These are his words:\n\n       . . . reiterate how critically important it is that \n     Congress authorize another round of base closures and \n     realignments.\n\n  We previously put in the Record a letter from the Secretary of \nDefense, Donald Rumsfeld, strongly supporting one additional round of \nbase-closing authority to begin in the year 2003 and giving the reasons \nfor that need.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter I \nreceived this morning from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. \nShelton.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                   Chairman of the\n\n\n                                        Joint Chiefs of Staff,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 25, 2001.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Senate Armed Services Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As the full Senate deliberates the FY \n     2002 Defense Authorization Bill I would like to reiterate how \n     critically important it is that Congress authorize another \n     round of base closures and realignments.\n       Last Thursday the President outlined a sustained campaign \n     to combat international terrorism. The efficient and \n     effective use of the resources devoted to this effort will be \n     the responsibility of the Services and the Combatant \n     Commanders.

As I mentioned before, there is an estimated 23 \n     percent under-utilization of our facilities. We cannot afford \n     the cost associated with carrying this excess infrastructure. \n     The Department of Defense must have the ability to \n     restructure its installations to meet our current national \n     security needs.\n       I know you share my concerns that additional base closures \n     are necessary.

The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to read two paragraphs of \nthis letter from the Chairman.\n\n       Last Thursday the President outlined a sustained campaign \n     to combat international terrorism. The efficient and \n     effective use of the resources devoted to this effort will be \n     the responsibility of the Services and the Combatant \n     Commanders. The authority to eliminate excess infrastructure \n     will be an important tool our forces will need to become more \n     efficient and serve as better custodians of the taxpayers \n     money. As I mentioned before, there is an estimated 23 \n     percent under-utilization of our facilities. We cannot afford \n     the cost associated with carrying this excess infrastructure. \n     The Department of Defense must have the ability to \n     restructure its installations to meet our current national \n     security needs.\n       I know you share my concerns that additional base closures \n     are necessary. The Department is committed to accomplishing \n     the required reshaping and restructuring in a single round of \n     base closures and realignments. I hope the Congress will \n     support this effort.\n\n  Mr. President, both the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs are acting in accordance with the Commander in Chief, the \nPresident of the United States. This BRAC issue is clearly one that our \nPresident needs at this time given the extenuating circumstances facing \nthe United States of America.\n  I yield sufficient time as he may need to our colleague from Arizona, \nSenator McCain.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining and how is it \ndivided?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There are 5 minutes remaining to \nthe opponents and 7\\1/2\\ minutes remaining to the other side.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the opponents \nof the Bunning amendment be given an extra 2 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want to make sure Senator McCain has \nadequate time. How much time would he like?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like to request that Senator Levin have 2 \nadditional minutes at the expiration of the 5 minutes I have. I ask \nunanimous consent for 2 additional minutes for Senator Levin and 2 \nadditional minutes for the Senator from Kentucky, if he wishes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, Senator Dorgan will be the first speaker.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BUNNING. I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I do not doubt that when there is excess \ncapacity with respect to military installations we ought to take action \nto deal with them. But I think it ought to be action that is targeted, \nthoughtful, and timely. In my judgment, there are two reasons why we \nought to strike the language from this bill at this point: One is \nmilitary and the other is economic.\n  First, we do not know what the force structure is going to be. We are \nundergoing a quadrennial review at this point and yet, before we talk \nabout force structure, we already presumably know what the base \nstructure should be.\n  With the issue of homeland security and all the other changes that \nwill occur as a result of this country's determination to protect \nitself, we ought to, at this point, reserve the question of what should \nbe our base structure. And for that reason, I do not think this is the \ntime to do this.\n  Second, on the economic circumstances, the potential of having a \nbase-closing commission that says to every military installation in the \ncountry, by the way, we are going to look at you for potential closure, \nis, in my judgment, an opportunity to stunt the economic growth of \nvirtually every community in every region in the country that has a \nmilitary installation.\n  At a time when we have an extraordinarily soft economy, and one that \nis in significant trouble, can you imagine anyone making a decision to \ninvest in any military installation community in this country if they \nknow the prospect might exist that installation will be closed? The \nanswer is, they will not make that investment. They will decide they \ncannot in good conscience do it.\n  We have been through this before. If we just say that every base is \nat risk with respect to a commission, it stunts the economic growth of \nevery community in which a base exists.\n  I say to the Pentagon, I think it would make much more sense to \nnarrow the focus of where they have excess capacity. When that is \nnarrowed, then let's have a commission that evaluates that excess \ncapacity and how to deal with it. But I really believe that both for \nmilitary and economic purposes this amendment ought to be agreed to and \nthis provision ought to be stricken.\n  I disagree with my friend from Arizona. I think he is an American \nhero. I have the greatest respect for him--and he is a good friend of \nmine--but we disagree. I believe we ought to take a chunk out of this \nexcess capacity at some point but not now, given the question of \nhomeland security. I certainly do not believe now is the time, given \nwhat it will do to the economy, the economy of communities, regions, \nand our country, if we say every military installation is at risk of \nclosure. That clearly will dry up investment that we need in this \ncountry to try to uplift the American economy.\n  For that reason, I intend to support the motion to strike.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I would like to very briefly address some of the \narguments that have been made. One is that the economy is too soft \nright now to consider further base closings and couldn't absorb the \nloss of jobs. The fact is that the provision gives the President the \nauthority to consider a base closure in 2003, not 2001. If our economy \nis still bad in the year 2003, we will have other problems besides a \nbase-closing commission.\n  Taxpayers for Common Sense and the Center for Defense Information \nprepared an independent report that they released in September 2001. \nSome of this data may surprise some of my colleagues who are citing \neconomic concerns as to why they oppose further base-closing rounds.\n\n[[Page S9765]]\n\n  This objective study studied 97 bases closed in four base-closing \nrounds. Eighty-eight percent of the bases closed experienced per capita \npersonal income growth, as high as 36 percent, and averaging nearly 10 \npercent. Seventy-five percent of the bases closed experienced gains in \naverage earnings per job. Eighty-seven percent of the bases closed had \npositive employment rates. Sixty-eight percent beat the national \naverage. The average job replacement rate of all these bases closed--\nall bases is 102 percent.\n  By the beginning of 2001, only 3 of the 97 counties had higher \nunemployment rates than the BRAC announcement year; and 53 percent had \nunemployment rates lower than the national average.\n  I will be glad to share this information with my colleagues.\n  Everything has changed with regard to BRAC. The argument is, and as \nmy friend from North Dakota has said, everything is changed now as of \nSeptember 11. That may be the view of some, but it is not the view of \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of Defense. \nIn fact, in their view, the opposite is the case--the opposite--that we \nneed now to provide the Secretary of Defense with more flexibility \nbecause we may be called upon to do things very differently.\n  The argument is made that we do not know what the force structure \nwill be absent the QDR--the Quadrennial Defense Review--so how can we \nvote on further base closure rounds? Maybe we ought to remember that \nthis issue has been around since 1970.\n  In 1983, the Grace Commission made recommendations for base closures. \nIn 1997, the QDR recommended that after four closure rounds we must \nshed excess infrastructure. The 1997 Defense Reform Initiative and \nNational Defense Panel strongly urged Congress and the Department of \nDefense to move quickly the base realignment, and BRAC has been \nrecommended--basic realignment--by Presidents Reagan, Bush I, Clinton, \nand now President George W. Bush.\n  Finally, Mr. President--and I think this is important--this is a time \nwe should place trust in the judgment of the Commander in Chief and the \nSecretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. If \nwe adopt the Bunning amendment, we will be acting in direct \ncontradiction to their views. I think it is important that there is not \na single military expert in this country of any credibility who doesn't \nbelieve that we need a base-closing round.\n  I ask my colleagues to consult anyone--Gen. Schwarzkopf--retired or \nactive. Who does not believe we need another base closing round? I hope \nwe will vote down the Bunning amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BUNNING. I yield Senator Ted Stevens 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I support the Bunning amendment to strike \nthe base realignment and closure language from this year's Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  It is my view that this is the wrong time for our country and our \nmilitary to move forward with BRAC legislation.\n  There are serious questions about the adequacy of the costs and \nsavings estimates upon which the Department bases its claims for \nsavings in the near term.\n  My concern has been that over the past 12 years, we have spent over \n$22 billion to close and realign bases throughout the United States. \nThese costs are substantial and must be figured into DOD's future \nbudgets. There is still considerable work to be done to clean up \npreviously closed bases.\n  However, the Department of Defense has not put aside funds in the \nfuture year Defense plan to pay for BRAC. They have not budgeted for \nthe up-front costs. A reasonable estimate that an additional BRAC round \nwould cost $3 to $4 billion a year--starting as early as 2004.\n  In recent General Accounting Office reports, they state that ``net \nsavings from BRAC were not generated as quickly as initially estimated \nbecause the costs of closing bases and environmental cleanup were high \nand offset the savings.''\n  The up-front money must be found and it will most likely come from \nthe Department's investment accounts. The diversion of billions of \ndollars to support an additional BRAC round could have a serious impact \non the transformation of the services for the 21st century.\n  There has been a lot of discussion about savings. We found that in \nthe past, most of the savings came from the elimination of civilian and \nmilitary positions. This was consistent with the downsizing of our \nArmed Forces through the 1990s--not necessarily related to closing \nbases. Many of the military personnel were simply realigned to other \nbases.\n  Further, I know of no comprehensive assessment of the mission impact \nof the totality of the closure and realignment decisions made to date.\n  Particularly with the considerable uncertainty about the future size \nof the force and its requirements, it would seem the more prudent \napproach would delay this legislation until we have a better picture of \nour future requirements.\n  I urge you to vote to support the Bunning amendment to strike the \nBRAC language.\n  Mr. President, there will be a lot of discussion about the \nelimination of these bases and the impact on the economy. This is not \nthe time to do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \nproposed by my good friends and colleagues, Senators Bunning and Lott, \nconcerning eliminating the authorization for another Base Realignment \nand Closure review in 2003.\n  In February of 2001, the Business Executives for National Security, a \nnon-profit organization focused on improving the Nation's defense \nbusiness policies reported that nearly 70 percent of the defense budget \nis spent on support functions including bases and infrastructure.\n  In the 1997 Department of Defense Report on Base Realignment and \nClosure, Secretary Cohen noted that our force structure has been \nbrought down significantly, 33 percent, but our domestic infrastructure \nhas decreased only 21 percent.\n  In June of this year, Secretary Rumsfeld stated that he needed \n``greater freedom to manage,'' and he pointed out that a ``reduction in \nexcess military bases and facilities could generate savings of several \nbillion dollars annually.''\n  This year, the Joint Chiefs testified before the Armed Services \nCommittee, and each one--General Ryan, Admiral Clark, General Jones, \nGeneral Shinseki--agreed to a need for an additional round of base \nclosures or realignments. In their comments they pointed out that \nsavings from excess capacity are real and that the excess \ninfrastructure burdens their ability to efficiently execute their \nnational strategy.\n  On September 3, 2001, Admiral David Jeremiah, former Vice Chairman of \nthe JCS, and General Richard Hearney, former Assistant Commandant of \nthe USMC wrote in commentary that ``Every billion not spent on unneeded \nbases is a billion that can be re-directed toward building an even \nstronger military.''\n  To those of my friends and colleagues who say that we are in a \ndifferent time than in 1997, or in February 2001 or even August, and \nthat we must support our military at this time, I say I agree with you. \nWe must support our soldiers, sailors, airmen and women and Marines. We \nmust give them the financial tools and operational and administrative \nflexibility to effectively carry out their mission, especially at this \ntime.\n  I draw my colleagues' attention to September 21, 2001, as it is after \nthe horrific events of September 11. On that date Secretary Rumsfeld \ncommunicated to the Congress, once again, his strong support for \nconverting ``excess capacity into warfighting ability.'' My colleagues, \na stronger more applicable comment could not have come at a more \ncritical time.\n  To my colleagues who may point out that in that letter Secretary \nRumsfeld noted that ``our future needs as to base\n\n[[Page S9766]]\n\nstructure are uncertain . . .'' I point out that he goes on to \nemphasize that the DoD, ``simply must have the freedom to maximize the \nefficient use of our resources.'' By authorizing another round of \nrealignments and closures we let our war fighters mold their \ninfrastructure to fit their requirements. Let us not burden them for \npolitical reasons with infrastructure that should have been retired \nwith the P-51, the Enfield rifle and the Sherman tank.\n  I stand with the Secretary, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Senate \nArmed Services Committee in opposition to this amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I support the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Kentucky to strike language from the fiscal year 2002 Defense \nauthorization bill that would authorize a new base closure and \nrealignment round in 2003.\n  I feel very strongly that the time is not right for another painful \nround of military base closures, and my opposition is only strengthened \nin the aftermath of the tragedy that occurred on September 11. As a \nresult of the terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center and at the \nPentagon, I believe we must reevaluate our military force structure \nneeds--both at home and abroad--in a new and very different light.\n  In fact, I was extremely skeptical about the need for additional base \nclosures even before the terrorist attacks. On August 14, Congressman \nGeorge Miller and I sent letters to the chairmen and ranking members of \nthe House and Senate Armed Services Committees outlining our reasons \nfor opposing a new base closure round. I ask unanimous consent that \nthose letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 14, 2001.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Chairman Levin and Senator Warner: We write to express \n     our deep concern about the round of military base closures \n     proposed by the Pentagon for 2003, and the enabling \n     legislation that the Armed Services Committee will be \n     considering. Since the late 1980s, in a series of \n     Congressionally mandated base closures, 97 major military \n     facilities have been closed or ``realigned''--29 of them in \n     California.\n       These closures have been extremely painful for the \n     communities involved, and it has proven extremely difficult \n     to convert these bases to other, economically viable uses. As \n     you know, the primary obstacles to converting closed bases \n     are the enormous costs and huge technical challenges \n     associated with cleaning them up. In our state of California, \n     while some sites have made great progress, none of the 29 \n     bases closed since 1988 have been fully cleaned up or \n     converted to non-military uses. And until a base is cleaned \n     up (or at least a fully funded clean up plan is in place), it \n     is virtually impossible for a community to attract the \n     vendors, developers and others who can help make a base's \n     conversion an economic and social success.\n       We believe it would be unfair and inefficient to close even \n     one more base while the Pentagon continues to raise financial \n     and bureaucratic hurdles to communities that are doing \n     everything in their power to adjust to new civilian economic \n     realities. The Pentagon must work in good faith with \n     communities in California and across the country to expedite \n     and complete the clean up and conversion efforts now \n     underway.\n       Instead of devoting time, money and energy to developing a \n     new base closure round, we ask that you work with us and our \n     communities to finish the job we started so long ago.\n           Sincerely,\n     Barbara Boxer,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n     George Miller,\n     Member of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 14, 2001.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, we have heard basically three arguments. \nOne is that this is the wrong time to do this, following the events of \nSeptember 11. It seems to me, the compelling answers are set forth in \nthe letters from Secretary Rumsfeld and GEN Shelton on that issue.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld: ``the imperative to convert excess capacity into \nwar-fighting ability is enhanced, not diminished,'' because of those \nevents because we need to maximize our resources--in his words--``the \nfinite use of resources.'' And the authority to realign and close bases \nand facilities will be a critical element to ensure the right mix of \nbases and forces within our warfighting strategy.\n  We are asking our troops to take risks. It seems to me, at a minimum, \nwe ought to be willing now to set aside our own back-home concerns and \ndo what is essential in order to have the efficient use of resources. \nWe cannot afford infrastructure which is excess at any time but surely \nwhen we are asking our troops to go into combat. There is no \njustification for us to continue to say we are going to preserve excess \ninfrastructure. This begins in 2003. I emphasize this because some or \nour colleagues have said, if you don't know the force structure, how \ncan you know the base structure? We don't know what our force structure \nis going to be. That is why in the bill itself we require that before \n2003, before this base structure plan is put into place--and here the \nwords of the bill are being quoted:\n\n       The Secretary shall carry out a comprehensive review of the \n     military installations of the Department of Defense . . . \n     based on the force-structure plan submitted under subsection \n     (a)2. . . .\n\n  There must be a force structure plan submitted under this law prior \nto the base restructuring proposal.\n  Finally, in terms of savings, we heard that at times you cannot prove \nthe savings. We have shown, it seems to me, through GAO report after \nGAO report, that--and now I am going to quote from one of the more \nrecent ones:\n\n       Our work has consistently affirmed that the net savings for \n     four rounds of base closure and realignment are substantial.\n\n  That is the GAO talking. And we have had a report from the Department \nof Defense, a very specific report, showing the savings in a chart \nwhich lays them out line by line. I ask unanimous consent that the \nDepartment of Defense chart showing specifically where the $6 billion \nannual recurring savings comes from be printed in the Record.\n  That is a significant amount of money. We cannot afford to waste this \nmoney. We cannot afford to ask our forces to go into combat if we \nourselves will not do what is necessary to give them the resources.\n  This is excess baggage.

Mr. President, I know we are about to vote. I yield myself \nsome leader time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is no secret that I have always opposed \nthe BRAC process. I think it is an abdication of the responsibility of \nthe Congress. For years and years, the Pentagon made recommendations \nfor Congress, and Congress considered them, acted on many of them, and \nbases were closed.\n  Second, we know for certain that the BRAC process severely disrupts \nthe local economies of communities in States across the Nation. We also \nknow there is still a question about the BRAC savings from the past \nbase closures. For instance, I know that in the military construction \nappropriations bill that will be coming up, perhaps later today or \ntomorrow, there is $150 million for cleanup as a result of previous \nbase closures, most of it going, I guess, to California, some to Texas, \nand some I think maybe to New York. We are still in the process of \ntrying to expend money so that the process can be completed.\n  Also, I think the timing is bad. We are arguing about exactly what we \nshould do now, but I saw an Air Force general talking the other day \nabout how our fighters had been looking outward up until 2 weeks ago; \nnow they have to look inward. The world did change. I think that at a \ntime of our Reserves being called up, the National Guard being called \nup, communities being told to support the military, we are going to be \ntogether, we have been attacked, and we are going to respond \nappropriately, but we are going to say: By the way, we are going to \nlook at closing your base.\n  I don't think the timing is good. While I have never supported BRAC, \nit is not to say I won't someday. I realize we have excess capacity and \nduplication. I think we could do this. Maybe we could even look at it \nin a few weeks or months when we see exactly what the force structure \nis going to be, what this conflict is going to look like. After more \nconsultation, in my opinion, we will know about how this would look.\n  I was interested and appreciative of the language Senator Levin \npointed out about the force structure. Obviously, before we go forward \non this, we should match base infrastructure with force structure. We \nstill have a lot of questions out there about this homeland defense. \nAnd Secretary Rumsfeld is still working on his strategic review and is \ncurrently executing the congressionally mandated quadrennial defense \nreview. It is underway, but it is not completed.\n  Also, my concern is that every base, every community, every State is \ngoing to be affected by this. They are going to be alarmed by this. \nThey are going to hire consultants and all kinds of people to make sure \ntheir case is made appropriately. I think that is the wrong way to go. \nWhere we have excess capacity, identify it and say we are going to look \nhere. Where we know we may not have sufficient capacity now, why have a \nquestion about that particular base?\n  I continue to wonder why we have not done more about overseas bases. \nWe gave the Pentagon authority a few years ago to move in that area. \nHave they done it? No. Have they consolidated missions and looked at \nclosing bases? No. Do we need bases in Europe? Yes. We need to have air \nand naval bases where we can project power from Europe. We have 523 \nactivities in Europe, 116,000 troops. We have spent well over a half-\nbillion dollars since 1997 on MILCON in Europe. So should we not take a \nlook at that before, or at least at the same time we are looking at \nbases in our own country?\n\n  Mr. President, I support the Bunning amendment. I think this is a \nclassic case of getting the cart in front of the horse. I am committed \nand prepared to work with Senator Warner and Senator Levin and the \nDefense Department to see if there can be a way to do this. I don't \nthink the way this is set up in the bill is appropriate. I think the \ntiming could not be any worse.\n  I urge a vote for the Bunning amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky controls \njust under 6 minutes.\n\n[[Page S9768]]\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I want to make sure I get to close. Do we \nhave any other speakers?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the opponents has \nexpired. The Senator would have the last word.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I hope the Chair will recognize me for the \npurpose of a tabling motion at the conclusion of my colleagues' \npresentation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, we are embarking on a new war like nobody \nhas ever seen before. We are not experts in knowing what the landscape \nof the 21st century warfare will look like. None of us knows for \ncertain that we need to downsize our military infrastructure under \nthese extraordinary circumstances.\n  I have heard it said here today, and before, that DOD has a certain \namount of savings. I show you two reports. One is from the GAO on \nmilitary base closings. In the report, it says: The estimates are \nimprecise and should be reviewed as rough approximations and not likely \nsavings. These prospects apply as well to the Department's updated net \nsavings estimates.\n  So even the GAO and the CBO say the savings are not really savings \nbecause they didn't consider everything. They can't even back up their \nown numbers. If you agree with DOD on savings--and they also say the \ncost upfront actually is more, which was brought out by Senator \nStevens. BRAC has been a political football. Anybody who has been \ninvolved in it knows it has been a political football. First it was the \ncommission; then it was the administration. So it cannot be done \nobjectively.\n\n  I know our good chairman and the ranking member have tried to do that \nin this BRAC round. But I am not sure it won't become a political \nfootball again. So that is BRAC as usual, and I am not for BRAC as \nusual.\n  The new home security cabinet, as Senator Lott has said, may decide \nthey need these bases to make our homeland secure. I think it is very \ngood that we keep in mind that when Governor Ridge is confirmed, he may \ndecide how important certain bases are. Our economy and BRAC don't go \nhand in hand. If we slow it down, it may fall off the edge. I know that \nis not as necessary a reason, but it is a reason for not doing BRAC at \nthis time.\n  The DOD's Quadrennial Defense Review is not even completed. It is \npremature to act on BRAC when we don't even know what the quadrennial \nreport proposes regarding our infrastructure.\n  Please vote no on the tabling motion that is coming.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator from Kentucky \nyield back his remaining time?\n  Mr. BUNNING. Yes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my vote on \nthe last amendment be changed. I erroneously voted aye becasue I \nthought I was voting for the amendment. That was a tabling motion. I \nnow ask unanimous consent to change my vote, and it will not in any way \nchange the outcome of the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I believe there is an order sequenced for \ntwo amendments. Am I correct?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1594\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards). The pending business is \namendment No. 1594 offered by Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1594, As Modified\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we have talked about the amendment that is \nunder consideration, No. 1594. We have agreed to change it. I send to \nthe desk the amendment, No. 1594, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1594), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 335. REVISION OF AUTHORITY TO WAIVE LIMITATION ON \n                   PERFORMANCE OF DEPOT-LEVEL MAINTENANCE.\n\n       (a) Section 2466(c) of title 10, United States Code, is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(c) Waiver of Limitation.--(1) The Secretary of Defense \n     may waive the limitation in subsection (a) for a fiscal year \n     if--\n       ``(A) the Secretary of Defense determines that--\n       ``(i) the waiver is necessary for reasons of national \n     security; and\n       ``(B) the Secretary of Defense submits to Congress a \n     notification of the waiver together with--\n       ``(i) the reasons for the waiver; and\n       ``(2) The Secretary of Defense may not delegate the \n     authority to exercise the waiver authority under paragraph \n     (1).''.\n       (b) The Secretary of Defense shall provide a report to \n     Congress not later than January 31, 2002 that outlines the \n     Secretary's strategy regarding the operations of the public \n     depots.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may we have a minute?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the chairman has advised me that the \nInhofe amendment is acceptable to the other side.\n  Would you restate the number of that?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent to vitiate the yeas and nays on \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Amendment No. 1594.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the yeas and nays are \nvitiated.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, can we adopt the Inhofe amendment?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we have reached agreement on the amendment \nhaving to do with depot maintenance. We have made two modest changes \nfrom that which was introduced. One is, instead of sending it to the \nPresident in lieu of the service chiefs, it now\n\n[[Page S9769]]\n\ngoes to the Secretary of Defense. No. 2, it says we need to have the \nreport from the Secretary of Defense as to the future use of depots. \nThat is essentially it. It is agreed to, and I ask it be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to modify the \namendment.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment, as modified.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I understand there is no objection to the amendment, as \nmodified, on our side.\n  Mr. WARNER. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment, as modified, \nis agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1594), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1674\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1674.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 821 of the bill.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this is an unusual step, but as a manager \nof the bill I have the responsibility to keep this bill moving. We have \nexercised good-faith efforts on both sides to reconcile an issue which \nis deserving of the attention of the Senate. The amendment of the \nSenator from Virginia would strike from the bill that language referred \nto generically as the prison issue of materials made by prisoners and \nsold to the Department of Defense.\n  I support the bill, and I am going to vote against my own amendment, \nbut in order for the Senate to move expeditiously, to continue to have \nthis bill go forward, because at the moment we cannot hope to achieve \nfinalization of this bill--the desire of both the majority leader and \nthe Republican leader--by tomorrow unless we get finalization on the \nlist of amendments.\n  I do not, in any way, disparage my distinguished colleague who is \nexercising, perfectly within his rights, certain procedures. But I \nthink this will enable the Senate to address this issue now and to come \nto some resolution on it so that we can move on with this bill.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I move to table the amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we need to have some debate, I think.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to have some debate, so I \nwill, at the appropriate time, move to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is withdrawn.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague. I think it is important that debate \ntake place on this amendment, and at the appropriate time the Senator \nmay seek recognition for that purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me first say I want to make it clear \nthat--reserving all of my rights under the rules of the Senate to offer \nsubstitutes or amendments--I am hopeful that in the midst of a national \ncrisis we can find a way to gather new information and commit to make a \ndecision on this divisive issue next year.\n  We have voted on this issue probably four or five times in the last \ndecade. To this point, in each and every case we have preserved prison \nlabor in America. Our new chairman of the Armed Services Committee, who \nhas consistently sought provisions in the bill that would effectively \nend the current program, is now chairman of the committee and has the \nprovision eliminating the program for all practical purposes--I will \nexplain that--has put that in the bill itself which has produced the \nsituation in which we find ourselves.\n  Now let me try to talk about this problem. I want to begin by talking \nabout the history of prison labor in America. I want then to talk about \nthe point at which we came to a fork in the road, and took the wrong \nfork, in my opinion. And that occurred during the Great Depression.\n  I want to talk about the Levin amendment, as to why it violates every \nprinciple in the bill. Then I want to outline the prison labor system \nand why it is so critically important to our system of criminal \njustice, and why the program, at least in our last study, which was in \n1998, was given very high marks. At that point, I will have made this \ncase, I hope.\n  We do have some Members of the Senate who are voting on this issue \nfor the first time, and I believe it is important that a full \npresentation be made.\n  Let me begin with de Tocqueville. We all remember that de Tocqueville \ncame to America and wrote the greatest critique ever on democracy in \nAmerica, the great classic which people read even today to understand \nthe special nature of America and to understand the genius of our \neconomic and political system.\n  Many of us forget that de Tocqueville came to America not to study \ndemocracy but he came to America to study our prison system. In fact, \nhis first book was about the American prison system. He basically \nconcluded that we had the finest prison system in the world, and the \nfoundation of the excellence of the American penal system, as de \nTocqueville found in the 1830s, was a comprehensive program where, for \nall practical purposes, every prisoner in America worked.\n  We had a system where prisoners engaged in manufacturing, prisoners \nengaged in agriculture, and substantial amounts of the cost of \nincarceration were paid for by prison labor, lifting the burden on the \ntaxpayers of the 1830s in America to fund our prison system; but most \nimportant, in de Tocqueville's opinion, was the humaneness of labor in \nprisons. In fact, de Tocqueville went to great lengths to talk about \nthe prison system and to talk about how humane it was that people in \nprison in America, unlike Europe, worked.\n  Let me read you a quote from de Tocqueville:\n\n       It would be inaccurate to say that in the Philadelphia \n     Penitentiary labor is imposed. We may say, with more justice, \n     that the favor of labor is granted. When we visited this \n     penitentiary, we successively conversed with all its inmates. \n     There was not one single one among them who did not speak of \n     labor with a kind of gratitude and who did not express the \n     idea that without the relief of constant occupation, life \n     would be insufferable.\n\n  In 19th century America when someone went to prison, they went to \nwork, and they worked 12, 14 hours a day, 6 days a week, and in working \nseveral good things happened. One, they weren't idle. And as we all \nknow from Poor Richard's Almanac, ``idle hands are the devil's \nworkshop.''\n  Secondly, they produced food, they produced products that could be \nsold, and they dramatically reduced the cost of incarceration in 19th \ncentury America. From 1900, where virtually every prisoner in America \nworked--and I would have to say there is some justice to requiring \npeople in prison to work and to share the burden of their incarceration \nwith working people who today pay $30,000 per Federal inmate to put \npeople in prison and keep them there. It is cheaper to send somebody to \nHarvard University than it is to send somebody to the Federal \npenitentiary.\n  Now, by the turn of the century, we had an effective prison system \nall over America. In Texas, I am proud to say, we had a model program \nwhere every prisoner worked, and they worked hard. They grew their own \nfood, they made their own clothes, and they produced products that were \nsold in the economy. Attention was given not to glut local markets, so \ngenerally products were not sold in areas where prisons were located. \nAnd by all accounts, beginning with de Tocqueville and ending with \nanybody who studied the penal systems of the world, at the turn of the \ncentury, in 1900, we had far and away the finest prison system in the \nworld. And the recidivism rate relative\n\n[[Page S9770]]\n\nto the current day was low because prison was not an experience that \npeople wanted to repeat. They had generally accumulated productive \nskills in prison by working, and they were blessed that when they left \nprison, they knew how to do something and it gave them a chance to go \nback to society and to try to do it--and do it for pay.\n  This system took a dramatic turn in the 1930s. In the 1930s, we \npassed three laws: Hawes-Cooper in 1929, Summers-Ashurst in 1935, and \nWalsh-Healy in 1936. The Hawes-Cooper Act made it illegal to sell \nprison-produced goods in America across State lines. The Summers-\nAshurst Act made it illegal to transport prison goods in interstate \ncommerce. The Walsh-Healy Act, in essence, said, if you produce things \nin prison, you have to pay prisoners union scale.\n  The net result of these three laws was it killed the prison industry \nin America. So, today, we have 1.2 million people in prison. Almost all \nof them are young men in their peak years, in terms of ability to work. \nYet all over America, they are idle because of prohibitions against \nprison labor. So it is all right to let working people work, it is all \nright to tax people at confiscatory rates to pay $30,000 a year to have \npeople in the Federal penitentiary. But it is not all right to force \nthem to work and to have a process whereby there is productive work to \nbe done.\n  The only vehicle left--the only work that is currently done in \nAmerica by prisoners is work to produce items that are purchased by the \nGovernment. That is a pale comparison with the program that we had in \n1900. But it is all that is left today.\n\n  Now, the Levin amendment would effectively kill that program with \nregard to the Defense Department, which is the largest purchaser of \ngoods from our Federal prison industry. Senator Levin is going to say \nthat all we want is competition. But I am sorry that I have to say that \nnothing in this bill is aimed at competition except the prison labor \nstandard. This bill is full of provisions that ban competition, that \nforce the Defense Department to pay a higher price. Not one contractor \nin America can bid for a job with the Defense Department unless that \ncontractor pays union wages, unless that contractor pays the highest \nwage scale that anyone is paying in that labor market.\n  That is not competition. You are going to later hear Senator Levin \nsay: All we want is competition.\n  All his bill has is the absence of competition. The only place it \ncalls for ``competition'' is in the prison labor industry. This, in \nreality, is not a competition provision; this is a special interest \nprovision supported by organized labor and supported by private \nmanufacturers. Senator Levin and proponents of this provision will say: \nWhat could be wrong? Business and labor are together on this issue, and \nif the two great special interests of America are for it, surely it \nmust be America's interest.\n  I beg to disagree. The special interests of labor and business are \nnot in America's interest. And I remind my colleagues that by idling \nthese prisons who are beginning to pay victims restitution, who are \nbeginning to pay funds that displace taxpayers' money, what we are \ngoing to do is to impose a heavier and heavier burden on the American \ntaxpayer. We are going to destroy the only system we have that \neffectively trains prisoners so when they get out, they can go out and \nget a job and hope to hold a job--and America will be a loser.\n  Part of the problem here is that all the political interests are on \nthe side of the amendment that is now in this bill. I am proud to say \nthat in the last decade we have voted on this thing four or five times, \nand each time we have saved prison labor in America. I don't know where \nthe votes are here, and I would have to say that I am profoundly \ndisappointed that in a year where we are facing an imminent crisis, \nthat instead of focusing on defense, we have a special interest \nprovision in this bill that is aimed at killing prison labor.\n  I want my colleagues to know that I have proposed doing an \nindependent study through the General Accounting Office where the \nreport would be made in May and where we could have a comprehensive \ndebate and, hopefully, have a compromise that would allow us to solve \nthis problem once and for all. Senator Levin and I have fought over \nthis issue for a decade.\n\n  Let me go back and complete the story. Where we are is that we have a \nprovision in the bill that basically claims that the Defense Department \nis a loser from the prison labor system. I want my colleagues to \nunderstand the Defense Department did not ask for the Levin amendment. \nYou might ask: How come they didn't send a letter down here saying they \nopposed it? If you were the Secretary of Defense and the chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee in the Senate had a provision related to \nprison labor, would you write a letter saying you are against it? No, \nyou would not.\n  I want my colleagues to understand, the Secretary of Defense did not \nask for this provision, and the Attorney General and the Justice \nDepartment are adamantly opposed to the provision in Senator Levin's \namendment.\n  Senator Levin apparently is going to make the argument, which he has \nmade for the last decade, that the prison labor system is unfair to the \nDefense Department. I simply make two comments: One, how come every \nother noncompetitive purchasing provision in the pending bill is not \nunfair to the Defense Department? Why only prison labor? What is this \nabout?\n  I can tell you what it is about. It is about greedy special interest. \nThat is what it is about.\n  Let me tell you what the facts are, and they are old facts. One of \nthe reasons we ought to do a study is to update the facts so we know \nexactly what we are talking about. There was an audit report mandated \nby the Congress that was submitted to Congress on August 5, 1998, 3 \nyears ago. It was submitted by the Office of Inspector General of the \nDepartment of Defense. This is basically what it concluded. It was a \ncomprehensive study. I have the study here if anybody would like to \nlook at it.\n  Basically, what the study concluded was that when they looked at a \nrandom sampling of procurement by the Defense Department from the \nFederal Prison Industries Program, in 78 percent of the products they \nlooked at, the price the Defense Department got from the Federal Prison \nIndustries was lower than the competitive market price. In 20 percent \nof the cases, it was higher. In 2 percent of the cases, it was the \nsame.\n  Also, when they looked at waivers--that is where the Defense \nDepartment concluded that the property that was being procured was not \nbeing sold at a competitive price or at competitive quality or on a \ntimely basis--in over 80 percent of the cases where the Defense \nDepartment sought a waiver because they believed it was not a good \ndeal, that waiver was granted.\n  When you look at the overall aggregate situation that existed in 1998 \nwhen we last studied the Federal Prison Industries, in 78 percent of \nthe cases, the Prison Industries sold the product at less than the \ncompetitive price in the private sector; 20 percent of the time, it was \nmore; 2 percent of the time, for all practical purposes, it was the \nsame. The quality of the product was found to be excellent. There were \nproblems in terms of deliverability and, in fact, in 1998, a series of \nreforms were implemented to try to deal with the deliverability \nproblem.\n  Senator Levin will say that all his amendment does is require \ncompetition. My answer is, let's require competition in everything the \nDefense Department buys from anybody. If the Senator will change his \namendment to simply give the Secretary of Defense the ability to buy \ncompetitively so that the Secretary can have competitive bidding and \nbuy the highest quality product at the lowest price across the board, I \nwill support that amendment. But that is not going to happen because \nthis bill is not a competition bill. This bill is full of restrictions \non competition everywhere except prison labor.\n\n  Another provision I would support and would rejoice to the heavens \nabout would be to eliminate the Federal Prison Industries Program at \nthe Department of Defense and in the rest of the Government and let's \nallow the Federal Prison Industries to compete with anybody else in \nGovernment procurement with no special arrangement, but then, subject \nto simple restrictions, let's let them sell in the private sector.\n  What would those restrictions be? A, you cannot sell in the area \nwhere the\n\n[[Page S9771]]\n\nprison is located because you do not want to glut the market; B, you \ncannot sell products that are in excessive supply where the price is \nfalling precipitously; and C, let's focus production where prisoners \nare producing things we are importing--component parts, for example.\n  Unless I am sadly misinformed by the last 10 years of the debate, I \ndo not expect the proponents of the provision in the bill to say they \nwant competition. In fact, not only do they not want prisoners to work \nand produce things to sell in the private sector, they do not want \nprisoners to work to produce things in the public sector. That is our \ndilemma.\n  We have before us a provision in the bill which was not sought by the \nDefense Department, which is adamantly opposed by the Attorney General \nand the Department of Justice, a provision that the Federal Prison \nIndustries Program believes will be extraordinarily detrimental to \ntheir program. It is a provision which is now a part of the entire \nbill. If there were a provision in the bill that said the Secretary of \nDefense, in promoting the public interest, shall be driven by the same \nmotivation which motivates every consumer and every producer in \nAmerica, and that is to buy the best quality product at the lowest \npossible price and they shall be in no other way constrained, I would \nsupport that amendment, and I would think it was enlightened policy.\n  I want my colleagues to remember when they hear this impassioned \nargument about competition, there is no competition in this bill save \nfor prison industry. If the bill had a general competition provision, I \nwould be for it because the benefits to America of having competitive \nprocurement in defense would greatly outweigh the problems it would \nproduce in the American prison industries, but there is no competition \nin this bill, save an effort to kill the prison industries in America.\n  Part of our problem in this debate, and it has been one for the whole \ndecade--I do not know why it is that I always end up on these issues \nwhere there is no constituency--the taxpayers, by and large, hardly \nknow this issue is even being debated today. In fact, they would be \nstunned. If somebody turned on the television, they would say: What in \nthe world is that guy doing standing up talking about prison labor when \nthe Nation is hearing the drumbeat and the bugle to march off to war? I \nwonder why we are doing that, too. I did not bring this up.\n  The point is, the American public does not understand we have an \neffort underway to kill what is left of prison labor. So we have 1.2 \nmillion young men, at their peak productive period, who are rotting \naway in prison and not working. Why is this being killed? Because of \nthe power of special interests, the two biggest ones in America, labor \nand business.\n  If anybody cares, I want to make an additional argument, and that is \nabout recidivism. I am sorry I did not offer this amendment today. I \nwas getting ready to debate it when it was offered by the ranking \nmember of the committee, and so I have to thumb through my book to try \nto find it, but let me summarize it rather than reading the number. \nThose prisoners who work have a dramatic decline in the recidivism rate \nor, in English, if people work in prison, they are far less likely to \ncome back to prison when they leave. Why? For one thing, because they \naccumulate skills in prison.\n  What we really ought to be debating today and every day is turning \nour prisons into industrial parks. We ought to have American \nmanufacturers in joint ventures with our prison systems producing the \ncomponent parts in prison that we are buying from other parts of the \nworld. We ought to have every prisoner working 10, 12 hours a day, 6 \ndays a week, bringing down the cost of incarceration and building up \nthe skill level, and when they are not working, they ought to be going \nto school, building up the skill level, so when they get out of prison, \nthey know how to do something.\n  Amazingly--almost astounding to me--is not only are we not going in \nthat direction but we are trying to kill the last remaining vestige of \nprison labor.\n  I want to ask my colleagues, on the basis of a couple of things, to \nsupport the Warner amendment to strike this provision.\n  No. 1, I am willing to support a comprehensive study. We have not had \none since 1998. In all fairness, the study was done by the inspector \ngeneral of the Department of Defense, and that is part of the same \nexecutive branch that is for prison labor. So what I proposed, which \nhas not yet been accepted--I am hoping it will be--is we have the \nGeneral Accounting Office, which is part of the legislative branch of \nGovernment, do a comprehensive study of the prison labor system and \nprocurement by the Defense Department and report back to us by May, so \nwe have it for next year, how competitive is prison labor production? \nWhat is the quality like?\n  We know in 1998 that 78 percent of the time it was cheaper, 20 \npercent ofttimes more expensive, 2 percent ofttimes about the same.\n  We should have a report on quality. We know in 1998 quality was \nexcellent. And we should have a report on the problem that was \nuncovered in 1998, which was deliverability.\n  With that report, I then commit to seeking a compromise within our \nGovernment, or voting one way or the other on the program.\n  So I hope my colleagues will vote to strike this provision now, \nknowing we will have an opportunity next year, hopefully under very \ndifferent circumstances than today, to deal with this problem.\n  The second thing I ask people is to not kill the remaining vestige of \nprison labor in America. I know my colleagues are hearing from \nfurniture manufacturers, from some electronics manufacturers, saying: \nWe do not want to compete with prison labor. We want to force prison \nlabor into a--we want to eliminate the special status they have.\n  I say, and have said to manufacturers in my State: Look, if you will \nlet prison labor compete in selling in the private sector, in a no \nglutting of the market system, then I will support taking away their \nspecial relationship with government. I would support that. But they do \nnot want to do that. They do not want to compete with prison labor \nanywhere.\n  The problem is, if you do not let prisoners work, you have 1.2 \nmillion young men idle--idle hands are the devil's workshop--and you \neliminate the building programs of victims' restitution and self-\nfunding of prisons. In fact, since the 1930s we have largely destroyed \nthe greatest prison system in history by destroying prison labor.\n  Finally, let me ask my colleagues to look very closely at the \nrecidivism rates. Look at what is happening with people who are working \nin prison and what is happening when they leave prison versus people \nwho are not privileged to work in prison and their recidivism rate. \nWhat you are going to find is the probability of people coming back to \nprison when they are released falls dramatically if they have worked in \nprison; it goes up dramatically if they have not worked in prison.\n  So I understand we do not have any prisoner PACs. We do not have any \norganized lobby from people in prison.\n  I am not sympathetic to people in prison. I think they ought to have \nto work. I am sympathetic to working people who are going to have to \nwork harder to pay this $30,000 a year to keep people in prison because \nspecial interests want to kill off the prison labor system because some \ndesk that the Defense Department is buying or some component part of \nsome item the Defense Department is buying is being produced by prison \nlabor.\n  So remember, if the issue were, let us buy everything competitively \nin the Defense Department and have the Secretary constrained in no way, \nsave by the best product, the lowest price, put me down as a cosponsor, \nbut there is no such provision in this bill. In fact, there are pages \nin this bill that prohibit competition. If I am a paving contractor and \nthey are paving a road at the Pentagon or a parking lot at the \nPentagon, I cannot even bid on pouring of the concrete unless I pay the \nhighest wages in the region. What kind of competition is that?\n  So when you hear this chest thumping about all we want is \ncompetition--that is all they want--where is it? Where is it except for \nPrison Industries?\n  Secondly, if people think Prison Industries should not have a special \nagreement with the Government to buy products it produces, let Prison \nIndustries produce and sell in the private\n\n[[Page S9772]]\n\nsector and eliminate the special privilege. But there is no proposal \nfor competition. There is no proposal for allowing Prison Industries to \nsell in the private sector.\n  Cloaked in the righteousness of competition--and what special \ninterest in American history has ever cloaked itself in anything other \nthan the public interest?--cloaked in the public interest is this \ndemand by unions and by manufacturers to kill the prison labor system \nin America. Reform it, yes. Study it and find better ways of doing it, \nyes. Bring competition to defense procurement in general, yes. Let \nanybody bid on a prison contract based on pricing and quality, yes. But \nkill prison labor in America, no. That is what the issue is.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment and let us settle \nthis issue. But this issue will not be settled if this amendment is \nrejected because there are other amendments and other ways of doing \nthis, and I think it is very important. We are talking about the lives \nof real people. We are talking about the burden on taxpayers. They are \nnot represented. I assume no taxpayers know what is going on here. \nNobody has heard from one. I don't take calls from prisoners myself, so \nthey are not busy lobbying. But the AFL-CIO and furniture \nmanufacturers, in particular, are very active on this issue.\n\n  One will say: All they want is competition. What about competition in \nselling to the private sector? They do not want that. This is a special \ninterest provision aimed at killing or dramatically reducing the \nFederal Prison Industries. I think that is a mistake. It is wrong. I am \nopposed to it.\n  This is a debate that ought to be taking place, but on another day, \non another bill, not on our defense authorization bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I rise in support of tabling this amendment. I have \nlistened to my esteemed friend from Texas. I am not going back to \nPlato. I will start closer to the current situation. I am surprised, \nwhen we talk about giving the private sector an opportunity to compete \nfor contracts put out by the Defense Department, that that is special \ninterest. That is difficult for me to understand.\n  This is defense authorization. It is absolutely the appropriate place \nto talk about how we do that, how we pay for it, and who does the work. \nIt is also important we get moving with this program.\n  This is not an amendment that came in; this language is in the \ncommittee bill.\n  I have worked for several years, as many have, on a fair amendment \ndesigned to give the private sector an opportunity to bid on Government \nbusinesses. We have been successful. We have had many agencies look at \nwhat they are doing instead of doing it internally, instead of putting \nit out for contract. It seems reasonable. This is competition. The \nprisons will continue to have the opportunity to compete under a very \nunfair--for them, favorable--situation. They don't have to pay taxes; \nthey don't have to pay minimum wage; they don't have to do any of the \nthings they do in the private sector.\n  This has been in place since 1934. Talk about a study. The study was \nnot even made by the congressional group. The study did not come up \nwith the real facts. It is time to do something. It is time to deal \nwith this idea that the private sector ought to be able to participate, \nto compete. That is the bottom line.\n\n  As to the notion that this does away with Federal Industries, only 18 \npercent of the Federal prisoners are involved. The other 82 percent are \ndoing food service, plumbing, carpentry, other things. It is not a fact \nthat this does away with the industry. As a matter of fact, as a good \nexample, New Mexico, a State that had a mandatory source situation such \nas this, lifted it. The New Mexico Prison Industries operated under \nthat until the State legislature reformed it. They are very happy with \nthe result of that transformation which does, indeed, provide for \ncompetition, which is exactly what we want.\n  The Senator from Texas, a proponent of the private sector for the \nmost part, is calling the private sector private interest. That is \npeculiar. We have a Government monopoly and we are saying this is an \nopportunity for people to compete. This does not eliminate the prison \nproduction. It makes it competitive.\n  As I mentioned, there are a number of opportunities for them. The \ncompetitive advantages are retained: Inmate wages, from $.23 to $1.15, \ncompared to the private sector; factory space furnished by the host \nprison, with no cost to the actual production; equipment, utilities, \ntaxes, insurance, workplace benefits--none of those things offered. Yet \nthey will be able to compete. That is what it is, competition.\n  We have had meetings about the private sector and trying to \nstrengthen the economy. Yet we seem to be reluctant to allow the \nprivate sector to help the economy by moving into this area. It is very \ntimely and appropriate to do it on this bill. The idea of setting it \noff I don't think makes much sense.\n  There are many other products beyond defense, less vital to the time. \nWe have had, for 45 years, a policy in this Government that we ought to \ngo to the private sector to provide for governmental needs. That has \nbeen the policy. Yet we still have a monopoly to do it the other way. \nThere are plenty of jobs prisoners can do. I, too, support the idea \nthat there ought to be work for prisoners. But there are lots of jobs \nthat can be done in the prison realm that would be outside of this \ncompetitiveness as to who can do the supplies and the necessary \nequipment for the defense.\n  This idea is also supported as a special interest by the U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce, by the small business NFIB, by labor unions, which also \nfavor all these opportunities for the private sector to supply the \nneeds of Government. It is not a new idea. It makes sense to me.\n  Also, we will find it is difficult for the Defense Department to have \nvarious contracts. They are not the ones that supervise the contract. \nThey lose some control when it goes to this prison authority. It is \ndifficult when we have a mandatory source for the needs that are \nrequired in defense.\n  I don't know that we need to go into a great deal of detail. The \nfacts are that prison workers can still continue. Most support the idea \nthat we ought to have competition for these expenditures. Most support \nthe idea the private sector ought to have an opportunity to compete \nwith Government in any circumstance where the private sector can do \nthat. That is what strengthens it.\n  We are in a time that anything we can do to increase the activity of \nthe private sector is good for the economy. We are fighting on two \nfronts: terrorism on one side and strengthening the economy on the \nother. These are the things we need to do.\n  The policy for doing this is 46 years old. We have strengthened that \nin the last several years to get more emphasis on the idea that there \nneeds to be competition, there needs to be private sector involvement. \nIn my view, the more the private sector can do in terms of the \nGovernment realm, the better off we are. What the Government ought to \ndo is strengthen their ability to let contracts and review the \ncontracts and make sure it is done that way.\n  Prison Industries has been in place since 1934. I think it has not \nbeen improved. This is not going to change it. Only 18 percent are \ninvolved out of 22,000.\n\n  So we are going to find ourselves with an opportunity that they can \nfind ways to continue to do it. We will find a way to put the private \nsector in, have more efficiency, less cost, and if they cannot compete, \nthen the prisons will continue.\n  I am not going to take an awful lot of time. It seems to me the \nissues here are fairly basic. Let me just review them again. This was \nnot an amendment. This was part of the bill of the committee. This is a \ntime when we ought to be looking for more opportunities for the private \nsector. This is a time when we ought to have competition. I think we \nhave an opportunity to do that here and yet continue to have a program \nwhich works for the prisoners.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, if I may speak for a couple of brief \nmoments about the Gramm amendment?\n\n[[Page S9773]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator's remarks are welcome even \nthough they might be contrary to the views of the Senator from \nVirginia. But I arranged this debate. It is quite unusual to put on a \nfellow Senator's amendment, but it was necessary to keep this bill \nmoving. We welcome the debate. I shall be voting against it eventually. \nMy distinguished colleague from Wyoming will be seeking recognition for \npurposes of a tabling motion in due course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I will not keep the body long. I do \nrise in support of the amendment of Senator Gramm of Texas regarding \nPrison Industries. This has come after some considerable review, and \nvisiting the prison in Kansas at Leavenworth, the Federal Penitentiary \nof Leavenworth. I note: visiting, not occupying. This is a maximum \nsecurity facility. Men are in this facility for years, frequently for \nlife, and at these Prison Industries at this facility.\n  I visited with the warden about 2 months ago--a month and a half ago, \nactually--about this particular issue, and also with the head of \nCorrections for the Federal Government. Both insisted that if we do not \nallow Prison Industries to effectively be able to compete--there are \nquestions about that in the language, but if we don't allow Prison \nIndustries to effectively compete, they are going to have difficulty at \nthe penitentiary keeping these gentlemen occupied, working with them, \nand being able to effectively run that prison. Otherwise, these men are \ngoing to be sitting around, and idle hands present a great deal of \ndifficulty.\n  I have worked with the Senator from Wyoming on privatization efforts \nwithin the Federal Government. I think he is absolutely on the mark on \nthese issues. From a personal perspective and the perspective of \nKansas, having a penitentiary that has long-term inmates, people who \nare going to be incarcerated frequently for life, or at least 10 to 20 \nyears, prisoners need something that is going to keep them occupied and \nworking or else we are going to have a great deal of difficulty with \nthem.\n  Prison Authorities don't know what they are going to do with these \ninmates otherwise, and they pleaded with me, saying: Don't allow this \nto go forward. This is going to be very difficult for us in the system.\n  I bring that word to my colleagues from a State with a major Federal \npenitentiary facility housing long-term inmates. They don't know how \nthey are going to be able to handle it. Some say it will still allow \nthem to compete and do the work all right, but reading this, within the \nsystem, it will cut back their ability to effectively have jobs for \nthese inmates, and they need jobs for these inmates. It helps with \nrestitution pay, helps them build self-worth; more than anything, it \nhelps manage this population that is very violent, very difficult, and \nif you do not give them anything to do, the idle hands are the devil's \nplayground. This has a great deal of difficulty.\n  I appreciate my colleagues allowing me to put those sentences \nforward, and I will be supporting the Gramm amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment that strikes section \n821 of our bill. Section 821 is a good government provision. It simply \nsays the private sector should be allowed to compete when it comes to \nselling items to the Department of Defense and that Federal Prison \nIndustries should not establish a monopoly and say the Department must \nbuy an item made in the prison, even though the private sector might be \nable to make it more cheaply.\n  I think everybody wants prisoners to work. But I hope everyone also \nwants the private sector to be able to survive and compete and be able \nto offer products to its own Government. I think if anything would \nshock taxpayers, it would be that the private sector--private \nbusinesses, private industry--is precluded from bidding on items the \nDepartment of Defense wants to buy.\n  I think it also would come as a shock that the private sector can \nproduce something more cheaply than can a prison at times. The Senator \nfrom Texas said about 20 percent of the time the prices are lower in \nthe private sector, according to a study, than they are from a prison. \nThat is not bad savings--20 percent of the time.\n  Of course we want prisoners to work. The Senator from Kansas just \nsaid we should not stop the prisons from competing for purchases by the \nDepartment of Defense. We are not stopping the prisons from competing. \nWhat we are trying to do in this legislation is allow the private \nsector to compete, instead of saying Prison Industries can establish a \n``must buy from us'' policy.\n  The Senator from Texas also said this is the only provision in the \nbill which talks about competition. There are probably dozens of \nprovisions in this bill that promote competition explicitly. This is \nbut one of them. The Senator from Texas said: Why don't we, then, say \ncompetition will be everywhere; eliminate Davis-Bacon--which of course \nhe favors anyway. If he wants to offer an amendment to eliminate Davis-\nBacon, that is his right. But that is not in this bill. What is in this \nbill is the opportunity for private businesses to bid. If they are \nunderbid by prisons, that is the way it is.\n  Prisons have tremendous economic advantages when it comes to bidding. \nObviously, 25 cents or 50 cents or a dollar an hour is an incredible \nadvantage to prisons when it comes to bidding. But even with that \nadvantage, the private sector can produce things more cheaply and at \nbetter quality at times. At those times, how in Heaven's name can we \ntell a Government agency that they must buy from a prison if they can \nbuy more cheaply from the private sector? How in the name of Heaven can \nwe tell someone in a private business, or an employee in a private \nbusiness, that he cannot bid on something that his Government is \nbuying? That is all this language does. It doesn't end the Prison \nIndustries program, or come close.\n  There are all kinds of things prisoners can and should be doing, by \nthe way, including focusing on things the Government buys that it \ncurrently imports. There are all kinds of opportunities.\n  We talk to Federal Prison Industries about this year after year. They \nalways say they are going to do something about it, and they have not.\n  The Senator from Texas says let's do a study. We just had a study, in \n1999, April. This is what the joint study of the Department of Defense \nand the Federal Prison Industries did. This is the result of that \nstudy:\n  On price, 54 percent of Department of Defense electronics buyers, 70 \npercent of Department of Defense clothing and textile buyers, 46 \npercent of Department of Defense furniture buyers, 53 percent of \nDepartment of Defense office case goods buyers, and 57 percent of \nDepartment of Defense systems furniture buyers rated the Federal Prison \nIndustries prices as average, fair, or poor. There is a lot of room in \nthere to save money for the Department of Defense.\n  On delivery, the figures are approximately the same: Roughly 50, 60 \npercent say: average, fair, or poor. On quality, about 50 percent say \naverage, fair, or poor. Those are averages. These are buyers at the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  So we ought to be very clear what this provision does and does not \ndo. It allows, for the first time in a long time, a private person who \nis working hard on the outside of prison to make a product and be able \nto bid when his Government is buying that product and not be stopped \nfrom bidding by an establishment of a monopoly by Federal Prison \nIndustries.\n  There are letters which we received, to which I think my friend from \nVirginia will also refer. I will place one of the letters in the \nRecord. It comes from the AFL-CIO, urging us to oppose any effort to \nweaken or eliminate the Federal Prison Industries reforms contained in \nthe bill. It says at the end that the AFL-CIO supports prison work \nprograms and recognizes that they make prisons safer for correctional \nstaff. They say:\n\n       However, we do not believe that the Federal Prison \n     Industries should enjoy a monopoly that unilaterally deprives \n     other firms and workers of job opportunities. Section 821 \n     represents a more balanced policy and we urge you to support \n     it.\n\n  Finally, my friend from Texas talks about letting prisons sell in the \nprivate\n\n[[Page S9774]]\n\nsector. We have laws going back 50 years which say that they can't. The \nreason we say that is because it is obviously totally unfair to say \nthat 25 cents or 50 cents an hour should be able to compete \ncommercially against people who provide products when they are paying a \ndecent wage. We prohibit imports from China that are made with prison \nlabor. Yet the suggestion of the Senator from Texas is, hey, let's \njust, across the board, allow prisoners to make anything that goes into \nthe commercial world at the scale that they are paid.\n  In that case, he said he would favor the language and broaden it to \ninclude anything. He says that is real competition. That sure is. That \nis totally unfair competition.\n  You can't compete. If an employer pays a decent wage to somebody, you \ncan't possibly compete with somebody who is paying 25 cents or 50 cents \nan hour. Yet that is the approach which the Senator from Texas really \nfavors and says so openly on this floor.\n  That is not an approach which too many of us--I hope--would favor. I \nsurely don't favor that. To hold that up as being what is desirable, \nand short of that we should not allow a private business in this \ncountry to offer to supply its own Government a product because Federal \nPrison Industries has said you may not bid because we have a monopoly \non this item, it seems to me, is just highly wrong.\n  The language in the bill has been carefully constructed; it simply \nallows for competition. It doesn't say that Federal Prison Industries \ncan't compete at all, as the Senator from Kansas suggested. That is not \nwhat it says at all. It simply says, allow private businesses to \ncompete, as I think most Americans would think that the private sector \nsurely can now compete when it comes to providing the Department of \nDefense with products.\n  We received many letters from owners of businesses across this \ncountry. From an office supply company in Biloxi, MS:\n\n       I could go on and on about how we could have sold the \n     product much cheaper which would have saved taxpayers' money, \n     faster delivery, which would have increased productivity, \n     and, finally, better service. You get the picture.\n\n  From Tucson, AR:\n\n       The Prison Industries' representatives routinely refuse \n     waivers. The answer is the standard ``we have products which \n     will meet your needs.'' No explanation. They refuse to answer \n     waiver requests in a timely fashion. I had a $110,000 order \n     for the Arizona Air National Guard in Tucson literally taken \n     away by Prison Industries. The representative demanded the \n     designs--the company's--and said that Prison Industries would \n     fill the request. No waiver, no discussion.\n\n  Fairfax, VA:\n\n       You know, it is not just the impact that Federal Prison \n     Industries has had on our businesses. It is the waste of \n     everybody's tax dollars when furniture costs more and doesn't \n     even do the job.\n\n  According to Economy Office Products of Fairfax, VA:\n\n       Federal Prison Industries tells their customers what the \n     customer can have rather than the needs of the customer.\n\n  I hope this language will remain in the bill and that the effort to \ntable it on the part of Senator Gramm will fail. When the time comes \nfor a tabling motion, I hope that tabling motion is agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thoroughly support what my distinguished \nchairman has said, and indeed the Senator from Wyoming.\n  For purposes of clarity, I submitted the amendment to keep the bill \nmoving and to frame the issue so it could be debated. We have now had a \nvery good debate on this subject.\n  Just for clarity, I will be voting against my own amendment, which I \nsaid at the time I introduced it. There will be a motion to table, and \ntherefore Senators who desire to have the bill remain intact would then \nsupport the motion to table.\n  The distinguished chairman alluded to certain letters. I think it is \nimportant that colleagues understand that while the labor unions, which \nSenator Levin addressed, are strongly in favor of keeping the bill \nintact, there is an equal strength among the private sector \norganizations.\n  The National Federation of Independent Business, the voice of small \nbusiness, addressed a letter to the Senate signed by the senior vice \npresident.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire letter be \nprinted in the Record, together with a letter from the Chamber of \nCommerce, which I will shortly address.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            National Federation of\n\n\n                                         Independent Business,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 20, 2001.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the 600,000 members of the \n     National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), I want to \n     express our support for your language in the FY 2002 National \n     Defense Authorization Act that would allow the Department of \n     Defense to purchase products from the private sector rather \n     than from Federal Prison industries if it would benefit the \n     taxpayer and the DOD. We will oppose any effort to strike \n     this language from the defense authorization bill.\n       Eighty-nine percent of NFIB members do not believe that \n     prisons should receive preference over small businesses for \n     federal contracts. NFIB's members have long fought against \n     unfair government competition with the private sector. \n     Federal Prison Industries (FPI) has become one of the most \n     egregious examples of unfair government competition. FPI, \n     also known by its trade name UNICOR, is a government-owned \n     corporation operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons. From a \n     small program when it was established in 1935, FPI has grown \n     to be a large enterprise. According to its most recent annual \n     report, FPI operates a centrally managed chain of over 100 \n     prison factories that employed 20,966 inmate workers in 1999. \n     With sales to the Federal Government of $566.2 million, FPI \n     would rank 36th among the top 100 contractors to the Federal \n     Government.\n       FPI would be a formidable competitor for even the most \n     accomplished small business experienced in the Federal \n     market, but FPI does not have to compete. FPI simply takes \n     its contracts from its captive Federal agency ``customers.'' \n     Under FPI's Depression-era statute, FPI is a mandatory source \n     for all Federal agencies, meaning that they are not required \n     to compete with private businesses for Federal contracts. A \n     Federal agency must actually obtain FPI's authorization, a \n     so-called ``waiver,'' before it can even solicit competitive \n     offers from the private sector. FPI, rather than the Federal \n     agency, determines whether FPI's product, delivery schedule, \n     and non-competitive price meet the agency's needs.\n       FPI's advantages don't stop there. FPI pays its workers at \n     hourly rates of $1.25 per hour or less, rather than market-\n     driven wages. FPI's facilities are built as part of a prison. \n     FPI has access to production equipment excess to other \n     Government agencies at no-cost. Congress even gave FPI direct \n     access to the Treasury with authority to borrow up to $20 \n     million, at rates far below what would be available to even \n     the largest commercial enterprise.\n       Your language provides for fundamental change, making FPI \n     less predatory to small business government contractors and a \n     more responsible supplier to Federal agencies and taxpayers. \n     it would require that FPI compete for its contracts with the \n     Federal government. small businesses do not want to prohibit \n     prison industries from entering the market, they just want a \n     fair and level playing field upon which to compete against \n     the FPI. Thank you for your support for small business and \n     fair competition.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Dan Danner,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n     Public Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 20, 2001.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: The United States Senate is expected to \n     very shortly consider A. 1416, the Fiscal 2002 National \n     Defense Authorization Act. Contained in that measure is a \n     provision (Section 821), based on legislation authored by \n     Senators Carl Levin and Craig Thomas, that would allow the \n     Department of Defense to purchase goods and services in the \n     private sector rather than from Federal Prison Industries \n     (FPI), if doing so would be in the best interests of the \n     taxpayer and DOD. Be aware that efforts may be made to strike \n     or alter this provision.\n       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business \n     federation, representing more than three million \n     organizations of every size, sector, and region urges you to \n     support Section 821 and oppose amendments to weaken or strike \n     this pro-defense, pro-business, pro-taxpayer, pro-worker \n     provision.\n       Under current law, federal agencies, including the \n     Department of Defense (DOD), must purchase needed goods from \n     FPI rather than buy them following a competitive procurement \n     process. As a result, DOD and other Federal agencies subject \n     to the FPI monopoly, waste taxpayers dollars purchasing \n     inferior-quality prison made goods and services at inflated \n     costs.\n       By supporting the Levin-Thomas FPI provision you will \n     signal your support for freeing up needed defense dollars for \n     other vital needs and you will save jobs in your state just \n     as many workers and their employers are facing layoffs and \n     cutbacks.\n\n[[Page S9775]]\n\n       Prisoners should work and learn skills, but can be occupied \n     with work and skills development activities that do not mean \n     that DOD and other agencies waste taxpayers dollars and cost \n     jobs in the private sector.\n       The language in Section 821 has broad bipartisan support as \n     well as support from both the business community and \n     organized labor. Please join the U.S. Chamber, the AFL-CIO, \n     and scores of other organizations, large and small, in \n     opposition to any attempt to strike or amend Section 821. The \n     U.S. Chamber may use votes on or in relation to Section 821 \n     in our annual ``How They Voted'' guide to Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  R. Bruce Josten,\n                                         Executive Vice President.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it says:\n\n       On behalf of the 600,000 members of the National Federation \n     of Independent Business (NFIB), I want to express our support \n     for your language in the FY 2002 National Defense \n     Authorization Act that would allow the Department of Defense \n     to purchase products from the private sector rather than from \n     Federal Prison Industries if it would benefit the taxpayer \n     and the DOD. We will oppose any effort to strike this \n     language from the defense authorization bill.\n       Eighty-nine percent of NFIB members do not believe that \n     prisons should receive preference over small businesses for \n     federal contracts.\n\n  That is what we are talking about here.\n  The Chamber of Commerce:\n\n       The United States Senate is expected to very shortly \n     consider S. 1416, the Fiscal 2002 National Defense \n     Authorization Act. Contained in that measure is a provision \n     (Section 821), based on legislation authored by Senators Carl \n     Levin and Craig Thomas, that would allow the Department of \n     Defense to purchase goods and services in the private sector \n     rather than from Federal Prison Industries (FPI), if doing so \n     would be in the best interests of the taxpayer and DOD. Be \n     aware that efforts may be made to strike or alter this \n     provision.\n\n  On behalf of the Senator from Wyoming and myself, I move to table the \namendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator from Texas has been very \ncooperative on this unusual procedure. He advises the managers that he \nand two other Senators wish to participate in this important debate, \nthat debate by these total of three Senators could be concluded prior \nto 2:15. The leadership is prepared to agree to have a vote at 2:15.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Secretary of State is going to be here \nfor a briefing at 2:30. We would have to have that vote at 2:15. The \ntime between now and 12:30 when we recess would be taken. I understand \nthe Senator from Texas says he has at least one other person who wants \nto come to speak in addition to him. I am sure the two managers will \nfairly divide the time between now and when we recess. But if we could \nhave an agreement, we first ask for the yeas and nays on Senator \nWarner's motion to table and then agree that the vote would be at 2:15 \nthis afternoon. I ask that in the form of a unanimous consent request.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask the Senator from Texas, is that agreeable? We would \nnow ask unanimous consent that a vote would occur on the tabling motion \nwhich I, together with the Senator from Wyoming, will make at 2:15, \nsubject, however, to a continuation of this debate up until, should we \nsay, no later than 1 o'clock.\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is fine.\n  Mr. REID. Why don't you make it 12:40 or something.\n  Mr. LEVIN. 12:30.\n  Mr. WARNER. 12:30.\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is fine. All I want to do is answer the three \nspeeches that have been given. I have two other people who say they may \nwant to speak. They may not get over to the Chamber. If they cannot, \nthey cannot.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I only ask unanimous consent that we vote at \n2:15, that the time until 2:15 be divided between the two managers, and \nthat prior to that motion to table there be no amendments in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest proposed by the Senator from Nevada?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have been trying to get an amendment up, \namendment No. 1595. That is the Vieques amendment, not the energy \namendment. And this somehow got in front of me.\n  Mr. REID. This has nothing to do with that amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I understand that. After that vote, could we then take up \nthis amendment?\n  Mr. REID. It recurs automatically, so we do not have to do anything.\n  Mr. INHOFE. OK.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest propounded by the Senator from Nevada?\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I don't object. I would just like to be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I have listened to our three speeches. In \nlistening to them, you get the idea that what they want is competition \nin defense procurement. I would, therefore, like to ask unanimous \nconsent that the pending resolution be set aside and that an amendment \nbe adopted by unanimous consent, which says the following:\n\n       All defense procurement shall be on a competitive basis, \n     and the Secretary of Defense shall buy products at the \n     highest possible quality at the lowest possible price.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I wanted that objection because I wanted to \nmake a point. And that point is, this bill is completely full of \nnoncompetitive provisions. This bill is full of provisions that say who \ncan do business with the Pentagon and who cannot. This bill prohibits \nsomeone from even bidding on a contract with the Pentagon unless they \npay the highest wage rates paid in their region. There is no price \ncompetition in this bill. This bill is the antithesis of price \ncompetition. When our colleagues talk about price competition, their \nbill has none, save they want to destroy Prison Industries.\n  The point I want to make is the following: This amendment has nothing \nto do with price competition. This bill has to do with killing Prison \nIndustries. Now, look, if you listen to our colleagues, it sounds as \nthough they are saying, we do not want to compete with prisoners. It \nsounds as if prisoners are getting all this money that would have gone \nto some private sector producer.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from The \nNational Center for Victims of Crime be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           The National Center for\n\n\n                                             Victims of Crime,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 24, 2001.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: The National Center for Victims of \n     Crime wishes to express its strong opposition to Section 821 \n     of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2002 (S. 1438), concerning purchases from federal prison \n     industries. This amendment raises a panoply of concerns at \n     both the federal and state levels, and will literally take \n     desperately needed funds away from victims who are trying to \n     piece their lives back together in the aftermath of crime.\n       At the federal level, we are deeply concerned that this \n     provision would thwart the Federal Bureau of Prisons' (BOP) \n     efforts to collect millions of dollars each year to support \n     victim assistance and pay crime victim restitution.\n       In addition, we have spoken to state officials who are \n     extremely concerned that this federal provision may set \n     precedent for state level action, significantly affecting the \n     ability of crime victims to collect restitution. Many states \n     require a percentage of money deposited into inmate \n     accounts--including inmate earnings from prison industries--\n     to be collected to support statewide funds for crime victim \n     assistance programs as well as to satisfy court-ordered \n     restitution for victims. For example, in California, during \n     fiscal 2000-2001, the state Prison Industry Authority (PIA) \n     deducted 20% of the inmate\n\n[[Page S9776]]\n\n     wages and transfers (or the balance of victim restitution \n     orders of court-ordered fines, whichever was less) to pay for \n     crime victim assistance programs and restitution orders. The \n     total payment from PIA wages for crime victim restitution \n     during that year was $440,000 dollars. In Florida, the \n     statewide private Prison Rehabilitative Industries and \n     Diversified Enterprises (PRIDE) collected $264,000 in crime \n     victim restitution during the last fiscal year. To take away \n     those desperately needed victim assistance funds is a slap in \n     the face of the already wounded.\n       Furthermore, we believe that prison work programs can \n     prepare inmates for a productive return to society, reducing \n     recidivism. Section 821, by introducing competitive bidding \n     into the procurement process, will reduce the availability of \n     prison work. The result will be fewer prisoners returning to \n     society with the necessary skills and work history to gain \n     employment.\n       We strongly urge you to support restitution for victims of \n     crime and oppose Section 821 of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Susan Herman,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. The point of this letter is, some of the money that is \nbeing earned by producing goods in prison is going for restitution to \ntheir victims. Prisoners get approximately 5 percent of the value of \nthe products that are sold. This is not benefiting prisoners in any \nreal sense. Who it is benefiting really boils down to three groups of \npeople: One, restitution to victims, where some of the money goes for \nthat purpose; two, we are beginning to develop a program whereby we can \npay some of the $30,000 per-prisoner cost of keeping somebody in the \nFederal penitentiary by having them work; and, finally, indirectly \nprisoners benefit by a reduced recidivism rate.\n  Our colleagues say: Well, look, why should the Government give to \nPrison Industries the right of first offering to sell products to the \nGovernment? Why shouldn't we just do it competitively?\n  Let me say, Madam President, I would be perfectly happy--in fact, I \nask unanimous consent that the current amendment be set aside and that \nthe following amendment be adopted:\n\n       The Federal Prison Industry Program and its special \n     relationship to the Defense Department shall be terminated \n     and the Federal Prison Industies shall have every right to \n     sell products in the private sector of the economy except \n     with two limitations: No. 1, no products shall be sold in the \n     immediate vicinity of the prison; and, No. 2, no products \n     shall be sold in a market where price has declined more than \n     10 percent in the last year.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I wanted that objection because I wanted \nto make the point that when our colleagues are talking about wanting \nprison labor to compete; they do not want prison labor to compete; they \ndo not want it to work. The unions and the furniture manufacturers \npound their chest and talk about: We want to compete with prison labor. \nBut they are not telling the truth. They want to take away the only \nmarket that is left for prison labor.\n  They killed off the market for prison labor in the 1930s where \nvirtually everybody in American prisons worked and where they produced \ntheir own food, where they produced their own clothes, where they paid \nfor part of the cost of their incarceration, and where they learned \nskills. So having killed that, now they want to kill the last vestige \nof prison labor; and that is selling to the Federal Government. They \ncloak themselves in the righteousness of competition, but they want no \ncompetition.\n  Now, lest anybody think the relationship the Federal Prison \nIndustries has is a relationship which is unfair to the Government, I \nremind my colleagues that in the 1930s we killed the prison industry as \nit related to producing and selling goods in the private marketplace \nwith three Federal statutes: One, forbid the sale of prison goods in \ninterstate commerce; another, forbid the transportation of prison goods \nin interstate commerce; and another one said: You can work, but you \nhave to pay them union wages. The simple English was: Prisoners are not \ngoing to work. What happened? We drove up the cost of keeping people in \nprison.\n  The only thing left is Government procurement. Every other kind of \nproduction by prisoners is now illegal in the United States of America.\n  Let me recite these facts: In the last comprehensive study by the \nOffice of the Inspector General, Department of Defense--let me remind \nmy colleagues, the Defense Department did not ask for the Levin \namendment. The Justice Department is adamantly opposed to the Levin \namendment. But you get the idea in listening to the proponents of this \nprovision that, well, these prison products are overpriced and are no \ngood. When we did a comprehensive study that was reported to Congress \non October 5, 1998, here is what it found:\n\n  In 78 percent of the procurements that the Defense Department engaged \nin with Federal Prison Industries, the cost of the product was actually \nlower than the cost of the product that was available in the private \nsector. So 78 percent of the time it was cheaper buying from the \nprisons; 20 percent of the time, in the survey, it was higher; 21 \npercent of the time it was roughly the same.\n  When the cost is higher, the Defense Department has the ability to \napply for a waiver so that they don't have to buy from Prison \nIndustries if they think it is not a good deal. Well, in listening to \nthe proponents of this provision, you would get the idea that the \nanswer every time they asked for a waiver was no. The plain truth is \nthat in 89 percent of the cases where they said they didn't want this \nproduct from Prison Industries, that waiver was granted.\n  Let me summarize by making the following points: First of all, by \nroughly a 4-to-1 margin in the surveys that have been done, it is \ncheaper to buy from Prison Industries than from the private sector.\n  Secondly, in those cases where it is not cheaper, almost 90 percent \nof the time a waiver was granted so that the Pentagon did not have to \npurchase the item from Prison Industries.\n  Our colleagues talk about competition, but they don't want \ncompetition. When I asked unanimous consent to have competition for the \nPentagon to buy the best quality at the lowest price, just as Mr. and \nMrs. America try to do every day--and as every business in America \ntries to do every day--they claim it is what they want, but when I ask \nthat we do it by unanimous consent, they object. They say they want \nprison labor to have to compete, but when I ask unanimous consent that \nit be able to compete for both Government contracts and private \ncontracts, save the limitation that you could not sell things right \naround the prison when you glut the market and you could not sell in \nmarkets where prices were falling because of an excess supply--when I \ntried to take the principle they argue on and apply it across the \nboard, they object.\n  So what is the principle? The principle is, having killed prison \nlabor in the private sector, having gone from a system where virtually \nevery prisoner in America worked 12 hours a day, 6 days a week to pay \nrestitution to victims, to pay for their incarceration--having killed \nthat in the private sector, we have an effort before us today to kill \nit in the public sector. That is what this amendment is about. It is \nnot about competition.\n  Now, it is true that our colleagues hold up letters from the AFL-CIO \nand from the NFIB, and those letters say they are for this bill, and \nthat is true. We do have a letter from labor unions. We have a letter \nfrom people who produce items and who would like to see prison labor \nkilled so that they can sell the items to the Federal Government. But I \nask my colleagues, who benefits from that? It is true that the workers \nof a furniture manufacturing plant that might get more jobs or higher \nwages by killing the Federal Prison Industries--maybe they will \nbenefit. It is probably true that the furniture manufacturer who would \nsell the product if we kill Federal Prison Industries will benefit. But \nthere are 285 million people in America who are paying $30,000 per year \nto incarcerate one person in a Federal penitentiary. We have 1.2 \nmillion people nationwide in prison. Does that cost, borne by 285 \nmillion people to keep someone in prison, carry no weight? Do we only \ncare about the labor unions and the manufacturers who would benefit by \nkilling the Federal prison system? And do we not care about the 285 \nmillion people who would lose by losing victim restitution, by losing \nour ability to develop a system\n\n[[Page S9777]]\n\nwhere prisoners will help pay some of that $30,000 a year? Do we only \nhear from the voices of the few who would benefit by killing the \nFederal prison system and not hear from the 285 million people who \nwould lose?\n\n  What a skewed debate this is. But the problem is, the unions know who \nthey are; they have sent letters and they have called Members of the \nSenate. My dear friends at the NFIB--one of the great organizations in \nAmerica, which is a special interest organization--have sent out \nletters, and they have called and lobbied. Where are the lobbyists for \nthe 285 million people who are going to pay $30,000 a year to keep \nsomebody in prison? Have we heard from them? No. They can't figure out \nwhy we are talking about killing Federal Prison Industries when the \nNation hears the drum roll and the bugle of war. They don't even know \nthis is being debated.\n  So we have Members of Congress, and over their left shoulder are all \nthose special interest groups that want to kill the last vestige of \nprison labor in America. They are all going to send letters back home \ntelling people--whether you care about the manufacturer or the labor \nunion, they are going to send those letters. Nobody is going to send a \nletter back home saying that you cared about 285 million taxpayers \nbecause the American public thinks that we are in a crisis and they are \npaying attention to it.\n  That is how bad laws are made. I urge my colleagues to defeat the \nLevin amendment. We had a very unusual thing happen. I must say, in all \nthe time I have been here I don't remember it happening before, but it \nis perfectly within the rules. We had the Senator from Virginia offer a \ntabling amendment on behalf of another member--in this case, myself--\nbefore I was ready to debate the issue, before I could get together my \nsupporters to come speak on behalf of it. I am sure that was not his \nintention. His intention was to get on with this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Did we have a unanimous consent agreement dividing the \ntime? If so, I did not hear it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time was to be equally divided.\n  Mr. GRAMM. That was in the unanimous consent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it was.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I ask unanimous consent for one additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. The issue is not going to be decided on this tabling \nmotion unless this provision is stricken because I have not yet had an \nopportunity to offer an amendment. I would like to have a compromise. I \nwould like to get new data, and I would like to try to improve the \nFederal prison system. I would like to respond to the legitimate \nconcerns that have been raised. But I am not willing to step aside and \nallow prison labor to be killed in America. We have 1.2 million people \nsitting around in idleness, and the cost of keeping people in prison is \ndriving up taxes all over America.\n\n  If, in fact, this amendment is taken out of this bill, it will settle \nthis issue for this year, but if it is not taken out of this bill, it \nwill not settle this issue for this year. I urge the distinguished \nchairman of the committee to compromise, to come to a reasonable \nsolution so we can deal with the Nation's problems.\n  This is an important issue. There are 285 million people paying \n$30,000 a year to keep people in prison. We have 1.2 million people in \nprison. I just cannot be indifferent about that. As a result, I am \nopposed to the Levin amendment. I will vote against this tabling \nmotion. If it is not tabled, the amendment will be pending and it can \nbe amended. If it is tabled, then another amendment can be offered, so \nI do not know that we have settled anything.\n  We have had a good debate, and I think the more people hear about \nthis, the better off we are. I cannot imagine an objective American \nsiding with killing the Federal Prison Industries.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, very briefly, there are a number of \npoints which the Senator from Texas has made which deserve, again, to \nbe refuted. I will pick two of them.\n  First he says Mr. and Mrs. America, if they only knew, they surely \nwould say that we have to allow the Prison Industries to establish a \nmonopoly so that the Defense Department must buy a product from Prison \nIndustries, even though the Defense Department is paying more for it \nfrom Prison Industries than they do from a private firm.\n  I think Mr. and Mrs. America would be stunned, would be shocked if \nthey heard that a private firm is not allowed to bid on a product that \nthe Government is buying.\n  I think Mr. and Mrs. America would probably shake their heads in \ndisbelief and say: Wait a minute, you mean that the office supply \ncompany down the street my husband or wife works at is not allowed to \nbid even if they have a lower price than Prison Industries at 50-cents-\nan-hour labor? You mean that firm, that company, where my spouse has a \njob, cannot even bid on it? Talk about being stunned. That would stun \nMr. and Mrs. America.\n  There is something else, by the way, about Mr. and Mrs. America to \nwhich I want to make reference. We do not allow Americans to buy \nproducts made by Chinese prison labor. We prohibit it. We just do not \nthink it is right that we should be competing with Chinese prison \nwages. It is tough enough to be competing with wages of people who are \nnot in prison in other countries, but we have a prohibition on that.\n  Yet our friend from Texas says we ought to let prison labor sell in \nthe private sector. That is really what is at issue by the way. The \nissue is much more than the language which is in this bill which would \nsimply allow the private sector to compete. What the Senator from Texas \nis really after and has said he would support would be a provision that \nwould let prison labor make products and sell in the private sector.\n\n  I want to see whether or not the American public will support a \nsystem where our workers not in prison have to compete with prison \nwages. I do not think they want to do it any more than we want to \ncompete with Chinese prison wages. I do not think they want to do it. \nYet that is what the Senator from Texas says he will support.\n  I hope this Senate will reject that as being really what the Senator \nfrom Texas is after and, according to his own words, something he will \nsupport.\n  The issue before us is a narrower issue. Although the issue I \nmentioned may be the underlying issue, the narrower issue is the \nlanguage in this bill. The language in this bill simply says that if a \nprivate firm wishes to bid on a product that the Department of Defense \nis buying, it ought to be allowed to do so and that Prison Industries \nshould not be able unilaterally to say a private company may not bid, \nthat Prison Industries is going to have a monopoly.\n  The Senator from Texas repeated perhaps 20 times that the effort here \nis to kill prison labor, kill Prison Industries. Of course, it is not. \nIt is to permit the private sector to compete. Indeed, the statistics, \nwhich he cited a number of times, support our language. It was his \nstatistics which said that in 78 percent of the procurements by the \nDepartment, the price paid to Prison Industries was actually lower. \nFine. We are not trying to change that. All this language does is take \ncare of the other 20 percent, which is also one of the statistics cited \nby the Senator from Texas.\n  In the other 20 percent, according to the Senator from Texas, it \nwould actually be cheaper for the Department of Defense to buy from the \nprivate sector than it would from Prison Industries. He cites that \nstatistic as proving that in most cases it would be cheaper for the \nDepartment to buy from Prison Industries. Fine. We are not trying to \nstop that. We are not trying to stop the Prison Industries from \ncompeting. We just want to allow the private sector to compete so that \nin 20 percent of the cases where the Department of Defense would save \nmoney by buying from the private sector, it would be allowed to do so.\n  Madam President, I hope this language will stay in the bill. It has \nbroad support. It is also, it seems to me, so fundamentally fair that \nAmerican citizens not in prison be allowed to bid on items that their \nGovernment is buying. That to me is so obvious and so fair that it \nwould come as a shock to American citizens to learn that is anything \nother than what the current system is.\n\n[[Page S9778]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n             Order for Recess Subject to Call of the Chair\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \n2:15 p.m. vote, the Senate be in recess subject to the call of the \nChair as a result of the briefing that will take place by Secretary of \nState Colin Powell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, we have a minute before we recess. I \nfeel so strongly about this notion that we favor private enterprise, \nthat we favor the opportunity for competition, and that we have worked \nat this problem for a number of years and now to pick out a portion of \nit and say somehow private competition should not work surprises me a \ngreat deal.\n  I understand the number of Federal prisons in Texas. Talk about \nspecial interests. It is there. What we ought to do is follow the \npolicy we have had for a very long time and see if we can move as much \nactivity to the private sector as possible when they can compete, when \nthey can make the best product, and that is the case here.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, we have a couple minutes remaining, and I \nwould like to have that time, if I may.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, first of all, I am not in a Federal \nprison, and I do not have any kinfolk in a Federal prison, so I do not \nknow how I would benefit from that.\n  Second, it is interesting, all this concern about competition. The \nDefense Department sent the chairman a recommendation that they be \nallowed to be more competitive in purchasing items by not requiring \ndefense contractors to pay inflated wage rates in order to bid. They \nestimated that next year they could save $180 million if they were \nallowed to be more competitive, and that provision was struck and not \nincluded in this bill.\n  The Defense Department sent the chairman and the ranking member a \nletter saying: If you will just let us have a little bit more leeway in \ngetting competitive bidding on small contracts of less than $1 million, \nthat could have saved $180 million in 1 year.\n  Our colleagues who are so concerned about competition today say \nbasically we do not want to save $180,000 if it means competition, and \nso they rejected that provision. Yet when it comes to Federal Prison \nIndustries, now all of a sudden everything should be different.\n  So I hope my colleagues will vote on this on the merits. Do you want \nto kill Federal Prison Industries or not? Do you think a handful of \nworkers and a handful of manufacturers who would benefit by killing \nFederal Prison Industries are more important than the 285 million \ntaxpayers who are paying $30,000 a year to keep somebody in prison \nwhere those costs can be ultimately partially paid by prisoners working \nand where we could use some of the money for victims' restitution? That \nis the issue, and I hope people will vote on that basis.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I rise today in support of the \npreservation of the Federal Prison Industries Program. Language that is \ncurrently in the Defense authorization bill would gut this program \nwithin the Bureau of Federal Prisons, effectively withdrawing hope for \nthousands of incarcerated Federal prisoners and fostering a dangerous \nnumber of idle hands within our Federal prison system.\n  Today, the Federal Prison Industries Program employs and provides \nvaluable skills training to the greatest practicable number of inmates \nincarcerated within the Federal prison system. Overall, FPI has some \n21,000 inmates in more than 100 Federal prisons working in 100 \nindustries, from textiles to electronics to graphic design. In Ohio, \nthe Federal Correctional Institute at Elkton has up to 450 inmates \nworking in data processing and electronics recycling. This employment \nof prisoners does more than just occupy time, it teaches prisoners the \nskills they need to obtain a job once they leave prison.\n  By giving prisoners an opportunity to change their lives, the FPI \nprogram contributes to security inside prisons, and it reduces the rate \nof recidivism among those it trains. Indeed, inmates in FPI's work \nprograms are 24 percent less likely to be repeat offenders after being \nreleased. In addition, 55 percent of inmates' wages go toward meeting \ntheir financial obligations, such as victim restitution, child support, \nand court fees.\n  When I was Governor of Ohio, we had a similar program to FPI and saw \nfirsthand the success and value of giving inmates a second change at \nbeing productive members of society. In Ohio, we had inmates who had \nbeen trained in horticulture take part in groundskeeping throughout the \nGovernor's residence. We had inmates working in the Governor's office \nmailroom and copy center operations, where they put together news \nclippings, distributed mail and did a good portion of the photocopying. \nOverall, I had an extremely good experience with the work these inmates \ndid, and I have to say that for the most part, the work they performed \nwas excellent. For some inmates who had exemplified themselves, I even \nwrote letters of recommendation to help them get jobs when they got out \nof prison.\n  The experience that I have had at the State level by employing State \ninmates is one that is replicated at the Federal level through the FPI \nprogram.\n  I understand that some private sector companies desire to compete for \nFPI contracts, however, I believe that FPI provides an invaluable \nopportunity for inmates, and the communities to which they will \neventually return, that cannot be ignored.\n  While I find merit in pursing possible reforms to the FPI program, I \ndo not believe the answer is to completely obliterate FPI, as the \ncurrent language does. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support to \nensure the viability of FPI, the safety of our Federal prisons and the \nrehabilitation of our Federal inmates.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I oppose section 821 of the Fiscal Year \n2002 Defense authorization bill because I fear that this section would \nundermine what has proved to be a successful program in helping to \nmanage Federal prisoners.\n  Section 821 would effectively eliminate the mandatory source \nrequirement for the Department of Defense, which ensures that Federal \nprisoners are employed in sufficient numbers, and thus is fundamental \nto the security of our Federal prisons.\n  Moreover, since this section would significantly affect our Federal \nprisons, it is an issue that the Senate Judiciary Committee should \nfirst consider before the Senate takes action on it after only 2 hours \nof debate.\n  I support competition for the provision of goods and services to the \nFederal Government. However, this competition should not be sought at \nthe expense of a successful prisoner management program, and that \nprogram should certainly not be repealed without some alternative \nprogram to replace it.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I rise to support my colleague from \nTexas in his effort to strike section 821 from S. 1438. I have outlined \nwhy I believe that the Federal Prison Industries is important for the \ncontinued orderly function of our prisons.\n  Today I have received a letter from Fraternal Order of Police \nPresident Steve Young. In his letter, Mr. Young made an interesting \npoint that a healthy Federal Prison Industries is not only important \nfor the orderly function of our prisons but also for the safety of our \ncorrections officers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Young's letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                    Fraternal Order of Police,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 25, 2001.\n     Hon. Sam Brownback,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Brownback: I am writing on behalf of the more \n     than 299,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police to \n     advise you of our strong support for Amendment No. 1674 to \n     strike Section 821 from S. 1438, the ``FY 2002 National \n     Defense Authorization Act;'' and therefore urge a ``no'' vote \n     on the motion to table this important amendment.\n       Reform of Federal Prison Industries has been an issue which \n     has received much attention over the past several years. For \n     our\n\n[[Page S9779]]\n\n     organization, any reform proposal put before the Congress \n     must be viewed from the perspective of its potential impact \n     on both the safety of Federal correctional officers, and the \n     safety of the public from recidivist offenders.\n       With the large number of Federal prisoners incarcerated in \n     Bureau of Prison (BOP) facilities, now is the time to seek \n     increased opportunities for inmates to gain meaningful \n     employment through FPI. In so doing, we can reduce the rate \n     of recidivism, enhance public safety, provide restitution to \n     victims of crime and their families, and require these \n     inmates to truly pay their debt to society at no additional \n     cost to the American taxpayers. In addition, it will create a \n     safer environment for the thousands of correctional officers \n     who work in BOP facilities.\n       On behalf of the membership of the Fraternal Order of \n     Police, I wish to thank you for your continuing leadership on \n     this issue and your support of America's law enforcement \n     officers. Please do not hesitate to contact me, or Executive \n     Director Jim Pasco, if we can provide you with any additional \n     information or assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Steve Young,\n                                               National President.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I rise to express my strong support \nfor the amendment to strike section 821, the Federal Prison Industries \nprovision of the Defense Authorization Act. I commend Senator Gramm for \nhis leadership and excellent remarks today on this critical issue.\n  FPI or UNICOR is an essential correctional program that keeps \nthousands of prisoners working every day without any cost to taxpayers. \nIt helps maintain prison safety and security because inmates that are \nproductively occupied are less likely to be involved in mischief and \nviolence.\n  FPI has existed since the 1930s, but it has never been more important \nthan it is today in these times of rising prison populations. Just on \nthe Federal level, the prison population today is twice what it was in \nthe late 1980s. While the number of inmates in State prisons may be \nleveling off now, the number of Federal prisoners is continuing to rise \nand is expected to expand by 40 percent in the next seven years. The \nCongress is approving 28 more medium or high-security prisons to \naccommodate this continuing increase, which is needed to keep our \nstreets safe and keep the crime rate declining. It is prisons of this \ntype that most need the work programs that FPI provides.\n  Moreover, Prison Industries helps provide prisoners a future when \nthey are released. The program teaches inmates meaningful job skills \nthat they can use when they return to society, and has proven to be the \nmost successful government initiative in helping prevent prisoners from \nreturning to a life of crime. It is an extremely popular work program, \nthrough which inmates volunteer to participate. In fact, the prisons \nhave long waiting lists for inmates to be involved. It is worth \nrepeating that FPI requires no government funding and sustains itself \nas a government corporation.\n  We should not destroy what keeps the growing correctional population \noccupied in a way that benefits prisoners and protects the prisons and \nour communities. Yet, Section 821 of the Defense authorization bill \ncould do just that. It would essentially exclude the Defense Department \nfrom FPI and endanger this program and its essential mission.\n  The Defense Department is critical to FPI's continued success. It is \none of FPI's most important customers, constituting about 60 percent of \nFPI sales. Also, FPI is an important part of the military supply \nnetwork. DOD and FPI have a good working relationship, and there is no \nbasis for us to create a special carve out of DOD from FPI's very long-\nstanding Federal Government preference in procurement.\n  Section 821 would eliminate the preference that FPI has over the \nprivate sector for sales less than $2,500, for products that are part \nof a national security system, or for products that are components of \nitems that FPI does not sell. This would essentially exclude Defense \nfrom the mandatory source because the great majority of DOD orders fit \ninto one of these three categories. In fact, for any remaining \npurchases, DOD would be required to conduct ``market research'' before \nmaking purchases. This provision is simply unworkable in practice and, \nconsidering that DOD constitutes about 60 percent of FPI sales, would \nseverely harm FPI, and even endanger the program.\n  The arguments that opponents of Prison Industries are making are \ncertainly not new. These issues were raised by Senator Levin years ago \nin a previous Defense authorization bill, and the Congress required the \nDefense Department and the Justice Department to complete a major study \nregarding their relationship. The results of that joint study were \nreleased in 1999, and show that the changes we are considering today \nare not warranted. The study found that they have a beneficial and \ncooperative relationship, and the suggestions it made for improvement \nhave been implemented. It specifically concluded that no statutory \nchanges in the procurement process are warranted, which the provision \nwe are considering today entirely disregards.\n  Moreover, the current Bush administration opposes this type of \npiecemeal effort to harm FPI, just as the Clinton administration and \nothers did in the past. The Bush administration has expressed great \nconcern about the effect that Section 821 could have on the safe and \neffective administration of Federal prisons.\n\n  This concern is entirely appropriate. The fact is that Section 821 \nwould eliminate many FPI jobs and create problems for the safe and \nefficient operation of Federal prisons. Also, many opportunities for \ninmates to earn marketable job skills would be lost or have to be \nsubsidized with scarce Government funds. Given the severe budget \nconstraints and demands for Federal money caused by the September 11 \nterrorist attacks, this is definitely not the time to be creating an \nadditional need for Federal dollars.\n  The operation of Federal prisons is a matter within the jurisdiction \nof the Judiciary Committee, and that committee is the appropriate place \nto consider matters related to FPI. In fact, reform legislation that we \nshould consider in the Judiciary Committee is currently pending there.\n  I agree that it is time to move away from the mandatory source \npreference that FPI has in the Federal market. However, we must do so \nin a reasoned, comprehensive way that creates more opportunities, not \nless.\n  Senator Hatch and I have introduced a bill that is pending in the \nJudiciary Committee which would eliminate the mandatory source in a way \nthat would not endanger FPI. Our legislation, S. 1228, would give \nprivate businesses the opportunity to partner with FPI to make products \nin the private sector.\n  Most importantly, it would permit prisoners to make products for \nprivate companies that otherwise would be made overseas, such as \nelectronic toys and televisions. This has the potential to return jobs \nto America that have been lost to foreign labor. FPI already purchases \nover $400 million per year in raw materials and equipment from United \nStates companies, most of which comes from small businesses. This bill \nwould expand those opportunities for private industry.\n  Also, under S. 1228, when inmates made products in the domestic \nmarket, they would earn comparable locality wages. Additional money \nthat they earned would be used to pay restitution, child support, and a \nportion of their room and board costs. This would be in addition to the \nmillions of dollars that FPI inmates already contribute annually to \ntheir families and to crime victims. I think we should make FPI a \npartner with the private sector as part of a comprehensive solution to \nthis long-standing issue.\n  Any argument about forced labor, whether in FPI today or in this \nbill, has absolutely no merit. FPI is a program that inmates volunteer \nto participate in, and S. 1228 would require that participation be \nvoluntary. Also, the facilities would comply with standards established \nby OSHA, the International Labor Organization, and the American \nCorrectional Association.\n  I am prepared to work with all interested parties to help resolve \nthis matter once and for all. However, the Defense Authorization Act is \nnot the right place and section 821 is clearly not the right approach \nto reforming Prison Industries. With the recent terrorist attack, many \nwant to limit the Defense authorization bill to our military and \nnational security needs. This bill certainly should not be used to \ninterfere in the orderly operation of Federal prisons. Thus, I \nencourage my colleagues to support this important amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n[[Page S9780]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, do I have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, if the Senator from Texas wants to offer \nan amendment to modify the Davis-Bacon law to accomplish what he talked \nabout, he ought to offer it. Nobody offered it in committee, but the \nSenator from Texas is free to offer it.\n  What troubles me is we have a bill which is of critical significance \nto the Armed Forces of the United States. We have pay increases in the \nbill. We have housing allowances. What the Senator from Texas is saying \nis, unless he gets his way on this issue, he is not going to allow that \nbill to go forward. It seems to me that is wrong, and that is the \nproblem. That is what has caused this particular situation.\n  That is the only reason the Senator from Virginia obviously offered \nthe amendment and moved to table it, to see whether or not there is \nsupport for the position of the Senator from Texas. If the Senator from \nTexas prevails on his position, fine. If he does not prevail on his \nposition, this bill is too important, has too much in it that matters \nto the security of this country, to be held up by one Senator who \ninsists he is going to get his way even if the majority of the Senate \ndisagrees with him. That is what the issue is. It seems to me that is \nthe overriding issue.\n  Back to competition, if the Senator from Texas believes there should \nbe an amendment that would modify Davis-Bacon, I would urge him to \noffer that. Let us debate it. Let us vote it, but let us not hold up \nthe Defense bill as his position would.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I ask unanimous consent that the request of the Defense \nDepartment that they have the right to engage in competitive bidding on \ncontracts of less than a million dollars be accepted.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I object. I have said very clearly that the Senator should \noffer the amendment if he wants to do so. Send the amendment to the \ndesk. Let's debate that amendment. Win or lose, modify Davis-Bacon if \nhe wishes. Send an amendment to the desk. We will debate it. But what I \nobject to is holding up the Defense bill on this ground. We do not do \nthis by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Not to keep dragging this dead cat back across the table, \nbut I am not asking for any special privilege. I wanted to offer my own \namendment, which someone else offered. The Senator can deal with his \nbill as he chooses. I have been a private in the Army, but I believe I \nam a private in the right. I want this issue to be heard, and I want to \ndebate it. I don't understand why that is somehow unreasonable.\n  When people want to pass special interest legislation, they can cloak \nthemselves in the righteousness of the moment. I do not understand why \nit is even in this bill. I think, quite frankly, people ought to be \nembarrassed that it is in this bill.\n  In any case, I am not asking for any special privilege whatsoever. I \nwant to exercise my right as 1 of 100 Senators. That is all I am doing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

RADIATION EXPOSURE COMPENSATION ACT MANDATORY \n                   APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       Section 3(e) of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 2210 note) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(e) Appropriation.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Subject to the limits in paragraph (2), \n     there are appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not \n     otherwise appropriated, for the fiscal year 2002, and each \n     fiscal year thereafter through 2011, such sums as may be \n     necessary to the Fund for the purpose of making payments to \n     eligible beneficiaries under this Act.\n       ``(2) Limitation.--Amounts appropriated pursuant to \n     paragraph (1) may not exceed--\n       ``(A) in fiscal year 2002, $172,000,000;\n       ``(B) in fiscal year 2003, $143,000,000;\n       ``(C) in fiscal year 2004, $107,000,000;\n       ``(D) in fiscal year 2005, $65,000,000;\n       ``(E) in fiscal year 2006, $47,000,000;\n       ``(F) in fiscal year 2007, $29,000,000;\n       ``(G) in fiscal year 2008, $29,000,000;\n       ``(H) in fiscal year 2009, $23,000,000;\n       ``(I) in fiscal year 2010, $23,000,000; and\n       ``(J) in fiscal year 2011, $17,000,000.''.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we are going to do something that is \nvery fair that will eliminate a serious problem that is out there among \na few thousand Americans, some of whom have walked into meetings with \nthe U.S. Government carrying an IOU. The IOU is that the Federal \nGovernment owes them the money they were supposed to receive months \nago, because either the person there or one of their spouses have died \nor is seriously ill with an ailment that is charged and relates \ndirectly to having been in the uranium mining activity for years and \nyears in the early days of the nuclear weapons program.\n  What happened was, we put money in a trust fund and we made this an \nentitlement, but it was not funded. The trust fund was a given amount \nof money. They adjudicated these claims. We did it so they could do \nthem quickly; they didn't have to spend a lot of money on lawyers.\n  The Government ruled quickly, even though in some cases, with some of \nthem listening in the Four Corners area, they did go through an awful \nlot of trouble to get their claim. But then, the insult: they produced \ntheir claim and said, where is the money? The U.S. Department of \nJustice said, oops, sorry, we don't have any. These people are walking \naround, some of them almost in a daze, because they cannot believe that \ntheir Federal Government they read about every day, spending hundreds \nof billions of dollars, huge amounts for defense, huge amounts for \nother things, is telling them for a claim that is theirs, that has been \nadjudicated, that says the U.S. Government of America owes Jimmy Jones \n$100,000, there is no money. And this is what they bring to our \nmeetings.\n  We do not take very long in agreeing with them. We try to give them \nthe history, the fact it has to be funded. Every time we sought funding \nfor one reason or another, we received just enough for a month or two. \nThis claim got mixed up in jurisdictional problems as to which \ncommittee ought to fund it.\n  I say to the Senate, when we were working on the budget resolution, \nwe allocated in that budget to the Armed Services Committee the money \nthat was necessary to keep this program going for a substantial period \nof time. We said, even though it is allocated to the defense part of \nour budget, this amount of money should be used for the claimants I am \ntalking about under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Fund.\n  Under this bill, there is $172 million in the defense account that \nhas not been used because it is for these claimants. A little bit of it \nwas used in the process of producing this bill. I do not choose to \nargue about that. That is all right with me. I just want this amendment \nadopted so nobody uses the rest of the money that is in this bill for \nthese people.\n  For anybody who is interested, we are about to do something for a lot \nof Americans, principally in the Four Corners area, some in the \nDakotas. Those claimants ought to know the best we can do is to put it \non this bill. This bill has a long way to go, but the Senator from New \nMexico does not know where else to put it that will get it into their \nhands any sooner.\n  We will be watching and observing, and if for some reason this \nauthorization bill cannot get through the process--through the House to \nthe President and signed--we will try to find another way. We did not \nsucceed totally. We do not make this a completely mandatory program.\n  We are taking jurisdiction away from no one. If this bill is in the \nJudiciary Committee, they will retain jurisdiction. We are going to pay \nfor it out of an allocation that went to this committee's work on \ndefense, and we are just about to say that this money will now go to \nwhom it was intended: those people to whom the Government is clearly \nindebted and owes money.\n  I offered this amendment that will make funding for the Radiation \nExposure Compensation Fund mandatory.\n  From the 1940s through 1971, uranium miners, Federal employees, who \nparticipated in above-ground nuclear tests, and downwinders from the \nNevada Test Site were exposed to dangerous levels of radiation. As a \nresult of this exposure, these individuals contracted debilitating and \ntoo often deadly radiation-related cancers and other diseases.\n  In 1990, Congress recognized their contribution by passing the \nRadiation Exposure Compensation Act to ensure that these individuals \nand their families were indemnified for their sacrifice and suffering. \nHowever, the RECA Trust Fund ran out of money in May, 2000. \nConsequently, for over a year most eligible claimants received nothing \nmore than a five-line IOU from the Justice Department explaining that \nno payments will be made until Congress provides the necessary funds. \nSome of these claimants died while awaiting their payments. This is \nsimply unconscionable.\n  Fortunately, we were able to secure the necessary funds in this \nyear's supplemental to pay the IOUs and all claims approved by \nSeptember 30, 2001. Nonetheless, many claims will be filed and approved \nover the coming years, and it is time we make all payments to this fund \nmandatory so that these people who have suffered so greatly for our \nNation's security are not again shortchanged by the political \ncomplexities of the annual congressional appropriations process. If we \ndo not adopt this amendment, more of these men will die holding nothing \nbut a Government IOU.\n  In a time when our Nation is at war, it is imperative that we do not \nforget those citizens who have contributed so much to the strength and \nsecurity of our Nation. After all, these folks helped build our nuclear \narsenal, the nuclear arsenal that is responsible, at least in part, for \nending the cold war and leading to America's place as the world's only \nsuperpower.\n  Moreover, it is important that we show those who are now being called \non to protect our Nation that the Senate cannot and will not forget \ntheir efforts and sacrifice. By turning our backs on some of \nyesterday's heroes we will be sending the wrong message to the heroes \nof today.\n\n[[Page S9782]]\n\n  This is the appropriate time to raise this issue because we assumed \nthis spending in the Senate budget resolution and the funding was \nallocated to the Armed Services Committee for this purpose. It is \nimportant to note that under this amendment, these mandatory payments \nare capped at the amounts allocated to the Armed Services Committee and \nwill not exceed $172 million in any one year.\n  Those who helped protect our Nation's security through their work on \nour nuclear programs must be compensated for the enormous price they \npaid. Anything less is unacceptable.\n  Mr. President, there were a lot of Senators involved. If they want to \nbe a cosponsor, we will be glad to ask they be made original \ncosponsors. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend our good friend from New Mexico. \nHe and Senator Bingaman and others have fought hard and long for equity \nin this area. We intended to do it for some time, but it has always \nbeen subject to appropriation.\n  The Senator from New Mexico made sure that in the budget resolution \nthere was an allocation that would make this possible on this bill. He \nhas done his homework, as he always does. It is very gratifying.\n  I know the people he represents, plus a lot of other people for whom \njustice will finally be done. I commend him for his work and support on \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am an original cosponsor of this \namendment by Senator Domenici and strongly supportive of it because it \ntakes important steps to fully fund the Radiation Exposure Compensation \nAct, or RECA.\n  RECA was originally enacted as a means of compensating thousands of \nindividuals who suffered from exposure to radiation as a result of the \nFederal Government's nuclear testing program and Federal uranium mining \nactivities. While the Government can never fully compensate for the \nloss of a life or the reduction in the quality of life, RECA serves as \na cornerstone for the national apology Congress extended in 1990 to the \nvictims of the radiation tragedies. This amendment is critical to \nensure that the Federal Government finally lives up to that commitment \nof providing a compassionate program of compensation to these workers \nand their families.\n  Unfortunately, for years the Federal Government's commitment to RECA \nhas been half-hearted. The fund has been consistently shortchanged, so \nmuch so that the Justice Department was until recently shamefully \nissuing IOU's to sick and dying workers. This amendment will assure \nuranium millers, miners and ore transporters that the Federal \nGovernment values the service they gave to our country and is committed \nto ensuring they receive compassionate compensation for that service.\n  The amendment provides $655 million over 10 years to workers and \ntheir families that are eligible through RECA. This goes a long way \ntoward the Federal Government fully living up to its promise when we \npassed RECA 11 years ago. Unfortunately, the Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates that we need $812 million over the same period. So, \nwhile I urge the Congress to recognize we are making important and \ncritical strides to fully funding this commitment, we remain around \n$150 million short and we must all work to ensure that the program is \nfully funded throughout the 10-year period. We must never reach a point \nof issuing IOU's rather than actual financial assistance to these \nworkers and their families again.\n  I would also like to thank Chairman Levin and Senator Warner for \ntheir hard work on this issue. They have, from the beginning, \nrecognized the importance and fairness involved in passage of this \namendment and I am appreciative of their help and support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1672) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the senior Senator from Michigan. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate has \nadopted an amendment I cosponsored with Senator Domenici to provide \n$665 million over the next 10 years to fund the Radiation Exposure \nCompensation Act.\n  Hundreds of former uranium workers in South Dakota and thousands \nacross the Nation have developed cancer and other life-threatening \ndiseases as a result of their work producing uranium on behalf of the \nU.S. Government. Although the Federal Government knew this work put the \nhealth of these men and women at risk, it failed to take appropriate \nsteps to warn or protect them.\n  The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act is designed to compensate \nthese individuals, or their surviving family. Although Congress has \nalready committed to the compensation, adequate funding has never \navailable to fund this program. In fact, the Federal Government at \ntimes has been sending IOUs to eligible beneficiaries because Congress \nhas not been providing enough money to pay these claims.\n  The amendment just adopted by the Senate takes a significant step \ntoward addressing this problem. It provides $665 million over the next \n10 years to pay these claims. While this amount is not sufficient to \ncover all those expected to apply for benefits, it will cover the vast \nmajority of claims. I plan to work with my colleagues to ensure that \nany remaining funds that prove to be necessary are provided.\n  I want to express my thanks to Senator Domenici for his work on this \nissue, and to Senators Bingaman, Reid and Hatch for their consistent \nefforts to support uranium workers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Office is required \nto prepare a cost estimate for spending legislation reported by \ncommittees. The cost estimate for the bill reported by the committee, \nS. 1416, was not finished at the time the report on this bill was \nfiled. The CBO cost estimate is now available. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Congressional Budget Office cost estimate for the Defense \nauthorization bill reported by our Committee on Armed Services be \nprinted in the Record.\n  Because the four sections removed from S. 1416 should not affect the \nfunding levels in the bill, this CBO cost estimate will also apply to \nS. 1438 which we are presently considering.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               September 19, 2001.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 1416, the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002.\n       The CBO staff contact is Kent Christensen, who can be \n     reached at 226-2840. If you wish further details on this \n     estimate, we will be pleased to provide them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Barry B. Anderson,\n                                   (For Dan L. Crippen, Director).\n       Enclosure.\n\n               Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate\n\n     S. 1416--National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n         2002\n       Summary: S. 1416 would authorize appropriations totaling \n     $343 billion for fiscal year 2002 for the military functions \n     of the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of \n     Energy and certain other defense-related programs. It also \n     would prescribe personnel strengths for each active duty and \n     selected reserve component of the U.S. armed forces. CBO \n     estimates that appropriation of the authorized amounts for \n     2002 would result in additional outlays of $338 billion over \n     the 2002-2006 period.\n       The bill also contains provisions that would raise the \n     costs of discretionary defense programs over the 2003-2006 \n     period. CBO estimates that those provisions would require \n     appropriations of $10 billion over those four years.\n       The bill contains provisions that would reduce direct \n     spending, primarily through revised payment rates for some \n     services offered under the Tricare for Life program and \n     certain asset sales. We estimate that the direct spending \n     savings resulting from provisions of S. 1416 would total $209 \n     million over the 2002-2006 period and $86 million over the \n     2002-2011 period. Those totals include estimated net receipts \n     from asset sales of $144\n\n[[Page S9783]]\n\n     million over the next five years and $120 million over 10 \n     years. Because it would affect direct spending, the bill \n     would be subject to pay-as-you-go procedures.\n       Section 4 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) \n     excludes from the application of that act any legislative \n     provisions that enforce the constitutional rights of \n     individuals. CBO has determined that subtitle F (Uniformed \n     Services Overseas Voting) of title V is excluded because the \n     provision would enforce an individual's constitutional right \n     to vote. The bill contains one private-sector mandate; \n     however, the costs of that mandate would not exceed the \n     threshold as specified in UMRA ($113 million in 2001, \n     adjusted annually for inflation).\n       The remaining provisions of the bill either contain no \n     mandates or are excluded, as specified in UMRA, because they \n     would be necessary for national security. The bill also would \n     affect DoD's Tricare long-term care program by increasing \n     costs in state Medicaid programs by about $1 million in 2002 \n     and over $2 million in 2003. Such costs would not result from \n     mandates as defined by UMRA.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of S. 1416 is shown in Table 1. Most of the \n     costs of this legislation fall within budget function 050 \n     (national defense).\n\n       TABLE 1.--BUDGETARY IMPACT OF S. 1416, THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2002\n                                    [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars])\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        2001         2002         2003         2004         2005         2006\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\n \nSpending Under Current Law for\n Defense Programs:\n    Budget Authority \\1\\..........      316,051            0            0            0            0            0\n    Estimated Outlays.............      301,602      107,667       36,099       13,839        6,256        3,308\nProposed Changes:\n    Estimated Authorization Level.            0      342,647            0            0            0            0\n    Estimated Outlays.............            0      226,562       76,529       23,636        8,254        3,008\nSpending Under S. 1416 for Defense\n Programs:\n    Estimated Authorization Level       316,051      342,647            0            0            0            0\n     \\1\\..........................\n    Estimated Outlays.............      301,602      334,229      112,628       37,475       14,510        6,316\n \n                                     DIRECT SPENDING (EXCLUDING ASSET SALES)\n \nEstimated Budget Authority........            0           32         -200           61           25           17\nEstimated Outlays.................            0           32         -200           61           25           17\n \n                                                 ASSET SALES \\2\\\n \nEstimated Budget Authority........            0          -40         -114          -16           -5           31\nEstimated Outlays.................            0          -40         -114          -16           -5          31\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The 2001 level is the amount appropriated for programs authorized by the bill.\n\\2\\ Asset sale receipts are a credit against direct spending.\n \nNote.--This table excludes estimated authorizations of appropriations for years after 2002. (Those additional\n  authorizations are shown in Table 3.)\n\n     Basis of Estimate\n       Spending Subject to Appropriation\n       The bill would authorize appropriations totaling $343 \n     billion in 2002 (see Table 2). Most of those costs would fall \n     within budget function 050 (national defense). S. 1416 also \n     would authorize appropriations of $71 million for the Armed \n     Forces Retirement Home (function 600--income security) and \n     $17 million for the Naval Petroleum Reserves (function 270--\n     energy).\n       Title XIII would make $15.2 billion of the authorizations \n     in the bill contingent upon either a procedural action taken \n     by the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget in the Senate \n     or a procedural waiver agreed to by three-fifths of the \n     members of the Senate. The estimate assumes that one of these \n     actions would occur and that $343 billion will be \n     appropriated near the start of fiscal year 2002. Outlays are \n     estimated based on historical spending patterns.\n       The bill also contains provisions that would affect various \n     costs, mostly for personnel, that would be covered by the \n     fiscal year 2002 authorization and by authorizations in \n     future years. Table 3 contains estimates of those amounts. In \n     addition to the costs covered by the authorizations in the \n     bill for 2002, these provisions would raise estimated costs \n     by $10 billion over the 2003-2006 period. The following \n     sections describe the provisions identified in Table 3 and \n     provide information about CBO's cost estimates for those \n     provisions.\n       Multiyear Procurement. In most cases, purchases of weapon \n     systems are authorized annually, and as a result, DoD \n     negotiates a separate contract for each annual purchase. In a \n     small number of cases, the law permits multiyear procurement; \n     that is, it allows DoD to enter into a contract to buy \n     specified annual quantities of a system for up to five years. \n     In those cases, DoD can negotiate lower prices because its \n     commitment to purchase the weapons gives the contractor an \n     incentive to find more economical ways to manufacture the \n     weapon, including cost-saving investments. Funding would \n     continue to be provided on an annual basis for these \n     multiyear contracts, but potential termination costs would be \n     covered by an initial appropriation.\n\n                                   TABLE 2.

Those amounts are shown in Table 2. Amounts shown in this table for 2003 through 2006 are not\n  included in Table 1.\n\n       Section 122 would authorize DoD to enter into a multiyear \n     contract to buy engines for F/A-18E/F aircraft starting in \n     2002. The Navy currently purchases the aircraft from Boeing \n     under a multiyear contract covering the 2000-2004 period, \n     while the engines are purchased separately from General \n     Electric under annual contracts. Each engine costs about $4 \n     million today. According to the Navy, it plans to purchase 48 \n     aircraft a year over the next five years starting in 2002. \n     CBO estimates that the savings from buying F/A-18E/F engines \n     under a multi-year contract would total about $50 million \n     over the 2002-2006 period, or about 3 percent of total engine \n     costs. This estimate assumes that the Navy would buy 96 \n     engines a year (two engines for every aircraft purchased) \n     over the five-year period and that there would be no up-front \n     investment required to implement the multiyear contract.\n       Section 131 would authorize DoD to enter into a new \n     multiyear procurement contract to buy up to 60 additional C-\n     17 aircraft. Under the current multiyear contract, the Air \n     Force will buy 15 aircraft in 2002 and another 8 aircraft in \n     2003. Assuming that the Air Force would proceed with follow-\n     on procurement of up to 60 additional aircraft, CBO estimates \n     that savings from buying 60 additional C-17s under a \n     multiyear contract arrangement would total $934 million or an \n     average of about $250 million a year over the 2003-2006 \n     period. Funding requirements would total just under $8.3 \n     billion instead of the almost $9.2 billion needed under \n     annual contracts. This estimate assumes that the Air Force \n     would purchase the 60 additional aircraft starting in 2003 at \n     a rate of 15 a year.\n       Force Structure. The bill contains various sections that \n     affect endstrength and personnel grade structure.\n       Endstrengths. The bill would authorize active and reserve \n     endstrengths for 2002. The authorized endstrengths for \n     active-duty personnel and personnel in the selected reserve \n     would total about 1,387,000 and 865,000, respectively. Of \n     those selected reservists, about 67,000 would serve on active \n     duty in support of the reserves. The bill would specifically \n     authorize appropriations of $82.4 billion for the costs of \n     military pay and allowances in 2002. Of that amount, \n     discretionary authorizations for military pay and allowances \n     would total $82.3 billion, while $0.1 billion would be \n     provided to cover mandatory costs. The authorized endstrength \n     represents a net increase of 3,152 servicemembers that would \n     boost costs for salaries and other expenses by $262 million \n     in the first year and about $600 million annually in \n     subsequent years, compared to the authorized strengths for \n     2001.\n       The bill also would authorize an endstrength of 8,000 in \n     2002 for the Coast Guard Reserve. This authorization would \n     cost about $83 million and would fall under budget function \n     400 (transportation).\n       Grade Structure. Sections 402, 415, and 502 would increase \n     the number of servicemembers in certain grades. Under section \n     402, the number of servicemembers in pay grade E-8 in \n     the Navy would increase. Section 415 would change the \n     grade structure of active-duty personnel in support of the \n     reserves. Section 502 would reduce the time-in-grade \n     required for promotion to captain in the Army, Air Force, \n     and Marine Corps, and lieutenant in the Navy when service \n     staffing needs require. These changes would not increase \n     the overall endstrength, but would result in more \n     promotions to these ranks. CBO estimates these provisions \n     would cost $20 million in 2002, rising to $55 million by \n     2006.\n       Compensation and Benefits. S. 1416 contains several \n     provisions that would affect military compensation and \n     benefits.\n       Military Pay Raises. Section 601 would raise basic pay by 5 \n     percent across-the-board and authorize additional targeted \n     pay raises, ranging from 1 percent to 10 percent, for \n     individuals with specific ranks and years of service at a \n     total cost of about $3.1 billion in 2002. Because the pay \n     raises would be above those projected under current law, CBO \n     estimates that the incremental costs associated with the \n     larger pay raise would be about $1 billion in 2002 and total \n     $7.1 billion over the 2002-2006 period.\n       Expiring Bonuses and Allowances. Several sections would \n     extend DoD's authority to pay certain bonuses and allowances \n     to current personnel. Under current law, most of these \n     authorities are scheduled to expire in December 2001, or \n     three months into fiscal year 2002. The bill would extend \n     these authorities through December 2002. CBO estimates that \n     the costs of these extensions would be as follows:\n       Payment of reenlistment bonuses for active-duty personnel \n     would cost $327 million in 2002 and $174 million in 2003; \n     enlistment bonuses for active-duty personnel would cost $91 \n     million in 2002 and $140 million in 2003.\n       Various bonuses for the Selected and Ready Reserve would \n     cost $64 million in 2002 and $73 million in 2003.\n       Special payments for aviators and nuclear-qualified \n     personnel would cost $52 million in 2002 and $55 million in \n     2003.\n       Retention bonuses for officers and enlisted members with \n     critical skills would cost $23 million in 2002 and $13 \n     million in 2003.\n       Authorities to make special payments to nurse officer \n     candidates, registered nurses, and nurse anesthetists would \n     cost $7 million in 2002 and $2 million in 2003.\n       Most of these changes would result in additional, smaller \n     costs in subsequent years because payments are made in \n     installments.\n       Housing Allowances. Section 605 would limit the out-of-\n     pocket cost of housing for servicemembers receiving basic \n     allowance for housing (BAH) within the United States. \n     Currently, DoD pays members BAH rates which cover about 85 \n     percent of the cost of adequate housing in the United States. \n     DoD plans to reduce the average out-of-pocket housing expense \n     for members by increasing BAH by about 4 percent annually, \n     until BAH covers the full cost of adequate housing by 2005, \n     adjusting the rate each January. Section 605 would accelerate \n     DoD's plan by limiting out-of-pocket costs to 7.5 percent in \n     2002 and eliminating average out-of-pocket costs in 2003, \n     adjusting the rates on January 1, 2002, and October 1, 2002, \n     respectively. CBO estimates that accelerating the increase in \n     BAH would cost $230 million in 2002 and $1.4 billion over the \n     2002-2006 period.\n       Travel and Transportation Allowances. Sections 631 through \n     634 would affect travel and transportation allowances by \n     expanding eligibility or increasing benefits. CBO estimates \n     that the cost of these changes would be as follows:\n       Expanding eligibility to receive the basic allowance for \n     housing (BAH) to junior enlisted members in grades E-3 and \n     below who are on leave or traveling between permanent duty \n     stations would cost $34 million in 2002 and $182 million over \n     the 2002-2006 period.\n\n[[Page S9785]]\n\n       Expanding eligibility for temporary subsistence allowance \n     to officers would cost $6 million in 2002 and $30 million \n     over the 2002-2006 period.\n       Authorizing dislocation allowances (DLA) for married \n     servicemembers without dependents where the spouse is a \n     member of the military, would cost $4 million in 2002. \n     Expanding eligibility to receive DLA to members with \n     dependents moving to their first duty station would cost $34 \n     million in 2002. Authorizing a $500 allowance to compensate \n     members who must move for government convenience (e.g., \n     because of housing privatization or renovation) would cost $6 \n     million in 2002. CBO estimates that these three provisions \n     would cost $256 million over the 2002-2006 period.\n       In total, these provisions affecting travel and \n     transportation allowances would cost $84 million in 2002 and \n     $468 million over the 2002-2006 period.\n       Increases in Incentive Pay and Bonuses. Sections 537, 616, \n     and 617 would expand eligibility for bonuses and increase pay \n     for personnel with special skills. Section 537 would expand \n     the population eligible to receive stipends under the Health \n     Professional Stipend Program to include medical and dental \n     school students. Assuming the number of participants would \n     increase gradually, at about 5 percent a year, CBO estimates \n     that implementing section 537 would cost less than $500,000 \n     in 2002 and $7 million over the 2002-2006 period.\n       Section 616 would raise the maximum pay rates for \n     servicemembers performing submarine duty. CBO estimates this \n     pay increase, effective October 1, 2002, would have no cost \n     in 2002, cost $21 million in 2003, and cost $111 million over \n     the 2003-2006 period.\n       Under section 617, certain officers and enlisted \n     servicemembers would become eligible to receive career sea \n     pay, regardless of their rank, time-in-service, or time-at-\n     sea. CBO estimates section 617 would cost $49 million in 2002 \n     and $245 million over the 2002-2006 period. Together, these \n     increases in incentive pay and bonuses would cost $49 million \n     in 2002 and $363 million over the 2002-2006 period.\n       New Bonuses. Sections 619 and 661 would authorize new \n     bonuses for commissioned officers and enlisted members with \n     critical skills. Section 619 would authorize a new officer \n     accession bonus for officers with critical skills. The bonus, \n     limited to $20,000, could be paid in a lump sum or \n     installments. This authority would expire on December 31, \n     2002. Based on information from DoD, CBO expects that the Air \n     Force and the Navy would use this authority starting in 2002, \n     and that the provision would cost $18 million in 2002 and $22 \n     million over the 2002-2006 period.\n       Under section 661, the Secretary of Defense could purchase \n     United States savings bonds for certain officers and enlisted \n     members with critical skills, who agree to extend their \n     period of service for a minimum of six years. The face value \n     of the bonds would range from $5,000 to $30,000, depending on \n     the members' years of service and prior receipt of this \n     benefit. Based on DoD's use of similar bonuses, CBO estimates \n     that section 661 would cost $20 million in 2002 and $104 \n     million over the 2002-2006 period.\n       Together, CBO estimates these new bonuses would cost $38 \n     million in 2002 and $126 million over the 2002-2006 period.\n       Subsistence Allowances. Section 604 would extend the \n     current authority to provide an additional subsistence \n     payment when rations-in-kind are not available. DoD plans to \n     prescribe this incremental subsistence allowance until \n     payments may be fully offset by the annual increases in basic \n     allowance for subsistence (BAS). CBO estimates that under \n     DoD's plan, additional subsistence payments would end in \n     2005. This section also would delay the termination of BAS \n     transition authority by three months, making termination \n     effective on January 1, 2002, and saving an estimated $15 \n     million in 2002. CBO estimates the combined effects of \n     implementing these provisions would cost $6 million in 2002 \n     and $32 million over the 2002-2006 period.\n       Uniform Allowances. Section 607 would loosen restrictions \n     on eligibility of officers to receive an additional $200 \n     clothing allowance by doubling the cap on the dollar amount a \n     member may receive in an initial clothing allowance over the \n     prior two years. Under current law, officers are ineligible \n     to receive the additional allowance if they have received \n     more than $200 in an initial clothing allowance during the \n     past two years. Raising the cap would increase the number \n     of officers eligible for the additional $200 allowance. \n     CBO estimates that implementing this provision would cost \n     $4 million in 2002 and $20 million over the 2002-2006 \n     period.\n       Commissary Benefits. Section 662 would allow new members of \n     the ready reserve to use the commissary benefit up to 24 \n     times a year. CBO estimates that implementing this section \n     would cost about $3 million in 2002 and $17 million over the \n     2002-2006 time period. Currently, new reservists do not \n     automatically qualify for commissary benefits, since they \n     have not had sufficient time to accumulate the necessary \n     annual training points. Under this section, new reservists \n     would be allowed to visit the commissary two times a month \n     until they meet the eligibility requirements which CBO \n     estimates to be about six months. Based on data from DoD, CBO \n     estimates that up to 70,000 reservists would become eligible \n     for this benefit each year. Allowing up to 70,000 more \n     customers to shop at commissaries would increase the \n     administrative costs associated with the commissary system, \n     which are paid out of appropriated funds and are estimated by \n     CBO to be about $8 per reservist per month.\n       Education and Training. Several sections of the bill would \n     affect education and training by expanding eligibility. CBO \n     estimates that the cost of these changes would be as follows:\n       Section 532 would remove the cap on the number of Junior \n     Reserve Officers' Training Corps (JROTC) units. DoD plans to \n     have 3,185 units in 2002, less than the current cap of 3,500 \n     units. Based on recent growth rates, CBO expects the number \n     of units would exceed 3,500 in 2005. CBO estimates \n     implementing section 532 would increase JROTC costs by $2 \n     million in 2005, rising to $5 million in 2006.\n       Section 536 would increase the number of international \n     students authorized to be admitted to the service academies \n     and would eliminate the restrictions on full tuition waivers. \n     CBO estimates that this section would cost $17 million over \n     the 2002-2006 period. Removing the restrictions on tuition \n     waivers would allow about 70 additional international \n     students to receive full tuition assistance each year. This \n     figure includes students admitted because of the higher \n     number of international slots made available under this \n     section, as well as slots that are currently receiving only \n     partial tuition assistance. The current cost of tuition for \n     an international student is about $62,000 a year, and the \n     annual cost of implementing this section would be about $4 \n     million.\n       Section 539 would provide DoD with the authority to allow \n     certain military personnel the option to transfer up to 18 \n     months of their entitlement to Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) \n     educational assistance to any combination of spouse and \n     children. To be eligible for this benefit, servicemembers \n     would have to have a critical skill or speciality, to have \n     served at least six years in the Armed Forces, and to \n     agree to serve an additional four or more years. Under \n     section 539, the service would be required to deposit an \n     amount equal to the net present value of the transferred \n     MGIB benefit into the Defense Education Trust Fund when a \n     servicemember was granted this benefit.\n       Under current law, participants in MGIB who serve at least \n     three years on active duty are entitled to receive $650 a \n     month if they are full-time students. CBO estimates that the \n     value of 18 months of MGIB benefit would be $11,700 in 2002. \n     In estimating the net present value of transferring a portion \n     of an individual's MGIB benefit, CBO assumes that one-third \n     of the benefit transfers would be to spouses and two-thirds \n     would be to children, that spouses would begin using the \n     benefit after two years and children after 16 years, and that \n     75 percent of the amount available for transfer would be \n     transferred and used. Using these assumptions, CBO estimates \n     that the cost to DoD of the transferred benefit would be an \n     average of $6,640 per person in 2002 and, because of the \n     automatic cost-of-living increases in the MGIB benefit, the \n     cost of the transferred benefit would increase to $7,365 in \n     2006.\n       CBO expects that DoD would use the authority in 2002 to \n     enhance retention in those areas where the maximum authorized \n     retention bonuses are currently being paid and that the \n     benefit would be offered to a larger population in subsequent \n     years. Based on information from DoD, about 20,300 \n     servicemembers, with six or more years of service, will \n     receive a selective re-enlistment bonus in 2002. Under \n     section 539, CBO assumes that about 3,000 of those would \n     receive the MGIB transfer benefit, and that this number would \n     increase to 4,400 by 2006. Thus, CBO estimates implementing \n     this provision would cost $20 million in 2002, and about $130 \n     million over the 2002-2006 period. (There would also be \n     direct spending costs of about $91 million over the 2004-2011 \n     period for outlays from the Defense Education Trust Fund as \n     the transferred MGIB benefit is used. CBO's estimate of those \n     outlays is discussed below under the heading of ``Direct \n     Spending.'')\n       CBO notes that, because this section offers a benefit to \n     the families of servicemembers, it is possible that the \n     demand for equal treatment across families might cause the \n     services to offer this benefit more widely than CBO has \n     estimated. If this benefit were offered to the entire \n     eligible population by 2011, CBO estimates the cost could be \n     more than $200 million over the 2002-2006 period.\n       Defense Health Program. Title VII contains several \n     provisions that would affect DoD health care and benefits. \n     Tricare is the name of DoD's health care program and the \n     spending under Tricare for beneficiaries under age 65 is \n     subject to appropriation. Spending under Tricare for \n     beneficiaries age 65 and over, often called Tricare for Life \n     (TFL), is subject to appropriation in 2002, but beginning in \n     2003 this spending will be paid out of a trust fund and \n     will not be subject to appropriation.\n       Payment Rates. Under current law, DoD has the regulatory \n     authority to set maximum allowable rates for medical services \n     to limit how much the Tricare program pays to health care \n     providers. Although DoD has set maximum rates for many \n     services, it has not yet set rates for hospital outpatient \n     diagnostic services, including clinical lab work and \n     radiation services, and long-term care services such as \n     skilled nursing and home health care services. As a result, \n     Tricare currently pays 75 percent of billed charges for these \n     services. DoD has started the regulatory process to establish \n     maximum rates\n\n[[Page S9786]]\n\n     for the services listed here and estimates it will take \n     upwards of two years to implement the changes by regulation.\n       Section 713 would require DoD to implement these rates by \n     October 1, 2001. Under this provision, DoD would be able to \n     lower its costs for both hospital outpatient and long-term \n     care services over the 2002-2003 period before the \n     regulations would have been implemented. These savings would \n     affect spending subject to appropriation as well as direct \n     spending for retirees of the other uniformed services in 2002 \n     and 2003 and the TFL trust fund that starts operation in \n     2003. CBO estimates that the total savings in spending \n     subject to appropriation for hospital outpatient and long-\n     term care services would be about $230 million over the 2002-\n     2003 period, assuming appropriations are reduced by the \n     estimated amounts. Section 713 would affect two different \n     programs: Tricare (under 65) and Tricare for Life. Those two \n     effects are discussed below.\n       By lowering payment rates for hospital outpatient \n     diagnostic services, DoD would be able to reduce spending on \n     its beneficiaries under age 65. (This portion of the \n     provision would not affect beneficiaries age 65 and over \n     because Medicare is first payer for these services and TFL \n     would only be responsible for the Medicare deductible and \n     copayments.) Using data from DoD, CBO estimates that making \n     payment rates for hospital outpatient diagnostic services \n     equivalent to Medicare rates would lower Tricare spending for \n     these services by about 30 percent. CBO estimates that \n     lowering the payment rates for hospital outpatient services \n     would save about $150 million over the 2002-2003 period, \n     assuming appropriations are reduced by the estimated amounts.\n       Under section 713, DoD also would lower the rates paid for \n     skilled nursing and home health care. This change would \n     primarily affect the TFL program since beneficiaries under \n     age 65 do not use much long-term care (DoD spent only $10 \n     million on long-term care for those under 65 in 2000). \n     Savings arise because Tricare's skilled nursing benefit has \n     no time limit while Medicare's benefit expires after 100 \n     days. The change in payment rates would have no impact on \n     Tricare for the first 100 days because Tricare would only be \n     liable for the deductibles and copayments charged under \n     Medicare. However, this provision would lower the amount that \n     Tricare would pay for those beneficiaries who need more than \n     100 days of skilled nursing care. Additionally, Tricare would \n     reduce its costs for providing skilled nursing and home \n     health care to those beneficiaries who use these services \n     without a prior hospital stay and are thus not Medicare-\n     eligible.\n       CBO estimates the savings to Tricare would initially be low \n     because the Tricare for Life program does not actually begin \n     operation until the start of fiscal year 2002 and CBO expects \n     that it will take about a year before all beneficiaries take \n     full advantage of the program. CBO estimates that lowering \n     payment rates for skilled nursing and home health care would \n     save DoD about $80 million in 2002, assuming appropriations \n     are reduced by the estimated amounts. (There also would be \n     direct spending savings of about $7 million over the 2002-\n     2003 period for the other uniformed services, and about $215 \n     million in 2003 for DoD when the trust fund begins operation. \n     CBO's estimates of those savings are discussed below under \n     the heading of ``Direct Spending.'')\n       Long-term Care Rules. Tricare does not currently require a \n     hospital stay prior to using long-term care services such as \n     skilled nursing and home health care. Requiring prior \n     hospitalizations would reduce the number of beneficiaries who \n     use long-term care. DoD has stated the regulatory process to \n     require such prior hospitalizations and expects to complete \n     the process by the start of fiscal year 2004.\n       Section 703 would require DoD to structure the Tricare \n     long-term care program to resemble Medicare, which requires \n     prior hospitalization before being eligible for skilled \n     nursing and home health care. Under section 703, DoD would be \n     required to implement this provision on October 1, 2001. \n     Requiring prior hospitalization under Tricare's long-term \n     care program would reduce the benefit for those beneficiaries \n     who would otherwise have used long-term care and would save \n     DoD the cost of providing this care over the 2002-2003 period \n     before DoD's new long-term care rules would have gone into \n     effect under DoD's plan. CBO estimates that some of those \n     beneficiaries would likely be able to get a prior \n     hospitalization before seeking care. In those instances, \n     Medicare would become the first payer while a few \n     beneficiaries would end up using Medicaid. Thus the savings \n     to DoD would be partially offset by increased costs to both \n     Medicare and Medicaid (discussed below).\n       Using data from DoD and the Agency for Healthcare Research \n     and Quality, CBO estimates that about 3,500 beneficiaries, \n     who would have used skilled nursing without a hospital stay, \n     would be affected by these new rules along with about 24,000 \n     beneficiaries who would have used home health care. CBO \n     estimates that some of those beneficiaries would pay for the \n     long-term care through Medicare or Medicaid, while others \n     would pay the costs themselves, use other insurance, or do \n     without the long-term care. For those beneficiaries who would \n     be covered by Medicare, DoD would not save the full cost \n     because Tricare would be liable for all deductibles and \n     copayments. Taking this information into account, CBO \n     estimates that, under section 703, Tricare spending would be \n     reduced by about $40 million in 2002, assuming appropriations \n     are reduced by the estimated amounts. (There would also be \n     direct spending savings of about $120 million for both the \n     trust fund and the other uniformed services in 2003 and \n     Medicare and Medicaid costs in both 2002 and 2003.)\n       Travel Reimbursement. Under current law, if the military \n     health care system refers an active-duty servicemember to a \n     new doctor or hospital greater than 100 miles from the \n     member's home or duty station, the servicemember is \n     reimbursed for the costs of traveling to the new doctor or \n     hospital. Section 712 would require the Secretary of Defense \n     to also reimburse reasonable travel expenses for a parent, \n     guardian, or responsible family member when the covered \n     beneficiary is a minor. Based on data provided by the \n     department, CBO estimates that this provision would apply \n     about 10,000 times each year and expects that reimbursements \n     would average about $500 per occurrence, although those costs \n     would rise with inflation. CBO estimates that implementing \n     this provision would cost about $5 million a year, assuming \n     appropriation of the necessary amounts.\n       Strategic Forces. Section 1011 would repeal section 1302 of \n     the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 \n     (Public Law 105-85), as amended by section 1501(a) of the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 \n     (Public Law 106-65), to allow DoD to initiate actions to \n     retire or dismantle the Peacekeeper intercontinental \n     ballistic missile force. CBO estimates that implementing this \n     provision would yield net savings of $650 million over the \n     2002-2006 period. Those savings would come from eliminating \n     the cost to operate the missiles starting immediately in \n     2002, eventually saving about $200 million a year. These \n     savings would be partially offset by the costs of removing \n     the missiles and warheads from the silos and the costs of \n     monitoring the silos. CBO assumes that the retirement process \n     would take about three years and that the missiles would be \n     completely retired by the end of 2004. CBO estimates missile \n     retirement costs would total about $100 million over the \n     2002-2004 period.\n       Voluntary Separation and Early Retirement Incentives. S. \n     1416 contains several provisions that would allow DoD and the \n     Department of Energy (DOE) to offer voluntary separation \n     incentives and voluntary early retirement to their civilian \n     employees. Taken together, CBO estimates implementing these \n     provisions would cost $145 million in 2003 and $6 million in \n     2004.\n       Section 1113 would provide DoD with the authority to offer \n     its civilian employees early retirement annuities as well as \n     separation incentive payments of up to $25,000 to employees \n     who voluntarily retire or resign in fiscal year 2003. The \n     authority under this section would be provided only during \n     fiscal year 2003 and would be limited to 4,000 employees. \n     Assuming that 4,000 DoD employees would participate in the \n     buyout program, CBO estimates that the buyout payments would \n     cost $100 million in 2003, assuming appropriation of the \n     estimated amounts. DoD also would be required to make a \n     payment to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund \n     (CSRDF) for every employee who takes a buyout. The \n     payments would equal 15 percent of the final basic pay of \n     each employee and come out of the agency's appropriated \n     funds. CBO estimates these payments would cost $29 million \n     in 2003. (CBO estimates that enacting this section also \n     would increase direct spending for federal retirement and \n     retiree health care benefits by a total of $46 million \n     over the 2003-2011 period. CBO's estimate of those outlays \n     is discussed below under the heading of ``Direct \n     Spending.'')\n       Section 3153 would provide the Department of Energy with \n     authority to offer payments of up to $25,000 to employees who \n     voluntarily retire or resign in calendar year 2003. Current \n     buyout authority for DOE is scheduled to expire on December \n     31, 2002. CBO assumes that about 600 DOE employees would \n     participate in the buyout program in calender year 2003. CBO \n     estimates that the cost of the buyout payments would total \n     $11 million in 2003 and $4 million in 2004. Like DoD, DOE \n     also would be required to make a payment to the CSRDF for \n     every employee who takes a buyout payment. CBO estimates \n     these payments would cost $5 million in 2003 and $2 million \n     in 2004. (CBO estimates that enacting this provision also \n     would increase direct spending for federal retirement and \n     retiree health care benefits by $16 million over the 2003-\n     2011 period. CBO's estimate of those outlays is discussed \n     below under the heading of ``Direct Spending.'')\n       Payment to World War II Slave Laborers. Section 1064 would \n     authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to pay a \n     gratuity of $20,000 to certain veterans and civilians who \n     were held as prisoners of war (POWs) or prisoners of Japan \n     during World War II and sent to Japan to perform slave labor. \n     Section 1064 also would authorize VA to pay this gratuity to \n     a surviving spouse if the claimant is deceased. During the \n     war, thousands of American POWs and civilians who were \n     employees of the United States (either directly or through \n     contractors) were forced to provide slave labor for Japanese \n     corporations. While the precise number of people who might \n     qualify for this gratuity is not known because many Japanese \n     documents are still unavailable for examination, at least one \n     historian has estimated that as many as 25,000 Americans were \n     forced to perform slave labor for about 40 different Japanese \n     companies, and thus would qualify for this gratuity.\n\n[[Page S9787]]\n\n       Based on historical and actuarial data about the veteran \n     and civilian populations, CBO estimates that about 6,000 \n     claims would be made for the $20,000 payment resulting in a \n     cost of about $118 million over the 2002-2006 period. (CBO \n     assumes that surviving spouses who have subsequently \n     remarried would not be eligible for this benefit, a standard \n     VA policy. Should this rule not apply for this benefit, CBO \n     estimates that an additional 2,000 claims would be made and \n     costs would increase to $161 million over the 2002-2006 \n     period.)\n       Purchase of Alternative Fuel Vehicles for DoD. Section 317 \n     would increase the number of alternative-fuel light duty \n     trucks purchased for DoD use above the levels set forth in \n     the Energy Policy Act of 1992. CBO estimates that \n     implementing this section would cost about $23 million in \n     fiscal year 2005 and $44 million over the 2005-2006 period.\n       Based on data from the General Services Administration \n     (GSA), CBO estimates that about 11,500 light duty trucks are \n     purchased annually for DoD use. CBO also estimates that to \n     meet the levels specified in section 317, GSA would need to \n     purchase about 7,700 alternative-fuel light duty trucks for \n     DoD in 2005 and every year thereafter. These vehicles would \n     be purchased in lieu of conventional gas or diesel vehicles \n     and do not include vehicles purchased to satisfy the terms of \n     the Energy Policy Act. Based on data provided by GSA, CBO \n     estimates that in 2005 the average alternative-fuel light \n     duty truck would cost about $3,000 more than a conventionally \n     powered vehicle. When this cost differential is multiplied by \n     the 7,700 trucks estimated to be purchased under this \n     section, CBO estimates that the net annual cost to the \n     department would be about $24 million a year. This cost would \n     be partially offset by savings in DoD's fuel purchases. CBO \n     estimates fuel savings would average about $2 million a year \n     over the 2005-2006 period or about $300 per vehicle per year.\n       Emergency Response Equipment. Section 1063 would allow DoD \n     to give state and local governments equipment needed for \n     responding to emergencies involving weapons of mass \n     destruction. Only states and local governments in possession \n     of this equipment prior to enactment of this bill would be \n     eligible for this transfer. CBO estimates that this provision \n     would have no budgetary impact because giving equipment to a \n     state or local government would not result in additional \n     spending or cause the federal government to forgo receipts, \n     nor would it affect DoD's authority under current law to lend \n     equipment to other governments. It is possible, however, that \n     giving this equipment away now could lead to DoD experiencing \n     shortages in equipment later, but CBO projects that any \n     future spending would occur after 2011.\n       Reduction in Authorizations of Appropriations for DoD \n     Management Efficiencies. Section 1002 would authorize a $1.6 \n     billion reduction to the amounts authorized for procurement, \n     research and development, and operation and maintenance in \n     the bill to reflect savings that should be achieved through \n     implementation of the provisions in title VIII and other \n     management efficiencies. Specifically, section 802 would set \n     savings goals for the procurement of services (other than \n     construction) within DoD. Section 802 specifies savings goals \n     beginning in fiscal year 2002 (3 percent) that increase \n     annually until 2011 when DoD would be expected to achieve a \n     10 percent cost savings in the procurement of services. CBO \n     has no basis for estimating the extent to which those savings \n     targets could be achieved. CBO notes that the department has \n     undertaken similar savings initiatives in the past and that \n     there is little evidence that these initiatives produced the \n     savings levels that were promised. If the total of the \n     authorization amounts in the bill are appropriated in 2002 \n     and the savings goals for next year are not achieved, then \n     the department would need to reduce funding elsewhere in \n     its budget to achieve the $1.6 billion reduction called \n     for by section 1002.\n       Direct Spending\n       The bill contains provisions that would reduce direct \n     spending, primarily through revision to payments rates for \n     certain defense health care program services and certain \n     asset sales from the National Defense Stockpile. The bill \n     also contains a few provisions with direct spending costs. On \n     balance, CBO estimates that enacting S. 1416 would result in \n     net savings in direct spending totaling $209 million over the \n     2002-2006 period (see Table 4).\n       Medical Care Trust Fund. Sections 703 and 713 would change \n     the way DoD administers long-term care and the way it pays \n     for that care under the Tricare for Life program. DoD has the \n     regulatory authority to make the changes that are directed in \n     these sections but thinks it will take upwards of two years \n     to implement the changes by regulation. Both sections would \n     require that the changes take effect on October 1, 2001. \n     Accordingly, DoD would save money over the roughly two-year \n     period before the regulations would have been implemented. \n     The Tricare for Life program will begin on October 1, 2001, \n     but the trust fund will not begin operation until one year \n     later, so only the savings to DoD in fiscal year 2003 would \n     be considered direct spending savings. There also would be \n     some minor savings in 2002 for retirees of the other \n     uniformed services.\n       Payment Rates. Under current regulations, the Tricare for \n     Life program will pay all deductibles and copayments \n     associated with Medicare's skilled nursing benefit and will \n     pay for skilled nursing care in excess of the Medicare \n     benefit (100 days). Additionally, Tricare will pay for \n     skilled nursing and home health care even if the beneficiary \n     does not have a prior hospital admission. (Tricare will pay \n     75 percent of billed charges, with no maximum charge, until \n     the beneficiary has paid $3,000 in out-of-pocket costs and \n     then will pay 100 percent of billed charges after that \n     point.) Section 713 would require DoD to set maximum \n     allowable charges for skilled nursing and home health care, \n     which would lower its cost of providing long-term care. CBO \n     estimates that implementing new charges based on Medicare \n     rates would lower what DoD pays for skilled nursing and home \n     health care by about 30 percent. Under section 713, CBO \n     estimates that direct spending from the trust fund for DoD \n     retirees would decline by about $215 million in 2003. (The \n     discretionary savings for 2002 are discussed earlier in the \n     ``Spending Subject to Appropriation'' section under the \n     heading of ``Defense Health Program.'')\n\n        TABLE 4.--ESTIMATED DIRECT SPENDING FROM HEALTH CARE AND OTHER PROVISIONS IN S. 1416, AS REPORTED\n                                [By fiscal year, outlays in millions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     2002         2003         2004         2005         2006\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                               CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING (EXCLUDING ASSET SALES)\n \nMedical Care Trust Fund:\n    Payment Rates..............................           -2         -220            0            0            0\n    Long-Term Care Rates.......................           21          -47            0            0            0\nVoluntary Separation and Early Retirement                  0           44           35            3           -6\n Incentives (DoD)..............................\nVoluntary Separation and Early Retirement                  0            6            7            2        (\\1\\)\n Incentives (DOE)..............................\nImprovements to Energy Employees Compensation             11           14           14           13           13\n Program.......................................\nTransferability of MGIB Education Benefits.....            0            0            2            5            8\nArmed Forces Retirement Home Fees..............            2            2            2            2            2\nLand Conveyance of Navy Property in Maine......            0            1            1            0            0\n                                                ----------------------------------------------------------------\n      Subtotal.................................           32         -200           61           25           17\n                                                ================================================================\n                                                 ASSET SALES \\2\\\n \nNational Defense Stockpile--New Sales..........           -2           -2           -2           -2           -2\nNational Defense Stockpile--Accelerated Cobalt           -20          -30          -14           -3           33\n Sales.........................................\nAuthority to Transfer Naval Vessels............          -18          -82            0            0            0\n                                                ----------------------------------------------------------------\n      Subtotal.................................          -40         -114          -16           -5           31\n                                                ================================================================\n                                        TOTAL CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING\n \nEstimated Outlays..............................           -8         -314           45           20           48\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Less than $500,000.\n\\2\\ Asset sale receipts are a credit against direct spending.\n\n       The Tricare for Life program also covers retired members of \n     the Coast Guard and retired uniformed members of the Public \n     Health Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration. Health care spending for these retirees is \n     considered direct spending. Under section 713, CBO estimates \n     that the other uniformed services would save about $2 million \n     in 2002 and $5 million in 2003.\n       Long-Term Care Rules. Under current law, Medicare will not \n     pay for skilled nursing and home health care unless the \n     beneficiary has been hospitalized before receiving that care. \n     Tricare, on the other hand, will pay for long-term care \n     without a prior hospitalization. For those cases, Tricare \n     becomes the primary insurance because Medicare will not pay. \n     Section 703 would require DoD to structure its long-term care \n     benefit to resemble Medicare's, which requires prior \n     hospitalization. Implementing this provision would lower \n     DoD's costs because fewer beneficiaries would be eligible for \n     skilled nursing and home health care. CBO estimates that \n     under section 703, direct spending from the\n\n[[Page S9788]]\n\n     trust fund would decline by about $120 million in 2003. CBO \n     also estimates that, under section 703, the other uniformed \n     services would save less than $500,000 in 2002 and about $1 \n     million in 2003. (There would also be discretionary savings \n     of about $40 million, as discussed earlier.)\n       The Tricare for Life program would be able to lower costs \n     by shifting many of those costs to their beneficiaries and \n     other government programs, primarily Medicare. CBO estimates \n     that about 50 percent of individuals who would have used \n     long-term care without a prior hospital stay would be able to \n     qualify under the Medicare rules (about 1,600 for skilled \n     nursing and about 12,000 for home health care). CBO further \n     estimates that the average cost of skilled nursing is about \n     $250 a day, and for home health care about $2,300 for 60 days \n     of care, which is the Medicare benefit. Accordingly, CBO \n     estimates that under section 703 direct spending for Medicare \n     benefits would increase by $20 million in 2002 and $70 \n     million in 2003. In addition, a few beneficiaries would \n     eventually become eligible for Medicaid, which also provides \n     long-term care benefits. CBO estimates that Medicaid costs \n     under section 703 would be $1 million in 2002 and $3 million \n     in 2003.\n       Voluntary Separation and Early Retirement Incentives. S. \n     1416 contains several provisions that would allow the DoD and \n     DOE to offer voluntary separation incentives and voluntary \n     early retirement to their civilian employees. Taken together, \n     CBO estimates enacting these provisions would increase direct \n     spending for federal retirement and retiree health care \n     benefits by $50 million in 2003 and $62 million over the \n     2003-2011 period.\n       Section 1113 would provide DoD with authority to offer its \n     civilian employees early retirement annuities as well as \n     separation incentive payments of up to $25,000 for employees \n     who voluntarily retire or resign in fiscal year 2003. The \n     authority under this section is provided only during fiscal \n     year 2003 and is limited to 4,000 employees. CBO estimates \n     that enacting section 1113 would increase direct spending for \n     federal retirement and retiree health care benefits by $44 \n     million in 2003 and $46 million over the 2003-2011 period.\n       Section 3153 would provide DOE with authority to offer \n     payments of up to $25,000 to employees who voluntarily retire \n     or resign in calendar year 2003. Current buyout authority for \n     DOE is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2002. CBO \n     estimates enacting section 3153 would increase direct \n     spending for federal retirement and retiree health care \n     benefits by $6 million in 2003 and $16 million during the \n     2003-2011 period.\n       DoD Retirement Spending. CBO assumes that 4,000 DoD \n     employees would participate in the buyout program in 2003. \n     CBO further assumes most workers who take a buyout would \n     begin collecting federal retirement benefits an average of \n     two years earlier than they would under current law. Inducing \n     some employees to retire earlier initially would result in \n     additional retirement benefits being paid from the Civil \n     Service Retirement and Disability Fund. In later years, \n     annual federal retirement outlays would be lower than under \n     current law because the employees who retire early receive \n     smaller annuity payments than if they had retired later. \n     Under section 1113, CBO estimates direct spending for \n     retirement benefits would increase by $38 million in 2003 and \n     $34 million over the 2003-2011 period. (The discretionary \n     costs for 2003 associated with the buyout payments were \n     discussed earlier in the ``Spending Subject to \n     Appropriation'' section under the heading of ``Voluntary \n     Separation and Early Retirement Incentives.'')\n       DoD Retiree Health Care Spending. Enacting section 1113 \n     also would increase direct spending on federal benefits for \n     retiree health care because many employees who accept the \n     buyouts would continue to be eligible for coverage under the \n     Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) program. The \n     government's share of the premium for these retirees--unlike \n     current employees--is mandatory spending. Because many of \n     those accepting the buyouts would convert from being an \n     employee to being a retiree earlier than under current law, \n     mandatory spending for FEHB premiums would increase. CBO \n     estimates these additional FEHB benefits would increase \n     direct spending by $6 million in 2003 and $12 million over \n     the 2003-2011 period.\n       DOE Retirement Spending. CBO assumes that about 600 DOE \n     employees would participate in the buyout program in calender \n     year 2003 and that most workers who take a buyout would begin \n     collecting federal retirement benefits an average of two \n     years earlier than they would under current law. Inducing \n     some employees to retire earlier initially would result in \n     additional retirement benefits being paid from the CSRDF. In \n     later years, annual federal retirement outlays would be lower \n     than under current law because the employees who retire early \n     receive smaller annuity payments than if they had retired \n     later. Under section 3153, CBO estimates direct spending for \n     retirement benefits would increase by $6 million in 2003 and \n     $15 million over the 2003-2011 period.\n       DOE Retiree Health Care Spending. Section 1113 also would \n     increase direct spending on federal retiree health benefits \n     because many employees who accept the buyouts would continue \n     to be eligible for coverage under the FEHB program. CBO \n     estimates these additional FEHB benefits would increase \n     direct spending by less than $500,000 in 2003 and by $1 \n     million in 2004.\n       Energy Employees Compensation. Section 3151 would make \n     technical changes to the Energy Employees Occupational \n     Illness Compensation Program (EEOICP) created by Public Law \n     106-398, which enacted the Floyd D. Spence National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001. CBO estimates that \n     enacting this provision would increase direct spending for \n     EEOICP by $11 million in 2002, $65 million over the 2002-2006 \n     period, and $108 million over the 2002-2011 period.\n       Section 3151 would establish more relaxed criteria for \n     determining whether a claimant suffers from chronic \n     silicosis. Specifically, this section would reduce the \n     required pneumoconiosis classification of a claimant to a \n     more lenient category. CBO estimates that relaxing this \n     criteria would allow about 550 new claimants, who were not \n     previously eligible, to receive compensation from EEOICP.\n       Under current law, successful claimants are entitled to a \n     one-time, lump sum payment of $150,000. CBO estimates that \n     relaxing the criteria for chronic silicosis would increase \n     direct spending for EEOICP by about $55 million over the \n     2002-2006 period, and $83 million over the 2002-2009 period. \n     CBO assumes these payments would be spread evenly throughout \n     the 2002-2009 period because screening programs are still \n     ongoing and will need several years to identify all potential \n     claimants.\n       Additionally, under current law, once a claim is approved \n     EEOICP becomes the primary payer for all medical bills \n     related to a claimant's condition. CBO estimates that the \n     average annual cost for treatment of chronic silicosis is \n     about $4,000. After considering mortality rates associated \n     with this disease, CBO estimates that medical costs paid \n     under EEOICP would increase direct spending by about $1 \n     million in 2002, $5 million over the 2002-2006 period, and \n     $21 million over the 2002-2011 period.\n       Section 3151 also would make other changes to EEOICP. The \n     age requirement for those claimants afflicted with leukemia \n     attributable to occupational exposure to radiation would be \n     lowered to include those whose initial exposure occurred \n     before age 21. CBO estimates that lowering the age \n     requirement would create a negligible number of additional \n     claims. Section 3151 would also clarify the rules for making \n     payments to survivors of former energy workers. Currently, \n     widows or children can claim the entire $150,000 payment in \n     the event that the former employees are deceased. \n     Grandparents, grandchildren, and siblings can claim the \n     payment if they can prove dependency on the deceased \n     employee. Section 3151 would allow these other relatives to \n     make such claims without proving dependency. CBO estimates \n     that only about 2.5 percent of all survivors would be someone \n     other than a widow or child, generating about 25 additional \n     claims. CBO estimates that the relaxed restrictions on \n     survivors would increase direct spending for EEOICP by less \n     than $500,000 in 2002, and $4 million over the 2002-2006 \n     period. CBO expects that almost all these additional claims \n     would be paid in the 2002-2006 period.\n       Transfer of Entitlement to MGIB Education Assistance. \n     Section 539 would provide DoD with the authority to allow \n     certain military personnel to transfer up to 18 months of \n     their entitlement to MGIB educational assistance to any \n     combination of spouse and children. To be eligible, \n     servicemembers would have to have a critical skill or \n     speciality, to have served at least six years in the Armed \n     Forces, and to agree to serve an additional four or more \n     years. Under section 539, an amount equal to the net present \n     value of the transferability option would be deposited into \n     the Defense Education Trust Fund when a service member was \n     granted this benefit, and would be paid to the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs as the benefit was used. The monies \n     deposited into the trust fund are subject to appropriation \n     and were discussed earlier under the heading of ``Spending \n     Subject to Appropriation.''\n       CBO expects that DoD would use the authority in 2002 to \n     enhance retention in those areas where the maximum authorized \n     retention bonuses are currently being paid and that the \n     benefit would be offered to a larger population in subsequent \n     years. Based on information from DoD, about 20,300 \n     servicemembers, with six or more years of service, will \n     receive a selective re-enlistment bonus in 2002. Under \n     section 539, CBO assumes that about 3,000 of those would \n     receive the MGIB transferability benefit, and that this \n     number would increase to 7,100 by 2011. CBO also assumes that \n     two-thirds of the transfers would be used by children. Since \n     most selective re-enlistment bonuses go to servicemembers \n     with 10 or fewer years of service, few of their children \n     would be of an age to use post-secondary education benefits \n     over the next 10 years. CBO's estimate of mandatory outlays \n     for this benefit, therefore, focuses on the use of the \n     remaining one-third of the transfers that would go to \n     spouses.\n       CBO expects the spouses would, on average, begin training \n     two years after the transferability option was granted, and \n     that they would train, on a part-time basis, over a period of \n     several years. Based on these assumptions, CBO estimates that \n     about 700 spouses would receive an average annual benefit of \n     $2,400 in 2004 and that, by 2011, almost 840 spouses would \n     receive an annual MGIB benefit of about $2,800. Thus, CBO \n     estimates that enacting this provision would increase direct \n     spending for MGIB education benefits by $2 million in 2004, \n     $15 million over the 2004-2006 period, and $91 million over \n     the 2004-2011 period.\n\n[[Page S9789]]\n\n       Changes to Armed Forces Retirement Home Fee Structure. \n     Section 1045 would authorize changes to the fees levied on \n     residents of the Armed Forces Retirement Home. These fees are \n     deposited into the Armed Forces Retirement Home Trust Fund, \n     which pays the operating and maintenance costs of the U.S. \n     Soldiers' and Airmen's Home in Washington, D.C., and the U.S. \n     Naval Home in Gulfport, Mississippi. The legislation would \n     change the percentage of monthly income charged to residents \n     of the two homes and alter the monthly caps on resident fees. \n     Section 1045 would also authorize the Chief Operating Officer \n     of the Armed Forces Retirement Home, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of Defense, to make additional changes in the \n     resident fees in accordance with the financial needs of the \n     Retirement Home. However, Armed Forces Retirement Home \n     staff have indicated that no significant changes in the \n     fee structure, other than those indicated by the bill, are \n     anticipated in the near future.\n       Information provided by the Armed Forces Retirement Home \n     indicates this provision would reduce fees for more than \n     1,200 residents, almost 80 percent of all residents. CBO \n     estimates the affected residents would see their fees reduced \n     by an average of about 15 percent in 2002. Therefore, CBO \n     estimates that section 1045 would reduce offsetting receipts \n     (a credit against direct spending) by $2 million in 2002 and \n     a total of $20 million over the 2002-2011 period.\n       Land Conveyances. Title XXVIII would authorize a variety of \n     property transactions involving both large and small parcels \n     of land.\n       Enacting this bill would result in direct spending by \n     authorizing a conveyance that would reduce offsetting \n     receipts collected by the federal government. Under section \n     2823, the Navy would be authorized to convey 485 acres of \n     property to the state of Maine or other governmental \n     jurisdictions. Under current law, however, the Navy will \n     declare that property excess to its needs and transfer it to \n     the General Services Administration for disposal. Under \n     normal procedures, GSA sells property not needed by other \n     federal agencies or by nonfederal entities in need of \n     property for public-use purposes such as parks or educational \n     facilities. Information from GSA indicates that portions of \n     the land will likely be sold under current law after the \n     entire parcel is screened for other uses in 2002. As a \n     result, CBO estimates that the conveyance in the bill would \n     result in forgone receipts totaling about $1 million in 2003 \n     and $1 million in 2004.\n       CBO estimates that other conveyances would not \n     significantly affect offsetting receipts because according to \n     DoD some of the properties have values of less than $500,000 \n     while others are not likely to be transferred to GSA for \n     disposal.\n       Concurrent Receipt. Upon passage of qualifying, offsetting \n     legislation, section 651 would allow total or partial \n     concurrent payment of retirement annuities together with \n     veterans' disability compensation to retirees from the \n     military, the Coast Guard, the Public Health Service, and the \n     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who have \n     service-connected disabilities. The provision also would \n     discontinue special compensation for certain uniformed \n     service retirees who are severely disabled.\n       Under current law, disabled veterans who are retired from \n     the uniformed services cannot receive both full retirement \n     annuities and disability compensation from the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs. Because of this prohibition on concurrent \n     receipt, such veterans forgo a portion of their retirement \n     annuity equal to the nontaxable veterans' benefit.\n       Section 651 would become effective only upon passage of \n     legislation that would fully offset its costs in each of the \n     first 10 fiscal years after passage of the offsetting \n     legislation. If qualifying, offsetting legislation were \n     enacted in 2001, CBO estimates that implementing this section \n     in 2002 would increase direct spending for retirement \n     payments and veterans' disability compensation by about $3 \n     billion in 2002, $17 billion over the 2002-2006 period, and \n     $41 billion over the 2002-2011 period. Because those effects \n     are contingent upon subsequent legislation, they are not \n     included in Table 4.\n       In addition, the military retirement system is financed in \n     part by an annual payment from appropriated funds to the \n     military retirement trust fund, based on an estimate of the \n     system's accruing liabilities. If section 651 were \n     implemented, the yearly contribution to the military \n     retirement trust fund (an outlay in budget function 050) \n     would increase to reflect the added liability from the \n     expected increase in annuities to future retirees. CBO \n     estimates that implementing this provision would increase \n     such payments by about $1 billion in 2002, and $6 billion \n     over the 2002-2006 period, assuming appropriation of the \n     necessary amounts.\n       Other Provisions. The following provisions would have an \n     insignificant budgetary impact on direct spending:\n       Section 314 would extend a pilot program for the sale of \n     air pollution emission reduction incentives. DoD would be \n     allowed to spend all receipts less than $500,000 on \n     environmental programs. Any receipts above $500,000 would go \n     to the Treasury.\n       Section 505 would allow officers whose mandatory retirement \n     has been deferred for medical reasons to further postpone \n     their retirement for up to 30 days.\n       Section 515 would allow disability retirement for \n     reservists whose disability was incurred or aggravated while \n     remaining overnight before inactive-duty training, or between \n     successive periods of such training. Currently, reservists \n     are only covered during overnight stays for such periods if \n     they are outside reasonable commuting distance of their \n     residences.\n       Section 552 would require the military to review the \n     records of certain Jewish American war veterans to determine \n     if any of these veterans should be awarded the Medal of \n     Honor. A $600 a month pension is available to living Medal of \n     Honor recipients. Based on similar reviews in the past, CBO \n     estimates that a small number of awards would be presented \n     (many posthumously), resulting in an increase in direct \n     spending of less than $500,000 a year.\n       Section 586 would allow DoD to accept voluntary legal \n     services as a way to provide legal help to DoD beneficiaries. \n     Although the service is voluntary, in the event of a legal \n     malpractice suit the government would be liable for any \n     claims against the legal volunteer. Payment of those \n     claims is considered direct spending, but CBO estimates \n     that this provision would cost less than $500,000 each \n     year.\n       Section 1111 would provide federal retirement credit to \n     certain former employees of Nonappropriated Fund \n     Instrumentalities (NAFI). Under current law, most workers who \n     transfer from NAFI employment to regular federal employment \n     may transfer any NAFI retirement service credits earned as \n     NAFI employees to the appropriate federal retirement program. \n     However, under certain circumstances, some former NAFI \n     employees have not been permitted to transfer NAFI retirement \n     credits to their federal service. Section 1111 would permit \n     many of these employees to use NAFI credits that otherwise \n     would not have been credited to their federal service in \n     order to qualify for retirement annuities under the Civil \n     Service Retirement System or the Federal Employees' \n     Retirement System.\n       Although workers would be able to use these credits in \n     order to qualify for federal retirement benefits earlier than \n     they would have otherwise, the provision mandates that \n     annuities be actuarially reduced. The actuarial reduction \n     would be calculated in such a way that the present value of a \n     retiree's benefits would be actuarially equivalent to the \n     value of the annuity that would have been provided without \n     the NAFI service credit. Information provided by the \n     Department of Defense and Office of Personal Management \n     indicates that only between 5 and 15 employees would claim \n     NAFI service credit under this provision in any given year. \n     Therefore, CBO estimates that Section 1111 would increase \n     direct spending for federal retirement benefits by less than \n     $500,000 a year.\n       Section 1112 would provide greater pension portability for \n     certain civilian employees who have been employed by a NAFI \n     employer and then become federal workers. The provision would \n     eliminate the requirement that workers who move between a \n     NAFI employer and the civil service must be fully vested in \n     order to transfer any accrued service credits from one \n     retirement system to another. According to the Department of \n     Defense, relatively few workers would be affected by this \n     provision; thus, CBO estimates that Section 1112 would \n     increase direct spending by less than $500,000 per year.\n       Section 2804 would expand DoD's ability to substitute in-\n     kind payments for cash from the lease of its property. The \n     provision would raise direct spending because it would lower \n     the amount of cash that DoD receives and deposits in the \n     Treasury as offsetting receipts. CBO estimates that the loss \n     of offsetting receipts would total less than $500,000 \n     annually.\n       Asset Sales\n       The bill would authorize various asset sales totaling $144 \n     million over the 2002-2006 period.\n       National Defense Stockpile. Section 3301 would authorize \n     DoD to sell certain materials contained in the National \n     Defense Stockpile that are obsolete or excess to stockpile \n     requirements. CBO estimates that DoD would be able to sell \n     the materials authorized for disposal and achieve receipts \n     totaling about $2 million in 2002, $10 million over the 2002-\n     2006 period, and $20 million over the 2002-2011 period.\n       Section 3302 would amend previous authorization bills \n     allowing managers of the stockpile to achieve near-term sales \n     in excess of the established interim targets. Because actual \n     sales have already exceeded those targets and because the \n     bill would not increase total program targets, CBO estimates \n     that enacting this provision would have no net budgetary \n     impact.\n       Section 3303 would accelerate by one year the disposal of \n     cobalt that was previously authorized for sale in the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 \n     (Public Law 105-85). The 1998 bill authorized the sale of all \n     remaining cobalt starting in 2003. The sales of cobalt \n     authorized for disposal under earlier bills are projected to \n     be completed this year. This bill would allow all remaining \n     cobalt to be sold starting in 2002, thus avoiding a one-year \n     gap in sales. CBO estimates that DoD would be able to \n     expedite that disposal without impacting current market \n     prices, resulting in more receipts from asset sales over the \n     next five years, but no net budgetary impact over the 2002-\n     2011 period.\n       Naval Vessels. Section 1216 would authorize the transfer of \n     13 naval vessels to foreign countries. It would authorize the \n     sale of six vessels; the other seven would be given away. \n     Information from DoD indicates that the\n\n[[Page S9790]]\n\n     asking price for the six ships would be approximately $175 \n     million. There is significant uncertainty as to whether all \n     six vessels would be sold and what the sale price might be. \n     Reflecting this uncertainty, CBO estimates that receipts from \n     these sales would total $18 million in 2002 and $82 million \n     in 2003.\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: The Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act sets up pay-as-you-go \n     procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or \n     receipts. The net changes in direct spending that are subject \n     to pay-as-you-go procedures are shown in Table 5. For the \n     purposes of enforcing pay-as-you-go procedures, only the \n     effects in the current year, the budget year, and the \n     succeeding four years are counted.\n\n                                          TABLE 5.

CBO has \n     determined that subtitle F (Uniformed Services Overseas \n     Voting) of title V is excluded because the provision would \n     enforce an individual's constitutional right to vote.\n       Section 1062 of the bill would prohibit possession of \n     significant former military equipment that has not been \n     demilitarized and require the Secretary of Defense to notify \n     the Attorney General of any known cases of persons holding \n     such equipment. The Attorney General would be given the \n     authority to require holders of such equipment either to \n     ensure that the equipment is demilitarized or returned to DoD \n     for demilitarization. In either case, those requirements \n     would be considered mandates. If the equipment is not \n     returned to DoD for demilitarization, the recipient must bear \n     the costs of demilitarizing the equipment. However, the \n     instances in which this provision would be used are expected \n     to be small; in most cases DoD demilitarizes equipment prior \n     to transferring ownership. Consequently, the costs of this \n     mandate would be minimal.\n       The remaining provisions of the bill either contain no \n     mandates or are excluded, as specified in UMRA, because they \n     would be necessary for national security. The bill also would \n     affect DoD's Tricare long-term care program by increasing \n     costs in state Medicaid programs by about $1 million in 2002 \n     and over $2 million in 2003. Such costs would not result from \n     mandates as defined by UMRA.\n       Previous CBO estimates: On August 22, 2001, CBO transmitted \n     a cost estimate for H.R. 2586, the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal year 2002, as ordered reported \n     by the House Committee on Armed Services on August 1, 2001. \n     The House bill also would authorize approximately $343 \n     billion in defense funding for fiscal year 2002. Both H.R. \n     2586 and S. 1416 would reduce direct spending over the \n     2002-2006 period, but the Senate bill contains less such \n     savings.\n       On May 22, 2001, CBO prepared cost estimates for S. 170 and \n     H.R. 303, identical bills titled the Retired Pay Restoration \n     Act of 2001. S. 170 and H.R. 303 would provide identical \n     benefits to those specified in Section 651 of S. 1416. If \n     section 651 is implemented by October 1, 2001, the costs \n     would be identical to those estimated for S. 170 and H.R. \n     303. As noted above, however, the provisions of section 651 \n     cannot be implemented until additional legislation is enacted \n     (to offset the section's costs). S. 170 and H.R. 303 do not \n     contain such a contingency requirement.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: Military Construction \n     and Other Defense: Kent Christensen (226-2840); Military and \n     Civilian Personnel: Dawn Regan (226-2840); Civilian \n     Retirement: Geoffrey Gerhardt (226-2820); Stockpile Sales and \n     Strategic Forces: Raymond Hall (226-2840); Military \n     Retirement: Sarah Jennings (226-2840); Health Programs: Sam \n     Papenfuss (226-2840); Multiyear Procurement: Raymond Hall \n     (226-2840); Naval Petroleum Reserves: Lisa Cash Driskill \n     (226-2860); Operations and Maintenance: Matthew A.

I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1595\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have amendment No. 1595 before the \nSenate. I am very distressed right now over some things that are \nhappening. I have an amendment before the Senate that will change our \nrelationship with and the understanding many people have concerning the \nisland of Vieques. The island of Vieques has been a live range for us \nfor over 50 years. It has had a very successful record. There has only \nbeen one civilian killed during that time period. Contrast that with a \nrange in the State of Oklahoma. In the State of Oklahoma we have had a \nlive range much longer than that, and we have lost eight civilians \nduring that period of time--because of purely political reasons and in \na lust for the votes and a mistaken notion that if you vote to close a \nrange as a result of people who are protesting, breaking the law, \npeople who are former terrorists, such as Mrs. Lebron, who led a bunch \nof terrorists into the House of Representatives many years ago and \nopened fire, wounding five of our Members of the House of \nRepresentatives, and others now protesting, trespassing on property \nthat we own, property owned by the U.S. Navy, where we train our troops \nfor their deployments from the east coast to the Persian Gulf.\n  When we deploy battle groups to the Persian Gulf, those troops are \ngoing to see combat. The chances are better than 50-50 they will see \ncombat. They have relied on this live-fire training for a long time. It \nhas always been there. It is the only place we can do that type of \ntraining. We have had all kinds of committees to find another place \nthat is just as good, but they cannot do it.\n  The reason they cannot find a new range is because there has to be \nunified training: a battle group of aircraft carriers and the F-14s, F-\n18s, using live munitions, bombing, and at the same time our Navy using \nlive munitions, and at the same time our Marine expeditionary units \ngoing in under that live fire.\n  For those of us in this room--and I do not know how many besides the \ntwo I am looking at have actually been in the service --there is a huge \ndifference between inert and live ammunition. I can remember when I was \nin basic training. It is easy to crawl under that barbed wire when it \nis not real bullets, but when it is real ammunition, that is different. \nThat is exactly what we have to have to train these people who are \ngoing off to the Persian Gulf.\n  We have been unable to do it because of these protests. This is the \nfirst time in the history of America we have allowed a bunch of illegal \nprotesters to change our policy. They will not be successful, but if \nthey were successful, think about our other ranges. I have talked to \nthe chiefs of every service. The Air Force is in desperate need of \nranges right now.\n  I have talked to people in Lawton, OK. There are 100,000 people who \nlive right next to a live range, and a few of them said: All you have \nto do is protest and they close the range?\n  There is a clear right and wrong. I have 2\\1/2\\ years of my life in \nthis issue. I have been around the world. I have looked at every \npossible area where we could have an alternative training source. Some \npeople say let us send the F-18s over there and let them go to England \nor some place and drop their loads. Let us train over here with live \nfire and let us let the marines train over in this area, and I was \nsuggesting at least that notion to some of the Navy pilots that were on \none of the--this is probably over a year ago--on one of the aircraft \ncarriers on which they were supposed to be training, and he said, well, \nwait a minute, that is like having the very best football players you \ncan have anyplace in the world; you have the best quarterback, the best \nhalfback, the best defense but they never scrimmage together. So what \nhappens on the day of the opening game? They lose it. They have to \ntrain together.\n  Now, people say you get the same training with inert. You do not get \nthe same training with inert, but when we allowed that bunch of illegal \ntrespassers to take us out of live fire and put us in inert, we lost \nfive American lives. Did we lose these lives because of that? Yes, we \ndid. They had to go over and they were trying to carry out an exercise \nin Kuwait. It did not work,\n\n[[Page S9791]]\n\nand six people died, five of whom were Americans.\n  I have the investigation. It shows clearly those individuals who were \nunable to have live fire training--they had inert training on Vieques \nbut not live fire training. There is a huge difference. Talk to anyone \nin the Navy who has to handle those live missiles. When they are \ndeploying them, when they are handling live ordnance, it is a big \ndifference from inert. Anyway, we have already lost that many, and I am \nhoping we will be able to resolve this problem.\n  Senator Corzine is going to offer an amendment if I bring up my \namendment. It is a second-degree amendment, and that amendment would \nhave the effect of killing what I am trying to do. That would make it \nso we would not have a range to practice at or to train on on these \ndeployments from the east coast. I have had to think long and hard \nabout this as to whether or not it is better not to have an amendment \nat all and resolve this problem in conference, or whether we go ahead \nand succumb to the second-degree amendment.\n  I say to Senator Corzine, I think the votes are there to pass his \namendment. If we did that, we would be closing the range and at the \nsame time we would be giving that responsibility to the President on a \nyear-by-year basis. If one stops and thinks about the 200-and-some \nranges we have, if the President had to go through and debate this \nevery year as to whether or not to allow that range to stay open as a \nlive range, he would not have time to do anything else. That would not \nwork.\n  Secondly, that puts politics right back in it. My amendment is a good \namendment. It said call off the referendum. We should never have had a \nreferendum. Then it says we will use the range we own--and at this very \ntime we are in the middle of war--to train our troops until such time \nas both the CNO of the Navy and the commandant of the Marine Corps \ncertify we do not need it. Those are military people. They are not \npolitical people.\n  I have this gnawing feeling that the way this is worded I would lose \nthat amendment, and rather than have the Corzine language in there, we \nare far better off not to have any language at all.\n  I regrettably say I think we will end up in the same situation as we \nwould be if we passed this amendment, or if we did not pass it or if we \njust left it like it is in conference.\n\n  As we speak, in Puerto Rico they are considering a resolution. That \nresolution says we, Puerto Ricans, as proud American citizens with the \nsame responsibilities as our brethren in the continental United States, \nhave the obligation of contributing to this fight, allowing and \nsupporting military training and exercises in the island municipality \nof Vieques.\n  This may not pass. It is being debated right now. But certainly there \nis a very large number of people saying--and that number is much larger \ntoday after September 11 than it was before--we are American citizens \nfirst. We have to train our people and we have to train them with \nquality training so they do not lose their lives when they get over to \nthe Persian Gulf.\n  That is my situation. That is the dilemma that we have right now.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, frankly, there is no Senator in this \nChamber, on either side of the aisle, who has worked more \nconscientiously on this extremely complex issue than our distinguished \ncolleague from Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe.\n  I had indicated to him I felt his amendment was one that certainly \nmerited my support, and my support remains. I wonder if we laid his \namendment aside, perhaps in further consultations we could come up with \nsome affirmation of a position that fostered, No. 1, the current \nobvious willingness among responsible people in Puerto Rico to \nrecognize the extenuating circumstances in which our American \nservicemen are now preparing to embark, as we speak, for various points \nworldwide in response to an issue taken by a very courageous and bold \nPresident of the United States.\n  I wonder if we could lay it aside, enabling the Senator from Oklahoma \nto counsel with our colleague from New Jersey in the hopes that perhaps \nhe could reach a position again that would foster the strengthening of \nthis opportunity to continue the use of this base as the Puerto Ricans \nat the present time are doing.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate that counsel, and I think it is very wise \ncounsel. If I could count the votes, and I knew I could defeat the \nCorzine amendment and have mine, I would do it, but I think we would be \nin far worse shape if we had that language.\n  For that reason, I am down to two choices: one to go ahead and \nwithdraw my amendment, and the other to lay it aside so we can talk to \nsee if something can happen. I think I will choose the latter and ask \nat this time to lay aside amendment No. 1595 for a period of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the chairman of the committee and I will \nconfer on what matter we next have at hand.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if we have any cleared amendments we can take up?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1677\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. On behalf of Senators Cleland and Hutchinson, I offer an \namendment which would give the Secretary of Defense direct hiring \nauthority for certain health care professionals, and I believe this \namendment has been cleared by the other side.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the amendment has been cleared.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for Mr. Cleland, for \n     himself, and Mr. Hutchinson, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1677.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To authorize the Secretary of Defense to exempt certain \n   health care professionals from examination for appointment in the \n                       competitive civil service)\n\n       On page 377, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1124.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S9792]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 1678\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the attention of \nour distinguished chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee an \nissue that we must consider as potential military action is taken to \naddress our national crisis. There are many aspects to consider in \ntaking care of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines who are sent \ninto harm's way. However, there is an immediate and critical area that \nmay not seem like a high priority in these times of deployment and \nmobilization of our armed forces, an area that in times of war becomes \nabsolutely necessary in preserving their well-being. I am speaking of \nmedical technology and research as it concerns the battlefield.\n  I have recently been made aware of two efforts that could \ndramatically improve the current medical challenges involved in blood \nand tissue preservation. These programs would aim to develop stable \nblood products, organs, and wound-repairing tissues that could enhance \nhuman survivability under conditions of trauma, shock, anoxia and other \nextreme conditions that are common in combat.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from Maine is quite correct in her observation \nand assessment that medical treatment is a part of war that sometimes \nmay be taken for granted, and that the medical care of our service men \nand women is an area of defense that should not be overlooked. \nParticularly in the area of military combat casualty care, the \nDepartment must consider any initiative that could have benefits for \nsaving the lives of men and women whose service to our nation puts them \nat risk of severe injury.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I have recently been briefed on these two medical \nresearch efforts and would like to offer a couple of comments on their \npotential impact in combat casualty care. They are research initiatives \nby our research laboratories and universities across the country, which \ncould provide a unique capability to develop new tissue products that \nare vitally important for the military. Recent U.S. military actions \nhave resulted in stationing troops in harsh climates, from Kuwait to \nBosnia to Saudi Arabia. Future locations and missions will require new \ncapabilities in combat casualty care, and these capabilities would \ninclude stable blood products, organs, and wound repairing tissues that \nwill enhance human survivability under conditions of trauma, shock, \nanoxia and other extreme conditions, including extreme environment. \nThese projects aim to develop tissue with a long shelf life that are \nnecessary for combat casualty care. Additionally, the research would \nserve as a large-scale source of murine models for the scientific \ncommunity to utilize mouse genetics in understanding how the products \nof multiple genes interact to develop and maintain entire physiological \nsystems. I would strongly urge the Department to investigate research \nthat would permit the long-term storage of blood cells and tissues in \ndeployed environments.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the distinguished Senator from Maine for \nhighlighting the critical nature of this research, and for voicing her \nsupport for investments in the well-being of a most precious national \nasset--our men and women in uniform, who will fight and risk their \nlives for each of us.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this authorizes the Secretary of Defense \nto waive the prohibition against requiring statements of \nnonavailability to authorized health care services other than mental \nhealth services of beneficiaries receiving care under TRICARE standard. \nIt is my understanding this amendment is cleared on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1678) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1679\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Feingold, I offer an \namendment which requires the Under Secretary of Defense to provide a \nreport on certain matters pertaining to the V-22 Osprey Program before \nthe aircraft is returned to flying status, and I send the amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I see colleagues coming to the Chamber. \nI will not be lengthy. I surmise we may be debating an amendment. But \nuntil we do, let me just take this time to present kind of a bit of an \noverview--I see the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, perhaps we can just go into morning \nbusiness for a period of time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is fine. I appreciate that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we go into morning business for 10 \nminutes so that I may speak.\n  Mr. WARNER. I reserve the right to object.\n  Can we stipulate some time period?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Wellstone are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have talked to the managers of the bill \nabout two amendments I intend to offer. I would like to comment about \nthese matters now and will be glad to get into a greater discussion \nabout them later. I believe that these amendments address issues that \nare extremely important and directly relate to our fighting men and \nwomen and those service members who have disabled children.\n  First, I want to thank the committee, especially Senators Levin and \nWarner, for taking the first step toward ensuring that disabled \nfamilies of our active-duty military have greater access to the health \ncare they deserve. The first amendment I intend to offer is another \nstep toward achieving that goal.\n  Early last year, a young man in the U.S. Air Force, SGT Faye, drove \nover 12 hours with his wife and disabled 4-year-old daughter to testify \nhow important it was to make Medicaid more accessible. Why? The \nmilitary health care system does not provide for his daughter's needs, \nand Medicaid does.\n  Unfortunately, in order to continue her eligibility for Medicaid, \nthis service member could not accept a promotion to the next rank. No \nmember of the Armed Forces who risks their life for our country should \never be put in a position of having to decide between health care for a \ndisabled child and doing their job for our country, nor should these \nfamilies have to rely on Medicaid to find health care that works.\n  My amendment corrects the injustices these families have suffered by \ngiving these families in TRICARE what they effectively receive in \nMedicaid. It allows disabled dependents to receive the health care that \nis necessary to maintain their function and prevent further \ndeterioration of their disability, provides community-based services so \ndisabled dependents can stay at home with their families and live in \ntheir communities rather than being institutionalized. This is no \ndifferent from what Medicaid provides. The amendment includes respite \ncare and hearing aids which can help a disabled person stay or become \nindependent. It includes more flexible mental health services, and also \ngives the physician the final decision regarding what health care \nservices are necessary.\n  These guarantees are effectively what are in existence under the \nMedicaid program. But what harmed SGT Faye was that in order to be able \nto get these kinds of services for his 4-year-old child, he had to \ndecline his promotion to the next rank a promotion that would have \nraised his family's income above the Medicaid threshold. SGT Faye had \noutstanding recommendations and the Air Force wanted to promote him, \nbut he couldn't accept it because it meant giving up the health care \nhis daughter needed.\n  Right now, the President is activating many servicemen and women who \nface these very same circumstances. We clearly know that these \nservicemen and women should not have to worry about finding adequate \nhealth care for their children, especially when their children have a \ndisability. Half of all the members of the Armed Forces are married, \nmore than half have children, and many of those children are under 10 \nyears of age. As in any population, a number of those children are \nspecial needs children and require the services I have outlined.\n  This amendment ensures that servicemen and women don't have to go to \nMedicaid to get the health care their children need.\n  We know how far we have come, over many decades, to guarantee that \ndisabled people have the health care and independence they need to be \nparticipating members of their communities. Our military families with \ndisabled dependents should not be denied that opportunity. These \nimprovements to TRICARE are some of the most significant steps we can \ntake in this Congress. They offer a new and better life to large \nnumbers of military families. I commend Senator Cleland, who did a \ngreat deal of work in this area and provided great leadership in the \ndevelopment of a number of different programs to reach out to children \nwith special needs.\n\n  This amendment gives servicemen and women and their disabled family \nmembers the health care they need.\n  My other amendment also addresses the needs of our military families, \nbut from a different angle. It relates to the needs of the families of \nservicemen and women who will be impacted by the call up of the \nNational Guard and Reserves components. As we examine the immediate and \nlong-term needs of our military, we cannot forget the families, \nespecially the children, whose daily lives and routines are disrupted \nby their parents' commitments to preserving America's freedoms. \nHusbands and wives, parents and children, will be separated more \nfrequently and for longer periods during the coming months and years. \nThese separations will be filled with uncertainty about the safety of \ntheir loved ones, and the families will be profoundly affected.\n  Today, over half of the active-duty members are married, almost half \nhave children. There are 2 million family members of active-duty \npersonnel and 900,000 family members of those in the Reserve. There are \nnearly half a million children under the age of 6 of active-duty \nmembers, and a majority need some type of child care.\n  Families of reservists will also be affected because they often lack \nthe support provided by military installations. Reserve members are \nlocated in more than 4,400 communities nationwide. More than half of \nthem live at least 75 miles from a military installation. Support is \nespecially critical to provide needed assistance to these \ngeographically isolated families.\n  This amendment uses the lessons learned from Desert Storm and Bosnia\n\n[[Page S9794]]\n\nto authorize additional wartime support for military families. Included \nare provisions for child care and youth programs and family support \nprograms, such as parent education, to help families cope with the \nstress of deployments. It also provides assistance for Reserve families \ngeographically separated from military installations, as well as \nsupport for security for DOD schools and children's facilities in areas \nof high risk for terrorist attacks.\n  We have a number of children attending schools that are off base that \ncome to mind immediately. In Turkey, children of U.S. service members \nride in buses through areas which could put these children at risk \nshould there be any deterioration in the security conditions we are \nfacing throughout the world. This amendment would also provide \nadditional resources for protecting these children in overseas schools.\n  Many husbands and wives share child care responsibilities. When a \nservice member deploys, the burden is left to one spouse, and in some \ncases a guardian. The need for child care is greater. If a spouse works \nirregular hours, such as nights or weekends, the challenge is even more \ndifficult. In many instances, the base operating hours are extended and \nlonger shifts are required. Additional operating funds are needed for \nthe non-traditional care in centers and family child care homes.\n  Guard and Reserve families do not typically live close to the \nmilitary bases where they can obtain military child care. We should do \nall we can to offer these families the same assistance with child care \nthat we are offering active-duty personnel on their bases. We can do so \nthrough a cooperative agreement with The National Resource and Referral \nnetworks. Modeled on a project called ``AmeriCorps Care'' established \nby the National Service Corporation. Child care assistance can be \nprovided on the same sliding fee scale available to military families \non base. This step will prevent financial hardships for many young \nreservists called to active duty.\n  With parents not available, youth, especially young teens, are \nstranded, with no place to go after school or no way to get to after \nschool activities. Families not located close to installations find \nchild care problems after school. Youth are often left home alone after \nschool. During Desert Storm, to help give parents peace of mind that \nchildren were engaged in positive after school activities, \ntransportation and activities were provided free to over 17,500 Guard \nand Reserve families through a partnership between DOD and the Boys and \nGirls Clubs of America. The youths participated in after school \nprograms, sports and recreational activities, and received help with \nhomework. We ought to be prepared to provide those kinds of services to \nthese Guard and Reserve families. This is what was done during the \nPersian Gulf War. It worked well then and was good for the morale of \nthe Reserve and the Guard who were serving overseas.\n  My amendment doesn't reinvent the wheel. We had many of these \nprograms in place before. We simply need to reauthorize them for \ntoday's deployments.\n  During Desert Storm, additional aid funds were provided to civilian \ncommunity schools when large units were deployed. We also learned \nduring Desert Storm that there is a need for counselors for family \nsupport activities. This amendment authorizes the additional funds for \ncounselors.\n  There are serious school security issues on our overseas bases, \nincluding safety on school buses in foreign countries. Approximately 40 \npercent of military families living overseas live off their bases. \nTheir children are bused to schools, either on the base, or, in many \ncases, to schools in unprotected foreign communities that are potential \ntargets for terrorist attacks. We also need to fund bus safety \npersonnel and equipment for school buses to ensure the personnel are \nadequately trained to identify risk.\n  Military families face an extended period of anxiety and sacrifice \nfor our Nation. It is our responsibility to ensure they have the \nsupport they need in the face of this extreme danger and sacrifice.\n  I urge the Senate, when we have the opportunity, to support my \namendments.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1679\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Santorum, I offer an \namendment which would authorize an additional $1 million for the Air \nForce for research, development, test and evaluation for the Agile \nCombat Support, Integrated Medical Information Technology System \nInitiative, offset by a reduction of $1 million in the bill from Navy \nRDT funds provided for Modular Helmet Development.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today not to offer an amendment but, \nfirst, to express my thanks and appreciation to the managers of the \nbill for responding to a concern that I raised. I have spoken with \nChairman Levin, and his staff, Senator Warner, and his staff, as well \nas Chairman Inouye and Senator Stevens, and the Defense Department \nabout the concern I have over our industrial base for the production of \ntactical fighters.\n  It seems to me that the tragedy of September 11 brings with it the \nrealization that we are in a long contest with terrorists. We are in a \nlong, drawn out contest that may require us to provide all kinds of \nresponses. The tactical aircraft we are planning to build in the future \nis just one of the tactical aircraft that we might have to provide in \nyears beyond.\n  So it is my concern that when the competition for the joint strike \nfighter--the JSF--is over, that if one of the two contestants--Boeing \nand Lockheed Martin are competing--is selected, if there is not \nproduction and an active role for the second one, we would be left with \nonly one major producer of tactical aircraft.\n  It is for that reason I have raised the concern that, either before \nor after the contract is let, the Defense Department and both \ncontractors must be willing to agree that production will go on in both \nfacilities.\n  Boeing and Lockheed Martin are this country's sole remaining tactical \naircraft manufacturers. Whoever wins the contract will have a long-term \nfoothold in tactical aircraft manufacturing due to the very large \nnumber of aircraft expected to be built for both here at home and the \noverseas market.\n  If nothing else happens, whoever loses out of the jet fighter \nbusiness, in about 10 years, when our current production of F-22s, F-\n16s, and FA-18s will have reached the end of their production runs, \nthere will be nothing left for them to do. That would leave us with \njust one military house capable of providing the full line of services \nnecessary to build whatever aircraft will follow. And the JSF, while it \nis the state of the art now, will not be the state of the art 10, 20, \n30 years from now.\n  The competitiveness exhibited by Boeing and Lockheed Martin in the \nJSF competition has been good for the U.S. and for our military forces. \nWithout it, we would not now be looking at two sets of prototypes that, \nby all independent accounts, meet and exceed the criteria set by the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  My concern is what happens on the next complex tactical aircraft \nprogram we build. I am a big fan of Boeing; I am a big fan of Lockheed \nMartin--the two finest producers in the world. One of them happens to \nbe located in my State; one of them happens to be located in the \nPresident's State. Both companies have excellent design and \nmanufacturing teams. And without them we would not now be fielding the \nbest military aircraft in the world. But I am an even bigger fan of \nhaving them both in the business of making tactical aircraft with \nconcomitant design, engineering, manufacturing, and support services.\n  With only one domestic military tactical aircraft producer, we would \nseriously cripple our ability to field state-of-the-art tactical \naircraft in the future, as any serious competition would be eliminated. \nAnd as is the case in so many other areas, competition is essential to \nthe health of our tactical aircraft industry.\n\n  We do not have to look far to see examples of how we can ensure a \nrobust split production program. The two primary competitors for JSF--\nLockheed Martin and Boeing--currently share production of the F-22 \nRaptor. Boeing has a one-third share and Lockheed Martin a two-thirds \nshare of the program. Supporting split production would ensure a \nminimum of two primary contractors in the tactical fighter industrial \nbase.\n  An issue associated with split production is second sourcing. That \nhas been productive, and it has been a prudent working theory in the \nyears past. It still is practiced effectively in many areas.\n  During the defense buildup period, the Department of Defense and \nCongress worked diligently to increase the amount of competition in the \ndevelopment of major defense systems. In the defense aerospace \nindustry, during those years, there were five primary companies capable \nof developing and producing fighter weapons systems.\n  The benefits of competition were well understood in commerce at large \nbut difficult to establish in the military. So emphasis in some \nprograms shifted to second sourcing. The production piece of weapons \nsystems programs was divided in two. A single design was produced. The \nGovernment financed creation of both production lines. The firms \ncompeted for the largest share of the production run each year, but \nboth remained in production.\n  This worked to keep costs under control for large volume purchases \nbecause each firm saw the potential for decent earnings by investing in \ncost reduction programs to remain competitive. If one producer let its \ncosts get out of control, well, then, the purchaser--the Department of \nDefense--could go to the more efficient producer.\n  The same logic was successful in setting up second sourcing for \npropulsion systems for the joint strike fighter. And my question is, If \nthe logic is compelling enough to institutionalize competitive \ncompetition in second sourcing for engine competition, why wouldn't the \nsame logic work for the prime aircraft manufacturing companies, \nespecially since there are only two left in the industry?\n  The second sourcing expands the mobilization base as well as \nproducing an increased surge capability. And it encourages higher \nproduct quality and reliability at a competitive cost. And that helps \nthe Government in contract negotiations.\n  One other example I would cite is the joint cruise missile project, \nsecond sourcing of the Tomahawk missile in 1982. Every review of that \neffort demonstrated abundant cost savings to the Government, and a \nsteady production of missiles which have been used for years by our \nArmed Forces.\n  The success of the program resulted from at least two factors: One, \nthe cost for entry for a second source was low, given the large \nprojected production run, and, two, the annual production quantities \nwere large enough to absorb direct and indirect manufacturing costs.\n  The Tomahawk experience is directly applicable to the current JSF \nProgram because we have a large projected number of aircraft deliveries \nspread over many years, for both the armed services--all branches--and \nthose of our allies, and gives us an opportunity to retain the benefits \nof second sourcing.\n  It worked for engines, and it worked for prime aircraft developers \nand manufacturers, while preserving the domestic industrial base. \nHowever, second sourcing alone does not ensure the sustainment of full \ndesign and development capability.\n  I think it would also be unwise for the country to have only one \ncompany capable of designing an appropriate fighter aircraft. I hope, \nas we move forward, we will continue to utilize the design and \ndevelopment capacity of both of the manufacturers.\n  Despite the fact that there may be some additional costs for having \ntwo production lines--some say costs may be a half billion to a billion \ndollars--when you are really talking about a couple of hundred billion \ndollars, a multiyear program, it seems to me the protection of the \nsearch capacity, production protection of a second major source, and \nthe protection of competition are well worth the price. That is why I \nhave been arguing that we must maintain two tactical aircraft \nproviders.\n  We cannot prevent the pendulum from swinging radically in the \nopposite direction without maintaining split production. The recent \nterrorist attack teaches us that if we skimp on defense, we will pay \nfor it. Maintaining a strong defensive posture is not done on the \ncheap, unless we are willing to expose our national security and \nhomeland security.\n  For this reason, I have discussed at length with my colleagues, with \nthe\n\n[[Page S9797]]\n\nmanagers of this bill, with the chairman and ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee, as well as the Department of Defense, the \nneed to continue to keep two tactical aircraft fighters in production. \nBased on the discussions I have had and the understanding that has been \ndeveloped, I believe now that we are in a position where we will not \nsee one company alone winning the competition and taking over the \nentire tactical aircraft production in the United States. I think that \nwould be a significant mistake for the Nation, and it would not serve \nour military well because we would not ensure that competition to \nprovide not only this airplane and the most economical and highest \nquality product available but future design and manufacture of aircraft \nto follow on.\n  So while we had discussed the possibility of offering an amendment, I \nbelieve the position is well understood. And from the conversations I \nhave had, I believe there will be efficient steps taken to ensure that \nwe do maintain two tactical aircraft producers. If we don't move down \nthat path, then I will be back on the appropriate measure, whether it \nis on an authorization or an appropriations bill, to ensure that we do \nhave two strong tactical aircraft manufacturers in this country.\n  Mr. President, I thank the managers and the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, at this time, I withdraw my amendment No. \n1595 from consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I express my gratitude, and I understand \nthe differences of opinion we have regarding this issue. I think we now \nhave an opportunity to have a good discussion on this issue in \nconference committee. In that vein, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record the amendment I would have proposed.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert in lieu thereof \n     the following:\n\n     SEC. 1066. CLOSURE OF VIEQUES NOVEL TRAINING RANGE.\n\n       (a) Section 1505 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 is amended by adding \n     at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(e) National Emergency.--\n       ``(1) Extension of Deadline.--The President may extend the \n     May 1, 2003 deadline for the termination of operations on the \n     island of Vieques established in Subsection (b)(1) for a \n     period of one year (and may renew such extension on an annual \n     basis), provided that--\n       ``(A) The President has declared a national emergency, and \n     such declaration remains in effect; and\n       ``(B) The President determines that, in light of such \n     national emergency, the actions required by subsections (b), \n     (c) and (d) would be inconsistent with the national security \n     interest of the United States.\n       ``(2) Effect of Extension.--An extension of the deadline \n     pursuant to paragraph (1) shall suspend the requirements of \n     subsections (b), (c) and (d) for the duration of the \n     extension.''\n       (b) Subsection (a) of Section 1505 of the Floyd D. Spence \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 is \n     repealed and subsections (b) through (e) are redesignated as \n     subsections (a) through (d) respectively.\n       (c) Section 1503 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 is repealed.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, before I discuss the provisions of this \namendment, let me make something clear. I am very sensitive--painfully \nand personally so--of the human tragedy and national emergency created \nby the cowardly attacks of the terrorists on our nation on September \n11. Just as much as my colleagues, I stand united with our President, \nour military personnel, and the people of America in accepting, as \nPresident Bush put it, our ``mission and moment'' to end this scourge \nof terrorism.\n  But just as so many of America's leaders have implored the nation to \nbe measured and thoughtful in our actions in the wake of this tragedy, \nand just as President Bush has asked that Americans go on about their \nlives, so too should the workings of America's democracy. That's why I \nbelieve it would be a a mistake to approve the amendment by the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, which represents a significant change in direction from \nthe policies formulated by both Presidents Bush and Clinton, while \nfrankly undermining the President's authority as commander in chief. \nWhy should the Chief of Naval Operations, and the commandant of the \nMarine Corps, be given the authority to make decisions that go well \nbeyond military considerations? In my view, full access given the \nextended public debate and deep concerns, surrounding this Vieques \nfacility this decision rightfully rests, as it did before September 11, \nwith the President of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I believe, in the long run, we should respect the \nviews of the people of Puerto Rico and Vieques. Their voice has been \nclear on this issue, certainly before the current circumstances. Just a \nfew months ago, more than 70 percent of those living in Vieques voted \nto suspend operations and there was a broad element of support for that \nview throughout Puerto Rico's leadership and public.\n  At the same time, I understand and am sympathetic to the concerns of \nmany of my colleagues about the need for combined Navy and Marine \namphibious training in this time of national emergency. But, as \nPresidents Clinton and Bush both have said, in the long-term, we should \nrespect the will of the people. And, in my view, while there is \njustification for changing the timing of implementation of current \npolicies given the current circumstances, we should return to agreed \nupon policy as soon as practical. Any exceptions to the agreed upon \npolicy should be at the judgment of the president of the United States-\nour commander in chief.\n  And that, Mr. President, is exactly what this amendment does. It \nwould provide for the termination of operations on Vieques by May 1, \n2003, subject to the national security judgment of the President. In \nfact, my amendment would codify the policy already established by \nPresident Bush. However, in an effort to give the President necessary \nflexibility in these extraordinary times, the amendment would allow the \nPresident to continue operations on Vieques for one-year periods in \ntimes of national emergency beyond the May 1, 2003 deadline, if the \nPresident determines, in light of the emergency, that the termination \nof operations would be inconsistent with national security interests.\n  I also would note, that my amendment eliminates the requirement for a \nsecond referendum required by last year's DOD authorization. Finally \nMr. President this is a compromise endorsed by the Resident \nCommissioner of Puerto Rico, Congressman Anibal Acevedo Vila and \nsupported by the National Puerto Rican coalition. After all, there \nalready has been a referendum with the results showing that 70 percent \nof Vieques residents favor closure.\n  Mr. President, I think that's a reasonable compromise that makes \ncommonsense. And I hope it can win the support of my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I've heard some people say that the Navy bombings in \nVieques are merely a political issue. But to the 9,000 residents of \nVieques who live immediately adjacent to the field of fire and have \nsuffered with constant and severe noise, and whose environment and \nhealth have been threatened by related pollutants, the bombing of \nVieques is a humanitarian issue. And to all the people of Puerto Rico, \nit's an issue about respect and democracy.\n  I have personally visited Vieques and seen the disastrous impact that \nconstant bombing has had on the island's natural resources and \nenvironment, on its resident's health and on its economy. The people of \nPuerto Rico are Americans. They raise our flag. They have fought \nvaliantly in our wars. Many hundreds--maybe as many as 800--died on \nSeptember 11th in the World Trade Center tragedy. Puerto Ricans deserve \nto be treated justly.\n  Both President Clinton and President Bush have recognized this \nreality in formulating their responses to this difficult issue.\n  Mr. President, like all Americans, I believe that the people of \nPuerto Rico have shown throughout history that they are willing to make \nsacrifices if asked to protect America. But we shouldn't use the \ncurrent circumstances to justify continued bombing over some \nindeterminate period. We should and must find an alternative training \nsite and more on as soon as possible.\n\n[[Page S9798]]\n\n  So, in summary, Mr. President, this amendment recognizes our current \nmilitary needs and provides the President flexibility to deal with \nAmerica's war on terrorism. But, over time, this action would respect \nthe will of the people of Puerto Rico, and end the Vieques debate on \nthe bombings.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, in consultation with our colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle, I feel the need to propound another unanimous \nconsent request. I know there have been requests made throughout this \ndebate regarding the list of finite amendments.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list that I will send to the desk at \na later time tonight be the only first-degree amendments remaining in \norder to S. 1438, the Department of Defense authorization bill; that \nthese amendments be subject to relevant second-degree amendments; that \nupon disposition of all the amendments, the bill be read the third time \nand the Senate vote on passage of the bill with no intervening action \nor debate.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, reserving the right to object, most \nreadily, I say to our leader that I have to object. There are still \nMembers on our side with concerns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, will the leader yield.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I am happy to yield to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, if the majority leader will yield for one \nmoment, this bill has provisions in it which we need to pass. There is \na special pay provision in it for short wartime specialties, for \ninstance. We have special provisions which will allow us to hold onto \nenlisted members in high priority units who otherwise might leave the \nmilitary. We have special reenlistment and enlistment bonuses in this \nbill. We have a targeted pay raise of 4\\1/2\\ percent for everybody. And \nwe have targeted pay raises of between 5 and 10 percent for special \ncategories.\n  This is a vital bill for the success of our military.\n  The problems we have now are no longer related to the jurisdiction of \nthis committee. We think we have resolved the last problem, or we are \nclose to resolving the last problem that relates to the jurisdiction of \nthis committee. Everybody else is willing to have their amendments \nplaced on this list so we have a finite list. We are not trying to \npreclude anybody from offering amendments of any kind. It is just a \nlist of their amendments and a finite list.\n  I thank the majority leader for his patience. I thank Senator Reid \nfor his extraordinary effort to get us to where we are. I express \ndisappointment that we can't get that finite list so we can proceed to \ncomplete this important bill, but to report to him and to our \ncolleagues that the problem we think we have now is not related to the \njurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee, and that is too bad.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, if I could just add to what the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan has said, and let me repeat also \nthe compliment of our two managers. I think they have done an admirable \njob. They have shown remarkable patience with all of their colleagues. \nBut I don't know of a bill that deserves more urgency than this one. I \ndon't know of a bill that ought to be the source of unity as we look at \nthe array of challenges that our country is currently facing.\n  This afternoon, we were given one of the finest briefings that I have \nheard in recent years by the Secretary of State and the Secretary of \nDefense. They did an outstanding job in laying out the challenges that \nwe have to face, not only in the short term but in the longer term. At \nthe very least, it seems to me, the Senate ought to respond to the \ntremendous challenges we face by providing the support that we can to \nthis administration at a time of need.\n  I must say that I know we have worked off the earlier objections. And \nnow, as the Senator from Michigan said, we have objections tonight that \nI am told have nothing to do with the Defense bill but have to do with \nthe schedule on other issues. I am willing to work with my colleagues. \nNo one wants to pass an energy bill more than I do. We know we have to \ndo that. That has to be an important part of the Senate's agenda. I am \nwilling to enter into a colloquy with Senators who have concerns about \nhow high a priority that is. But, for heaven's sake, let us not hold up \none of the most urgent bills before the Senate tonight.\n  I must say, I will tell my colleagues, that we may be left with no \nother option than to pull this bill and go straight to Defense \nappropriations when that bill is ready. We can resolve this on Defense \nappropriations. I don't want to have to do that, but I will do that if \nthere is no other choice. Tomorrow we are going to go to the military \nconstruction bill.\n  This is our last opportunity tonight until sometime later.\n  There are so many other urgent pieces of work that have to be done. \nWe have an airport security bill that we all have talked about that we \nknow is important. That has to be brought up, hopefully next week.\n  We can't continue to deliberate, object, delay, and confound the two \nmanagers here as we try to address this important question. We have a \nwindow. If we lose this window, we are going to have to look for \nanother window under the appropriations process.\n  I put my colleagues on notice. We will either work this out this way \nor we will work it out another way. But these laborious objections are \nvery troubling to me and ought to be troubling to all of our \ncolleagues.\n  I will work with our managers.\n  I appreciate as well the distinguished assistant majority leader for \nhis efforts tonight.\n  If I sound frustrated, I am. I will be patient. But patience wears \nthin. We have a lot of work to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, before the leader leaves the floor, I am a \nmember of the Committee on Appropriations. We are not an authorizing \ncommittee. We should not have to do the Defense authorization bill \nbecause the hard work that these two managers and the committee members \nhave put in will be for naught.\n  Yesterday, I had to make some phone calls. Eighty-three National \nGuardsmen who have been called to active duty out of Ely and Las Vegas. \nThese are MP's--military policemen. We had 100 out of Reno call the \nsame day. They are military intelligence. They are leaving as I am \nspeaking.\n  There are provisions in this bill to help them and their families. At \nNellis Air Force Base, we have 10,000 military personnel, and at Fallon \nwe have 7,000.\n  How can I go back to Nevada and face these people? This bill is going \nto go down as a result of something that has nothing to do with this \nbill.\n  The leader talked about these two managers. They have worked so hard. \nThey have worked so hard. They are two veteran legislators. They are \ntwo of the best we have. They have done everything they can to move \nthis legislation.\n  Ninety-eight percent of the Senate wants to move this bill. It is too \nbad that 2 percent decided they don't want this bill to move anyplace. \nIt is too bad for the country. It is too bad for the military personnel \nin Nevada and all over this country, and for those serving outside the \nUnited States' continental limits. It is just too bad.\n  If the leader is frustrated--and I know he is because he has been on \nthis all day--I can't imagine how these two managers feel who have \nspent months working on this legislation. And they are being told, \nwell, you can have the appropriators do it. That is what it is coming \nto. It is a sad day in the history of the Senate and this country.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, in light of our circumstances, I \nreluctantly concluded that there will be no more votes tonight. There \nis so much work we could do. Clearly, we are not at a point where we \ncan move any further on the bill. If Members wish to express \nthemselves, they are welcome to\n\n[[Page S9799]]\n\ndo that. But there will be no more votes tonight.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, the fiscal year 2002 National Defense \nAuthorization Act that was reported out of the Committee on Armed \nServices was a good bill. In particular, it included important \nprovisions regarding missile defense.\n  It required prior Congressional approval of any activities during the \nnext fiscal year that are barred by the ABM Treaty. This provision \nassured Congress its proper role in any decision to walk away from a \ncornerstone of strategic stability which has served the United States \nwell for the past 30 years.\n  It strengthened transparency and Congressional oversight over the \nAdministration's missile defense programs. If the Congress is to \nauthorize billions of dollars for national missile defense, we deserve \na clear blueprint for how the administration will spend that money.\n  And it reallocated $1.3 billion from missile defense to other \npressing defense priorities.\n  As a result of the managers' amendment adopted last week, the first \ntwo provisions were dropped. The third one was altered to permit the \nPresident to spend the $1.3 billion on missile defense or on counter-\nterrorism.\n  As every other Member, I understand the need to forge a unity of \npurpose in fighting the difficult war which lies ahead. That is why I \ndid not prevent action on the managers' amendment last week. Let the \nrecord show, however, that I strongly disagree with the decision to \ndelete those very sensible provisions.\n  The prior approval provision did nothing to prohibit the President \nfrom withdrawing the United States from an international treaty. Nor \ndid it prohibit the Department of Defense from undertaking any activity \nin violation of the ABM Treaty. Rather, it simply enabled the Congress \nto exercise its rightful power of the purse to approve or disapprove \nthe use of funds for any DoD activity barred by a major U.S. treaty.\n  I believe that the President has the constitutional authority to \nwithdraw from a treaty in the face of congressional silence. I also \nbelieve, however, that Congress must exercise its appropriate \nresponsibility. That is why it was also a mistake, in my view, to \ndelete the missile defense transparency provisions in this bill.\n  Finally, in my view, there is no question how marginal dollars must \nbe spent. The tragic and unconscionable attacks of September 11, 2001, \nhave thrust upon us a war that we absolutely must win, not only for our \nown sake, but for all civilized nations. The wisdom of any element of \ndefense spending must be evaluated in that light.\n  As President Bush has made clear, this war will be complex. The \nbattle to dry up terrorist funding will be as crucial as any military \noffensive. Both battles may hinge on the support we receive from other \ncountries.\n  President Bush has done a wonderful job of turning world reaction \ninto positive and specific support for an effective campaign against \ninternational terrorism and those who aid and abet it. That is \nprecisely what is needed.\n  Today, that international support is broad and strong, at least in \nwords. It extends from NATO to Russia, Pakistan, and even North Korea. \nWe must maintain and strengthen that international coalition, however, \nin the months, and years, to come.\n  Russia may very well play a crucial role in any military action \nagainst Osama bin Laden or those who aid him in Afghanistan. By virtue \nof both geography and its involvement in the region, Russia can do much \nto aid or hinder our operations. Already, some of its military leaders \nare cautioning against military action that we may find essential to \nthe defeat of terrorism.\n  What will happen, if the President chooses this time to walk away \nfrom the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in the face of Russian \nobjections? Russia's official stance is that anti-terrorism is a \nseparate issue, and that cooperation will continue. But I fear that \nboth military and public opinion in Russia could shift substantially \nagainst cooperation with the United States.\n  Neither can we take our European allies for granted. Their \ngovernments overwhelmingly oppose any unilateral abandonment of the ABM \nTreaty. Even Prime Minister Tony Blair, the leader of our staunchest \nally, warned that Great Britain's support was not a ``blank check.''\n  Alliance cohesion requires our willingness, too, to cooperate with \nother nations in pursuit of a common aim. Our leadership role in the \nbattle against terrorism is clear today, but will be maintained in this \nconflict only by convincing others of both our wisdom and our care to \ntake their concerns into account. That is why precipitate actions to \ndeploy a missile defense, such as our unilateral withdrawal from the \nABM Treaty, could undermine our vital war efforts.\n  A defense against ICBM's will have little impact on international \nterrorism. Terrorists are not likely to develop or acquire such weapons \nand the complex launch facilities that they require. Rather, terrorists \nare likely to seek to attack the United States through infiltration, \nsmuggling in a nuclear weapon in a ship into a city's harbor or \ncarrying lethal pathogens in a backpack.\n  A national missile defense would do nothing to defend against these \nmore likely threats. Indeed, too much investment in it now could drain \nneeded resources from the war effort, not just in money, but also in \ntechnical manpower and production capability.\n  Let me give some examples of how $1.3 billion could be used to \nfurther the war on terrorism: The greatest threat of a nuclear weapons \nattack on the United States is from a weapon smuggled into the United \nStates. Terrorists cannot build such a weapon, but they could hope to \nbuy one. According to the bipartisan Baker-Cutler task force report \nissued earlier this year, Russia has tens of thousands of nuclear \nweapons, sensitive nuclear materials and components. Some are secure, \nbut others are not. Some nuclear facilities don't even have barbed wire \nfences to keep out potential terrorists. The task force called for \nspending $30 billion over the next 8 to 10 years, to address what it \ncalled ``the most urgent unmet national security threat to the United \nStates today.''\n  Biological terrorism is a real threat to both our military personnel \nand our civilian population. It is a challenge we can sensibly face, \nbut only if we invest in the necessary preparation today. For instance, \nthe Department of Defense should produce or acquire the necessary \nvaccines and antibiotics to protect our armed forces against a range of \npathogens. It should assist civilian agencies in procuring and \nstockpiling similar medicines for emergency use. According to Dr. Fred \nIkle, who testified at a Foreign Relations Committee hearing earlier \nthis month, $300 to $500 million will be needed just to ramp up our \nvaccine stockpile. This is a common-sense response to an otherwise \nfrightening threat.\n  The Department of Defense should also test and procure inexpensive \nbio-hazard masks that could save lives both in the event of a terrorist \nattack and through everyday use in military hospitals. By conducting \nthe necessary testing and creating an initial market for such masks, \nthe Defense Department will pave the way for use of these masks in our \ncivilian health care system.\n  A more immediate step to help our armed forces would be to improve \nthe security of our domestic military bases and installations. Many of \nthem lack the basic anti-terrorism protections that our overseas bases \nhave.\n  Another war-related need is to speed up the Large Aircraft Infra-Red \nCounter-Measures program that gives our military transport aircraft \nincreased protection against surface-to-air missiles. We gave Afghan \ngroups hundreds of Stinger missiles in the 1980's, and scores of them \ncould be in the Taliban's inventory today. We owe it to our fighting \nmen and women to give them maximum protection as they move into combat \nor potentially hostile staging areas.\n\n[[Page S9800]]\n\n  Winning the war on terrorism, a war that we face here and now, is \ninfinitely more important than pouring concrete in Alaska or an extra \n$1.3 billion into combating the least likely of threats.\n  We can take the time to perfect our technology and to reach \nunderstandings with Russia and China that will minimize the side-\neffects of missile defense. But we have precious little time to do what \nis essential: to win the war against terrorism, to dry up the supply of \nRussian materials or technology, or to prepare our military, our \nintelligence community, our health care system, and our first \nresponders to deal with a chemical or biological weapons attack by the \nterrorists of tomorrow.\n  In the fury of the moment, Congress will let the President have the \nfinal say on the use of these funds. So be it. It will be up to the \nPresident to take the sensible course.\n  In the midst of a war, let us not be diverted by the least likely \nthreat. Let us turn our attention, our energies, and our resources to \nwinning the war that is upon us, and to building our defenses against \nterrorism of all sorts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/25/senate-section/article/S9800-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I would like to, in 10 minutes, cover \nthree topics. First, I want to talk a little bit about September 11 and \nnow. And I want to just say, in an ironic way--not bitterly ironic--the \ndays I have had in Minnesota have maybe been some of the better days I \nhave had because--and I am not putting words in anybody's mouth; and I \ndo not do damage to the truth; I have too much respect for people, even \nwhen we disagree--most of the people with whom I have spoken back in \nMinnesota have said a couple things.\n  First of all, they have said we need to do a better job of defending \nourselves. Who can disagree with that? Second of all, they have said--\nthey have not been jingoistic; and they have not said we need to bomb \nnow--we need to do this the right away. Many of them have expressed \nconcern that we not let terrorists define our morality and that we \nshould take every step possible to minimize the loss of life of \ninnocent civilians in Afghanistan, or any other country, starting with \ninnocent children. I am proud of people in Minnesota for saying that.\n  People in Minnesota have also said they understand this is not going \nto be one military action. They know this is going to be a long \nstruggle. They know we are going to need a lot of cooperation from a \nlot of other countries. They think it should be international.\n  Above and beyond the way people come together to support each other, \nI am so impressed with the way I think people are really thinking \ndeeply about this and want us to stay consistent with our own values as \na nation. I just want to say that. That is my view.\n  I find myself kind of on two ends of the continuum. I had a \ndiscussion with some friends who were telling me that I should speak \nout more about the underlying conditions and causes of this violence, \nthis hatred and violence. I told them there is a divide between us \nbecause I cannot do that because there are no conditions or \nexplanations or justification for the mass murder of innocent people. I \ndo not even like to talk about war because I do not think warriors \nmurder people. Warriors are not involved in the slaughter of innocent \npeople; criminals are.\n  A second point, which now gets closer to the defense authorization \nbill: On economic recovery, we have to really focus on economic \nsecurity. I believe, and will always believe, we should have included \nassistance for employees in the package we passed last Friday.\n  I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, when I went home to \nMinnesota, I heard about that. People were not bitterly angry, but they \nsaid: How could that happen to us and our families who are out of work? \nThat has to be a priority, along with safety, to get help to employees.\n  I would argue, maybe it is a sequence; you can't do everything at one \ntime. It is easier to give a speech than to actually do it. But above \nand beyond help for employees and employment benefits and making sure \npeople can afford health care needs and making sure there is job \ntraining and dislocated worker funding and, I would argue, having to \ndeal with some child care expenses, I want to say one other thing. The \ntruth is, I think we have to also think about an economic recovery \npackage. And that should include, I say to my colleague from New \nJersey, a workforce recovery package because not only are we going to \nneed to extend the lifeline to people by way of helping them--when \npeople are flat on their back, Government helps them; that is what \nGovernment is for--it is also true that that is part of an economic \nstimulus because you do not want to have a lot of people--people who \nwork in hotels and restaurants and small businesspeople, all of whom \nnow are really hurting--you do not want to have a whole lot of people \nshut down and not able to consume at all.\n  So we need to think about this package in broader terms as well. \nFinally, on the defense authorization bill, if I had my own way, there \nare at least a couple of provisions I wish were in it. One of them \nSenator Levin worked so hard on, and other colleagues support it. It \nmade it clear that if President Bush requested funding for missile \ndefense tests that violated the ABM Treaty, he would need congressional \napproval to spend those funds. I wanted that language in this bill in \nthe worst way. If I had time, I would argue over and over again, but I \ndon't want to impose my own agenda on what our country is facing right \nnow. But we need to reorder some of our priorities, and clearly more of \nthe money--some of the money in this bill that I don't think we need \nfor certain items I would put into homeland defense and helping \nfamilies with economic security.\n  I think there are a lot of threats our country is faced with that \ncome way before a rogue nation sending missiles our way by suitcase, by \nboat, by plane, chemical, biological--there are lots of other threats \nwith a much higher priority. I wish we hadn't dropped that language. I \nunderstand that the majority leader and Senator Levin and others made a \ncommitment that we will come back to that language and that provision.\n  I believe missile defense doesn't make the world more secure; it \nmakes it less secure for our children, grandchildren, and for all God's \nchildren. I could argue that for the next 5 hours. I don't have 5 \nhours.\n  I congratulate Senators on both sides of the aisle for the way in \nwhich we have worked together. We probably need each other as never \nbefore. There will be some sharp disagreement on policy issues--some of \nthe issues that deal with education and health care, prescription \ndrugs, you name it. Frankly, I am sure there will be questions many of \nus have as we go forward. But for right now, I want to just dissent on \nmissile defense and say to my colleagues we need to get back to that \ndebate. I think we are going to have to see more of an emphasis on \npriorities, including some of the money from some weapons systems that \nare not necessary to what we are talking about now by way of our own \nnational security and homeland defense.\n  I say to Senator Levin and others, I appreciate the additional \nsupport for the armed services, especially when they are about to go \ninto harm's way. I want to say to every Senator that we did not do well \nfor too many people in this package for the industry, which was \nnecessary. I don't think the companies and CEOs were crying wolf, but \nwe didn't help the employees, and the economic security of these \nworking families has to be the next step, along with safety. That has \nto happen soon.\n  Finally, I believe we are going to have to have a broader workforce \nrecovery bill as part of economic recovery legislation, as a part of \nhow we deal with this recession in hard economic times, because there \nare a lot of other people who are really hurting right now. The \nGovernment should be there to help people when they are flat on their \nbacks through no fault of their own. That is going to be a big part of \nour work as well.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/25/senate-section/article/S9801-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9801]]\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. BIDEN.

Madam President, yesterday Senator Kyl and I introduced \nthe Critical Infrastructure Information Security Act, CIISA, which is \ndesigned to minimize a dangerous national security blind spot by: one, \nprotecting voluntarily shared critical infrastructure information; two, \nproviding critical infrastructure threat analysis; and three, \nencouraging proactive industry cooperation.\n  Critical infrastructures are those key sectors such as financial \nservices, telecommunications, transportation, energy, emergency \nservices, and government essential services, whose disruption or \ndestruction would impact our economic or national security. On \nSeptember 11, 2001, America suffered a senseless strike, where \nAmerica's commercial air space was ``weaponized'' and turned viciously \nagainst its financial and defense establishments in an infrastructure \nattack that resulted in staggering losses.\n  About 85 percent of the United States' critical infrastructures, \ntelecommunications, energy, finance, and transportation systems, are \nowned and operated by private companies. If our critical \ninfrastructures are targets, it is the private sector that is on the \nfront line. Thus, we have to think differently about national security, \nas well as who is responsible for it. In the past, the defense of the \nNation was about geography and an effective military command-and-\ncontrol structure. However, now prevention and protection must shift \nfrom the command-control structure to partnerships that span private \nand government interests.\n  The American economy is a highly interdependent system of systems, \nwith physical and cyber components. Preventing, detecting, responding, \nmitigating, and recovering from attacks to these systems requires an \nunprecedented exchange of information. It is essential to remove \nunnecessary barriers that prevent the private sector from sharing \ninformation. Because in many cases, releasing sensitive information \ninto the public domain could have extremely negative consequences for \nbusiness, it is understandable why the private sector is reticent to \nshare this information with the Government as it is not protected.\n  The Critical Infrastructure Information Security Act, CIISA, is \nintended to clear the way for increased critical infrastructure \ninformation sharing and improve threat analysis for these \ninfrastructures. The bill seeks to increase the two-way sharing of \ninformation between the Federal Government and the private sector by \nfirst, protecting information voluntarily shared by the private sector, \nand second, requiring the Government to send analysis back to the \nprivate sector. It also encourages information sharing within the \nprivate sector so industry can better solve its own problems.\n  CIISA outlines a process by which critical infrastructure \ninformation, information which would not normally be shared due to its \nsensitivity, can be submitted to one of 13 designated Federal agencies \nwith a request that the information be protected. Such a request would \nmean that this information will not be disclosed even in a response to \na request under the Freedom of Information Act, commonly known as FOIA.\n  FOIA has helped make a transparent government. Initially enacted in \n1966, FOIA establishes for any person, corporate or individual, \nregardless of nationality, presumptive access to existing, unpublished \nagency records on any topic. CIISA does not change FOIA in any way. In \nfact, it seeks to protect information which would not be in the public \ndomain in the first place and if publicly released, could interfere \nwith, disrupt, or compromise critical infrastructure operations. CIISA \nwill protect voluntarily shared information without diminishing Federal \ntransparency.\n  Access to information is essential to our democracy. However, it is \nimportant to realize that the ability to make a request under FOIA does \nnot apply only to American citizens interested in seeing what the \nGovernment is doing. Corporations, associations, foreign citizens, and \neven foreign governments have the same access. There are no limitations \non FOIA even during times of war. Furthermore, the narrow provisions \nprovided in CIISA are nothing new. Congress has on 40 other occasions \ncreated certain classes of information that are not subject to the \nFreedom of Information Act.\n  In order to ensure the uniform protection of voluntarily shared \ninformation, CIISA requires the Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget to establish procedures for the Federal agencies to receive, \nacknowledge, mark, care, and store voluntarily submitted critical \ninfrastructure information. Today, there is no uniform standard of care \nunder FOIA.\n  CIISA requires that information and analyses from the Federal \nGovernment be shared back with the private sector in the form of \nnotifications, warnings, and strategic analyses. The bill requires a \nFederal agency receiving voluntarily submitted critical infrastructure \ninformation to make reasonable efforts to do the following: one, \nanalyze the information; two, determine the tactical and strategic \nimplications for such information; three, identify interdependencies; \nand four, consider conducting further analysis in concert with other \nFederal agencies. Following this analysis, a Federal agency may issue \nwarnings regarding potential threats to: one, individual companies; \ntwo, targeted industry sectors; three, the general public; or four, \nother government entities. Federal agencies must take appropriate \nactions to prevent the disclosure of the source of any voluntarily \nsubmitted critical infrastructure information that forms the basis for \nany warnings.\n  CIISA also requires the President to designate an entity within the \nexecutive branch to conduct strategic analyses of potential threats to \ncritical infrastructure; and to submit reports and analyses to \ninformation sharing and analysis organizations and the private sector. \nThese analyses draw upon this information submitted to the Federal \nGovernment by the private sector, as well as information from the \nFederal Government, such as national security and law enforcement \ninformation. The President is also required to submit a plan for \ndeveloping strategic analysis capabilities in the Congress.\n  When competitors work closely to address common problems, antitrust \nconcerns always surface. Security in a networked world must be a shared \nresponsibility. To encourage the private sector to find solutions to \ncommon security problems, CIISA provides a narrow antitrust exemption, \nnot unlike that of the Information Readiness Disclosure Act or the \nDefense Production Act. Information sharing and analysis organizations \nformed solely for the purpose of gathering and analyzing critical \ninfrastructure information and to help prevent, detect, mitigate or \nrecover from the effects of a problem relating to critical \ninfrastructure, will be exempt from antitrust laws. Again, this \nexemption only applies to the activities specifically undertaken to \naddress infrastructure problems. The antitrust exemption will not apply \nto conduct that involves or results in an agreement to boycott any \nperson, to allocate a maker, or to fix prices or output.\n  The threats to our critical infrastructure are varied. Some of those \nthreats are physical; some may come from cyberspace. From wherever they \ncome, the private sector and Government each has different vantage \npoints. It is my hope that this bill will help both entities work \ntogether to reduce the blind spot.\n  I thank Senator Kyl for his interest and leadership on this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/25/senate-section/article/S9801-3", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9801-S9802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COMMENDING THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Juan Huiza, 19, \nand Marvin and Guillermo Hendriquez, both 20, were charged with \nsuspicion of civil rights violations and assault with a deadly weapon.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate.

A bill to designate the Federal building and United States \ncourthouse located at 550 West Fort Street in Boise, Idaho, as the \n``James A. McClure Federal Building and United States Courthouse''; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nnaming the Federal building and United States courthouse in Boise, ID, \nfor our former colleague Senator James A. McClure.\n  Jim McClure ably served Idaho for 24 years in the United States \nCongress, including 18 years here in the Senate. At the time of his \nretirement from the Senate in 1991, Jim McClure was one of the most \nsenior members of the Republican Conference, serving as its Chairman \nfrom 1981 to 1985. Prior to entering Congress in 1967, Jim McClure also \nserved 6 years in the Idaho State Senate.\n  Throughout his service in Congress, Jim McClure was widely recognized \nfor his expertise on energy and natural resource issues, especially in \nthe areas of mining, forestry, public land, water, and natural resource \nlaw. As Chairman of both the Senate Interior Appropriations \nSubcommittee and the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Jim \nMcClure was a key legislator behind the establishment of the Hells \nCanyon National Recreation Area in western Idaho and eastern Oregon. \nJim McClure also led the drive for the creation of the Frank Church \nRiver of No Return Wilderness in Idaho, and he was instrumental in \nhelping to assist and improve Idaho's rural economy and standard of \nliving.\n  Known for his ardent support of second amendment rights and hard-line \nstance on foreign policy and defense issues, Jim McClure was an \ninfluential voice in working with several administrations on arms \ncontrol issues. In 1990, he was a part of a four-member Senate \ndelegation that visited Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to express \nconcern about Iraq's development of chemical, biological, and nuclear \nweapons.\n  Having retired from the Senate more than 10 years ago, Jim McClure \nhas continued to be active in working with Congress on behalf of many \nimportant groups in Idaho and throughout the country. His civic-\nmindedness has also been illustrated through his service as a Trustee \nfor the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.\n  As former Prosecuting Attorney for Payette County, ID, as well as \nformer City Attorney for Payette, the renaming of this courthouse for \nJim McClure is an appropriate tribute to his service to Idaho and to \nthe Nation. I invite my colleagues to join Senator Craig and me in \nhonoring Senator James A. McClure through this legislation. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1459\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to require \nthat the screening of passengers and property on flights in air \ntransportation be carried out by employees of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration, and to assist small- to medium-size airports with \nsecurity enhancements; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise today to introduce a very timely \nand important piece of legislation, the Airline Passenger Safety \nEnhancement Act of 2001.\n  This legislation would require the Federal Government to operate \npassenger and carry-on baggage security checkpoints and screening \noperations in airports. The federalization of the screening process, \nand the Federal Government's role, will be accomplished by using FAA or \nU.S. DOT personnel, security personnel detailed by other Federal \nagencies, or by establishing a government or government-controlled \ncorporation to screen carry-on baggage and the traveling public. \nAdditionally, the FAA will have the authority under this Act to make \nchanges and adjustments in screening policy to assure safety.\n  This legislation would require the FAA Administrator to immediately \nmake arrangements with airport operators for armed, uniformed law \nenforcement personnel at passenger, carry-on baggage and employee \nsecurity checkpoints. O'Hare and Lambert Airports have already posted \nsuch personnel at passenger and carry-on baggage checkpoints.\n  The Airline Passenger Safety Enhancement Act of 2001 also would \nrequire the FAA Administrator to conduct a comprehensive study to \ndetermine how best to organize the security\n\n[[Page S9810]]\n\noperations at airports in cooperation with air carriers and local \nairports in order to secure the safety of passengers and workers. A \nreport to Congress would be required no later than 30 days after the \nenactment of this legislation. This report would include \nrecommendations for legislation to assure greater airport security.\n  I've heard from a number of Downstate Illinois airports that support \nstronger airport security procedures. However, these airports will be \nasked to shoulder a heavy financial burden. For example, the Central \nIllinois Regional Airport in Bloomington-Normal will likely need to \nspend as much as $30,000 per month for additional security measures. \nThese funds are above and beyond what has been budgeted and could \ncreate a financial hardship for the airport. The Department should \nexplore ways to help smaller airports by providing resources and \ntechnical assistance to upgrade security and enhance passenger safety. \nMy legislation would provide for additional support to these small-to-\nmedium size airports by providing them with added financial and \ntechnical support which would enhance, upgrade and improve security \noperations.\n  I am hopeful that these upgrades and improvements of a federalized \nsecurity system can be paid for through an added fee of up to $1.00 per \ndomestic flight segment.\n  While this concept generally appears to be supported by the airlines \nand by some in the Administration, I think it's important for Congress \nto act swiftly to codify these important changes.\n  In closing, together, we can craft common-sense solutions that \nprotect passengers, secure our airports, and ensure that our aviation \nsystem is the safest in the world and I believe this legislation can \nmake that happen.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE.\n  S. 1462. A bill to establish the Federal Emergency Transportation \nAdministration; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nthe National Emergency Transportation Coordination Act of 2001, to \naddress a serious concern I have in the wake of last week's tragic \nevents.\n  Last week, I met with local transportation officials in my home State \nof Maine to review the enhanced security measures implemented since the \nSeptember 11 attacks. During my meetings, these officials expressed \nserious concerns about security coordination among different modes of \ntransportation. Apparently, drastically differing standards of safety \nand security were used by Federal officials in different cities during \nthe attacks.\n  For obvious reasons, this lack of coordination could be of \nsignificant concern in the future. The fact of the matter is, we did \nnot know last Tuesday's attacks were coming. We certainly didn't know \nwhere, or in what form. In the future, my hope is that our intelligence \nwill be enhanced so that we may thwart terrorist attacks before they \noccur. Nonetheless, I believe it is critical that we be prepared for \nany contingency. To this end, the legislation I am introducing today \ngives the U.S. Department of Transportation, U.S. DOT, the authority \nand tools necessary to safeguard our national transportation \ninfrastructure in the event of a national emergency.\n  Specifically, my legislation will enhance coordination within the \nU.S. DOT and with other federal agencies to safeguard our \ntransportation infrastructure in the event of an emergency. It will \ncentralize within U.S. DOT the authority to: 1. coordinate national \ntransportation and transportation-related activities of all federal \nagencies during a national emergency; 2. disseminate critical \ntransportation-related information during an emergency; and 3. develop \nand notify appropriate federal, state and local authorities of uniform \nemergency transportation security standards to be followed during an \nemergency and to ensure those standards are followed.\n  It will establish within the U.S. DOT a Federal Emergency \nTransportation Administration, FETA. FETA would be responsible for \ncoordinating domestic transportation during a national emergency, \nincluding aviation, maritime and port security, and surface \ntransportation, including rail. FETA would coordinate transportation-\nrelated responsibilities of other agencies during an emergency as well. \nFETA could serve as a point of contact within U.S. DOT for the Office \nof Homeland Security laid out by the President last Thursday.\n  In addition, FETA would be responsible for establishing uniform \nnational transportation ``emergency'' standards, and notifying \nappropriate Federal, State, and local agencies and governments about \ntransportation-related security threats in the event of an emergency. \nIt would also develop appropriate standard operating procedures for \nagencies and municipalities to follow during an emergency and \ndisseminate critical transportation-related information during.\n  As a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, I know that steps are already being taken to safeguard \nour airports and our skies. However, there is no guarantee that, should \nthere be another terrorist attack on our soil in the future, that \naviation will be the only mode of transportation targeted. We must not \ntake that chance. We must take steps to ensure that all our modes of \ntransportation are coordinated in the event of such an attack. I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to join me in a strong show of support for \nthis legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire:\n  S. 1463. A bill to provide for the safety of American aviation and \nthe suppression of terrorism; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1463\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Airline Safety Act of \n     2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On September 11, 2001, terrorists hijacked four \n     civilian aircraft, crashing two of the aircraft into the \n     towers of the World Trade Center in New York, New York, and a \n     third into the Pentagon outside Washington, District of \n     Columbia.\n       (2) Thousands of innocent Americans and citizens of other \n     countries were killed or injured as a result of these \n     attacks, including the passengers and crew of the four \n     aircraft, workers in the World Trade Center and in the \n     Pentagon, rescue workers, and bystanders.\n       (3) These attacks destroyed both towers of the World Trade \n     Center, as well as adjacent buildings, and seriously damaged \n     the Pentagon.\n       (4) These attacks were by far the deadliest terrorist \n     attacks ever launched against the United States and, by \n     targeting symbols of America, clearly were intended to \n     intimidate our Nation and weaken its resolve.\n       (5) Armed pilots, co-pilots, and navigators with proper \n     training will serve as a deterrent to future contemplated \n     acts of terrorism.\n       (6) Secured doors separating the crew cabin from the \n     passenger cabin have been effective in deterring hijackings \n     in other nations and will serve as a deterrent to future \n     contemplated acts of terrorism in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3. AVIATION SAFETY AND SUPPRESSION OF TERRORISM BY \n                   COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT.\n\n       (a) Possession of Firearms on Commercial Flights.--No \n     department or agency may prohibit a pilot, co-pilot, or \n     navigator of a commercial aircraft, or any law enforcement \n     personnel specifically detailed for the protection of a \n     commercial aircraft, who is not otherwise prohibited by law \n     from possessing a firearm, from possessing or carrying a \n     firearm for the protection of the aircraft.\n       (b) Reinforced Cockpit Doors on Commercial Aircraft.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, a commercial aircraft described in paragraph (2) that is \n     operated in the United States shall possess a door or doors \n     separating the crew cabin of such aircraft from the passenger \n     cabin of such aircraft, which door or doors shall be \n     certified by the Secretary as being secure against forcible \n     entry from the passenger cabin into the crew cabin of such \n     aircraft.\n       (2) Covered commercial aircraft.--A commercial aircraft \n     described in this paragraph is any commercial aircraft that, \n     as determined by the Secretary, is configured so as to permit \n     a door to separate the crew cabin and passenger cabin of such \n     aircraft.\n       (c) Regulations.--The Secretary may prescribe regulations \n     for purposes of this section.\n\n[[Page S9811]]\n\n       (d) Reports to Congress.--Not later than six months after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, and every six months \n     thereafter, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report \n     on the effectiveness of the requirements in this section in \n     facilitating commercial aviation safety and the suppression \n     of terrorism by commercial aircraft.\n       (e) Effective Date.--This section shall take effect on the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself and Mr. McConnell):\n  S. 1465. A bill to authorize the President to provide assistance to \nPakistan and India through September 30, 2003; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I am introducing today a bill, along \nwith Senator McConnell, and there will be others who will be added as \ncosponsors to the bill, to provide limited authority to the President \nto provide assistance to Pakistan and India.\n  This bill provides a limited waiver authority to the President to \nprovide foreign aid assistance to Pakistan and to India. I do not need \nto remind anybody in this body of the difficulty facing particularly \nPakistan at this time, as General Musharraf, the Chief Executive of the \ncountry, stepped forward to support the United States in this time of \nfighting international terrorism, particularly that which is based in \nAfghanistan.\n  Yet because of prior legislation, the United States cannot provide \ncertain types of aid to Pakistan that I believe the administration may \nwell need to provide to Pakistan to keep the Government there, to \nprovide support and help to the Government.\n  For instance, the U.S. Government today, because of sanctions that \nwere put on Pakistan by law and there is no waiver authority, cannot \nprovide more than $50 million in foreign aid assistance to Pakistan. \nThey can in some areas provide below $50 million, but they cannot \nprovide any more than that. They can do no debt rescheduling. There are \nno balance of payment supports the United States can provide to \nPakistan. These are a lot of funds, but I want to point out what would \ntake place if the Pakistani Government gets into great difficulty and \nthe United States is not able to help.\n  General Musharraf controls nuclear weapons and missile capacity as \nwell. If the Government of Pakistan does not survive, it will probably \nmove to a more radical regime that will have both nuclear weapons and \nthe capacity to delivery those nuclear weapons to our allies and even \npossibly U.S. interests.\n\n  Pakistan is helping us against this battle of terrorism. We need to \nlift all sanctions to work with them. We are going to need to help them \neconomically during this very difficult time for them and for us.\n  As we move forward in this battle on terrorism, we are going to have \nto work with people in many ways. There is a military component that \npeople watch, but there is also a strong cooperative component which \nneeds to take place. We need to work with our potential allies around \nAfghanistan so that we can go into the country of Afghanistan or \nsupport resistance fighters around Afghanistan and in Afghanistan, \nwhich I think is the better route to go, for us to drain the swamp and \nbe able to get the terrorism at that point in time or cause them to \nmove and capture them at that time.\n  The administration is asking for this important assistance. They will \nneed to work very closely with Pakistan. The Musharraf government has \nhad sanctions imposed on it because they triggered particular \nprovisions by their own actions. The administration is going to have to \nweigh that very carefully. If they are going to return to an elective \ngovernment, which the Pakistani President and the Supreme Council of \nPakistan, the Supreme Court has stated that they will next October have \nfree elections to elect their leadership, we are going to have to \nappraise this as it moves forward.\n  Right now the Bush administration does not even have the authority to \nwaive these sanctions to provide foreign aid, debt repayment, and \nassistance. They do not even have the option. This bill will provide \nthem the waiver authority to provide that assistance. It means the \nsanctions will still be in place, and the administration will have to \ndecide whether or not to lift them.\n  I am introducing this bill now because I would like to see it \nincluded either on the Defense authorization bill, foreign ops \nappropriations bill, or as a freestanding bill passing through this \nCongress. This needs to take place. That is why I am introducing this \nbill and drawing it to the attention of my colleagues. We need to do \nthis, and we should not be parsimonious in this time of great \ndifficulty for us and for them. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/25/senate-section/article/S9811-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1672.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``American Servicemembers' \n     Protection Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 1402. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On July 17, 1998, the United Nations Diplomatic \n     Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an \n     International Criminal Court, meeting in Rome, Italy, adopted \n     the ``Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court''. The \n     vote on whether to proceed with the statute was 120 in favor \n     to 7 against, with 21 countries abstaining. The United States \n     voted against final adoption of the Rome Statute.\n       (2) As of April 30, 2001, 139 countries had signed the Rome \n     Statute and 30 had ratified it. Pursuant to Article 126 of \n     the Rome Statute, the statute will enter into force on the \n     first day of the month after the 60th day following the date \n     on which the 60th country deposits an instrument ratifying \n     the statute.\n       (3) Since adoption of the Rome Statute, a Preparatory \n     Commission for the International Criminal Court has met \n     regularly to draft documents to implement the Rome Statute, \n     including Rules of Procedure and Evidence, Elements of \n     Crimes, and a definition of the Crime of Aggression.\n       (4) During testimony before the Congress following the \n     adoption of the Rome Statute, the lead United States \n     negotiator, Ambassador David Scheffer stated that the United \n     States could not sign the Rome Statute because certain \n     critical negotiating objectives of the United States had not \n     been achieved. As a result, he stated: ``We are left with \n     consequences that do not serve the cause of international \n     justice.''\n       (5) Ambassador Scheffer went on to tell the Congress that: \n     ``Multinational peacekeeping forces operating in a country \n     that has joined the treaty can be exposed to the Court's \n     jurisdiction even if the country of the individual \n     peacekeeper has not joined the treaty. Thus, the treaty \n     purports to establish an arrangement whereby United States \n     armed forces operating overseas could be conceivably \n     prosecuted by the international court even if the United \n     States has not agreed to be bound by the treaty. Not only is \n     this contrary to the most fundamental principles of treaty \n     law, it could inhibit the ability of the United States to use \n     its military to meet alliance obligations and participate in \n     multinational operations, including humanitarian \n     interventions to save civilian lives. Other contributors to \n     peacekeeping operations will be similarly exposed.''.\n       (6) Notwithstanding these concerns, President Clinton \n     directed that the United States sign the Rome Statute on \n     December 31, 2000. In a statement issued that day, he stated \n     that in view of the unremedied deficiencies of the Rome \n     Statute, ``I will not, and do not recommend that my successor \n     submit the Treaty to the Senate for advice and consent until \n     our fundamental concerns are satisfied''.\n       (7) Any American prosecuted by the International Criminal \n     Court will, under the Rome Statute, be denied procedural \n     protections to which all Americans are entitled under the \n     Bill of Rights to the United States Constitution, such as the \n     right to trial by jury.\n       (8) Members of the Armed Forces of the United States should \n     be free from the risk of prosecution by the International \n     Criminal Court, especially when they are stationed or \n     deployed around the world to protect the vital national \n     interests of the United States. The United States Government \n     has an obligation to protect the members of its Armed Forces, \n     to the maximum extent possible, against criminal prosecutions \n     carried out by the International Criminal Court.\n       (9) In addition to exposing members of the Armed Forces of \n     the United States to the risk of international criminal \n     prosecution, the Rome Statute creates a risk that the \n     President and other senior elected and appointed officials of \n     the United States Government may be prosecuted by the \n     International Criminal Court. Particularly if the Preparatory \n     Commission agrees on a definition of the Crime of Aggression \n     over United States objections, senior United States officials \n     may be at risk of criminal prosecution for national security \n     decisions involving such matters as responding to acts of \n     terrorism, preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction, and deterring aggression. No less than members \n     of the Armed Forces of the United States, senior officials of \n     the United States Government should be free from the risk of \n     prosecution by the International Criminal Court, especially \n     with respect to official actions taken by them to protect the \n     national interests of the United States.\n       (10) Any agreement within the Preparatory Commission on a \n     definition of the Crime of Aggression that usurps the \n     prerogative of the United Nations Security Council under \n     Article 39 of the charter of the United Nations to \n     ``determine the existence of any . . . . act of aggression'' \n     would contravene the charter of the United Nations and \n     undermine deterrence.\n       (11) It is a fundamental principle of international law \n     that a treaty is binding upon its parties only and that it \n     does not create obligations for nonparties without their \n     consent to be bound. The United States is not a party to the \n     Rome Statute and will not be bound by any of its terms. The \n     United States will not recognize the jurisdiction of the \n     International Criminal Court over United States nationals.\n\n     SEC. 1403. WAIVER AND TERMINATION OF PROHIBITIONS OF THIS \n                   TITLE.\n\n       (a) Authority To Initially Waive Sections 1405 and 1407.--\n     The President is authorized to waive the prohibitions and \n     requirements of sections 1405 and 1407 for a single period of \n     one year. A waiver under this subsection may be issued only \n     if the President at least 15 days in advance of exercising \n     such authority--\n       (1) notifies the appropriate congressional committees of \n     the intention to exercise such authority; and\n       (2) determines and reports to the appropriate congressional \n     committees that the International Criminal Court has entered \n     into a binding agreement that--\n       (A) prohibits the International Criminal Court from seeking \n     to exercise jurisdiction over the following persons with \n     respect to actions undertaken by them in an official \n     capacity:\n       (i) covered United States persons;\n       (ii) covered allied persons; and\n       (iii) individuals who were covered United States persons or \n     covered allied persons; and\n       (B) ensures that no person described in subparagraph (A) \n     will be arrested, detained, prosecuted, or imprisoned by or \n     on behalf of the International Criminal Court.\n       (b) Authority To Extend Waiver of Sections 1405 and 1407.--\n     The President is authorized to waive the prohibitions and \n     requirements of sections 1405 and 1407 for successive periods \n     of one year each upon the expiration of a previous waiver \n     pursuant to subsection (a) or this subsection. A waiver under \n     this subsection may be issued only if the President at least \n     fifteen days in advance of exercising such authority--\n       (1) notifies the appropriate congressional committees of \n     the intention to exercise such authority; and\n       (2) determines and reports to the appropriate congressional \n     committees that the International Criminal Court--\n       (A) remains party to, and has continued to abide by, a \n     binding agreement that--\n       (i) prohibits the International Criminal Court from seeking \n     to exercise jurisdiction over the following persons with \n     respect to\n\n[[Page S9817]]\n\n     actions undertaken by them in an official capacity:\n\n       (I) covered United States persons;\n       (II) covered allied persons; and\n       (III) individuals who were covered United States persons or \n     covered allied persons; and\n\n       (ii) ensures that no person described in clause (i) will be \n     arrested, detained, prosecuted, or imprisoned by or on behalf \n     of the International Criminal Court; and\n       (B) has taken no steps to arrest, detain, prosecute, or \n     imprison any person described in clause (i) of subparagraph \n     (A).\n       (c) Authority To Waive Sections 1404 and 1406 With Respect \n     to an Investigation or Prosecution of a Named Individual.--\n     The President is authorized to waive the prohibitions and \n     requirements of sections 1404 and 1406 to the degree such \n     prohibitions and requirements would prevent United States \n     cooperation with an investigation or prosecution of a named \n     individual by the International Criminal Court. A waiver \n     under this subsection may be issued only if the President at \n     least 15 days in advance of exercising such authority--\n       (1) notifies the appropriate congressional committees of \n     the intention to exercise such authority; and\n       (2) determines and reports to the appropriate congressional \n     committees that--\n       (A) a waiver pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of the \n     prohibitions and requirements of sections 1405 and 1407 is in \n     effect;\n       (B) there is reason to believe that the named individual \n     committed the crime or crimes that are the subject of the \n     International Criminal Court's investigation or prosecution;\n       (C) it is in the national interest of the United States for \n     the International Criminal Court's investigation or \n     prosecution of the named individual to proceed; and\n       (D) in investigating events related to actions by the named \n     individual, none of the following persons will be \n     investigated, arrested, detained, prosecuted, or imprisoned \n     by or on behalf of the International Criminal Court with \n     respect to actions undertaken by them in an official \n     capacity:\n       (i) Covered United States persons.\n       (ii) Covered allied persons.\n       (iii) Individuals who were covered United States persons or \n     covered allied persons.\n       (d) Termination of Waiver Pursuant to Subsection (c).--Any \n     waiver or waivers exercised pursuant to subsection (c) of the \n     prohibitions and requirements of sections 1404 and 1406 shall \n     terminate at any time that a waiver pursuant to subsection \n     (a) or (b) of the prohibitions and requirements of sections \n     1405 and 1407 expires and is not extended pursuant to \n     subsection (b).\n       (e) Termination of Prohibitions of This Title.--The \n     prohibitions and requirements of sections 1404, 1405, 1406, \n     and 1407 shall cease to apply, and the authority of section \n     1408 shall terminate, if the United States becomes a party to \n     the International Criminal Court pursuant to a treaty made \n     under article II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of \n     the United States.\n\n     SEC. 1404.
