Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 4 minutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to the \nSantorum amendment No. 814.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, could we have order. We have a series of \nvotes now.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will come to order.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We had good debates on them last evening. They are \nimportant votes. The Senator is entitled to be heard, and we want to \ngive all those who worked on these amendments an opportunity for \nSenators to hear them.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will be in order. The \nSenator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. My amendment is simple. My amendment says anybody born \nalive, any child born alive is entitled to protection under the laws of \nthe United States of America.\n  Unfortunately, this amendment is necessary for two reasons. No. 1, \nbecause of the treatment of children who are delivered as a result of \nan abortion that was botched. We have ample testimony to, \nunfortunately, show that children born alive as a result of induced \nabortions are not cared for and are discarded, not cared for as \nappropriate to their gestational age. So we think it is important to \nmake it clear there is Federal protection; that the laws of the land \napply to even children who are born as a result of abortion--born \nalive.\n  The second reason is because of our courts in this country, \nparticularly the Supreme Court, where two Supreme Court Justices in the \nmost recent abortion decision, the Nebraska decision, stated that any \nprocedure that the doctor would permit is OK in this country. This is \njust two of the nine. But they said the Federal Government and our \nConstitution does not allow regulation of any procedure that the doctor \nbelieves is in the best health interests of the mother. That, to me, \nleaves open the possibility, if the doctor decides in the health \ninterest of a mother that the best thing is to deliver the baby alive \nand then kill the baby, two Justices on this Court would suggest that \nwould be OK because we cannot regulate any procedure, and they use \n``any procedure,'' that the doctor believes is the best interests of \nthe mother.\n  So I think it is important for us to draw a line at least here. I am \nhopeful we will have unanimous support for this amendment. It is one \nthat seems obvious on its face, but because of the courts and because \nof the practice in abortion clinics, it is necessary to make this \nstatement again on the floor of the Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We yield 2 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is nice to see you in the Chair.\n  I say to my friend from Pennsylvania, our side has no disagreement \nwith this whatsoever. Of course, we believe everyone born should \ndeserve the protections of this bill. The Senator, in his amendment, \nmentions infants who are born and that they deserve the protections of \nthis bill. Of course they deserve the protections of this bill. Who \ncould be more vulnerable than a newborn baby? So, of course, we agree \nwith that.\n  But we go further. We believe everyone deserves the protection of \nthis bill: babies, infants, children, families, all the way up until \nyou are fighting for your life because you may have a dreaded disease; \nyou may be elderly. Everyone deserves the HMOs to act in the right way \nand to put your vital signs ahead of their dollar signs. That is key.\n  Maybe in the spirit of our Chaplain who called for unity this morning \nwe start off this morning together, saying everyone who is born \ndeserves the protections of this bill. We all know that, regardless of \nwhat age, we have heard stories of patients who are really disregarded \nin the name of the bottom line.\n  During times when we see CEOs in these HMOs drawing down hundreds of \nmillions of dollars, we see little children and elderly people and \nthose in between denied the needed care, denied the kinds of \nprescriptions they need.\n  We join with an ``aye'' vote on this. I hope it will, in fact, be \nunanimous. I also hope the underlying bill will get a very strong vote \nand we will say that all of our people deserve protection, from the \nvery tiniest infant to the most elderly among us.\n  I urge an ``aye'' vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time on the amendment has \nexpired. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, during this vote, I will be conferring with \nthe manager of the bill on the Republican side to determine what are \nthe next two amendments after this series of votes.\n  I also plead with Members--the first vote is 15 minutes; the others \n10 minutes--if everyone will stay where they are supposed to be, we can \nspeed right through these votes. Senator Daschle has advised me and \neveryone here that we are going to try to maintain as close to the time \nfor the votes as possible. So there might be some people missing votes. \nEveryone should know now that we are not going to keep these votes open \nfor a long period of time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to \nSantorum amendment No. 814. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Murkowski) \nand the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Domenici) are necessarily absent.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under previous order, there will\n\n[[Page S7129]]\n\nnow be 4 minutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to the DeWine \namendment No. 842.\n  The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 842, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I have a modification of my amendment at \nthe desk. I ask unanimous consent that it be accepted.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 842), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 171, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 303. LIMITATION ON CERTAIN CLASS ACTION LITIGATION.\n\n       (a) ERISA.--Section 502 of the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1132), as amended by section \n     302, is further amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(o) Limitation on Class Action Litigation.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Any claim or cause of action that is \n     maintained under this section in connection with a group \n     health plan, or health insurance coverage issued in \n     connection with a group health plan, as a class action, \n     derivative action, or as an action on behalf of any group of \n     2 or more claimants, may be maintained only if the class, the \n     derivative claimant, or the group of claimants is limited to \n     the participants or beneficiaries of a group health plan \n     established by only 1 plan sponsor. No action maintained by \n     such class, such derivative claimant, or such group of \n     claimants may be joined in the same proceeding with any \n     action maintained by another class, derivative claimant, or \n     group of claimants or consolidated for any purpose with any \n     other proceeding. In this paragraph, the terms `group health \n     plan' and `health insurance coverage' have the meanings given \n     such terms in section 733.''.\n       ``(2) Effective date.--This subsection shall apply to all \n     civil actions that are filed on or after January 1, 2002.''.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, this amendment is a very simple one. It \nlimits class actions filed under this bill to suits filed within one \ncompany involving one plan. It is a commonsense approach. No \nindividual's rights are in any way violated. Individuals have the right \nto file suits pursuant to this bill.\n  In addition to that, class actions can still be filed, but they must \nbe filed within one company, one plan. What it basically would prohibit \nis the big national class action suits that would possibly be filed.\n  We are simply trying to balance the rights of the individual and the \nprotection of the patient with the whole problem of increasing costs.\n  We believe that the elimination of these national class action suits \nwill certainly help to keep the costs down.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, we appreciate very much the work by the \nSenator from Ohio. We appreciate him working with us. This is another \nexample of what can be accomplished when we work together. We will be \nsupporting this amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise only to say that in previous \ndebate, a story was referenced about a young patient named Christopher \nRoe, who tragically died on his 16th birthday. It was alleged that this \nhad nothing to do with the Patients' Bill of Rights. That, of course, \nis not true. Nevada, where Christopher Roe died, does not have clinical \ntrial provisions, and this boy would have clearly benefitted from such \nprovisions. This would have given him another chance for survival with \nthe help of experimental treatments.\n  When this Patients' Bill of Rights is enacted, either Nevada would \nhave to enact a substantially compliant clinical trial provision or the \nprovisions in this bill would apply. I don't want people \nmisrepresenting the notion of what is happening to some of these \npatients who deserve and ought to be able to expect to receive the \nprotections under this legislation.\n  Young Christopher Roe died at age 16 because he was required to fight \nboth cancer and the managed care organization at the same time. That is \nnot a fair fight, and it should not happen in the future. If we pass \nthis legislation, it will not happen in the future.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We yield back our time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 845\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 4 minutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to the \nGrassley amendment numbered 845.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself 1 minute.\n  A point was made last night that extending the user fees in section \n502 has no impact on the U.S. Customs Service budget. That is baloney. \nIf it has no impact, why is it in the bill in the first place? \nObviously, it is in the bill because it has an impact on budget \nscoring. Once CBO scores these funds against the Patients' Bill of \nRights, these funds cannot be used by the U.S. Customs Service for \ncustoms modernization. These funds then are no longer available to \noffset the costs of customs modernization. We will have to find funds \nsomewhere else; perhaps we can get them from the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee.\n  The U.S. Customs Service recognizes this problem: Any scoring which \nwould limit in any way the ability to fund or offset customs activity \nwould likely cause a critical funding shortfall in the Customs Service.\n  I think it is very clear.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Has all time been yielded back on the other side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. It has not.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I rise for the purpose of bringing a point of order; that \npoint of order will not be available until time has been used up on \nboth sides.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I know the chairman is going to raise a point of order, \nand I want 1 minute to respond to the point of order.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask consent that both sides yield back the time and \nthe Senator be permitted to make a point of order and each side have 2 \nminutes to explain the point of order and 2 minutes to respond to that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S7130]]\n\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, sections 502 and 503 of the bill help to \nensure that the Social Security surplus is not affected by the costs \nassociated with providing expanded patient protection.\n  The bill extends customs user fees beyond 2003. That is all. The bill \ndoes not change the current nature, structure, or purpose of these \nfees. Customs operations will not lose funds as a result of the \nextension of these fees. However, the net effect of accepting the \nGrassley amendment would be that over $6 billion in spending contained \nin this bill would not be offset. That is spending that represents a \ntransfer of funds to protect the Social Security trust fund. Deleting \nthat offset would cause the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee to exceed its committee budget allocation.\n  As a result, at the appropriate time I will raise the point of order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there will be a point of order made. If \na point of order is made, I am obviously going to waive it. I make \nclear my motion to strike would essentially allow us to replace the \nrevenues taken from the Finance Committee's jurisdiction with general \nfunds that are still available in the off-budget surplus. All Finance \nCommittee members, Republicans and Democrats alike, including my \nrespected chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, a senior member of \nthe Senate Finance Committee, should beware, a vote against my motion \nis a vote for weakening the Finance Committee's jurisdiction. If your \nmembership on the Finance Committee means anything, you need to vote in \nfavor of my motion to strike.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this goes beyond the question of \njurisdiction. This is the first test of fiscal discipline in this \nChamber. Do we adhere to the Budget Act or do we abandon fiscal \ndiscipline? That is the question on this vote. Are we going to spend \nmoney that is not offset and thereby violate the allocation that has \nbeen made to this committee and exceed the allocation that has been \nmade to this committee? I hope this body will stick with fiscal \ndiscipline and require we offset spending that is over and above the \nallocation to this committee. Spending, after all, is actually a \ntransfer of funds to protect the Social Security trust fund.\n  Mr. President, I bring, therefore, a point of order that the pending \namendment violates section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n1974.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I move to waive the point of order under section 904 of \nthe Budget Act. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? There \nis a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 846\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 4 \nminutes of debate prior to the vote in relation to the Nickles \namendment No. 846.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, the amendment we have before us now \nsays this should apply to all private-sector plans, including union \nplans. For the private-sector plans, the effective date is October 1, \n2002. But for collective bargaining plans, there is a little section on \npage 174 that says it shall not apply until the collective bargaining \nagreement terminates. In many cases, collective bargaining agreements \ndo not terminate for years and years, or they may be renegotiated.\n  My point is, we should make these protections apply, and hope they \nwill apply--if they are so positive--to all Americans, including union \nmembers. Union members should have these protections.\n  My colleague from Massachusetts asked: Was the Senator trying to \npunish the unions? I am not trying to punish anybody. Shouldn't union \nmembers have the same appeals process? Shouldn't they have the same \npatient protections we have for all private-sector plans?\n  To say we are going to exempt them for the duration of their \ncollective bargaining agreements I think is a mistake, especially when \nsome of these agreements may not terminate for years--maybe 10 years or \nmore. We should make this apply for all plans at the same time.\n  Madam President, I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nNevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, this morning the Senator from North \nDakota got up and spoke about a young man by the name of Chris Roe from \nmy State. He said this young man's parents would have been covered \nunder this bill. But according to the Department of Labor, the \nprotections in this bill do not apply to collective bargaining \nagreements. Because Chris Roe's parents were under a collective \nbargaining agreement--as a matter of fact, that collective bargaining \nagreement does not expire until years from now--the Roes would not be \ncovered.\n  Chris Roe is no longer with us, but people in the future like him \nshould be able to be covered under the same patient protections as \neverybody else under this bill.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, this is language on page 173. It is \nbasically boilerplate language, which means we have used identical \nlanguage in the HIPAA program and also in OBRA, the pension reform. It \nis basically out of respect for contracts. If you read the language it \nsays ``for plans beginning on or after October 1.'' ``For plans'' \nrefers to insurance. Most of the insurance, 60 percent of insurance \nplans start in January; 40 percent go over until the next year. So this \nwill apply at the first opportunity when those plans expire and also \nwhen collective bargaining expires.\n  That is our purpose, to do it in a timely way. I hope the Nickles \namendment will be defeated. I will offer an amendment that will say \nirrespective of collective bargaining, it will have to be done within 2 \nyears, and rollovers will not be permitted. That is the best way to do \nit. That respects the contracts. It was really done with the support of \nthe insurance industry. It has been boilerplate language that has been \nused in a number of different bills\n\n[[Page S7131]]\n\nas a way of addressing respect for contracts.\n  I hope the Nickles amendment will be defeated. We give assurance to \nthe membership that the follow-on amendment will say that every \ncontract has to be done within 2 years and that there is no \npossibility, even within that period of time, for a rollover agreement.\n  Madam President, I move to table the Nickles amendment, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Under the previous order, there will now be 4 \nminutes of debate in relation to the Brownback amendment No. 847.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I want to say that I will not be \nrequiring a vote on this amendment. At the end of a short statement, I \nwill ask unanimous consent that the vote be vitiated. I am doing this \nbecause a number of people who looked at this amendment have said they \nare very interested, intrigued, and supportive, but they are not sure \nabout the language. I think it needs to be tightened up some and \nreviewed.\n  Indeed, the chairman stated to me his desire to look at this issue in \nfurther depth later in the year. That is why I will be pulling this \nfrom a vote. We are talking about prohibiting the taking of genetic \nmaterial from outside the human species and injecting it into the human \nspecies, to where it can be passed on to future generations.\n  I point out to my colleagues that this is the modern face of \neugenics, the desire to create perfect people, as if we can become a \nbiologically perfectible artifact. This is a dangerous thing. It is an \nugly thing that has reared its head in history previously, and its \nmodern face involves taking genetic material wherever we can find it \nand putting it in. It should be banned. It is currently allowed. It is \ncurrently being researched in this country. It should be stopped.\n  I look forward to working with the chairman of the HELP Committee to \nsee if we can tighten up the language to address it in the Congress in \nthe near term before people start actually doing this. It is completely \nallowed now, with no prohibitions. We limit it more in other species \nthan we do in humans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the rollcall vote on the Brownback \namendment be vitiated and that the amendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 849\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 4 \nminutes of debate in relation to the Ensign amendment No. 849.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I am going to ask unanimous consent in a \nmoment to temporarily lay this amendment aside so we can work out the \nlanguage. There seems to be support on both sides of the aisle for this \namendment. There is just slight disagreement on the language.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my amendment No. 849 be temporarily laid \naside to recur at the concurrence of the bill managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 848\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 4 \nminutes of debate on amendment No. 848 by the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, we can actually have a vote on this \namendment. This amendment is about protecting health care providers who \nvoluntarily give of themselves, give of their services, and this \namendment will protect them from being sued.\n  Last night in the debate, the Senator from North Carolina mentioned \nthe Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 already takes care of the health \ncare providers. In fact, it does not. It defines a volunteer as ``an \nindividual performing services for a nonprofit organization or \ngovernmental entity who does not receive compensation or any other \nthing of value in lieu of compensation.''\n  I was speaking to one of my neighbors. He is a general surgeon. He \nwas just in an emergency room last week. He saw a patient who did not \nhave health insurance, could not afford to pay, and he voluntarily saw \nthis patient. I do not think it would be right for people to volunteer \nand then be sued.\n  My amendment says if, out of the goodness of your heart, you work at \na clinic, such as Dr. Chanderraj, a friend of mine who is a \ncardiologist in Las Vegas--he takes care of the poor on the weekends, \nand yet he has to carry malpractice insurance.\n  Many doctors and health care providers who volunteer their services \nfor the poor should be encouraged, not discouraged, to give their \nservices.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment. It is the right thing to do, \njust as the Good Samaritan Act and the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 \nwere the right things to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired. Who yields time in \nopposition? The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Madam President, Senator Coverdell offered legislation \nin 1997, as the Senator referred to, called the Volunteer Protection \nAct that does what this amendment is aimed at. It provides specific \nprotection for people who provide volunteer services. Physicians are \nincluded in that legislation.\n  Further, there is a specific provision in that legislation which \nprovides that State laws can remain in effect and States are given wide \nlatitude to opt out and enact their own legislation on this issue. \nThere is no such provision in this amendment.\n  Legislation, offered by Senator Coverdell and passed in 1997, covers \nthis issue. If the Senator wants to attempt to amend that legislation, \nthat would be the appropriate vehicle, not this vehicle. This \nlegislation we are debating today is the Bipartisan Patient Protection \nAct. It is about HMO accountability and HMO reform. These issues that \nare not directly related to HMO reform and HMO accountability do not \nbelong on this legislation. For that reason, we oppose this particular \namendment.\n  I yield the floor. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n\n[[Page S7132]]\n\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.

Can we have order, Mr. President? We have had great \ncooperation of the Members. We have made good progress during the \nmorning. We thank Senator Gregg for outlining the series of amendments \nand\n\n[[Page S7133]]\n\nthe time that will be necessary. We are moving along with consideration \nof the legislation. The Senator from Tennessee is entitled to be heard. \nCan we have order in the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate cannot proceed until there is order \nin the Senate. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, this amendment has to do with the \nexhaustion of administrative remedies. As stated the other day, we have \nin this underlying legislation quite an elaborate procedure for \nadministrative review so independent entities, at at least two \ndifferent levels, have an opportunity to make a determination on a \nclaim. Then the underlying bill allows a claimant to go to court if \nthey are not satisfied. The problem we saw in the underlying bill is in \nmany cases there was not a requirement that that administrative process \nbe gone through, that very easily you could jump right to the court.\n  I think no one really wants to do that. We have set up this \nadministrative appeal process, which is a good one, and we want to use \nit.\n  What we seek to do in this amendment is to basically require the \nexhaustion of administrative review, administrative remedies, before a \nclaimant goes to court.\n  We had a good discussion with the other side. The concern was \nexpressed that the modification should recognize an injury for which a \nclaim has been denied might later become more serious, after the \ntimeframe for exhausting external review has expired.\n  That is a legitimate concern. If someone has a later-developed injury \nthat did not manifest itself early on, there should be a provision so \nthey are not deemed to not have exhausted administrative review so they \ncould never go to court. So we have addressed that in this \nmodification.\n  The other concern was what if the external entity simply sits on the \nmatter and doesn't come within the 21 days allowed under the bill to \nmake its determination. We say in this modification, if the external \nentity takes longer than that, we give them another 10 days and then we \nallow the claimant to go to court.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I ask for an additional 20 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Under those circumstances, the claimant would still \nhave to exhaust their administrative appeal, but they could go ahead \nand file the lawsuit in the meantime under, what I think are very rare \ncircumstances. So with that modification I think we have a good process \nset up so this elaborate administrative process we have established in \nthe bill will actually be utilized.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  May we have order in the Chamber, please.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Senator from Tennessee. This is another \nexample of what can be done when we tackle these problems together and \ntry to find solutions. As the issue of scope and employer liability, \nwith a number of Senators on both sides of the aisle, now we are doing \nit on the issue of exhaustion of administrative remedies, exhaustion of \nappeals.\n\n  This amendment meets the very principle by which we began this \nlegislative drafting, which is we want patients to get the care they \nneed. The most effective way to do that is to have an effective appeals \nprocess.\n  What we have done in this process is, No. 1, require that the \npatient, the claimant, go through the appeal before going to court, \nexhausting those appeals. That is the easiest way and the most \nefficient way to get them the care they need.\n  The second thing we do is provide an outlet in case the appeals \nprocess drags on and it does not operate the way it should. If it is \nlonger than 31 days, then the patient will be able to go to court. But, \nas the Senator from Tennessee points out, they will have to \nsimultaneously exhaust the administrative appeal.\n  Third, we have now provided specifically that the result of the \nadministrative appeal will be admissible in any court proceeding, which \nis another important element of this amendment.\n  I thank my friend from Tennessee. I thank him for working with us on \nthis issue. I think we have an issue about which we now have consensus \nand we are pleased to be there.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Were the yeas and nays ordered on the amendment or the \nmodification?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They were ordered on the amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the yeas and nays \nbe vitiated on the amendment and they be ordered on the modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Thompson amendment No. 819, as \nmodified.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. \nDomenici) and the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Murkowski) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 98, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 213 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--98\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Domenici\n     Murkowski\n       \n  The amendment (No. 819), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee and the \nSenator from North Carolina. The last amendment was an important \namendment. It was a major step forward. That amendment, along with the \nSnowe amendment and several others that have passed, has immeasurably \nhelped this legislation.\n  I thank the Senator from Tennessee and the Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I join with the comments of the Senator \nfrom Arizona. In the trades, that was ``a biggie.'' It was a very \npositive action to make sure that the exhaustion of the appeals process \nis a true exhaustion of the appeals process and we don't go straight to \nthe court system. I congratulate the Senators from North Carolina and \nTennessee for achieving that resolution.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 847\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to oppose amendment No. 847 offered \nby my friend from Kansas, Senator Brownback.\n  This amendment purports to establish safeguards with respect to \nmedical treatments that encompass therapies directed at genetic \ndefects. The amendment would impose criminal sanctions, including \nimprisonment of up to 10\n\n[[Page S7134]]\n\nyears, on those who violate the restrictions on modifying the human \ngenetic structure.\n  Not only is this the wrong time to consider this amendment, it is \nalso the wrong piece of legislation on which to consider this \namendment. In all candor, I must tell my colleagues that in my view, \nbased on my preliminary reading of this amendment, I greatly doubt \nthere will ever be a right time for this proposal.\n  I have no doubt that this amendment is well-intentioned.\n  I have worked with Senator Brownback many times in the past on many \nissues, including many important right-to-life issues, such as \noutlawing partial birth abortion. Both he and I are proud to call \nourselves pro-life Senators.\n  But, as my colleagues are aware, Senator Brownback and I happen to \ndisagree on the issue of federal funding for embryonic stem cell \nresearch. I understand and completely respect his views on this issue.\n  In a nutshell, the Brownback amendment attempts to regulate genetic \nresearch. But I am afraid that it might regulate this critical avenue \nof research right out of existence.\n  This is an exceedingly complex and dynamic field of science.\n  It is certainly not the type of legislation that we want to attach as \na non-germane amendment to a bill that does not directly relate to \nbiomedical research.\n  My goodness, we have our hands full enough with HMOs and the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. We do not need to further complicate an \nalready complex bill with this language.\n  Why do we need to take floor time on this proposal? Have there been \nhearings on this language? Has there been a committee mark-up on this \nbill?\n  Isn't the reason why we have committee hearings and committee mark-\nups so that complex issues can be adequately aired by members of the \ncritical committees before the full Senate debates an issue?\n  There is much virtue for letting legislation ripen and be scrutinized \nin committee before the entire body debates the merits of proposals \nsuch as this amendment.\n  I think we should defeat this amendment today so that the relevant \ncommittees can thoroughly review this legislation.\n  While I strongly believe that we should defeat this amendment on \nstrictly procedural grounds, I do want to make a few comments on some \ninitial problems that I have with respect to the substance of the bill.\n  First, because there are over 300 diseases thought to be caused by a \ndefect in a single gene, we must be extremely careful that we do not \ncut off or unduly impede vital research on such diseases.\n  As a co-sponsor of the Orphan Drug Act of 1984, I know very well how \nmillions of American families must struggle each day with small \npopulation but highly debilitating diseases such as multiple sclerosis, \nALS, and Fragile X Syndrome.\n  The problem with the Brownback amendment is that it appears to thwart \nresearch on gene therapies that may lead one day to cures for many of \nthese single-gene diseases. It would not be right for the Senate to \nhastily adopt language that derails research on such crippling diseases \nas Alzheimer's or Parkinson's.\n  I am concerned with what the definition of human germline gene \nmodification in section 301 of the Brownback bill could do when it is \nread in context of section 302 of his legislation. The amendment's \ndefinition of human germline modification is ambiguous.\n  As one attorney representing the biotechnology industry has \ncharacterized the reach of this definition:\n\n       Among other problems, which of the examples listed are \n     ``sources'' of ``forms'' of DNA and why does it matter? \n     Moreover, the sentence--and he is referring to the first \n     definition in section 301 which describes human germline \n     modification--ends by referring to ``including DNA from any \n     source, and in any form, such as nuclei, chromosomes, \n     nuclear, mitochondrial, and synthetic DNA.'' To what part of \n     the first sentence defining ``human germline modification'' \n     is the language referring? Does the last sentence of the \n     definition, ``Nor does it include the change of DNA involved \n     in the normal process of sexual reproduction'' prohibit in \n     vitro fertilization? Does any part of the amendment prohibit \n     or allow in vitro fertilization? What genetic technologies \n     does ``normal'' cover, if any?\n\n  Without objection, I would like to place in the Recrd a copy of this \nlegal memorandum prepared by Edward Korweck of the law firm of Hogan & \nHartson. As I understand it, this memorandum was written on behalf of \nBIO, the biotechnology industry association.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to place in the Record a copy of a \nletter from BIO to Senator Lott opposing the Brownback amendment. This \nletter voices its opposition to the amendment by stating:\n\n       Let's not cripple essential medical research for a host of \n     chronic and fatal diseases such as diabetes, Parkinson's \n     disease, Alzheimer's disease, and various cancers. The \n     patients and families who suffer from these diseases are \n     looking to advances in medical research to develop cures and \n     better treatments for them.\n\n  This argument must be considered by all members of the Senate.\n  The question of how in vitro fertilization relates to the normal \nprocess of sexual reproduction is a question of great importance \nbecause it appears to directly implicate the science of embryonic stem \ncell research.\n  Specifically, we need to know this language would treat research with \nhuman pluripotent stem cells.\n  We all know where Senator Brownback stands on that issue. While I \ngenerally agree with my friend from Kansas, I disagree with him on \nembryonic stem cell research.\n  This is an issue that deserves careful consideration by each Senate. \nI welcome this debate. But today is not the time. We simply need to \nknow all the implications of the Brownback language before we even \nconsider such legislation.\n  In my view, this Senate should go on record as supporting federal \nfunding for embryonic stem cell research. And we certainly do not want \nto turn back the clock on the type of gene therapy research that has \nbeen conducted for over 20 years.\n  This is simply not the kind of measure that you try to slip into an \nunrelated bill.\n  All interested parties--patient groups, religious and advocacy \norganizations, scientists, health care providers, biotechnology firms--\ndeserve to be fully consulted on how the language of this measure will \naffect their interests.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Biotechnology Industry Organization,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 27, 2001.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: On behalf of the Biotechnology Industry \n     Organization (BIO), I am writing to express BIO's opposition \n     to an amendment that may be offered by Senator Brownback \n     regarding germ line gene modification. This amendment may \n     come up for a vote on the Senate floor as early as today \n     during consideration of S. 1052--the McCain, Kennedy, Edwards \n     Bipartisan Patient Protection Act. I urge you to vote against \n     the Brownback amendment if it comes up for a vote.\n       BIO opposes germ line gene modification and we support the \n     moratorium on germ line gene modification that has been in \n     place for over a decade. This moratorium has allowed critical \n     genomic research to continue while prohibiting unsafe and \n     unethical work. To our knowledge, all scientists have \n     complied with this moratorium.\n       Unfortunately, the Brownback amendment reaches far beyond \n     germ line gene modification. It attempts to regulate genetic \n     research--a complex and dynamic field of science that holds \n     great potential for patients with serious and often life-\n     threatening illnesses. This proposal also could prohibit \n     research on human pluripotent stem cells. Since these cells \n     have been demonstrated to form any cell in the body they hold \n     enormous therapeutic potential.\n       Let's not cripple essential medical research for host of \n     chronic and fatal diseases such as diabetes, Parkinson's \n     disease, Alzheimer's disease and various cancers. The \n     patients and families who suffer from these diseases are \n     looking to advances in medical research to develop cures and \n     better treatments for them.\n       Furthermore, to our knowledge there has been no \n     consultation with the scientific community, researchers, \n     physicians, or patient groups prior to the filing of the \n     Brownback amendment. This is particularly troubling because \n     the amendment calls for severe sanctions, including \n     imprisonment of biotech researchers.\n       I urge you to vote against this amendment. If you have \n     questions, please call me at 202-857-0244. Thank you for your \n     consideration on this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     W. Lee Rawls,\n                             Vice President, Government Relations.\n\n[[Page S7135]]\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n                                                    June 28, 2001.\n     To: Michael Werner, Esquire, BIO Bioethics Counsel.\n     From: Edward L. Korwek, Ph.D., J.D.\n     Re: Some Initial Comments/Analysis of the Brownback \n         Amendment.\n       The Brownback Amendment is poorly worded and confusing as \n     to its precise coverage. It uses a variety of scientific \n     terms and other complex language both to prohibit and allow \n     certain gene modification activities. Many of the sentences \n     are composed of language that is incorrect or ambiguous from \n     a scientific standpoint. A determination needs to be made of \n     what each sentence of the Amendment is intended to \n     accomplish.\n       As to a few of the important definitions, the term \n     ``somatic cell'' is defined in proposed section 301(3) of \n     Chapter 16, as ``a diploid cell (having two sets of the \n     chromosomes of almost all body cells) obtained or derived \n     from a living or deceased human body at any stage of \n     development.'' What does ``of almost all body cells'' mean? \n     Is this an oblique reference to the haploid nature of human \n     sex cells, i.e., sperm and eggs? Also, why is it important to \n     describe in such confusing detail from where the cells are \n     derived (in contrast to simply saying, for example, a somatic \n     cell is a human diploid cell)? From a scientific standpoint, \n     the definition of a somatic cell is not dependent on whether \n     the cell is from living or dead human beings. More \n     importantly, as to this human source issue, when does a \n     ``human body'' exist such that its status as `'living'' or \n     ``dead'' or its ``stages of development'' become relevant \n     criteria for determining what is a ``somatic cell.''\n       Similarly, the definition of ``human germline \n     modification,'' especially the first sentence, is very \n     convoluted. The first sentence states:\n       ``The term `human germline gene modification' means the \n     intentional modification of DNA of any human cell (including \n     human eggs, sperm, fertilized eggs (i.e., embryos, or any \n     early cells that will differentiate into gametes or can be \n     manipulated to do so) for the purpose of producing a genetic \n     change which can be passed on to future individuals, \n     including DNA from any source, and in any form, such as \n     nuclei, chromosomes, nuclear, mitochondrial, and synthetic \n     DNA.''\n       Among other problems which of the examples listed are \n     ``sources'' or ``forms'' of DNA and why does it matter? \n     Moreover, the sentence ends by referring to ``including DNA \n     from any source, and in any form, such as nuclei, \n     chromosomes, nuclear, mito-chondrial, and synthetic DNA.'' To \n     what part of the first sentence defining ``human germline \n     modification'' is this language referring? Does the last \n     sentence of the definition, ``Nor does it include the change \n     of DNA involved in the normal process of sexual \n     reproduction'' prohibit in vitro fertilization? Does any \n     other part of the Amendment prohibit or allow in vitro \n     fertilization? What genetic technologies does ``normal'' \n     cover, if any?\n       Similarly, the second sentence in the definition, stating \n     what is not covered by the definition of ``human germline \n     modification,'' contains three ``not'' words, leaving the \n     reader to decipher what exactly is ``not'' human germline \n     modification'': ``The term does not include any modification \n     of cells that are not a part of and will not be used to \n     construct human embryos'' (emphasis added). Also, what is an \n     ``embryo'' for purposes of this Amendment and what does \n     ``part of'' mean? Are (fertilized) sex cells ``part of'' an \n     embryo?\n       These and other problems leave the bill unsupportable in \n     its current form. Due to this imprecision, the amendment's \n     impact is unclear and seemingly far reaching.\n\n\n                           amendment No. 848\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, this pro bono amendment will benefit \ndoctors across the country. A prime example is my neighbor, Dr. Dan \nMcBride. Dr. McBride has provided medical care to individuals and \nfamilies free-of-charge for years. He understands that not all Nevadans \ncan afford health care insurance each month, and that many cannot even \nafford to go to the doctor once each year; but that does not mean that \nthey are not deserving of proper health care. This amendment will \nensure that doctors such as Dan McBride can continue providing free \nhealth care to the less fortunate without fear of lawsuits.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 849\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today we are at the threshold of \nastonishing new progress in medicine. New discoveries in genetics and \nother areas of biomedical research will revolutionize the diagnosis and \ntreatment of countless disorders. This astonishing potential to relieve \nsuffering will be squandered if patients fear that their private \ngenetic information will become the property of their insurance \ncompanies and their employers, where it can be used to deny people \nhealth care and deny workers their jobs.\n  To protect all Americans against genetic discrimination in health \ninsurance and employment, I am proud to support the important \nlegislation that Senator Daschle has introduced on this issue. I \ncommend my colleague, Senator Ensign for bringing this basic issue to \nthe floor of the Senate, and I look forward to working closely with him \nin the days to come.\n  However, Senator Ensign's amendment has several shortcomings that \nlead me to believe that it is not the right policy for us to adopt to \nend genetic discrimination. Yet in the interests of stimulating debate \non this important issue and to speed the termination of debate on the \nPatients' Bill of Rights, I am prepared to accept it as an amendment to \nthe bill. But next month, in our Committee, we will have a full and \nthoughtful discussion of this issue in our committee and a thorough \ndebate on the Senate floor.\n  Senator Ensign's amendment fails to provide protections that are \nessential. The amendment does not address the important issue of \ndiscrimination in the workplace. Genetic discrimination in employment \nis real and it's happening all across America. Effective legislation on \nthis issue must include protections for workers.\n  We must realize that genetic information will be commonplace in \nmedicine and we must ensure that our definitions adequately protect \ngenetic information in all its forms. Unfortunately, the definitions of \ngenetic information contained in the Ensign amendment do not properly \nprotect genetic information. The definitions in this legislation allow \nemployers and others to find dangerous loopholes in the protections \noffered by the legislation.\n  Finally, the remedies in the Ensign amendment do not provide adequate \nremedies for those whose rights have been violated. We should make sure \nthat we allow those whose rights have been violated to seek proper \nrecourse.\n  Despite these and other flaws in the Ensign amendment, I am prepared \nto accept the measure as a spur to future debate on this important \nissue. We will start from a clean slate in our committee deliberations \nand we will give this issue the thorough exploration it deserves. I \nlook forward to a fresh debate and to taking action on Senator \nDaschle's important legislation.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in an effort to move forward and complete \ndebate on the Patient's Bill of Rights, the Ensign amendment on genetic \ndiscrimination, along with several other proposals, were included in a \nmanagers' package without a full vote of the Senate. It must be \nclarified that there are several problems with the Ensign proposal as \noffered, and we do not support this approach for dealing with genetic \ndiscrimination.\n  First, the Ensign amendment does not comprehensively address the \nproblem of genetic discrimination. This amendment only covers genetic \ndiscrimination in health insurance and is silent on discrimination in \nthe workplace. Simply prohibiting genetic discrimination in health \ninsurance, while allowing it to continue in employment is no solution \nat all. Employers will simply weed out employees with a genetic marker. \nAdditionally, the protections the amendment provides are so riddled \nwith loopholes that health insurance providers would still have \nsubstantial access to individuals' private genetic information.\n  Recently, employees working at Burlington Northern Railroad were \nsubjected to genetic testing without their knowledge or consent. The \ncompany was attempting to determine if any of the employees had a \ngenetic predisposition for carpal tunnel syndrome--in an attempt to \navoid covering any costs associated with the injury. Giving up your \nprivate genetic information shouldn't be the price you pay for being \nemployed.\n  The Ensign amendment also fails to comprehensively cover all of the \ninsured. We must create protections for all Americans regardless of \nwhere an individual gets his or her health insurance coverage. It is \nunconscionable to allow genetic information to be used to discriminate \nagainst anyone--access must be limited appropriately to ensure that no \nAmerican is left vulnerable.\n  Finally, the Ensign amendment does not create a private right \naction--leaving individuals without an adequate remedy. Clearly, \nproviding protections without proper enforcement provisions makes any \nprotection meaningless.\n  We've seen a revolution in our understanding of genetics--scientists \nhave finished mapping our genetic code, and\n\n[[Page S7136]]\n\nresearchers are developing extraordinary new tests to determine if a \nperson is at risk of developing a particular disease. But with \nincreased understanding of the possibilities of the genome uncovers, \ncomes increased responsibilities. We simply cannot take one step \nforward in science while taking two steps back in civil rights.\n  The HELP committee will move forward with consideration of this issue \nthis summer. We welcome the opportunity to work with Senator Ensign and \nother Republicans on a comprehensive genetic non-discrimination bill \nthat can command bipartisan support. It is our hope that we can bring \nup and pass a bill later this summer.\n  Mr. GREGG. I now propound a unanimous consent request relative to the \norder of the following amendments to which we will be proceeding. The \nfirst would be Senator Smith for 30 minutes equally divided. The second \nwould be Senator Allard, 30 minutes equally divided. The third \namendment would be Senator Nickles, 30 minutes equally divided. The \nfourth would be Senator Santorum, 40 minutes equally divided. And the \nfifth would be Senator Craig, 30 minutes equally divided.\n  The substance of the amendments or the purposes of the amendments \nhave been presented to the other side. I can run through those if \nMembers wish to hear them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senator has shared the substance. \nMembers will hear the explanations, but the Smith amendment deals with \ntax credits; the Allard amendment, with exclusions for smaller \nbusinesses in terms of the numbers of employees; the Nickles amendment \nis an expansion to other Federal health programs; Santorum deals with \npunitive damages; and the Craig amendment deals with medical savings \naccounts. We are familiar with the subject matter. We have no objection \nto that as an order, and we believe the time recommended will help us \nmove this process along and will be sufficient to evaluate the \namendments.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we want to just make sure that the vote is \nin relation to the amendments offered in the usual form with no second-\ndegree amendments in order prior to the vote.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is acceptable----\n  Mr. REID. And also that the time limit be as outlined and the time \nfor debate--there would be an opportunity to file a motion prior to the \nvote in relation to the amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Do you mean a motion to table?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator so amends his request?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I inquire of the Senator from Nevada \nwhether or not it would be possible to stack these votes or whether the \njury is still out on that?\n  Mr. REID. We should wait on that. We have a number of people on this \nside who want to vote after every amendment. We will work on that.\n  Mr. GREGG. I point out to the Senator, as I know and he knows, by not \nstacking the votes we add a considerable amount of time to this \nexercise. We are trying to move these amendments in a prompt and \nreasonable fashion. I think that has been shown in the process \nthroughout the weeks here. We end up delaying if we don't stack votes.\n  Mr. REID. The managers have worked so hard and the leaders have \nconferred about this legislation. We will work on that. We hope that \nthe Senator from New Hampshire will give us a finite list of \namendments. Once that happens, I am sure we can quickly arrive at a \ntime to dispose of this and the votes could be stacked.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n\n\n                            motion to commit\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I send a motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Smith] moves to commit the \n     bill, S. 1052, as amended, to the Committee on Finance with \n     instructions to report H.R. 3 back to the Senate forthwith \n     with an amendment.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nfurther reading of the motion be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The motion is as follows:\n\n       Mr. Smith of Oregon moves to commit the bill S. 1052, as \n     amended, to the Committee on Finance with instructions to \n     report H.R. 3 back to the Senate forthwith with an amendment \n     that--\n       (1) strikes all after the enacting clause and inserts the \n     text of S. 1052, as amended,\n       (2) makes the research and development tax credit permanent \n     and increases the rates of the alternative incremental \n     research and development tax credit as provided in S. 41,\n       (3) provides that H.R. 3, as amended pursuant to paragraphs \n     (1) and (2), does not negatively impact the social security \n     trust funds or result in an on-budget surplus that is less \n     than the medicare surplus account, and\n       (4) provides that H.R. 3, as so amended, is not subject to \n     a budget point of order.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, for myself, Senator Hatch, \nSenator Allen, and others, I have sent to the desk a motion to commit \nS. 1052 to the Finance Committee with instructions to make permanent \nthe research and development tax credit. We are joined in this also by \nSenators Crapo, Craig, Bennett, Brownback, Burns, Hutchinson, Allen, \nand Enzi.\n  As a Member of the Senate high-tech task force, I believe that the \nR tax credit is essential to the technology community, and also to \nthe pharmaceutical community.\n  This credit encourages investment in basic research that, over the \nlong term, can lead to the development of new, cheaper, and better \ntechnology products and services. The research and development is \ncertainly essential for long-term economic growth.\n  Innovations in science and technology has fueled the massive economic \nexpansion we have witnessed over the course of the 20th century. These \nachievements have improved the standard of living for nearly every \nAmerican. Simply put, the research tax credit is an investment in \neconomic growth, new jobs, and the important new products and processes \nthat we need in our lives.\n  The R tax credit must be made permanent. This credit, which was \noriginally enacted in 1981, has only been temporarily extended 10 \ntimes. Permanent extension is long overdue.\n  Because this vital credit isn't permanent, it offers businesses less \nvalue than it should. Businesses, unlike Congress, must plan and budget \nin a multiyear process. Scientific enterprise does not neatly fit into \ncalendar or fiscal years.\n  R development projects typically take a number of years, and may \neven last longer than a decade. As our business leaders plan these \nprojects, they need to know whether or not they can count on this tax \ncredit.\n  The current uncertainty surrounding the credit has induced businesses \nto allocate significantly less to research than they otherwise would if \nthey knew the tax credit would be available in future years. This \nuncertainty undermines the entire purpose of the credit.\n  Investment in R is important because it spurs innovation and \neconomic growth. Information technology, for example, was responsible \nfor more than one-third of the real economic growth in 1995 through \n1998.\n  Information technology industries account for more than $500 billion \nof the annual U.S. economy. R is widely seen as a cornerstone of \ntechnological innovations which, in turn, serves as a primary engine of \nlong-term economic growth.\n  The tax credit will drive wages higher. Findings from a study, for \nexample, conducted by Coopers & Lybrand show that workers in every \nState will benefit from higher wages if the research credit is made \npermanent.\n  Payroll increases as a result of gains in productivity stemming from \nthe credit have been estimated to exceed $60 billion over the next 12 \nyears.\n  Furthermore, greater productivity from additional research and \ndevelopment will increase overall economic growth in every state in the \nUnion. Research and development is essential for long-term economic \ngrowth.\n  The tax credit is cost-effective. The R tax credit appears to be a \ncost-effective policy instrument for increasing business R \ninvestment. Some recent studies suggest that one dollar of\n\n[[Page S7137]]\n\nthe credit's revenue cost leads to a one dollar increase in business \nR spending.\n  There is broad support among Republicans for the credit, and \nPresident Bush included the credit in the $1.6 trillion tax relief \nplan.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I thank Senator \nHatch and Senator Allen, the chief cosponsors, for providing us with \nthe opportunity of increasing the size of the tax cut to include this \nimportant priority but which, unfortunately, was left out of the tax \nbill that we recently passed.\n  Before I yield to Senator Allen for his comments, I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second?\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Allen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment and very \nmuch thank Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon for his leadership and for \ngiving us the opportunity to vote on this very important amendment and \nprinciple and tax policy that is essential for the United States to \ncompete and succeed in the future. I also commend the Senator from \nUtah, Mr. Orrin Hatch, for all his work over the years, and especially \nthis year, in advocating this measure.\n  As chairman of the high-tech task force on the Republican side of the \nSenate, we have endorsed this idea. We have been working on this idea. \nUnfortunately, as the Senator said, it was not included in the tax \nbill. But the reason that this is so important is that research and \ntechnology--generally speaking, research in biotechnology and \npharmaceuticals--is at stake with this amendment and this research and \ndevelopment tax credit.\n  Up here in Washington, we are making decisions for a year or so, or \neven a 5-year budget, and even once in a while we do projections over \n10 years. In private industry and business, their planning needs to be \nlong-term. In particular, when you think of research and development \ninto pharmaceuticals, the amount of research that goes into putting \nforward a drug before getting it to patent, to the market, and so \nforth, it is not just the research and the labs; there are clinical \ntrials that go on year after year, and hopefully you will get a patent; \nand for a short period of time you will have a window of opportunity on \nthat prescription drug, for example.\n  So this tax policy is very important so that businesses have \ncertainty, that there is credibility, stability, predictability to \ndevote the millions and, indeed, in some cases, billions of dollars to \nresearch and development and technology.\n  The issue is jobs and competition for the people of the United \nStates. We, as Americans, need to lead in technological advances. The \nR tax credit is very important in microchips or semiconductor chips. \nIt is important in communications research and development. It is \nimportant in life sciences and medical sciences and, obviously, that \nincludes biotechnology and pharmaceuticals.\n  Making the R tax credit permanent, as Senator Smith says, actually \nis cost effective. It makes a great deal of sense. Studies suggest \nevery dollar of revenue cost leads to a $1 increase in business R \nspending. These are good jobs and it also allows us as a country to \ncompete.\n  A permanent extension is long overdue. As Senator Smith said, it has \nbeen extended every now and then for a few years. Once in a while it \nlapses. Businesses cannot plan that way. They have to make sure it \nstays constant. Publicly traded companies have their quarterly reports, \ntheir shareholder reports, and the amount of investment they get in \ntheir companies based on how they are operating and managing that \ncompany.\n  If you have changing tax laws or lack of credible, predictable tax \npolicies that foul up that whole system, that makes them less likely to \nwant to invest and take the risk of billions of dollars in research and \ndevelopment if they are not certain of the long term.\n  This amendment to make the research and development tax credit \npermanent will spur more American investment; it will create more \nAmerican jobs--and they are good paying jobs--and that will lead us to \nbetter products, better devices, better systems, and better medicines.\n  I hope the Senate will work in a unified fashion on this amendment by \nSenator Smith to make permanent the research and development tax credit \nso Americans get those good jobs, but, most importantly, allow America \nto compete and succeed and make sure America is in the lead on \ntechnological advances, whether they are in communications, in \neducation, in manufacturing, or the medical or life sciences.\n  I again thank the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Smith, for his great \nleadership, as well as that of Orrin Hatch.\n  I yield back the time I have at this moment and reserve whatever time \nmay remain on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is a Patients' Bill of Rights bill. \nThis is not a defense bill. This is not a foreign aid bill. This is not \nan agriculture bill. This is not a tax bill. This is the Patients' Bill \nof Rights bill.\n  The amendment offered by my good friend from Oregon is not a \nPatients' Bill of Rights amendment. It is a tax amendment. In fact, he \nwould like to report out of the Finance Committee, by his amendment, a \nbill that is currently in the Senate Finance Committee, a tax bill. Tax \nlegislation does not properly lie at this moment on this bill. Pure and \nsimple. Full stop. That ends it.\n  I also say to my good friend from Oregon, I agree with permanent \nextension of the R tax credit. I daresay a majority of Senators \nagree. I cosponsored legislation in the past. The Finance Committee \nreported out a permanent extension, and the Senate-passed tax bill, \nthat huge tax bill of $1.35 trillion, included permanent extension of \nthe tax credit. Unfortunately, it did not survive in conference, but it \nis clear that the R tax credit has enormous support in this body.\n  Does anybody here think there is not going to be another tax bill? Of \ncourse, nobody here believes there will not be another tax bill. There \nwill be tax legislation this year. That is clear. The appropriate time \nfor this Senate to appropriately include considering permanent \nextension of the R tax credit is when the tax legislation comes up.\n  The current provision expires December 31, not 2001, not December 31, \n2002, not December 31, 2003; it expires December 31, 2004, over 3 years \naway. In all the years we have been extending the R tax credit, that \nis probably the longest extension that has existed.\n  I agree with my good friend; it should be permanent. This yo-yo, up-\nand-down, back-and-forth, on-again off-again application of the R tax \ncredit by this body does not make good sense. It is wrong.\n  This is not a tax bill; this is a Patients' Bill of Rights bill. \nThere will be tax legislation. When there is tax legislation before \nthis body, that is the time we can appropriately consider permanently \nextending the R tax credit.\n  I wish my good friend would withdraw his amendment because this is \nnot the proper time and place for it. If he does not wish to withdraw \nit, I urge my colleagues to not support it because this is not the time \nand place. Were it to pass, the door would be open and we would be \nwriting another tax bill. We have already passed a big tax bill. We \npassed a tax bill of 1.35 trillion bucks. That is a big tax bill. This \nis not the time and place.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield to my good friend from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as chairman of the Finance Committee, the \nSenator from Montana made commitments to a number of people, including \nthis Senator, that he is going to do everything in his power as \nchairman of the Finance Committee to make sure there are other tax \nvehicles this year; is that true?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is absolutely true. There are many Senators who \nwanted to offer tax provisions to this bill but deferred, recognizing \nthis is not the time and place. It is Ecclesiastes, Mr. President: \nEssentially there is a time and place for everything. This is not the \nright time and place for tax legislation.\n\n[[Page S7138]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my colleague yield to me for a question?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask how much time is remaining on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes to the opponents; 4 1/2 minutes \nto the proponents.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield to my good friend from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to ask the distinguished chairman of the Finance \nCommittee this question. As someone who comes from the largest State in \nthe Union, on the cutting edge of high tech, making the R R \nsometimes called--tax credit permanent has been a priority of mine for \na long time.\n  Will my friend tell me, if this is such an important priority to \nthose who, in fact, had the majority at the time the tax bill was \nwritten, namely, the Republicans, and the President certainly was \nworking at that time with Senator Grassley, could they not have put the \nextension of the R tax credit into the big tax bill that was brought \nto this Chamber?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator from California makes a very \ngood point. Clearly, the President could have included a permanent \nextension of the R tax credit in his proposed tax legislation. The \nSenate was then controlled by the Republican Party, and it certainly \ncould have put in the R tax credit, and it probably would have \nsurvived conference if they pushed it.\n  I say to my friend from California, this is only speculation, but \nthat was not provided for because the current extension, the current \nprovision is in place at least until December 31, 2004. So there is \ntime for the R tax credit to take effect, and at a later date we can \nmake it permanent.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, then that is the same comment we can \nmake to our colleagues who are trying to put this on a Patients' Bill \nof Rights. The R tax credit is in effect until 2004. Let's get an \nappropriate vehicle where we can all walk together and support the R \ntax credit and not put it on the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  I thank my friend for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Montana, \nI want to put this on whatever moves. I know it does not expire until \n2004. I also know President Bush did include this in his original tax \nbill, but that was moved down then. It was unfortunate it was moved \ndown.\n  I want to see us do it as quickly as we can for the simple reason \nthat businesses need to make planning and expenditures that last an \nawful long time. The year 2004 does not fit with some of those plans \nthat need to be made.\n  This is not unrelated to medicine and patients' health. Part of the \ntechnological development we are hoping to continue to provide to our \npeople is in the pharmaceutical and biotechnological areas which do \nhave a direct bearing on patients' health. The best right a patient can \nhave is good health. This will facilitate that a great deal, perhaps as \nmuch as anything else in the bill.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to send a modification of my motion to the \ndesk.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object, could the Senator share \nwith the Senate the contents of the modification; otherwise, I will be \nconstrained to object.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. It is simply to comply with the \nParliamentarian's request to be consistent with Senate requirements.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The motion, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Mr. Smith of Oregon moves to commit the bill S. 1052, as \n     amended, to the Committee on Finance with instructions to \n     report S. 1052 back to the Senate within 14 days with an \n     amendment that--\n       (1) makes the research and development tax credit permanent \n     and increases the rates of the alternative incremental \n     research and development tax credit as provided in S. 41,\n       (2) provides that S. 1052, as amended pursuant to paragraph \n     (1), does not negatively impact the social security trust \n     funds or result in an on-budget surplus that is less than the \n     medicare surplus account, and\n       (3) provides that S. 1052, as so amended, is not subject to \n     a budget point of order.\n\n  Mr. REID. Has everyone yielded back their time?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. To wrap up in response to some of the assertions and \ncomments made in opposition to this amendment, the reason this \namendment is necessary is, unfortunately, the other side of the aisle \nknocked out the amount of the tax cut we wanted and omitted small \nfamily farms and small businesses against the research and development \ntax credit. Senator Hatch was working mightily, with the support of \nmany Members, to try to get this into the tax cut bill.\n  More important than all the procedure is the fact that our economy is \ngoing very slowly. I am trying to be positive at this moment. The \ntechnology sector is obviously going very slowly. In fact, it is in \nsome regards frozen, especially in new investment. The research and \ndevelopment tax credit being made permanent now matters because now and \nin the next few quarters is when technology companies, pharmaceuticals, \nbiotechs, all folks in tech, will be making decisions, and those \ndecisions need to be made so they can create the jobs, get our economy \ngoing again, and improve our lives.\n  I thank the Senator from Oregon for this amendment and hope my \ncolleagues will support this amendment.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. We yield back the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask, is all time yielded back?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has 8 minutes 50 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield back my time and I make a \nconstitutional point of order against Senator Smith's motion on the \ngrounds that the motion would affect revenues on a bill that is not a \nHouse-originated revenue bill.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask permission to enter a request for unanimous consent \nwith the Senator from New Hampshire. I ask that the vote on the motion \nmade by the Senator from Montana be set aside and we next go, as has \nbeen already ordered, to the Allard amendment, the Nickles amendment, \nwe debate the Allard and the Nickles amendment, and vote on those three \namendments at the conclusion of debate.\n  Mr. GREGG. We have 2 minutes equally divided prior to the Allard \namendment and Nickles amendment to explain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so amend his request?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 821\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 821.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Allard], for himself, and \n     Mr. Gregg, Mr. Craig, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Allen, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \n     Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. Gramm, Ms. Collins, Mr. Sessions, \n     Mr. Enzi, and Mr. Campbell, proposes an amendment numbered \n     821.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To exempt small employers from causes of action under the \n                                  Act)\n\n       On page 148, between lines 23 and 24, insert the following:\n       ``(D) Exclusion of small employers.--\n       ``(i) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this paragraph, in addition to excluding certain physicians, \n     other health care professionals, and certain hospitals from \n     liability under paragraph (1), paragraph (1)(A) does not \n     create any liability on the part of a small employer (or on \n     the part of an employee of such an employer acting within the \n     scope of employment).\n       ``(ii) Definition.--In clause (i), the term `small \n     employer' means an employer--\n\n       ``(I) that, during the calendar year preceding the calendar \n     year for which a determination under this subparagraph is \n     being made, employed an average of at least 2 but not more \n     than 15 employees on business days; and\n       ``(II) maintaining the plan involved that is acting, \n     serving, or functioning as a fiduciary, trustee or plan \n     administrator, including--\n\n[[Page S7139]]\n\n       ``(aa) a small employer described in section 3(16)(B)(i) \n     with respect to a plan maintained by a single employer; and\n       ``(bb) one or more small employers or employee \n     organizations described in section 3(16)(B)(iii) in the case \n     of a multi-employer plan.\n       ``(iii) Application of certain rules in determination of \n     employer size.--For purposes of this subparagraph:\n\n       ``(I) Application of aggregation rule for employers.--All \n     persons treated as a single employer under subsection (b), \n     (c), (m), or (o) of section 414 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 shall be treated as 1 employer.\n       ``(II) Employers not in existence in preceding year.--In \n     the case of an employer which was not in existence throughout \n     the preceding calendar year, the determination of whether \n     such employer is a small employer shall be based on the \n     average number of employees that it is reasonably expected \n     such employer will employ on business days in the current \n     calendar year.\n       ``(III) Predecessors.--Any reference in this paragraph to \n     an employer shall include a reference to any predecessor of \n     such employer.\n\n       On page 165, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n       ``(D) Exclusion of small employers.--\n       ``(i) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this paragraph, in addition to excluding certain physicians, \n     other health care professionals, and certain hospitals from \n     liability under paragraph (1), paragraph (1)(A) does not \n     create any liability on the part of a small employer (or on \n     the part of an employee of such an employer acting within the \n     scope of employment).\n       ``(ii) Definition.--In clause (i), the term `small \n     employer' means an employer--\n\n       ``(I) that, during the calendar year preceding the calendar \n     year for which a determination under this subparagraph is \n     being made, employed an average of at least 2 but not more \n     than 15 employees on business days; and\n       ``(II) maintaining the plan involved that is acting, \n     serving, or functioning as a fiduciary, trustee or plan \n     administrator, including--\n\n       ``(aa) a small employer described in section 3(16)(B)(i) \n     with respect to a plan maintained by a single employer; and\n       ``(bb) one or more small employers or employee \n     organizations described in section 3(16)(B)(iii) in the case \n     of a multi-employer plan.\n       ``(iii) Application of certain rules in determination of \n     employer size.--For purposes of this subparagraph:\n\n       ``(I) Application of aggregation rule for employers.--All \n     persons treated as a single employer under subsection (b), \n     (c), (m), or (o) of section 414 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 shall be treated as 1 employer.\n       ``(II) Employers not in existence in preceding year.--In \n     the case of an employer which was not in existence throughout \n     the preceding calendar year, the determination of whether \n     such employer is a small employer shall be based on the \n     average number of employees that it is reasonably expected \n     such employer will employ on business days in the current \n     calendar year.\n       ``(III) Predecessors.--Any reference in this paragraph to \n     an employer shall include a reference to any predecessor of \n     such employer.''\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, my amendment provides another opportunity \nfor the Senate to protect the country's employees of small businesses. \nYesterday, the Senate voted on an amendment I offered that would have \nprotected employees of small businesses from losing their health care \ninsurance.\n  I am offering another amendment that gives Members another chance to \nprotect those employees. My amendment, cosponsored by 12 Senators, \nprotects employees of small businesses from losing their health \ninsurance. My amendment exempts employers with 15 or fewer employees \nfrom unnecessary and unwarranted lawsuit.\n  We must protect small business employees from losing their health \ncare insurance. Small business represents over 99 percent of all \nemployers in America. If the Kennedy bill passes in its current form, \nsmall business employees will be subject to increased health care \npremiums and to the possibilities of losing their health care insurance \naltogether.\n  Based on studies from the Congressional Budget Office and the Lewin \nGroup, the Kennedy bill will cause more than 1 million Americans to \nlose their health insurance. The White House estimates--and that is \nrather conservative, I believe, because the White House estimated even \nmore Americans will lose their health care insurance--the Kennedy bill \ncould cause 4 to 6 million Americans to lose their health care.\n  The least the Senate can do to protect small business employees from \nlosing their health insurance and protect small employers from \nunnecessary liability is to pass this amendment. We are talking about \nemployers that have 15 to 2 employees. Currently, numerous Federal laws \nprovide exemption for small businesses and their employees.\n  In my previous amendment we talked about the 50 employee exemptions. \nThe other side made the point it was unfair because we were creating a \nbright line and those with 49 employees would not have an opportunity \nto take advantage of benefits provided in the amendment as those with, \nsay, 51 employees. This amendment draws a bright line. We are \naddressing the very small employers of the small business sector; that \nis, 15 employees or fewer. True, we have a bright line, but it is not \nunusual in Federal law to draw bright lines trying to differentiate \nwhere the respective law should deal with different sizes of employees, \ntrying to draw a line between small employers and the larger employers.\n  Let me cite for Members some examples. The Occupational Safety and \nHealth Act exempts businesses of 10 or fewer employees, workers, in \ncertain low-hazard industries. The Americans with Disabilities Act \ndefines the term ``employer'' as a person who has 15 or more employees \nengaged in an industry affecting commerce. This is the area where we \nhave decided in this amendment to differentiate the very small \nemployers from the other small businesses of this country. The Worker \nAdjustment and Retraining Modification Act, commonly referred to as the \nPlant Closing Act, defines the term ``employer'' as any business that \nemploys 100 or more employees. The Family and Medical Leave Act, which \nrequires employers to grant leave to parents to care for a newborn or \nseriously ill child, exempts businesses with fewer than 50 employees. \nThe Fair Labor Standards Act, which established the minimum wage \nstandards, exempts certain employers with minimum gross income--they \ndid not use the number of employees--of less than $500,000 as an \nindication of what a small employer might be as it applies to that \nstatute.\n  The Walsh-Healy Public Contracts Act, which contains minimum wage and \novertime for federally contracted employers, exempts employers that \nhave Federal contracts for materials exceeding $10,000, which also is \nindicative of a small employer. The Age Discrimination and Employment \nAct of 1967 exempts employers of 19 or fewer workers.\n  These numerous employee protections are currently in place as Federal \nlaw. The Senate should extend similar protections to employees of small \nbusiness. If we do not protect employees from frivolous lawsuits, more \nthan a million--some estimate up to 9 million employees--will lose \ntheir health care insurance.\n  Again, I am offering this amendment to provide the Senate with \nanother chance to protect employees of small business from losing their \nhealth care insurance.\n  I inquire the time remaining on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 9\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is the third bite of the apple. The \nfirst bite was Senator Gramm's amendment, where we were going to \nprovide protection for all employers. Then we had the Allard amendment \nto protect an employer with 50 employees or less. Now with this \namendment, we are down to 15.\n  The fact is, yesterday, if there was any question about what this \nlegislation was really all about, it was well debated, discussed and \naddressed. That was in the amendment offered by Senator Snowe of Maine \nand Senator DeWine of Ohio. In their amendment, the Wall Street Journal \nsays:\n\n       Employer protection makes gains. Senate passes rule to \n     shield companies from workers' health plan lawsuits.\n\n  It is very clear now that the only employers, large or small, that \nare going to be vulnerable are those that take an active involvement in \ndisadvantaging their employees in health care and putting them at \ngreater risk of death or serious injury. That is it. The rest of this \nhas been worked out. We have done it with 100 employees, we have done \nit with 50, and now we are down to 15. It makes no more sense today. \nThose employees should be adequately protected in these companies. I \nimagine, if the Senator is not successful\n\n[[Page S7140]]\n\nwith 15, we will be down to 10, we will be down to 5, and then we will \nbe down to 3.\n  We have addressed this issue. Every Member of this body ought to know \nit. I think this is a redundant amendment, one that we have addressed. \nThe arguments are familiar. I yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is clear filibuster by amendment. I \nhave been here a long time. I have seen this happen. As the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts pointed out, we have been here; we have done that. \nNext, as the Senator from Massachusetts indicated, it will be 10 \nemployees, 5 employees, 4 employees, 3 employees.\n  When the time has expired on this amendment, I will offer a motion to \ntable. This amendment should not be discussed. It should not take up \nthe serious time of the Senate that has been so well used these past 9 \ndays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I join the Senator from Colorado on this amendment. This \nbill is incredibly complex--to be kind. It has thousands of moving \nparts. The bureaucracy, which is going to be created and empowered as a \nresult of it, is going to be massive. The lawsuits are going to be \nmassive. The number of litigable events is going to be massive. It is \ngoing to be incomprehensible to large amounts of the American working \npublic and their employers.\n  It is only elementary fairness that we say, to at least the smallest \nemployers that are the ones creating the jobs in America today, you are \nnot going to have to pay what will undoubtedly be your entire profit \nmargin in order to try to comply with this new piece of legislation.\n  For employers that have 15 or fewer employees, it is simply fairness \nthat we take them out from this cloud and give them the opportunity to \ngive their people jobs and not be overwhelmed by the cost of this bill.\n  We have talked a lot about the costs of this bill, but let me cite a \ncouple of figures. The cost to defend the average malpractice suit is \n$77,000. There are very few employers in this country that have less \nthan 15 employees that are making more than $77,000. They are running a \nsmall business, a grocery store or restaurant, gas station, small \nretailer. These are the smallest businesses that create the most energy \nin our economy. That is where our jobs are created; they are created in \nthese small businesses.\n  Let's not have those folks who are willing to be entrepreneurs for \nthe first time in their lives, the first-time entrepreneurs who are \nwilling to step into the risk pool of the capitalist system and, as a \nresult, create jobs, let's not burden them with the bureaucracy and \ncost of this bill which we know is going to be extraordinary. Let's \npass the Allard exemption for employers with 15 or fewer employees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, let's just go back over what we are \ntalking about this afternoon. First of all, the majority of small \nbusinessmen and women in this country are not involved in \ndecisionmaking that affects the well-being of the employees. We know \nthat. They basically are busy enough. It has been explained by Members \nthat they are involved in running their businesses. This is really not \nan issue so much in terms of small business.\n  The only people that will be affected by this are the small \nbusinessmen or women who get hold of the HMO where they have the \ninsurance and says, look, if any of my employees are going to run up a \nbill more than $25,000, call me up because I want to know. When that \nHMO calls up, the employer says: Don't give them the treatment. As a \nresult of not giving that treatment, the child of an employee is put at \nrisk, and perhaps dies, or the wife of an employee, who has breast \ncancer, is denied access into a clinical trial and may die as a result. \nThis is only if you can demonstrate the employer is actively involved \nin denying the benefits to those employees. Are we going to say that \nall these employers, with 15 or fewer employees, are going to be \ncompletely immune from this when the only employer that has to worry \nabout this is one who is going to be actively involved in making a \ndecision that puts their employees at risk? We built in the protections \nwith the Snowe-DeWine amendment. We built them in and we have supported \nthem. But it seems to me that workers in these companies, which make up \nabout 30 percent of the American workforce, ought to be given the same \nkinds of protections against the employers that are going to make that \ndecision.\n\n  Make no mistake about it. The great majority of employers do not do \nthat today. Only a very small group do. But if the small group that do \ndo that are able to get away with it, there is an open invitation to \nother small businessmen and women, in order to keep their premiums \ndown, to get involved in similar kinds of activities. This will offer \ncarte blanche so that 30 percent of the American workforce will not be \ncovered one bit with this legislation. It makes no sense. It didn't \nmake any sense when it was first offered by Senator Gramm; it didn't \nmake any sense when it was offered previously by Senator Allard; and it \nmakes no sense at this time.\n  The only people who have to worry are those employers that are going \nto connive, scheme, and plot in order to disadvantage their employees \nin ways that are going to bring irreparable harm, death, and injury to \nthem. If you want to do that to 30 percent of the workforce and put \nthem at that kind of risk, this is your amendment.\n  I do not think we should. I hope the amendment will be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Massachusetts \nhas 9 minutes 23 seconds remaining. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. My friend and colleague from Massachusetts said if you \nwant to do this, you should sponsor this amendment. I am not sure I \nwant to do what he just described, but I want to sponsor this amendment \nwith my colleague and friend from Colorado. I ask unanimous consent to \nbe listed as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. This amendment is vitally important for small business. \nThis bill, the underlying bill, says employers beware, we are coming \nafter you because we do not exempt employers.\n  Interestingly enough, we exempt Federal employees, we exempt \nMedicare, we exempt government plans, but we do not exempt private \nplans. Anybody who has a private plan, employers beware because they \ncan sue you and they can sue the plan.\n  Oh, I know we came up with a little cover, and maybe you can put the \nliability under the form of a designated decisionmaker, and they can \nassume it. But guess what? They are going to charge the employer for \nevery dime they think it is going to cost. And my guess is, the \ndesignated decisionmaker will want to have enough cover so they don't \ngo bankrupt, so they are going to charge a little extra to make sure \nthey have enough to protect them from the liability and the costs that \nare associated with this plan.\n  The cost of health care is exploding. Health care costs went up 12.3 \npercent nationally last year. They are supposed to go up more than that \nthis year. That is not for small businesses. The cost of health care \nfor small business is 20, 21, 22 percent, and that is without the cost \nof this bill.\n  CBO estimates the cost of this bill is 4.2 percent. But if you assume \nthere is going to be a whole lot of defensive medicine, you can \nprobably double that figure. And with the liability, you are probably \nlooking at another 9 or 10 percent on top of the 20 percent for small \nbusiness. Those are not figures I am just grabbing out of the air, I \nthink they are the reality.\n  My friend and colleague from Colorado, Senator Allard, is saying: \nWait a minute. Let's exempt small employers, those people struggling to \nbuy health care for the first time. Let's protect them and make sure \nthey won't be held to the liability portions.\n  Federal employees are not able to sue the Federal Government. Why \nshould we say: Oh, yes, you can have a field day on small employers. \nThe only way to purely protect them--to surely protect them--is to \nadopt the Allard amendment.\n\n[[Page S7141]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in support of the Allard amendment to \nprotect small businesses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado has 4 minutes 25 \nseconds remaining.\n  Who seeks time?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I say to the majority I would like to be \nable to wrap up on my amendment, if I might.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Why don't you wrap up.\n  Mr. ALLARD. If you have finished, I will wrap up and then yield the \ntime.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Don't get too provocative.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Don't get too provocative? Maybe the Senator from \nMassachusetts would like to respond?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is all right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I have had the experience of starting a business from \nscratch and having to meet a payroll. As far as I am concerned, too few \nMembers of the Senate have ever had the opportunity to be in business \nfor themselves and had to meet the challenges of meeting a payroll. But \nI personally know how legislation such as this can affect your \nbusiness. I have had to face those tough decisions. They are not \npleasant.\n  There are a lot of small business employers all over this country \nthat are sending letters to Members of this Senate about the very same \nconcerns that have been expressed by the Senator from Oklahoma, the \nSenator from New Hampshire, and numerous other Senators, at least on \nthis side of the aisle, about the impact of this particular piece of \nlegislation on small business.\n  Let me take one example. There is a Mr. Terry Toler, for example, of \nGreeley, CO. I represent the State of Colorado. He runs a small \nconstruction business. He employs three workers. The health insurance \nhe provides to his employees also helps take care of the needs of his \nfamily. Terry cannot afford the costs that would come with the Kennedy \nbill in its current form.\n  Last year, Terry's company had a 65-percent increase in health \ninsurance premiums and costs. This increase was on top of Terry's other \ninsurance costs, including equipment insurance, professional liability \ninsurance, and general liability insurance. If this bill is passed in \nits current form, the company's health insurance rates will increase \neven further. As a result, he may have to drop the health insurance he \nprovides for his employees and his family.\n  My amendment will protect Terry and his employees from losing their \nhealth insurance. Terry is one of hundreds of small employers in \nColorado that would be forced to jeopardize their health care \ninsurance. We need to protect hard-working employees from losing their \nhealth insurance.\n  Let me share some further concerns of this small businessman. Large \nemployers can obtain health insurance at a much lower rate. As a \nresult, small business employers cannot compete with larger companies. \nIn a tight labor market, employers compete for the best employees. \nThese are all competitive issues about which a small businessman is \nconcerned. When this kind of legislation moves forward, you can \nunderstand their concerns.\n  I have heard comments from another small businessman in Springfield, \nCO, who has expressed his concern. He writes:\n\n       Health care costs are already prohibitive. Adding the law-\n     given right to sue for punitive damages can only increase \n     costs. A patient bill of rights is important, but not at the \n     price of Kennedy's bill.\n\n  He further states:\n\n     . . . liability limits are a good way to help cap rising \n     health care costs.\n\n  As an employer, he must evaluate the price tag that comes with paying \nfor health care. He believes it is prohibitive.\n  According to a recent survey of some 600 national employers, 46 \npercent of employers would likely drop health care coverage for their \nworkers if they were exposed to new health care lawsuits.\n  This is not a good bill for small business. The adoption of the \nAllard amendment would make it better. So I am asking my colleagues in \nthe Senate to join me in protecting employees of small business, thus \nprotecting the employees' health care they currently enjoy. If the \nKennedy bill passes in its current form, the health care protection of \nmore than 1 million Americans will be jeopardized. Colleagues should \nsupport this amendment to protect employees' health insurance and limit \nsmall employer liability.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado has 3 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I say to the Senator, I am going to make a brief \nstatement, and then he can wind up. I will yield him 2 minutes after I \nmake a brief statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 9 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, we acknowledge the burden \nthat is placed upon small business and the costs of their insurance. \nThe Senator is quite correct that they pay anywhere from 20 to 30 \npercent more. They are constantly having to look at newer kinds of \ncompanies as they are being knocked off the insurance rolls. We \nunderstand that. We are prepared to work with the Senator on this.\n  This is an important issue. I am amazed that small businesses in my \nown State can really survive with the problems they have. We ought to \nbe able to find ways to help and assist them; but this is not it.\n  We had $3.5 billion of profits last year from the industry. They have \nalready asked for a 13-percent increase in their premiums this year. \nThey were 12 percent last year. That is generally, without this.\n  We have been over this during the debate, that the cost of this is \nless than 1 percent a year over the next 5 years. We have also gone \nover this and found out that some of the wealthiest Americans are the \nheads of these HMOs. Mr. McGuire makes $54 million and got $350 million \nin stock value last year--$400 million. That has something to do with \nthe premiums for those companies.\n  This is a very simple kind of question. He talks about protecting the \nemployers. We are interested. They are protected unless they go out and \nchange and manipulate their HMO to disadvantage the patients who are \ntheir employees and deny them the kinds of treatments that would be \nprotected and with which we are all protected.\n\n  I am reminded, myself, that my son had cancer. I was able to get a \nspecialist for him and to be able to get into a clinical trial. I want \nthose employees who are represented by the 15 not to be denied that \nsame opportunity. I did not have someone who was riding over that and \ndenying me that. But that is happening in America. It might not be \nhappening in Colorado, but it is happening in America, where employers \nare calling up and saying: Don't put them in those clinical trials. We \nare here to stand and say: We are going to protect them. We will work \nwith you, with the small business, but let us protect the women who \nneed that clinical trial for cancer and the children who need that \nspecialist. Why deny them those protections? That is what this \namendment is all about.\n  I am prepared to yield the last 2 minutes to the Senator from \nColorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  I am continuing to hear from small business employers. And other \nMembers of this Senate, as well, are hearing the same message I am. \nThey are concerned about the rising cost of health care and the impact \nit will have on their business and the impact this particular piece of \nlegislation is going to have on costs.\n  They are also concerned about the increased number of lawsuits that \nwill be faced by small business employers if this particular piece of \nlegislation passes.\n  My amendment provides some relief for small businesses of 15 \nemployees or\n\n[[Page S7142]]\n\nfewer. When you first glance at this bill, as I did, you say: It looks \nas if the employer has been exempted. But when you read the fine print, \nthen you see there is a circle around it, and you find that the small \nbusinessman gets pulled in and becomes subject to lawsuits, more \nlawsuits than he is facing now. That puts at jeopardy the health care \nhe is currently providing for his employees.\n  I am asking the Members of the Senate to join me to make sure small \nbusiness doesn't get pulled into this ever-expanding web of tangled \nlawsuits into which they are going to be pulled if this particular bill \npasses.\n  The Allard amendment is a good amendment. I hope Members of the \nSenate will join me in protecting small business, those of 15 employees \nor fewer.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the \nRecord an editorial run in the Fort Collins Coloradoan.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Patients' Bill of Rights Not End-All to Health Care Issues\n\n       Physician (and consumer), heal you, should be the motto for \n     the Patients' Bill of Rights now under consideration by \n     Congress.\n       The legislation, which actually includes several \n     amendments, focuses on whether consumers can sue their health \n     care providers for not approving treatment deemed medically \n     necessary. Congress should restore that power to consumers, \n     but only if the suits are based on actual damages, rather \n     than punitive penalties. Those penalties have led to some \n     outrageous settlements, and those legal costs have been \n     passed on to employers and employees.\n       But consumers would be unwise to believe that this \n     legislation can solve the broader issues of the rising cost \n     of health care.\n       Many symptoms combine to make medical care costly: \n     Pharmaceutical companies are advertising directly to \n     consumers rather than doctors, which means patients may \n     demand the more expensive brand-name medicines. Low \n     deductibles for doctor office visits benefits consumers \n     upfront, but health care providers shift their expenses by \n     demanding higher premiums, which have increased sometimes 10-\n     fold in the past decade for employers.\n       Publicly owned health care providers face the sometimes-\n     conflicting mission of answering to stockholders, who want \n     profits, and their customers, who demand lower premiums and \n     broader access to care. All the while, health care CEOs are \n     receiving bonuses worth millions.\n       Managed care is not all negative. Without a cooperative \n     system, many individuals could not afford even simple \n     doctor's visits to maintain their health. Those without \n     insurance usually have to turn to acutely expensive emergency \n     rooms for health care. The focus on preventive care came \n     about, in part, from health care providers who were seeking \n     to keep their costs down, but the process also keeps patients \n     healthy.\n       Legislation will not replace the need for innovation and \n     close scrutiny by consumers and health care professionals \n     regarding how the system works. Some providers are using a \n     triage-type system to evaluate and treat patients \n     efficiently; employers are shopping around to find health \n     plans that fit their needs; providers are considering tiered-\n     cost plans; and patients bear responsibility for keeping \n     themselves as healthy as possible.\n       Congress should allow patients the right to sue providers \n     and exempt employers who have no control over medical \n     decisions. Still, turning the decision over to the courts in \n     expensive and unwieldy, with lawyers seeing the most benefit. \n     Another option is to rely on a binding mediation process or \n     an independent panel to weigh medical coverage decisions to \n     keep the focus on health care and off litigation.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to table the Allard amendment and ask \nfor the yeas and nays. Under the previous agreement, that will be set \naside and we will go to the Nickles amendment now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 850\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the pending \namendment is set aside and the Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 850.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To apply the patient protection standards to Federal health \n                           benefits programs)\n\n       On page 131, after line 20, insert the following:\n\n   TITLE III--APPLICATION OF PATIENT PROTECTION STANDARDS TO FEDERAL \n                          HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS\n\n     SEC. 301. APPLICATION OF PATIENT PROTECTION STANDARDS TO \n                   FEDERAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Application of Standards.--\n       (1) In general.--Each Federal health care program shall \n     comply with the patient protection requirements under title \n     I, and such requirements shall be deemed to be incorporated \n     into this section.\n       (2) Cause of action relating to provision of health \n     benefits.--Any individual who receives a health care item or \n     service under a Federal health care program shall have a \n     cause of action against the Federal Government under sections \n     502(n) and 514(d) of the Employee Retirement Income Security \n     Act of 1974, and the provisions of such sections shall be \n     deemed to be incorporated into this section.\n       (3) Rules of construction.--For purposes of this \n     subsection--\n       (A) each Federal health care program shall be deemed to be \n     a group health plan;\n       (B) the Federal Government shall be deemed to be the plan \n     sponsor of each Federal health care program; and\n       (C) each individual eligible for benefits under a Federal \n     health care program shall be deemed to be a participant, \n     beneficiary, or enrollee under that program.\n       (b) Federal Health Care Program Defined.--In this section, \n     the term ``Federal health care program'' has the meaning \n     given that term under section 1128B(f) of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b) except that, for purposes of this \n     section, such term includes the Federal employees health \n     benefits program established under chapter 89 of title 5, \n     United States Code.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, this amendment expands the coverage of \nthe bill basically to all Americans.\n  I have heard countless sponsors of the bill say we should cover \neverybody who needs basic protections. I have heard it time and time \nagain. I have heard it on national TV shows, Sunday morning shows: We \nshould make this apply to everybody. Some argue, shouldn't these \nprotections be reserved to the States because they have historically \ndone it? But the legislation before us says, no, the Federal Government \nwill do it; we will do it for all private plans. Usually they don't \neven say all private plans. They usually say for all plans.\n  The truth is, the legislation we have is a mandate on the private \nsector, but we have exempted the public sector.\n  It is amazing to me, almost hypocritical--I don't want to use that \nword, impugning anybody's motives--but it bothers me to think we are so \nsmart and wise that we are going to mandate these patient protections \non every plan in America, supersede State protections already present, \nand we don't give them to a group of employees over whom we really have \ncontrol. We do have control over the Federal employees health care \nplan. We can write that plan. We have control. We write the checks. \nFederal employees pay about a fourth, but the Federal Government pays \nthree-fourths. We have direct control over Federal employee plans, but \nthey are not covered by this bill.\n  Federal employees in the State of Delaware or California or Oklahoma \nusually get their health care from Blue Cross or Aetna or whomever. \nThey get it just like any other employee, but they are Federal \nemployees. They don't get the patient protections under this bill. They \ndon't have the appeals process under this bill. They don't have the \nlegal recourse that is under this bill. They don't have the patient \nprotections that are dictated in this bill. All other private sector \nemployees will. Does that really make sense? Is that equitable? I am \nnot sure.\n  My friend and colleague Senator Kennedy just talked about clinical \ntrials, and maybe they help somebody. I looked at the language for \nFederal employees. We are getting ready to mandate a very expensive \nprovision, probably fairly popular, that says under the McCain-Kennedy \nbill we pay for all trials, for all purposes, if it has any Federal \nconnection whatsoever. Federal employees aren't covered by the clinical \ntrials section of this bill.\n\n[[Page S7143]]\n\n They may be under individual plans, but they are not by mandate, by \npatient protections. Some plans may offer them; some plans may not. \nThere is not a dictate.\n  We are getting ready to mandate a very expensive comprehensive list \nof clinical trials for every private sector plan in America, but not \nfor Federal employees. I find that interesting.\n  We are getting ready to mandate an emergency room provision that \nincludes prudent layperson, poststabilization, and ambulance care \nprovisions. I mention this for the Senator from Delaware because I \nbelieve the State of Delaware is passing a patient protection program \nbut they only cover prudent layperson. That is what Federal employees \ndo. Federal employees don't have poststabilization and ambulance. That \nmeans our staffs, our employees, don't have the same patient \nprotections that we are getting ready to mandate on every other health \ncare plan in America. I find that to be very inconsistent.\n  I could go on and on and on. The OB/GYN provision: Federal employees \nget to have one visit. This is dictated or mandated--one visit to an \nOB/GYN. Under the bill we have before us, it basically allows the OB/\nGYN to authorize any OB/GYN care, without any other authorization \nrequirements. That sounds unlimited to me, a much more expensive \nprovision than what we have for Federal employees.\n\n  It is almost the case all the way through the bill. For pediatricians \nunder the McCain-Kennedy bill, we allow parents to designate a \npediatrician for their children. That sounds fine. I am sure if we \nvoted on that, it would be unanimous. That is not a dictate for Federal \nemployees. Some plans may have it; some plans may not.\n  My point is, Federal employees don't have these patient protections. \nWe are getting ready to mandate something on the private sector that we \nforgot to do for the public sector.\n  It is interesting because I know President Clinton made a big deal \nout of the fact, saying: Congress is not acting. I am going to have an \nExecutive order and make Federal employees have these patient \nprotections. I will do it by Executive order. Well, he didn't do as \nmuch as we are getting ready to do on the private sector. That is my \npoint.\n  I expect that what we are getting ready to do, that the patient \nprotections we are passing, the examples I have listed--and that is not \nthe total--are much more expansive than what has already been done. The \nsame thing would apply for Medicare. If all these patient protections \nthat have been espoused are so important, shouldn't we give those to \nsenior citizens? Shouldn't senior citizens have the same expedited \nreview process, internal/external appeal process, as we are going to \nmandate on all the private sector? I would think so. We all love our \nsenior citizens, our moms and dads and grandparents. Surely we should \ngive them the same protections we are getting ready to mandate. They \ndon't have it. They can spend days in an appeals process and never get \nout of the appeals process.\n  What about Indian Health Service? What about our veterans? Our \nveterans aren't covered by this bill. They don't have the same patient \nprotections. They don't have the same expedited review process. \nShouldn't they be covered?\n  Granted, this amendment could cost a lot of money, but this bill will \ncost a lot of money. I have heard a lot of people say this bill only \ncosts a Big Mac a month, it is not all that expensive, it is only just \na little bit. I disagree with that. I am also struck by the fact that \nwe are quite willing to mandate this on every city, every State, every \nprivate employer, but we don't mandate it on Federal employees. We \ndon't do it on Federal programs. We do it on State programs. We do it \non city programs. We don't have any objection to dictating how other \ngovernments have to do it. We will tell them how to do it. We just \ndon't think the Federal Government should do it. We don't think the \nprograms under Federal control should do it. I find that very \ninconsistent.\n  If this is that great of a program, and I have some reservations. I \nthink this bill goes too far.\n  I think we are superseding State regulations, and I have stated that. \nI lost on that amendment. Maybe that amendment can be fixed in \nconference, but for crying out loud, we should be consistent. I have \nheard proponents say time and time again that this bill is not at all \nexpensive. If so, shouldn't it apply to Federal employees? If we are \ngoing to mandate Blue Cross/Blue Shield in Virginia to provide this for \nall private sector plans, union plans, nonunion plans, and they also \nhave governmental plans--the same Blue Cross--shouldn't they apply to \ngovernmental plans? They have to do it for Virginia. Shouldn't they \nhave to do it for the Federal Government? That is my point.\n  There is some inconsistency here. If these are such great protections \nand they are not that expensive, we should make sure they apply to our \nemployees as well. Senator Kennedy mentioned clinical trials, as if \nthat was a mandate. Some of the Federal plans cover clinical trials. \nNot all do. We are getting ready to mandate them for every plan in the \ncountry. Shouldn't we have it for Federal employees as well--maybe for \nthe sons and daughters of the staff members working here? Shouldn't \nthey have access to those just as the private sector will now have \naccess to them?\n  The appeals process: This is one of the real keys. There have been \nhours of debate on the floor saying that on appeals every individual \nshould have rights of internal review, and then the external review \nshould be done by an independent entity not controlled by the employer. \nGuess what Federal employees have? If they are denied care, they can \nappeal. But to whom? They appeal to the Office of Personnel \nManagement--to their employer. The employer might subcontract it, but \nbasically it is the employer, the Federal Government. It is not totally \nindependent when the Federal Government might be making that decision. \nShouldn't we give Federal employees that same independent external \nreview?\n  My amendment would make this bill applying to the public sector \ninclude Federal employees, Medicare, Medicaid, Indian health, veterans, \nand civil service. I think it would help show that if we are going to \nprovide these protections for the private sector and, frankly, mandate \nthem, they should apply to the public sector as well.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have listened closely. I will come to \nthe substance of the Senator's amendment in just a minute. I listened \nto him very carefully about his great enthusiasm for the Federal \nemployee program. It is a fact that 100 Members have that program here \nin the Senate. It is interesting because the taxpayers pay for 75 \npercent of it. So it is always interesting for those of us who have \nbeen trying to get a uniform, or a national health insurance program. I \nfavored a single payer for years. I am glad to do it any way that we \nare able to do it.\n  But I am glad to hear from my good friend from Oklahoma how much he \nbelieves in the value of the Federal employee program of which 75 \npercent is paid for every Member in here by the Federal Government. \nWhen any of us talk about trying to expand health insurance to try to \ninclude all Americans, oh, my goodness, we are going to have the \nFederal Government pay for any of these programs? My goodness. I \nwelcome the fact that the Senator from Oklahoma is so enthusiastic \nabout that concept, about having a uniform concept. It is interesting, \nyou know, Mr. President. Many Americans probably don't know it. When \nyou come in and sign on, there is a little checkoff when you become \nemployed in the Senate. You check it and you are included in the \nFederal employee program. You have probably 30 or 35 different options. \nI wish the other American people had those kinds of options. No, we \ndon't get any kind of support for trying to give the American people \nthose kinds of options.\n\n  But do you know what, Mr. President? All these Senators who are \nalways against any kind of health insurance for all Americans are down \nthere checking that off as quick as can be to get premiums subsidized \n75 percent by the taxpayers. Wonderful. Now they come up and say, well, \nthey don't have all of the protections on it.\n  I want to say to the good Senator that I am very inclined to take the\n\n[[Page S7144]]\n\namendment. I would like to take the amendment. We are studying now the \nbudget implications because I don't want to take it and then find out \nthat we have the Senator from Oklahoma come over and say we have \nexceeded the budget limitations and then you have a blue slip and \ntherefore the whole bill comes down. We know what is happening now. The \nbasic protections of this legislation, according to the Congressional \nResearch Service--the patient protections in the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy \nbill would apply, with the exception of the right to sue. That is what \nwe are checking out at the present time in terms of what would be the \nestimation. Otherwise, I am all for it.\n  We have now in the Medicare systems that are involved in HMOs, they \nhave the right to sue on this. As we saw some of those elements on the \nexecutive order, they have not been altered by the administration. I \nwould like to make them statutory. No one would like to make them \nstatutory more than I. I am about to wrap my arms around the Senator \nand bring him in and say I am in on this.\n  Hopefully, as our leader pointed out, after all the lectures that I \nhave had--I don't say that in a derogatory way to my friend from \nOklahoma--about health insurance--we heard about how we are going to \nincrease the numbers of those who are going to lose their health \ninsurance. We are not dealing with that problem, with the 43 million.\n  We will have an opportunity to invite your participation on these \nissues. We had some votes on the extension last year in terms of the \nparents on the CHIP program and virtually every Republican voted \nagainst it. To the extent that we saw progress made with the good \nsupport of Senator Smith and Ron Wyden, we now have about $28 billion, \n$29 billion in the Finance Committee that can be used for the expansion \nof health care. We certainly want to utilize that. That is only a drop \nin the bucket. Our attempts in the past to get reserve funds out of the \nFinance Committee, which the Senator is on, so we could move ahead with \na health insurance program have fallen on deaf ears.\n  I hope that all those--I will have a talk on that later on because I \nam taking all of those statements and comments made by our Republican \nfriends over the period of the past days, all talking about health \ninsurance, and we will give them a good opportunity. Hopefully, they \nwon't have to eat their words. We will welcome some of their \ninitiatives. We know what they are against. We want to know what they \nare for in terms of getting some health insurance.\n  Well, I will say that I am going to recommend to our side that we \naccept the Nickles amendment. So I am prepared. The Senator made such a \nconvincing argument, and it has taken a little while. He left out HCFA. \nThat was the only thing he left out. That is why we have been so \npersuaded. I know HCFA is not going to have anything to do with this \namendment the Senator offers because, otherwise, I know he would not \noffer it.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator from Oklahoma agree to a voice vote \nbecause it appears he is going to win so overwhelmingly?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will think about that. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes. The Senator from Massachusetts \nhas almost 9 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I neglected to do this earlier and I \nmeant to do it. I wanted to compliment Senator Gregg and Senator \nKennedy for their leadership on this bill and their leadership on the \neducation bill because it is kind of unusual that we have two committee \nchairmen and two people who are responsible for moving two major pieces \nof legislation consecutively. So they combined and spent about the last \n2 months on the floor. That is not easy.\n  I have always enjoyed debating and working with my friend and \ncolleague from Massachusetts, and we are good friends. Occasionally, we \nagree. We have had two or three amendments, and we have had great \noratory and, occasionally, we still agree on amendments. I appreciate \nthat. We ended up coming together basically on covering union plans \ntoday. We got very close to an agreement. We will make that, I guess, \nin the managers' amendment. I appreciate that. I appreciate his \nwillingness to accept this amendment.\n  I will be very frank and say we don't know how much this is going to \ncost, but frankly, we don't know how much this costs in the private \nsector. There is a point to be made. The Senator said maybe we can \naccept it, and possibly it can work out to give patient protections, \nbut I don't know about the right to sue. That might be pretty \nexpensive. We are doing that on the private sector as well. We do not \nknow how much that is going to cost, but it will be very expensive.\n\n  Federal employees have a lot of protections, but they do not have \nnear the protections we are getting ready to mandate on the private \nsector.\n  Medicare has some patient protections. They do not have near the \npatient protections that we will be mandating on the private sector. \nThey do not have an appeals process that is as expedited as this. I do \nnot have a clue whether Medicare can comply with this language. It \ntakes, in many cases, hundreds of days to get an appeal completed in \nMedicare. We have a very expedited appeals process in this bill. I \nhappen to support that appeals process, and it would be good if \nMedicare could have a very concise, complete, final appeals process and \none, hopefully, that would be binding. We improved the appeals process \nin this bill today with the Thompson amendment, and I compliment \nSenator Thompson for his leadership on that bill.\n  I would be very troubled to go back to my State of Oklahoma and have \na town meeting and tell employers they have to do this, this, this, and \nthis; they have to have this in their plans; if things do not work out, \nthey might be sued for unlimited damages, and have one of them raise \ntheir hand and say, ``Did you do that for Federal plans,'' and say, \n``No, we didn't. We just did it for you. We think maybe we are not \ngoing to do it for ourselves.''\n  We have control over Federal plans. Those are the ones over which we \nreally have control. I would find it very troublesome. I was one of the \nprincipal sponsors of the Congressional Accountability Act a few years \nago who said Congress should live under the rules like everybody else. \nI remember some of my colleagues saying: Don't do that; if we make the \nCapitol comply with OSHA, it is going to be very expensive. If you walk \ninto the basement of the Capitol today, you will find a lot of \nelectrical wires that would not pass any OSHA inspection.\n  It bothers me to think we are going to mandate on every private \nsector health care plan: You have to have this, this, this, and this, \nall very well-intentioned, I might add, but some of which will be \npretty expensive. I would find it troubling if we mandate that on the \nprivate sector and say: Oops, we forgot to do it for Federal employees.\n  That is the purpose of my amendment. I appreciate the willingness of \nmy colleague from Massachusetts to accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I listened to the Senator talk about \nbeing in a town meeting and the questioner says: How in the world, \nSenator, can you apply all these provisions to our small business and \nyou are not doing that to the Federal employees?\n  I would think at a town meeting in my State of Massachusetts someone \nmight stand up and say: Senator, how come your health care premium is \nthree-quarters paid by the taxpayers; why don't you include me? That is \nwhat I would hear in my State of Massachusetts. That is what I hear.\n  Maybe they are going to ask you about the right to sue where hard-\nworking people have difficulty putting together the resources to get \nthe premiums and get the health care. They wonder why the Federal \nGovernment is paying for ours. If we are being consistent with that, I \nsay to the Senator from Oklahoma, we ought to be out here fighting to \nmake sure their health care coverage is going to be covered. I do not \nsee how we can have a town meeting and miss that one.\n  It is interesting, as we get into the Federal employees, we have 34, \n35 different choices. What other worker in America has that kind of \nchoice? The people say, what about your appeal? Generally speaking, you \ndo not need an\n\n[[Page S7145]]\n\nappeal; you can just go to another health care policy. We have that \nchoice, but working Americans do not. They are stuck with the choices \nin the workforce. We can get on with those differences. But I am still \nin that wonderful good moment of good cheer for my friend from \nOklahoma. I urge all our colleagues to support this well-thought-out, \nwell-considered amendment. I look forward to working with him on other \nmatters on health care to make sure we are going to do for the others, \nthe rest of the people of Massachusetts and Oklahoma, as well for them \nas we do for ourselves in health care.\n  I am ready to yield back the time or withhold my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. He mentioned the \nfact that the Federal Government pays three-fourths of the cost of \nhealth care for Federal employees. That is correct. With some companies \nit is more and some companies it is less.\n  The Federal Government pays 100 percent of my salary. The Senator \nfrom Massachusetts might want the Federal Government to pay 100 percent \nof the salaries in Massachusetts; I don't know. I appreciate his \nwillingness to accept the amendment. I am not going to ask for a \nrecorded vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield back his time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 6 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded back, the \nquestion is on agreeing to amendment No. 850.\n  The amendment (No. 850) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Regular order, Mr. President.\n\n\n                            Motion to Commit\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are now 4 \nminutes evenly divided prior to the vote on the point of order on the \nmotion to commit. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the participants are not here. We ask the \nroll be called.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Under the precedents and practices of the Senate, the Chair has no \npower and authority to pass on such a point of order. The Chair, \ntherefore, under the precedents of the Senate, submits the question to \nthe Senate: Is the point of order well taken? The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered.

On this vote, the yeas are 57, \nthe nays are 41. The point of order is sustained and the motion falls.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 821\n\n  Under the previous order, there are now 4 minutes evenly divided \nprior to voting on a motion to table the Allard amendment No. 821.\n  Who seeks time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Senator Allard isn't going to use his \ntime. I would be glad to yield back at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, if I might, I would like to give a brief \nexplanation of what this amendment is all about. The Allard amendment \nsays that if you are a small businessman--you have between 2 and 15 \nemployees--you are exempt from the provisions of this bill. That means \nyou do not have to face the increased burdens of having to face \nlawsuits. And it means you will not have to face the increased burdens \nof higher premium costs on your insurance.\n  So it is a very straightforward amendment. It is an amendment that is \nstrongly supported by the small business community. Probably most of \nyou have been getting calls into your offices from small businesspeople \nconcerned about how this is going to impact their small business. So it \nis an important small business vote.\n  I ask for a ``nay'' vote on the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, over the past several days, Members, in a \nbipartisan way, have worked very hard and successfully in shielding \nemployers from frivolous suits. As the Wall Street Journal today points \nout: ``Senate passes rule to shield companies from workers' health plan \nlawsuits.''\n  When this bill is passed, the only employers that have to worry in \nthis country are going to be those employers that call their HMOs and \ntell them to discontinue care when their workers run up a bill of more \nthan $20,000 or $25,000. They are not going to let women into the \nclinical trials. They won't let children get their specialty care. They \nwill not let the other employees get the rights that they have.\n  Employers, today, overwhelmingly do not do that; but a few do. If we \nadopt this amendment, this is going to be an invitation to other \nemployers. The ones that are violating the spirit of the law will get \nlower premiums, and this will be an incentive for others as well.\n  This will be the third time we have voted on this issue. It seems to \nme we have a balance now as a result of a bipartisan effort. We ought \nto respect that and guarantee to those employees across this country--\nthe workers--the absolute patients' rights which this bill provides.\n  So I hope we will support the tabling motion by the Senator from \nArizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to table and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have already been ordered on \nthe motion to table the Allard amendment.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. \nDomenici) and the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Murkowski) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 55, nays 43, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 215 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--55\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n[[Page S7146]]\n\n\n\n                                NAYS--43\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Domenici\n     Murkowski\n       \n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have an order that has been worked out \nby our friend and colleague. We are in the process now of working \ntoward that. I think we go to Senator Santorum next, for 40 minutes, \nSenator Craig for 30 minutes after that, and then Senator Breaux after \nthat. The general intention is to go to the Senator from Pennsylvania \nfor 40 minutes equally divided, followed by Senator Craig.\n  Mr. REID. If my friend from Massachusetts will yield for a brief \ninquiry, it is my understanding--Senator Judd Gregg is not on the \nfloor, but I think he has agreed to this. If there is a problem, I will \nbe happy to reverse it--that the matter to come up would be Senator \nBreaux's amendment after Senator Santorum, with 1 hour evenly divided. \nIf there is any problem, we will reverse it. Judd Gregg and I have \nspoken about that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, I had discussed with one \nof our managers the appropriate time at which we could consider the \namendment which I have at the desk, in sequence, and the yeas and nays \nhave been ordered. What would be a time that you could indicate to the \nSenator from Virginia it could be taken up?\n  Mr. REID. We can do it after Breaux.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the leader put that in, that it be taken in sequence \nafter Senator Breaux? Could it be amended so my amendment could be \nbrought up after Senator Breaux?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, it is my understanding that \nthe Senator wanted a half hour.\n  Mr. WARNER. Equally divided.\n  Mr. REID. We have not seen the amendment of the Senator from \nVirginia, so maybe we should not agree on time but agree on the \nsequence.\n  Mr. WARNER. We can have it sequenced. I will submit the amendment and \nthe Senator can establish a time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. FRIST. Reserving the right to object, I would like to talk to \nSenator Gregg on the time agreement and also restrictions on the \namendment with Senator Breaux. If I can have an opportunity to check \nwith Senator Gregg.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We are operating on good-faith agreements. We have done \nvery well. This is the intention. We will wait to hear from the \nSenator.\n  I understand Senator Craig and Senator Santorum want to change the \norder. Senator Craig will be the next amendment, followed by Senator \nSantorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order of \nthe Santorum amendment and the Craig amendment be switched and that the \ntime allotted be the same. Senator Santorum is still perfecting a \nportion of his amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we were planning on the other order. The \nperson who will be responding to the Senator from Idaho is not here.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We prefer to go the other way. We announced the order, \nand this has changed. We will need to put in a quorum call to get the \npersonnel who will be addressing this amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am sorry for this delay.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We are moving along, and we will do the best we can. I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 851\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, there was an agreement that the Santorum \namendment would proceed and I would follow. We agreed we would switch \nthose. I think that is the current agreement that has been accepted. I \nsee the Senator from Montana is on the floor, the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, so with that, I send my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding making medical \n              savings accounts available to all Americans)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING FULL AVAILABILITY OF \n                   MEDICAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds:\n       (1) Medical savings accounts eliminate bureaucracy and put \n     patients in control of their health care decisions.\n       (2) Medical savings accounts extend coverage to the \n     uninsured. According to the Treasury Department, one-third of \n     MSA purchasers previously had no health care coverage.\n       (3) The medical savings account demonstration program has \n     been hampered with restrictions that put medical savings out \n     of reach for millions of Americans.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that a patients' bill of rights should remove the \n     restrictions on the private-sector medical savings account \n     demonstration program to make medical savings accounts \n     available to more Americans.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I had planned up until an hour ago to offer \na detailed amendment on medical savings accounts that I think fits \nappropriately into any discussion about patient's rights in this \ncountry. The first and foremost right is access to health care, \nrelatively unfettered access to health care. The problem with that \nunder the current scenario on the floor is it would bring about a point \nof order and I do not want this issue to fall based on that.\n  Certainly it is appropriate we are here and we are taking the \nnecessary and adequate time to debate patient's rights in American \nhealth care. I am proud of my party. Republicans have a solid record on \nprotecting patients and their rights. We have fought for patients' \nrights from the very day we defeated the Clinton health care plan a \ngood number of years ago, which was a massive effort to use government \nto take over our health care system, which would have largely let \nbureaucrats decide whether your family would get the medical care they \nneed.\n  It was a Republican Congress that stood up for patients' rights by \ncreating medical savings accounts for the first time. Medical savings \naccounts, in my opinion, are the ultimate in patient protection for \nthey throw the lawyers, employers, and bureaucrats out of the examining \nroom and leave decisions about your health between you and your doctor.\n  What has been most fascinating under the current medical savings \naccount scenario in our country is that we have limited them to about \n750,000 policies. Yet, a good many people have come to use them even \nthough we have made it relatively restrictive and we have not opened it \nup to the full marketplace.\n  What is most fascinating about the use of medical savings accounts is \nthe category that all Members want to touch. We hear it spoken of quite \noften. That is the large number in our country of uninsured. Since we \noffered up a few years ago this pilot program, 37 percent of those who \nchose to use it were the uninsured of America. In other words, it \nbecame one of the most attractive items to them because it offered them \nat a lower cost full access to the health care system.\n  It proves something many colleagues do not want proved: That given \nthe opportunity, Americans can afford to\n\n[[Page S7147]]\n\nhealth coverage if the price is right and the strings are not attached \nand they can, in fact, become the directors of their own health care \ndestiny. I think it is fascinating when you look at this chart. Under \nthe current scenario, of over 100,000 MSA buyers, one-third were \npreviously uninsured.\n  With medical savings accounts, you choose your own doctor. Also, if \nyou believe you need a specialist, you have direct access to a \nspecialist. You don't need an HMO or an insurance company working with \nor telling your doctor what you may or may not do. Of course, the \ndebate for the last week has been all about that, all about the right \nof a patient to make the greater determination over his or her destiny \nand to have that one-on-one relationship with the health care provider. \nThere is no question that if you are independent in your ability to \ninsure or you have worked a relationship with your employer so you are \nindependent through a medical savings account, then you can gain direct \naccess to an OB/GYN. If your child is ill, you have direct access to a \nfamily pediatrician. With MSAs there are no gatekeepers; you are the \ngatekeeper. There are no mandatory referrals; you are the one who makes \nthe decision, you and your doctor. The only people involved in your \npersonal decisions, once again: Your family, you, and the medical \nprofessional you have chosen or to whom your doctor has referred you. \nThat is the phenomenally great independence to which we are arbitrarily \ndeciding Americans cannot have free access.\n\n  I hoped to offer a much broader amendment, but I knew it would have \nto face that tough test of dealing with the Senate rules and all of \nthat because it would deal with taxes and it would deal with revenue. \nAs a result, instead of making the changes in the law that ought to be \nmade because even the program I am talking about that has been so \naccepted expires this year and it is the responsibility of this \nCongress to expand it and make it available, here instead we are still \ntalking about the rights of lawyers, not the rights of the patient.\n  The rights of the patient are optimized if you provide the full \nmarketplace access to medical savings accounts. Since we introduced the \nlimited pilot program, wonderful things have happened. The very people \nwe were trying to reach, the uninsured, are able to afford health \ncoverage. And, in our society today, many of the uninsured are the \nchildren of working men and women who can't afford to add them as an \nextra beneficiary to their health care coverage because of the costs. \nYet they found they were able to do that when their employer that \nallowed them to have a medical savings account.\n  Medical savings accounts combine low-cost insurance, and a tax-\npreferred savings account for routine medical expenses. The \ncatastrophic insurance policy covers higher cost items beyond what the \nsavings account covers.\n  That is why I think it is important that this Senate now express its \nwill and its desire to continue to support medical savings accounts. \nThat is why it appropriately fits inside the broad discussion of a \nPatients' Bill of Rights.\n  I do not question any Senator's motive on the floor. Republican and \nDemocrat alike want to make sure all Americans have access to health \ncare. We want a Patients' Bill of Rights that works. We have had a \nPresident say very clearly, unless you can provide us with a Patients' \nBill of Rights that creates stability, that allows the kind of \nflexibility we need to assure that employers can continue to provide \nhealth care without the risk of being dragged into court because of a \nhealth care program that they may be a sponsor of, then he will veto \nit.\n  But here is a President who also supports maximizing choices in the \nmarketplace. How you maximize choices in the marketplace for the \npatient today is to allow open access to a medical savings account \nprogram that optimizes all the flexibility we have talked about. You \nreach out and bring in the uninsured of America and allow them to \ndevelop the one-on-one relationship with their doctor that has \nhistorically been the standard of health care in our country.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I appreciate the efforts of the Senator \nfrom Idaho for small businessmen and women, for families who are unable \nto afford health care costs to be able to invest in a medical savings \naccount. But I would like to put this issue in the context of this \nentire debate.\n  One of the first amendments proposed in this debate was to provide \ntax relief--not a sense of the Senate but an actual amendment to the \npending legislation to provide tax relief for small businessmen and \nwomen to get deductibility for their health care plans, at that time \n100-percent deductibility on their health care plans.\n  At that time I said I was willing to support the amendment and I was \nwilling to support two additional tax incentives for low-income \nAmerican families so they could afford health care. That offer was \nrejected. That offer was rejected by the opponents of this legislation \nas not being enough. They needed a multitude of tax provisions in this \nbill.\n  At that time I said OK, then I will not support them unless we have \nsome kind of narrowing--as I said, as many as three. That offer was \nrejected.\n  Here we are at 2 o'clock on Friday afternoon, after many days of \ndebate, and we are talking about a sense-of-the-Senate resolution on \nmedical savings accounts.\n  I am sorry. They should have taken advantage of the opportunity that \nI and the sponsors of this legislation would have provided to provide \nlegislative--not sense of the Senate --relief for small businessmen and \nwomen, for allowing families to establish medical savings accounts, and \nperhaps another bill. That offer was rejected.\n  At this time I would then have to oppose this sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I consume.\n  This is a Patients' Bill of Rights bill. This is not a tax bill. This \nis not a Department of Defense bill. This is not a agriculture bill. \nThis is not a foreign policy bill. This is a Patients' Bill of Rights \nbill.\n  The amendment offered by my friend from Idaho is not a Patients' Bill \nof Rights amendment; it is a tax amendment. We will have ample time \nthis year to take up tax legislation. We will take up tax legislation \nat some time, even though we had a huge tax bill already this year. \nWhen I say ``we,'' I mean the Finance Committee. That is because the \nbudget resolution provides $28 billion for health insurance benefits \nfor Americans who are now uninsured.\n  I guess the committee will report out legislation this year which \nwill include expansion of some benefits, perhaps under CHIP, but \nperhaps also some tax provisions. There are many Senators who have good \nideas to encourage Americans to have more health insurance--credits, \ndeductions, and so forth. MSAs is just one way. MSAs, I might say, are \nactually, under the law, reserved for the most wealthy Americans. It is \na particular kind of savings account which enjoys very lucrative, very \nbeneficial status with respect to our tax laws; that is, contributions \nare not deductible, inside buildup is not taxed, withdrawals for \nmedical purposes are not taxed, and only withdrawals for nonmedical \npurposes are, but not in the case when a person reaches the age 65. \nEssentially, they can be converted by wealthier people into a \nretirement account beyond a savings account.\n  They are just one way of, perhaps, providing health insurance for \nAmericans. The main point being this is not a tax bill. The Finance \nCommittee will take up health insurance legislation this year as \nprovided under the budget resolution. At the time we consider MSAs, we \nwill consider other appropriate ways to encourage Americans to have \nmore health insurance. That is the appropriate time for this body to \nconsider health insurance legislation. That is when the Finance \nCommittee can consider all the various ideas and report out a bill to \nthe Senate which, in a more orderly way, because it is a tax bill which \nis dealing with tax matters, particularly health insurance, will help \nmore Americans.\n  I also say to my good friend from Idaho, as referred to by my friend \nfrom\n\n[[Page S7148]]\n\nArizona, it is now 2 o'clock Friday afternoon. We have been on this \nPatients' Bill of Rights bill a long time. It is very good legislation. \nWe are going to finally pass a Patients' Bill of Rights, after I don't \nknow how many years, tonight. That is my guess.\n  We will not pass it tonight--who knows when we will ever get to \nfinally pass it--if we start going down this road of adopting sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolutions.\n  This is the first sense of the Senate. We have not had one before. \nThis particular resolution says this bill should include expansion of \nmedical savings accounts. If we are not going to add savings accounts \nhere, we are, in effect, deciding we should not add medical savings \naccounts, a tax bill, on this bill.\n  I respectfully suggest to all my colleagues, the proper vote here is \nto vote no because it is, in effect, a tax provision. It is a sense of \nthe Senate. We have not done that before. We are about ready to \nconclude passage of this bill and we will take up health insurance, tax \nlegislation, at an appropriate time later.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to discuss my vote on the Criag \namendment that it is the sense of the Senate that the Senate act to \nexpand access to Medical Savings Accounts.\n  I commend Senator Craig for offering this amendment. I support \nexpanding access to MSAs. I recently introduced S. 1067, the Medical \nSavings Account Availability Act of 2001, with my colleague from new \nJersey, Senator Torricelli. My support for MSAs is long standing. \nSenator Torricelli and I introduced in the last Congress a comparable \nbill to expand access to Medical Savings Accounts. I think we will \nimprove access to MSAs with the support of Senator Craig and many other \nSenators, particularly on my side, who I know want to see MSAs within \nthe reach of everyone.\n  As my colleagues know, I have argued during this debate that tax \nmaterial should not be included in this bill. I do not consider this \namendment a tax amendment because, if adopted, it would not have the \neffect of changing tax law.\n  Earlier in this debate, I sought and received agreement from the \nChairman of the Finance Committee that health related tax matters will \nbe considered at a markup of the Finance Committee in the near future. \nI look forward to pursuing this issue at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I inquire how much time remains on my \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I inquire if the Senator has anyone else who would wish to \nspeak to it on his side. If not, I will wrap up.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I will wait until the Senator concludes \nand then I will make a judgment whether I want to make another \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I allocate myself 5 minutes so I would like to conclude \nthe debate of my amendment. Let me speak briefly to what the chairman \nof the Finance Committee said.\n  First of all, I ask him to read my sense of the Senate. It has \nnothing to do with taxes at this moment. His underlying argument that \nthe responsibility for MSAs, when you are making substantive changes in \ncurrent law, is a finance responsibility and a tax provision, is \ncorrect. My amendment is not a tax provision.\n  It is asking the Senate to speak to the importance of doing what the \nSenator from Montana has said he will do this year. That is what my \namendment says--that medical savings accounts are important. Do they \nbelong in a Patients' Bill of Rights? Absolutely they do. If you want \nto optimize the rights of a patient or of a potential patient in \nAmerica's health care system, then you give them full access--not \nlimited and restricted access to medical savings accounts.\n  Let me correct one other thing that I think is important. As to this \nold bugaboo ``it is just for the rich'' that we heard coming from the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, will he tell me that one-third of \nthe 100,000 people who are uninsured and have never had insurance \nbefore because they couldn't afford it are somehow ``closeted rich'' \npeople? I doubt it very much. These are the working poor of America--\nnot the working wealthy--who found an opportunity to provide health \ncare for themselves, their spouses, and their families because the \nFederal Government, through the Congress, opened up a limited window of \nopportunity for them to use a medical savings account to their \nadvantage.\n  That is what that is all about. The House is looking to provide \nmedical savings accounts in their Patients' Bill of Rights. The \nPresident supports medical savings accounts. It is not an agriculture \nbill. It is not a bill for the Interior Department. It is a bill for \nAmericans seeking health care in the system today.\n  Why shouldn't we debate that right to have optimum access to the \nmarket on a Patients' Bill of Rights? Because it doesn't involve a \nlawyer? That is a good reason to debate it, because it doesn't involve \na lawyer and it doesn't involve a Federal bureaucrat at HCFA, and it \ndoesn't involve an HMO or an insurance company. It involves the patient \nwho holds that medical savings account and his or her doctor.\n  That is what this issue is all about. You darned well bet it is \nimportant that our Congress express to the American people that we \nshould make medical savings accounts increasingly available.\n  I am pleased to hear the chairman of the Finance Committee speak \nabout addressing that this year because this year it expires. We should \nnot allow that to happen.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I will make a couple of points.\n  If you read it, it makes clear that this is a sense-of-the-Senate tax \nprovision. It says sense of the Senate, and the Patients' Bill of \nRights should remove the restrictions on the private sector medical \nsavings account demonstration program to make medical savings accounts \navailable to more Americans.\n  Medical savings accounts is a tax provision. This says remove \nrestrictions to make it more available; to, in effect, change the tax \nlaw to make it more available.\n  It is clearly a sense-of-the-Senate tax bill.\n  Second, it has been asserted that it is for the working poor. I have \na distribution chart furnished by the President which indicates what \nincome groups of Americans utilize medical savings accounts. By far, \nthe greatest income level to use medical savings accounts is that with \nadjusted gross income--the total gross is a lot more--of between \n$100,000 and $200,000. Those people are hardly the working poor. For \nthose in the lowest category--those with adjusted gross incomes of \nunder $5,000--you get 111 returns. For those in the earlier category \nthat I mentioned--those in the $100,000 to $200,000 adjusted gross \nincome--you get 9,400 returns.\n  It is not for the working poor. That is not the main point. The main \npoint is that this is a sense-of-the-senate tax provision.\n  We should not go down this road. We will at the appropriate time \nlater this year in the Finance Committee work on a measure to protect \nand provide more health insurance for those who do not have health \ninsurance and report that legislation at the appropriate time to the \nfloor.\n  I yield the remainder of my time. If the Senator from Idaho will \nyield the remainder of his time, I will make a motion with respect to \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I believe that we have the opportunity to \nexpress the will of the Senate. The Congress has moved slowly but \ngrudgingly toward medical savings accounts and has created flexibility. \nWe have a good opportunity to do so this year. Today, we have an \nopportunity to express our will to do that once again. I hope we will \ndo so.\n  I yield the remainder of my time, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I am going to move to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to table the Craig amendment, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n\n[[Page S7149]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To dedicate 75 percent of any awards of civil monetary \n  penalties allowed under this Act to a Federal trust fund to finance \n     refundable tax credits for uninsured individuals and families)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. REFUNDABLE TAX CREDITS FOR THE UNINSURED FINANCED \n                   WITH CERTAIN CIVIL MONETARY PENALTIES.\n\n       (a) Payment of Certain Penalties to Secretary of the \n     Treasury.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, 75 percent of any civil monetary penalty in any \n     proceeding allowed under any provision of, or amendment made \n     by, this Act may only be awarded to the Secretary of the \n     Treasury.\n       (2) Civil monetary penalty.--For purposes of this section, \n     the term ``civil monetary penalty'' means damages awarded for \n     the purpose of punishment or deterrence, and not solely for \n     compensatory purposes. Such term includes exemplary and \n     punitive damages or any similar damages which function as \n     civil monetary penalties. Such term does not include either \n     economic or non-economic losses. Such term does not include \n     the portion of any award of damages that is not payable to a \n     party or the attorney for a party pursuant to applicable \n     State law.\n       (b) Establishment of Trust Fund.--\n\n     ``SEC. 9511. HEALTH INSURANCE REFUNDABLE CREDITS TRUST FUND.\n\n       ``(a) Creation of Trust Fund.--There is hereby established \n     in the Treasury of the United States a trust fund to be known \n     as the `Health Insurance Refundable Credits Trust Fund', \n     consisting of such amounts as may be--\n       ``(1) appropriated to such Trust Fund as provided in this \n     section, or\n       ``(2) credited to such Trust Fund.\n       ``(b) Transfer to Trust Fund of Amounts Equivalent to \n     Certain Awards.--There are hereby appropriated to the Health \n     Insurance Refundable Credits Trust Fund amounts equivalent to \n     the awards received by the Secretary of the Treasury under \n     section __(a) of the Bipartisan Patient Protection Act.\n       ``(c) Expenditures From Trust Fund.--Amounts in the Health \n     Insurance Refundable Credits Trust Fund shall be available to \n     fund the appropriations under paragraph (2) of section \n     1324(b) of title 31, United States Code, with respect to \n     assistance for uninsured individuals and families with the \n     purchase of health insurance under this title.''.\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendments made by this subsection \n     shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, one of the things I have repeatedly \nstated when I have spoken on this bill is that in S. 1052 there isn't \nany provision that provides for access to insurance. There is nothing \nthat increases the number of insured. There are pages and pages and \npages in this legislation that will decrease the number of insured and \nincrease the rate of insurance in this country. If you would take a \npublic poll, or take one in this Chamber, and were to ask people what \nis the biggest problem in the area of health care in this country, I \nthink the overwhelming response would be the lack of insurance for 43 \nmillion Americans.\n  The bottom line is that we should be discussing how we are going to \nsolve the biggest problem in the health care system, and that is \nproviding some assistance for those who don't have employer-provided \nhealth insurance. We do not do that in this bill.\n  In fact, it has been stated over and over again that this bill will \nadd to the ranks of the uninsured. That is not a positive step forward. \nWe can talk about the positive things--and there are positive things in \nthis legislation, which I have been historically in favor of but in my \nmind they are counterbalanced--in fact, overwhelmed--by the increase in \nthe uninsured that will happen as a result of several provisions of \nthis act.\n  One of the things I am going to do with this amendment is I hope to \ntake one of those negative provisions--that being unlimited punitive \ndamages in State court and a $5 million cap on punitive damages in \nFederal courts--and channel some of that cost that is going to be borne \nby the insurance system and employers, and put that back into the \nsystem in the form of a trust fund for those who do not have employer-\nprovided health insurance. So this is an amendment that will take 75 \npercent of all punitive damage awards that occur as a result of the \ncauses of action provided for in this bill and create a trust fund \nwhich will be used to finance those who do not have employer-provided \nhealth insurance--in other words, the uninsured.\n  I think that is a way to ameliorate some of the damage caused by this \nlegislation. The cost pulled out of the health care system through \nlitigation, and through punitive damages in particular, will drive up \nthe cost of health insurance. That money will go to lawyers, to a \nselect few--principally the lawyers, but to a select few clients, \npatients, such as the gentleman from California who a couple of weeks \nago hit the ``lottery,'' with a $3 billion punitive damage verdict.\n  If that kind of award occurs within the health care system, imagine \nthe impact on all of the insured in this country. Imagine the cost that \nis going to have to be borne by the millions of people who have \ninsurance with a $3 billion punitive damage award. How much are your \ninsurance rates going to go up if an award such as that is given?\n  The least we can do is take the potential of a back-breaker award, or \na series of back-breaker punitive damage awards, and put that back into \nthe system in a way that helps those who do not have insurance.\n  So what I am suggesting is really a way to avoid some of the \ncriticism that has been leveled against this bill, that this is full of \nlitigation and costs, without any benefit coming back into the system. \nRemember, what we are concerned about here--yes, we are concerned about \nindividual cases, obviously. But we also have to be concerned about the \ngreater picture, which is making sure the public generally has\n\n[[Page S7150]]\n\ninsurance and has quality health insurance.\n  As you can see from this chart, there is a real difference between \nthe kind of health care people get when they are insured versus when \nthey are not insured. This says ``nonelderly adults with barriers to \ncare by insurance status.'' In cases where they had procedures needed, \nbut did not get the care for a serious problem, only 3 percent of the \npeople who had insurance ended up in that category. So if they have \ninsurance, if they have a serious problem and a prescribed solution, \nthey basically get the care. But if they are not insured, 20 percent--\nalmost seven times the number of the uninsured--do not get the care \nthey need. This says ``skipped recommended test or treatment.'' If they \nare insured, 13 percent of the people skip those tests. If you are not \ninsured, almost 40 percent skip that.\n\n  Did not fill a prescription: 12 percent if you are insured; 30 \npercent if you are not insured.\n  Had problems getting mental health care: 4 percent versus 13 percent.\n  If we are concerned about quality care being provided to everyone, \nthen we have to address the issue of the uninsured. This bill just \ndeals with those who have insurance. I remind people, this bill only \ndeals with people who have insurance. The biggest problem with patient \ncare is those who do not have insurance, and that is displayed on this \nchart. We all know that is the fact from our own lives, knowing people \nwho do and do not have insurance.\n  We cannot walk out of here with our arms raised high saying we have a \ngreat victory for patients when we accomplish two things: No. 1, we \nprovide a little bit of protection--and that is what we do, provide a \nlittle bit of protection--for those who have insurance but cause \nmillions of people who have insurance to lose their insurance and end \nup with vastly inferior care. We provide a little bit of benefit for a \nlot, but we harm a lot of people profoundly in the process.\n  Again, this is a pretty minimal amendment. We allow for 25 percent of \nthe punitive damages to stay with the lawyer--to stay with the client \nso they get a little piece of this pie. The lawyer gets paid, although \nif they have a big punitive damage award, they probably get a big \nsettlement in a lot of other areas, too. In this $3 billion award, they \ngot $5.5 million in compensatory damages. Nobody is going poor, from \nthe lawyer's perspective, on filing this case.\n  When it comes to potential enormous awards for punitive damages, we \nneed to plow some of this money back into the system. I am hopeful the \nSenate will take a step back and say this is one of the reasonable \nsuggestions that can come about if we are willing to take seriously \nthis matter of providing quality health care, not just for those who \nhave insurance but plowing that money back for those who do not.\n  Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Madam President, I will first talk about what exactly \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania is talking about when he talks about \npunitive damages. Punitive damages can only be awarded in a case where, \nin this context, an HMO or a health insurance company has engaged in \nvirtual criminal conduct. They have to have acted maliciously, \negregiously, outrageously for there to be a punitive damages award.\n  Now let's talk about it in the context of a real case. Let's suppose \nsome young child needs treatment or a test and the insurance company \nexecutives meet and say: We are not paying for that test, and we do not \ncare what the effect is. If something bad happens, so be it. We will \nlive with that, but we are not paying for it. Even though it is covered \nby our policy, even though we know we are supposed to pay it, we refuse \nto pay it, period.\n  Let's suppose because that child fails to get some treatment or test \nthat they should have gotten, the child was paralyzed for life. Then a \ngroup of Americans sitting on a jury listens to the case, as they do in \ncriminal cases every day in this country, and decides the HMO has \nengaged in criminal conduct and awards punitive damages on that basis.\n  First of all, I say to my friend from Pennsylvania, I doubt if the \nparents of that child crippled for life believe they have hit the \nlottery. That child's life has been destroyed because of intentional \ncriminal conduct on behalf of a defendant, in this case the HMO and the \nhealth insurance company.\n  It is not abstract. This is conduct that was specifically aimed at \nthat child. It is not abstract to the world. This is something that was \naimed specifically at the child who is sitting in that courtroom, and \nthe jury found--in order for this to be possible, the court requires \nthat the jury find that the HMO has engaged in outrageous, egregious \nconduct.\n  This is what this amendment does: It says we are going to take away \n75 percent of that child's punitive damages award. That is what it \nsays. We are going to impose a 75-percent tax on that child.\n  That is a real case. This is not an abstract academic exercise. This \nis reality. I say to my colleague, if we are going to start taxing \npeople around this country 75 percent of their money--that would be \nthat child's money in this case. It does not belong to the Senator from \nPennsylvania; it does not belong to me and, by the way, it does not \nbelong to the Government unless this amendment is adopted. It belongs \nto that child. If we are going to start taking 75 percent of people's \nmoney, let's not stop at that child. Why don't we consider taking 75 \npercent of the $400 million that the CEO of one of these HMOs \napparently made last year? That will help. We can go around the country \nand start picking all kinds of groups of people and put that money in a \npot and do what we choose with it.\n  This is not a serious response to a serious problem. My friend from \nPennsylvania and I agree that the uninsured are a very serious problem \nin this country. It is an issue we need to address, and we need to \naddress it in a serious way. None of us suggest that what we are doing \nwith this Patient Protection Act will solve that problem. It will not. \nWe have work left to do. There is no doubt about that. But we need to \ndo that work in a serious, thoughtful, comprehensive way that will deal \nwith the kids and the elderly in this country who do not have access to \nhealth insurance and who, as a result, do not have access to quality \nhealth care. The way to accomplish that is not by imposing a 75-percent \ntax on people, families who have been hurt by HMOs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask the Senator to yield me 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Edwards for using a \nhypothetical example of why this is a very cruel amendment which I hope \nwill be voted down overwhelmingly. But I have a real case I can talk \nabout in a moment.\n  This morning--it seemed like a very long time ago, and it was--I \nvoted for an amendment by Senator Santorum to protect infants, to say \nthat infants who are born should have the protections of this bill. I \nsaid to him: I certainly agree that infants, children, and teenagers \nall the way up to the elderly, the most frail, should be covered by \nthis bill.\n  What does my friend now suggest? A 75-percent tax on pain and \nsuffering to go to the Federal Government for a Government program. \nThis is unbelievable to me. A 75-percent tax on families who may be \nsuffering because a child is permanently disabled, made blind, \nparalyzed, forever in a wheelchair, and then having to pay 75 percent \nof a punitive damage award that could go to help ease the pain of that \nchild, that could hire people to take care of that child.\n  This is a cruel amendment. My friend always says he is for the \nchildren. This is not for the children. This is not for the families. \nThis is not for the patients. This amendment will take the funds away \nfrom those families who are in desperate need of money to build a life \nfor someone deeply harmed by an HMO that had no conscience.\n  As my friend says, punitive damages are not gotten lightly. It has to \nbe proven that you were willful, that you\n\n[[Page S7151]]\n\nwere vicious in your intent. And then to say to that family: No, you \nhave to give up 75 percent of that fund that you won because you were a \nvictim. It is a victim's tax. It is a victim's tax that goes to a \nFederal fund, to a Government program.\n  I always thought my friends on the other side trusted local people, a \njury of our peers. They say: A local judge, someone from the community \nwho can look at that family and understand what it means when they have \na child permanently disabled.\n  A family with a little child in a wheelchair was coming to my office \nseveral years ago. The child was hooked up to every conceivable tube \nimaginable. The child was blind. There were caps on those punitive \ndamages. And there was not enough money to hire the people that family \nneeded to give their child the most decent life possible.\n  Now on top of this, as I understand this amendment, even in cases \nwhere there is a cap on punitive damages, this amendment still takes \naway 75 percent of the punitive damage. That is a slap at that victim, \nthat child, the parents, the very children my friend said he cared \nabout just 7 hours ago. This is an amendment that says the Federal \nGovernment is more important than your family. The Federal Government \nwill reach into a local jury; the Federal Government will take 75 \npercent of your award, of your punitive damages award, and put it into \na Government fund.\n  This is a terrible amendment. I hope it will be defeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I make one clarification: There are \neight States that currently do this. One of them is the State of the \nPresiding Officer. The State of Georgia takes 75 percent of punitive \ndamages, less attorney fees, and puts them in the State treasury. That \nis the State law in at least eight States. Georgia was, in fact, the \nmodel we used for this legislation.\n  By the way, those States are exempt from this provision so we don't \ntake both the State and the Federal. If there is a State law, those are \nexcluded under this act. This is hardly punitive. These are punitive \ndamages, not compensatory damages. These are not pain and suffering.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I was not going to say anything, but the arguments have \nnothing to do with the substance of the amendment. Everybody ought to \nrealize punitive damages have nothing to do with awarding a person who \nhas been injured. A person who has been injured is compensated for \neconomic losses, and there is no cap on economic losses. They are \ncompensated by pain and suffering. There are no caps on pain and \nsuffering. Punitive damages have one purpose. That is to punish the \nperson who has caused the injury. That is the only purpose for punitive \ndamages, to say to a company or an HMO, your conduct has been so \noutrageous, so egregious, you will be punished. That has nothing to do \nwith the compensation for the injured plaintiff or child. They have \nalready been taken care of.\n  The concept of taking punitive damages and saying, we will use those \ndamages to help people who do not have insurance, is a novel idea. \nOther States have done it. It is a good approach. I think we should \nsupport it because it has nothing to do with taking away anything to \nwhich an injured person is entitled. They have already been compensated \nin this bill with unlimited, uncapped economic and noneconomic pain and \nsuffering damages. The arguments that I have heard have no merit \nconsidering the nature of the amendment.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I make clear a couple of issues. Eight States have \nalready passed legislation that redirects punitive damages to specific \npurposes. I mentioned Georgia is one; Florida allocates money into the \nmedical assistance trust fund; Illinois, into the department of \nrehabilitative services; Iowa puts money into the civil reparations \ntrust fund; Kansas puts money directly in the State treasury; Missouri, \nto the tort victims compensation fund; Oregon, to the criminal injury \ncompensation account; Utah, anything in excess of $20,000 in punitive \ndamages goes to the State treasury.\n  This is not a brand new concept but a concept States have adopted \nbecause they understand, as the State of Georgia, that these are \npunitive damages, not compensatory damages. These are to punish people. \nWe are saying, if you punish a guy who does a bad thing, who is a \ncriminal, the crime is against everyone. Those who are not in the \ncourtroom should be benefiting from this. That is the uninsured.\n  What will happen if those punitive damages are awarded to the \nindividual or to the lawyer--because they get a big chunk? There will \nbe more uninsured because the cost of health care will go up. This is \npunishing people who have insurance with higher premiums and higher \nrates. As the Senator from Louisiana said, we are already compensating \nthe victim. They are getting unlimited compensation. There are no \nlimits in State or Federal court for any compensation that is due this \nperson. Who we are punishing here with punitive damages are the people \nwho are going to lose their insurance because of high rates of \ninsurance because of these punitive damages, and we will punish people \nwho are going to keep their insurance and have to pay a lot more.\n  This is a modest amendment that tries to lessen the heavy hammer of \ncost that this bill puts in place. I am hopeful we get bipartisan \nsupport for it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I will respond briefly to the Senator from Pennsylvania \nand the Senator from Louisiana.\n  First, I suggest to the Senator from Louisiana, when an HMO does \nsomething egregious, criminal, to a child, and in my example that child \nis crippled for life, that crime is not against all of us; it is \nagainst that child. It is that child who is in court. It is that child \nto whom the jury has awarded these damages. They didn't award it to us \nor the people in the gallery; they award it to that child. When we go \nin and take 75 percent of that child's money, it is a tax any way you \ncut it.\n\n  We can talk around this and talk about it for the next 15 minutes or \n15 hours. That money does not belong to us. It belongs to that child \nand that crime was committed against that child and that is whose money \nwe are taking. It is a tax.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 4\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  I have listened to my friend from Pennsylvania talk about the \nuninsured. But where was the Senator from Pennsylvania when President \nBush asked for $80 billion to develop a program to cover the uninsured \nin this country, and they reported back $1.6 trillion and wiped that \nprogram out? We could have had a real program for the uninsured, but I \ndidn't hear the Senator from Pennsylvania talk about that.\n  I didn't hear the Senator from Pennsylvania talk about when we were \ntrying to develop the CHIP program; let's get behind it and fight for \nthat program and take on the tobacco companies. They are the ones that \nare basically funding the CHIP program now, which has been extended to \ncover 6 million children in this country. I didn't hear the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania talking about that.\n  Where was he last year when we had the family care, $60 billion to \ncover 8 million Americans, the parents of the CHIP programs? The \nSenator from Pennsylvania opposed that.\n  So with all respect, to offer an amendment to try to help the \nchildren of this country with their health insurance has no relevancy \nin terms of the voracity of the commitment of that side of the aisle in \nterms of trying to do something for the children of this country.\n  The record has not been there. To try to offer some amendment this \nafternoon and cry crocodile tears all over the floor about what we are \ndoing for children when they basically have refused to address this \nissue in a serious way is something the American people see through.\n  We understand what is happening, even in this bill where you could \nhave an important impact in terms of children who are covered. They \nhave been supporting the attempts to water it down in terms of the \nHMOs.\n  That has been the record: Opposition to this HMO--the Patients' Bill \nof\n\n[[Page S7152]]\n\nRights, to guarantee the children who do have health insurance are \ngoing to get protections. And they have been fighting it every step of \nthe way. Then they say: Oh, well, we are really interested in children \nbecause we are going to give them this refundable credit on it.\n  It doesn't carry any weight. The American people can see through \nthis. Let's get about the business of passing a real Patients' Bill of \nRights and then let's go out and try to pass a real health insurance \nbill that will do something about the remainder of the children who \nneed the care and also the parents of those children who need it in \nlong-term family care. Let's do something to look out after our fellow \ncitizens.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I just want to remind the Senator from Massachusetts \nthat the Smith-Wyden amendment that provided $28 billion for those who \ndo not have insurance passed and that is now law. It was in the budget. \nSo I have been a supporter of money and a substantial amount of money \nfor those who do not have insurance.\n  I have sponsored a piece of legislation, with Senator Torricelli, \nthat is called Fair Care, which provides tax credits for the uninsured \nat the cost of around $20 billion a year.\n  So I suggest to the Senator from Massachusetts----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on my time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. One second--I just suggest to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, to impugn me personally and suggest I am disingenuous by \nproposing that we provide some money in punitive damages, not damages \nto compensate for injury but damages to punish someone who did a \nwrong--why should that go to an individual as opposed to society, which \nwas wronged by that activity, as all criminal activity is. It is a \ncrime against society. We do not compensate, as you know, when we \nprosecute someone criminally. The individual does not get benefit from \nthat punishment.\n  So punitive damages are there to punish, not to compensate. I know \nthe Senator from North Carolina knows that. That is why they are called \npunitive--punish; compensatory--compensate. There is a difference. That \nlanguage is not there for window dressing; it is there for substantive \ndifference.\n  What I am suggesting is that these punitive--punishment--damages \nshould not further punish people who have insurance because they are \nthe ones ultimately to be punished. Several States have recognized this \nand have plowed that money back into the system to help those who would \notherwise be punished by this money coming out of the system of health \ninsurance.\n  So I just suggest that my commitment here is sincere and my object \nhere I think is worthy of support.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. First I say to my colleague, we can keep talking about \nthis. The truth of the matter is the criminal conduct we are describing \nhere is committed against a particular patient; in my example, against \nthat particular child. We are taking 75 percent of that child's money, \nany way you cut it. It is a tax. The Government is taking their money, \nand there is no reason to do that. It makes no sense whatsoever.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from North Carolina for yielding 5 \nminutes.\n  Let me say I am one of the few Members on the floor of the Senate who \npracticed law before he was elected to Congress, who was in a \ncourtroom, involved in a case which had a punitive damage verdict. That \nis very rare in American law. It happened to me. I was on the defense \nside. I was defending a railroad in a lawsuit brought by the survivors \nof an elderly man who was killed at a railroad crossing in November of \n1970 near Springfield, IL.\n  There was a row of cars, train cars, parked near this crossing. This \nelderly man, late at night, crept up on the crossing to see if he could \nget across. His car stalled in the crossing. He tried to get out, \ncouldn't, and the train came through and killed him.\n  When the jury in Illinois sat down and looked at it, they said if you \nmeasure the value of an elderly man's life, there is not a lot of \ncompensation. But when they looked at the railroad I was defending and \nfound out we had done the same thing time and time and time again, they \ndecided this railroad needed to receive a message. So they imposed a \npunitive damage verdict of over $600,000 on the railroad I represented, \nto send a message to this railroad to stop parking these train cars so \nclose to a crossing that people could get injured and killed. That was \na punitive damage verdict in a relatively small town in Illinois.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania now wants us to say that three-fourths \nof the verdicts just like that should be taxed and taken by the Federal \nGovernment. He does not believe the family of the person who was killed \nat the crossing should get the money. He thinks the Federal Government \nshould take the money.\n\n  He has some good purposes for the money to be spent. I don't question \nthat. But this is a rather substantial tax which he said we should take \nto deal with the uninsured in America. Why is it the Senator from \nPennsylvania did not suggest we tax the profits and salaries of the \nHMOs and the health insurance executives? According to Senator \nKennedy's statement the other day, one of these HMO executives, in 1 \nyear, made $54 million in salary and over $300 million in stock \noptions.\n  I do not hear the Senator from Pennsylvania suggesting we tax that to \npay for the health insurance needs of America. No, let's take it away \nfrom the families of those who were killed at railroad crossings. Let's \ntake it away from the families of children who were maimed, with \npermanent injuries they are going to face for a lifetime. He would not \ndare reach into the pockets of the executives of these health insurance \ncompanies and tax them.\n  Come to think of it, just 6 weeks ago we gave them a tax break here, \ndidn't we?--a $1.6 trillion tax break for those executives. But a new \ntax on the family of those who come to court looking for compensation \nfor real injuries and death in their own family?\n  We should reject this amendment. We know what it is all about. We are \nthis close to passing a Patients' Bill of Rights with two fundamental \nprinciples, principles that say: First, doctors make medical decisions, \nnot health insurance companies in America; and, second, when the health \ninsurance companies do something wrong, they will be held accountable \nas every other business in America.\n  There are those on the other side of the aisle who hate those \nconcepts just as the devil hates holy water. But I will tell you, \nfamilies across America know they are sensible, sound values and \nprinciples. All of this fog and all this smokescreen about taxing \npunitive damages for the good of America--why aren't you taxing the \nexecutives' salaries at the health insurance companies who are ripping \noff people across America? Instead, you are passing tax breaks for \nthose very same people.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I will be happy to work with the Senator \nfrom Illinois to tax HMO executives and lawyers who get big awards out \nof the health care system equally. If you would like to propose an \namendment, I will work with you so all lawyers and all health \nexecutives who profit from the health care system will have that money \nplowed back in. I did not hear that. I don't think I heard that. I \nthink I just heard one side of that argument.\n  I will be happy to yield a minute to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Listening to all this screaming and hollering, obviously \nsomebody has been stuck by this amendment. What does this amendment do? \nThe bill before us, under the best set of circumstances, is going to \ncost 1.2 million people in America their health insurance by driving up \nthe cost of health care. And one of the primary factors driving up that \ncost is litigation.\n  What the Senator from Pennsylvania has proposed is to take the part \nof these massive settlements that has nothing to do with compensating \nthe person who has been injured--it has to\n\n[[Page S7153]]\n\ndo with punishing reckless and irresponsible behavior--and using that \nto help buy health insurance for the very people who will lose their \nhealth insurance as a result of all of these lawsuits.\n  Are we concerned about people without health insurance or are we \nconcerned about plaintiffs' lawyers? It seems to me I hear more \nscreaming about plaintiffs' lawyers than I do health insurance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield a minute to the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to agree with the Senator \nfrom Texas. Essentially, with these increased damages from punitive \ndamages, oddly enough, the way insurance works in America, the premium \npayers are going to pay more. The more big verdicts that are rendered, \nthe more premium payers will pay, raising rates for innocent people who \nhad nothing to do with the misconduct that resulted in the punitive \ndamages, resulting in higher costs so more people economically will \ndrop off the insurance rolls.\n  We have a real problem with the uninsured in America. It seems to me \nthis is a solution that is very creative. It is a solution that has \nbeen talked about by legal scholars for some time--what to do with \npunitive damages. Why, the part of it you pay for pain and suffering, \nyou pay for contract laws--the victim gets that. But what about the \nmoney that is to punish the company? Where should it go?\n  I suggest the Senator is correct; it go to the uninsured and help \npeople be insured.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two and one-half minutes.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding. I see my \ngood friend from Texas. He and I have worked over the years on \nlitigation matters and have authored litigation reform bills and a \nvariety of other measures to reform the legal system.\n  I think it is important to remember that we have had great debates \nover the years about victims' rights and how important it is that \nvictims be remembered when crimes are committed.\n  It seems to me that on this particular proposal and in this case when \na person is subject to criminal conduct--that is what this amounts to--\nthey have been victimized. This is not just compensatory damage for a \nmistake that is made. If you have been a victim of criminal conduct and \nare going to be deprived of the award that a jury provides you, that is \nfundamentally wrong. It ought to be defeated on just that point.\n  I have listened to and have engaged in debates on victims' rights. \nVictims are sick and tired when criminal behavior is committed and they \nare not considered when the matters have come before the bar of \njustice. When an individual, a child, or an adult is found to be \ninjured as a result of criminal conduct, that is what punitive damages \nare. I think they deserve to receive that award.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, the Senator from Connecticut is exactly \nright. When we have a victim, such as a child who has been injured by \nthe criminal conduct of an HMO, it is fundamentally wrong to take 75 \npercent of that child's money. And that is to whom it belongs. No \nmatter what they say, and no matter how long we talk about it, it \nbelongs to that child. To take 75 percent of that child's money is \nwrong, and we should vote against this amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I have been listening to this debate, \nand I think some good points have been made on both sides. But is the \nstandard for recovery of punitive damages in this case criminal \nconduct, or wanton misconduct, or intentional infliction of distress? I \nwould be surprised if the standard for punitive damages is criminal \nconduct.\n  Is that the case?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. No. If it takes a long time to answer, I am not going \nto yield the rest of my time to define that answer.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. If the Senator will yield time to me, I will be happy to \nanswer that question. I can't answer it yes or no.\n  The answer is reckless, intentional, outrageous conduct.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Which is not criminal.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Of course, it is criminal conduct.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. No, no, no. Reclaiming my time, let's not gild the \nlily. I think you have some good points. Let's not try to convince \npeople that wanton misconduct and willful misconduct is the same as \ncriminal misconduct. It is not.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, let me reclaim my time. It is quickly \nrunning out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Will the Senator yield for a response to that question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional minute to finish this colloquy so it doesn't impinge on my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. The language of the legislation is that reckless, \nintentional conduct is criminal conduct--all over America.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. No. It isn't.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I respectfully disagree. Somebody who engages in \nreckless conduct in the operation of an automobile has engaged in \ncriminal conduct. Somebody who engages in reckless conduct that causes \nthe death of another person has engaged in criminal conduct. I \nrespectfully disagree with the Senator.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. If I could respond, conduct that is subject to civil \nlitigation versus conduct that is subject to criminal litigation, the \nconduct that the Senator described may, in fact, turn out to be also in \naddition to having civil exposure having criminal exposure, or it may \nnot. But the conduct very well may be reckless, or even intentional, \nand constitutes conduct that is subject to punitive damages which can \nstill not be criminal.\n  My only point is that it is not the same. It is not the same. The \nsame conduct can in some cases be both, but in the civil context if----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. All right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 1 minute.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I reiterate that this amendment is about \ntaking money. The concern of this bill is that excessive costs will \ndrive up the rates for insurance. We are taking some of this excessive \ncost that is built into this bill and plowing it back into the system \nto make sure that we don't have more uninsured if we don't take care of \nit.\n  I wish to make one additional point. Back in 1992, the House sponsor \nof the McCain-Kennedy bill, John Dingell, proposed using 50 percent of \npunitive damage awards to help compensate people--in this case, to \nprevent medical injuries. This is not a punitive damage measure. This \nis a measure that understands that punitive damages should go to \nbenefit those in society who could be hurt by their increased cost of \ninsurance. That is what this amendment does.\n  I hope we can get some bipartisan support for it.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to table and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the \nmotion. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Arkansas (Mrs. Lincoln) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) is \nabsent on official business.\n\n[[Page S7154]]\n\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nHawaii (Mr. Inouye) would vote ``aye.''\n  Mr. NICKLES.

We have an amendment to be offered by \nSenator Carper and an amendment to be offered by Senator Kennedy. Those \nare the only two amendments on our side. I yield the floor for purposes \nof describing the list on the Republican side.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the list on our side includes the following \namendments. If there is somebody else who has an amendment and I have \nnot spoken to them, raise your hand.\n  The amendments are: Senator Craig, long-term care; Senator Craig, \nnuclear medicine; Senator Kyl, alternative insurance; Senator Santorum, \nuninsured; Senator Bond, punitive damages; Senator Frist, liability. \nThere are pending in the order we talked about, Senator Warner; Senator \nEnsign on genetics, and I understand his pro bono amendment is being \nagreed to; and Senator Thompson, which I understand also has been \nagreed to.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. No.\n  Mr. GREGG. It has not. And then Senator Frist has a substitute.\n  Is there anybody else who has an amendment?\n  That appears to be our list.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that be deemed as \nthe finite list of amendments to be offered to this bill.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, is there an objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I just tell the majority leader, we have not had a \nchance to run that by our colleagues. We have been shopping amendments, \nand the Senator from New Hampshire is to be congratulated that he has \nreduced the number of amendments substantially. We will need a few \nminutes at least to run this by the rest of our colleagues to make sure \nthey know that if they have additional amendments to be considered, \nthey need to get them on our list.\n  If the majority leader will please withhold the request, we will shop \nit around.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, while Senators are working out their \namendments, I think there ought to be an Independence Day speech. I \nassume we are going home for the Fourth of July. So if there is no \nobjection, I have a speech in hand. (Laughter.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object. (Laughter.)\n  In admiration of the Senator's tie, how long is the speech?\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, now, in the face of that extraordinary compliment, I \nwould say it is just half as long as it would have been otherwise. \n(Laughter.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senate will shortly recess, hopefully, \nfor the Independence Day holiday. Many Members will return home to meet \nwith their constituents. Some will perform a time-honored ritual and \ntake part in bunting-swagged Independence Day parades, sweating and \nwaving from the backs of convertibles somewhere in the line-up between \nthe pretty festival queens, brightly polished antique cars, flashing \nfire engines, and, hopefully, ahead of the prancing equestrian groups. \nIt is an American tradition as familiar and as comforting as the fried \nchicken and the apple pie that everyone will enjoy. Families and \nfriends will gather to watch the fireworks light the evening sky.\n  This first Independence Day of the new millennium calls to mind an \nearlier year two centuries ago. The year was 1801. Of course, then, as \nnow, there had been a hotly contested election. Control of government \npassed from one party to another. It took a vote in the electoral \ncollege to decide the Presidency, and the House of Representatives put \nThomas Jefferson into the White House instead of Aaron Burr.\n  Passions ran high and many strong words were uttered. Grudges were \nnursed, and we feel those same passions today, and with the recent \nchange of party control in the Senate, some angry feelings have been \nfanned anew. It is, perhaps, a good time as we celebrate the 225th \nanniversary of our country's independence as a new nation, a new \ngovernment created under God in as thoughtful and inspired a manner as \nman can devise, to recall these words from President Jefferson's \ninaugural address:\n\n       During the contest of opinion through which we have passed \n     the animation of discussions and of exertions has sometimes \n     worn an aspect which might impose on strangers unused to \n     think freely and to speak and write what they think; but this \n     being now decided by the voice of the Nation, announced \n     according to the rules of the Constitution, all will, of \n     course, arrange themselves under the will of the law, and \n     unite in common efforts for the common good. All too, will \n     bear in mind this sacred principle, that though the will of \n     the majority is in all cases to prevail, that will to be \n     rightful must be reasonable; that the minority possesses \n     their equal rights, which equal law must protect, and to \n     violate would be oppression. Let us, then, fellow-citizens, \n     unite with one heart and one mind. Let us restore to social \n     intercourse that harmony and affection without which liberty \n     and even life itself are but dreary things.\n\n  The language that came from Jefferson's inaugural speech may be \narchaic, but the message rings true through the ages and is \ncontemporary still. It reminds us of the great luxury of our liberty--\nthe freedom to say what we think and the ability to stand up for what \nwe believe. It also reminds us of the need, then as now, to remember, \nprotect, and preserve our liberty as our greatest common good. For \nthat, we must stand together as a people united in, as Jefferson says \nlater in his speech, ``. . . The preservation of the general government \nin its whole constitutional vigor, as the sheet anchor of our peace at \nhome and safety abroad . . . .''\n  Americans are fortune's children. We are the lucky citizens of a \ngreat and novel experiment in government, the golden children of a 225-\nyear-old alchemy that blended the best of all governmental forms into a \nwholly new metal, a grand representative government that has endured \nthe trials of centuries. We enjoy power coupled with restraint; wealth \nwith generosity; individual opportunity with concern for the less \nfortunate. Though at times it seems that we are consumed by petty \nsquabbles or diverse interests that\n\n[[Page S7155]]\n\nthreaten to fragment us as a people, each year on the glorious Fourth \nof July we are given a chance to come together proudly as one American \npeople, to honor, in Jefferson's words, ``[T]he wisdom of our sages and \nthe blood of our heros . . .'' that have been devoted to the principles \nembodied in our Constitution and our government.\n  This next Wednesday evening, as fireworks thunder over the Jefferson \nMemorial in Washington and are mirrored in the reflecting pond around \nit, patriotic strains will fill the air. Similar scenes will play out \naround the country. Whether in Washington or in small towns or medium-\nsized cities around the Nation, or in large cities, we may all be proud \nto be Americans first and foremost. Whatever other allegiances we might \nhave, to party, church, state, or community, we are Americans first. \nLet us celebrate that and let us not forget it.\n  As you light your sparklers and fountains, as you hear the martial \nmusic of John Phillip Sousa, as you applaud the fireworks displays, as \nyou eat the first sweet corn and tomatoes from the garden, look around \nyou and feel proud. Be proud that 225 years ago, bold men risked their \nlives and their fortunes and their sacred honor to give us this \nwonderful system of States, this amazing governmental system, this land \nof the free, this home of the brave united as one nation under God and \nunder the red, white, and blue flag of the United States of America. \nFeel glad that so many of your fellow citizens are standing at your \nshoulders watching the parade, or sitting nearby with their families \nlooking up at the sky ablaze with man-made stars. In these crowds is \nour hope for a long future as a people united still under Old Glory, \nand under the Constitution of the United States.\n\n  Mr. President, Thomas Jefferson spoke of our constitutional \ngovernment as the ``sheet anchor'' of our peace and safety. He chose \nhis nautical allusion fittingly. A sheet anchor, according to the \nMerriam-Webster Dictionary, is a noun that first appeared in the 15th \nCentury. It is a large, strong anchor formerly carried in the waist of \na ship and used as a spare in an emergency, but the phrase has also \ncome to be used for something that constitutes a main support or \ndependence, especially in times of danger. Truly, then, the \nConstitution is not just the organizing construct of our government, \nbut also, as Jefferson saw it, the tool by which our Nation would \npreserve our liberties. It is fitting, then, to close with the words of \nthe poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, who wrote about the republic in \n``The Building of the Ship.''\n\n       Thou, too, sail on, O Ship of State!\n       Sail on, O Union, strong and great!\n       Humanity with all its fears,\n       With all the hopes of future years,\n       Is hanging breathless on thy fate!\n       We know what Master laid thy keel,\n       What Workmen wrought thy ribs of steel,\n       Who made each mast, and sail, and rope,\n       What anvils rang, what hammers beat,\n       In what a forge and what a heat\n       Were shaped the anchors of thy hope!\n       Fear not each sudden sound and shock,\n       'Tis but the wave and not the rock;\n       'Tis but the flapping of the sail,\n       And not a rent made by the gale!\n       In spite of rock and tempest's roar,\n       In spite of false lights from the shore,\n       Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea!\n       Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee,\n       Our hearts, our hopes, ours prayers, our tears,\n       Our faith triumphant o'er our fears,\n       Are all with thee--are all with thee!\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I certainly join my colleagues in \nexpressing our warm appreciation for our senior colleague, our \nPresident pro tempore, for addressing the Senate in such a stirring \nmanner.

Mr. President, I want to comply with the wishes of the \ndistinguished leaders.\n\n[[Page S7156]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, may we have order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not in order. The Senate will \nsuspend. Please take your conversations off the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to accommodate the managers, but I \nam ready to proceed. I think I can describe my amendment in about 10 or \n15 minutes or less. I urge colleagues to accept that offer to move \nahead and give equal time to each side.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry, I say to my friend, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Virginia, we have had trouble hearing over here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The Senator from \nVirginia is entitled to be heard.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my good friend, the distinguished majority whip, \nI am seeking now to address my amendment. It has been pending for some \nseveral days. I am perfectly willing to enter into a time agreement. I \nneed but, say, 15 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Say 30 minutes evenly divided?\n  Mr. WARNER. I am quite agreeable to 30 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. REID. Our anticipation now--we will work this out, speaking with \nthe managers of the bill--is to offer side by side with yours, or \nsecond degree, whatever your manager wishes to do, but you should go \nahead and proceed. We are available during our 15 minutes to respond.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, might I have clarification? If I \nunderstand it on the second-degree, in the event it seems we need some \nadjustment in the time agreement with which to address that----\n  Mr. REID. Why not take an hour evenly divided, and if we don't need \nit, we will yield back the time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am not sure what the Senator from \nVirginia wishes to do. I hope they will not second degree your \namendment but, rather, offer an amendment which would be a stand-alone, \nside-by-side amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry, did you say you wanted to offer it side by \nside? That is what we want to do.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is perfectly agreeable. Could my amendment be voted \non first?\n  Mr. REID. Of course--well, let me not get my mouth ahead of my head.\n  In the past what we have done, Mr. President, is the second-degree \namendment could be a second-degree amendment that appears to be the one \nwe would ordinarily vote on first. Through all these proceedings, the \nstand-alone was the one we would vote on first. In other words, that \ncould have been a second-degree. That is what we have done in the past.\n  Mr. GREGG. Actually, we did reverse the order on the Snowe----\n  Mr. REID. It is not important whether it is first or second. Do you \nagree?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. We should go first.\n  Mr. REID. Through these entire proceedings--I don't know how many \nvotes it has been now, but certainly it is lots of them--the one that \nwould have been the second-degree should be voted on first. We think we \nshould do it in this instance.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I believe I have the floor. I believe the \namendment is up. We are simply discussing a time agreement. I am not \nprepared to yield the right that I believe I now have with respect to \nproceeding with this amendment. But I want to accommodate my \ndistinguished friend. He has been most helpful for 3 or 4 days, as I \nhave worked on this amendment.\n  Could you be more explicit exactly what you think you would like to \nhave? I understand you have to consult with others.\n  Mr. REID. What we would like to do is offer an amendment that would \nbe voted on, a companion to yours.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine.\n  Mr. REID. The only question now, it seems, is which one would be \nvoted on first. What we have done during these entire proceedings \nexcept for one bipartisan amendment that was offered by the Senator \nfrom Maine, the one that would have been a second-degree is voted on \nfirst. We think we should follow that same order.\n  Mr. WARNER. I simply ask as a matter of courtesy--some 3 days I have \nbeen working with you--just allow mine to be voted first. Certainly we \ncould have discussion on the one that is in sequence. I am confident \nMembers will very quickly grasp the basic, elementary framework that I \nhave in my amendment. And I presume any companion amendment you or \nothers wish to introduce would likewise be very elementary. We could \nquickly make decisions, all Senators, on it and proceed with our \nbusiness this afternoon.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator from Virginia, I know some of our \nfriends would rather we went first. We feel pretty confident of our \nvote, so we will go second.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I like a man who is audacious. I accept \nthat challenge. We will proceed on mine. I need only about 10 minutes \nto address it.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the distinguished senior Senator from Virginia \nyield for a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. WARNER. Oh, yes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We were able to reach this agreement with the \ncooperation of all our colleagues. I think we are now prepared to \npropound the agreement.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following be the only \nfirst-degree amendments remaining in order to S. 1052, except the \nWarner and Ensign amendments which have been laid aside and which now \nare being debated, that they be subject to relevant second-degree \namendments; all amendments must be offered and disposed of by the close \nof business today; and that upon disposition of these amendments the \nbill be read a third time and a vote on final passage of the bill occur \nwithout any intervening action or debate:\n  Frist substitute; Frist, liability; Craig, long-term care; Craig, \nnuclear medicine; Kyl, alternative insurance; Santorum, unions; \nNickles, liability; Bond, punitives; Thompson, regarding point of \norder; Kennedy, two relevant; Daschle, two relevant; Carper, relevant, \nto be offered and withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, I ask if the majority \nleader would be willing to adjust his unanimous consent so Senator \nEnsign could modify his amendment, which is pending, and also, because \nwe have not seen the Kennedy, Daschle, or Carper amendments, we would \nwant to reserve the right to have a second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The amendments are subject to second degrees, of course. \nI ask consent the Ensign amendment be allowed to be modified.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Reserving the right to object, a simple point: My \namendment was listed as one having to do with a point of order. If we \ncould correct that, it actually has to do with venue.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask consent the clarification be made with regard to \nthe Thompson amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I also ask that the Nickles amendment be defined as \nrelevant, rather than liability, and, since the majority leader has \nasked to reserve two relevant amendments, the Republican leader be \ngiven two relevant amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the majority leader modify the request?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent that the request be so modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is modified.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, may I inquire of the majority leader, is it \nyour intent to at least shape the field of amendments into a set number \nbut there is no time tied to those? Is that correct?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is correct.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request. Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank our colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I may just proceed, my understanding is \nthat we have 30 minutes equally divided under the time agreement. Is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That has not been propounded.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I suggest we just leave it open. I want to\n\n[[Page S7157]]\n\ngive adequate opportunity to those who wish to address this subject. I \nwill proceed.\n  Mr. President, for some time I have followed this bill very \ncarefully. I am, of course, quite aware of the name of it--the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. I want to ask the Senate to give serious \nconsideration to protecting the right of a patient to receive what I \nregard as a fair return on such awards as a court may approve, \npresumably, by a jury recognizing the plaintiff's case has merit and \nassigns an award figure.\n  The McCain-Kennedy-Edwards bill provides new rights. But there is \nnothing in there to give the patients the protection from what could \nwell be perceived by many as an unfair allocation of that award between \nattorneys and patients. Therefore, I think there should be a framework \nof caps on the maximum amount of the award to be made.\n  May I explain it.\n  It is kind of complicated because we have a Federal court and a State \ncourt. While I don't know the ultimate finality of this legislation, at \nthis point the amendment provides for the treatment of caps in both \ncourts, and they are somewhat different.\n  In addition, I believe very strongly that there is in rare instances \nand under extraordinary circumstances a case where an attorney would be \nentitled to in excess of the one-third cap that I am proposing in both \nFederal and State courts. An allowance has to be made for the \nexceptional type of case.\n\n  I am proposing a framework of caps. It would be giving the court the \nright to only approve attorney's fees in a case up to one-third of the \naward of the damages. It could well be that the client may have struck \nan arrangement with his attorney for less than one-third. It recognizes \nthat situation.\n  Having the one-third cap strengthens the ability of the patient--the \nclient--to get a fee structure which is consistent with their receiving \nthe majority of the ultimate one-third as the basic structure in both \nthe Federal and the State court.\n  In addition, in both Federal and State court, we have exceptions in \nrare cases, and extraordinary facts, where the judge can go above the \none-third with no cap.\n  We have reposed confidence in our judiciary system. Indeed, we have \nreposed confidence in those members of the bar. Many years ago, I was \nprivileged to be an active practitioner before the bar and had \nextensive trial experience as assistant U.S. attorney and some modest \ntrial experience in other areas.\n  I recognize that the vast majority of the bar will work out a fee \nschedule with their client in such a way that there will be an \nequitable distribution. But there are instances where the patient could \nwell be deserving of the award by the court and then prohibited from \ngetting what I perceive as a fair and proportionate share by someone \nwho does not follow the norm.\n  The norm in most cases does not exceed one-third. Contingent fees are \nusually one-third or less. Therefore, we put in the cap of the one-\nthird.\n  I also want to make it clear that there is a good deal of expense to \na lawyer associated with representing a client. They pass it on to the \nclient, of course, but that expense is over and above the fees. If it \nis a 2-week trial with a lot of expenses associated with it, it does \nnot come out of the one-third allocation. It is over and above, and \nagain subject to the court's discretion.\n  We lay out a formula for the Federal courts under the lodestar \nmethod. That is a formula that was approved by the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States as it relates to attorney fees in Federal cases.\n  Here are basically the factors the court would review in the Federal \nsystem: The time involved by the attorney; the difficulty of the \nquestions involved; the skill requisite to perform the legal services; \nor the preclusion of employment of the attorney due to acceptance of \nthe case.\n  In other words, he is giving up other opportunities to take on this \ncase.\n  What are the customary fees that are before the courts and the bar in \nthe jurisdiction that the case is held? Whether the fee is fixed or \ncontingent; time limitations imposed by the client on the \ncircumstances; the amount involved in the return of the jury in most \ninstances; the experience and reputation and the ability of the \nparticular attorney, and on it goes. But it is carefully worked out \nthrough many years of following these cases.\n  Therefore, I believe that we are giving protection to the patient. \nFor rare and extraordinary cases, the court can go above it. In some \ninstances, the court will decide that the one-third is not appropriate, \nand that it should be some fee less than a third, again protecting the \ninterests of the patient.\n  I find this a very reasonable amendment. It certainly comports with \nthe basic objectives of this law; namely, to give some benefits to \nthose who have suffered the grievances which are designated in this \nlaw.\n  I also recognize the Federal-State law; that is, what we call States \nrights. I have been a strong proponent of that throughout my career in \nthe Senate.\n  I provide that in the case of a State court, if the State in which \nthat court sits has a framework of laws which govern attorney fees, \nthen this amendment does not apply.\n  I repeat that the State law would govern the return to the attorney \nof that amount to which he or she is entitled for their services--not \nthis proposed amendment.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague in the Chamber.\n  I yield the floor for the moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request I am \ngoing to propose in just a minute--or in even less than a minute.\n  Senator Gregg is in the Chamber, and I appreciate his listening.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized to offer \nan additional first-degree amendment, with 30 minutes for debate in \nrelation to the Warner amendment and the Reid amendment to run \nconcurrently prior to a vote in relation to the Warner amendment--which \nthe Senator from Virginia indicated he wanted first--followed by a vote \nin relation to the Reid amendment, with no second-degree amendments in \norder prior to the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 852\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Warner and I have worked side by \nside all the time I have been in the Senate on the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee. I have been his subcommittee chairman; he has \nbeen my subcommittee chairman. Twice I have been chairman of the full \ncommittee. I have been the ranking member of that committee.\n  There is no one I have worked with in the Senate who is more of a \ngentleman than the Senator from the Commonwealth of Virginia, Mr. \nWarner. He has been a pleasure to work with. We tried to work this out \non the attorney's fees. We have been unable to do that. But his \namendment is, in my opinion, very complicated. It is going to create \nlitigation, not solve it.\n  We have a fair way to address this issue. Even though personally, as \nan attorney, I had done a great deal of defense work where I was paid \nby the hour and a significant amount of work where I was paid on a \ncontingency fee basis many years before I came back here, I think \ncontingent fees should be based upon whatever the States determine is \nappropriate.\n  But I am willing to go along with the basic concept of the Senator \nfrom Virginia; and that is we will go for a straight one-third, no \ncomplications. It is very simple: A straight one-third.\n  Senator Warner's proposal introduces a complex calculation in every \ncase and ignores the agreements between injured patients and their \nlawyers. This proposal portends to tell State judges how to apply State \nlaw. We do not need to do that here in Washington.\n  This proposal ties only one side's hands in litigation. HMOs can hire \nall the attorneys they want and plaintiffs cannot. There is no \nrestriction on how much money the attorneys for the HMOs make. We are \nnot going to get into that today. We could. It would be a very \ninteresting issue to get into.\n  But what we are saying is, when you walk down in the well to vote on \nthe amendments, we have a very simple proposal: It is one-third, \nperiod. Under\n\n[[Page S7158]]\n\nSenator Warner's proposal, it is something, and we will figure it out \nlater based on how many hours, and where you did it, and what kind of \ncase it was. Ours is simple, direct, and to the point. It would only \ncomplicate things to support the amendment of my friend from Virginia.\n  Mr. President, at this time, after explaining my amendment, I call my \namendment forward and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 852.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To limit the amount of attorneys' fees in a cause of action \n                        brought under this Act)\n\n       On page 154, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       ``(11) Limitation on award of attorneys' fees.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Subject to subparagraph (B), with \n     respect to a participant or beneficiary (or the estate of \n     such participant or beneficiary) who brings a cause of action \n     under this subsection and prevails in that action, the amount \n     of attorneys' contingency fees that a court may award to such \n     participant, beneficiary, or estate under subsection (g)(1) \n     (not including the reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket \n     expenses of an attorney as approved by the court in such \n     action) may not exceed an amount equal to \\1/3\\ of the amount \n     of the recovery.\n       ``(B) Equitable discretion.--A court in its discretion may \n     adjust the amount of an award of attorneys' fees required \n     under subparagraph (A) as equity and the interests of justice \n     may require.\n       On page 170, between lines 21 and 22, insert the following:\n       ``(9) Limitation on attorneys' fees.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, or any arrangement, agreement, or contract regarding \n     attorneys' contingency fees, subject to subparagraph (B), a \n     court shall limit the amount of attorneys' fees that may be \n     incurred for the representation of a participant or \n     beneficiary (or the estate of such participant or \n     beneficiary) who brings a cause of action under paragraph (1) \n     to the amount of attorneys' fees that may be awarded under \n     section 502(n)(11).\n       ``(B) Equitable discretion.--A court in its discretion may \n     adjust the amount of attorneys' fees allowed under \n     subparagraph (A) as equity and the interests of justice may \n     require.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President and Members of the Senate, the language in \nthis amendment was not made up in some back room by my staff or \nsomebody from downtown. It was taken--every word of it--directly from \nthe amendment originally offered by the Senator from Virginia--exactly \nidentical, not a word changed.\n  Certain paragraphs were taken out of his amendment. It is far too \ncomplicated. But every word in my amendment is directly from the \namendment offered by the Senator from Virginia. I ask Senators to \nsupport my amendment, what should be a bipartisan amendment.\n  There are some people who want no restrictions. We have acknowledged \nthat we are going to, in this instance, have a restriction. If there is \ngoing to be one, it should be direct and to the point, as is this one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield whatever time the Senator from \nDelaware wants.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Five minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Five minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, for clarification, are we under a time \nagreement?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, we are.\n  Mr. WARNER. Was that in the unanimous consent agreement?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. But I say to the Senator, whatever time you need we \ncan yield to you.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I always find these debates about \nattorney's fees fascinating. I find my friends on both sides of the \naisle who usually are seeking to restrict attorney's fees are the most \nbig-time free enterprise guys in the world. They are people who tell us \nwe should not freeze and/or put limitations on the amount of money \nenergy companies can make, even though it bears no relationship to \ncost. They are folks who told us out in California--when you have \nutility companies gouging the public--that we should not, even though \nwe have authority under Federal law, put on some limitations. They are \nfolks who tell us that, notwithstanding the fact that a drug company \nmay be able to manufacture a pill for one-quarter of 1 cent and sell it \nfor $75, there should not be any relationship between the amount of \ncost involved and the profit made.\n  I find it absolutely fascinating. For example--I am not going to do \nit--a great amendment to the amendment by my friend from Virginia would \nbe the following: That any fee charged by an HMO for health care \ncoverage must bear direct relationship to their cost and cannot exceed \na profit rate of X amount. That would be fair, right?\n  All these folks who can't afford health insurance, who are getting \nbanged around and battered, we are trying to help, but I imagine I \nwould not get many votes for that. I bet my friend from Virginia would \nnot vote for that because that is free enterprise.\n  My grandfather Finnegan used to have an expression. He said: You \nknow, it's kind of fascinating. There's free enterprise for some \npeople, free enterprise for the poor, and socialism for the rich. You \nfind yourself in a position where, if you are representing the right \ninterest, we talk about free enterprise; if you don't like the \ninterests that are at stake, you find that you should have socialism, \nyou should have imposed limitations on fees or on profits, based on \nwhether you like what is going on.\n  I do not know whether most people know this, that an awful lot of \nthese folks who want to bring suit against a giant company don't have \nany money. These giant companies, they have a lot of money and a lot of \nlawyers. So what they do is, they depose you to death, which costs \nthousands and thousands and thousands of dollars.\n  So what happens? You go to a lawyer, and you say: Look, I have this \nclaim. And the lawyer sits down and says: OK, who knows what the jury \nwill do, and who knows what will happen with regard to the defense that \nis going to be put up? And it seems to me you have a case. You have a \n60-percent chance of winning this case. I'll tell you what I will do. I \nam going to front all the expenses. I am going to take all the chances.\n  It is sort of free enterprise. It may cost that law firm $50, $500, \n$5,000, $50,000, $100,000, and they are betting on the come. They are \nbetting on the come. Some law firms actually risk their solvency on a \ncase that they believe is worth pursuing.\n\n  Then you are going to come along and say: By the way--after the fact, \nafter the risk is taken on behalf of a client, where you may get \nabsolutely nothing and you may end up in the hole, losing a lot of \nmoney, because I can tell you, major corporations do what they are \nentitled to do under this system. They have batteries of lawyers, and \nthey just depose the devil out of you. It costs. For example, the \nperson taking down my comments right now, the cost to the American \ntaxpayer for that transcription is hundreds of thousands of dollars a \nyear--millions of dollars a year. We need to have a record, and we do \nit.\n  The same thing happens in the depositions. Somebody sits with a \nlittle machine like that and types away. So if I am the deep-pocket \ncompany and I want to run you out, all I do is I keep deposing you; I \nkeep submitting interrogatories; and I run your cost up because you \nhave to pay for that.\n  I guess the only point I am trying to make is--and I don't want to \ntake the time because I am sure everybody's mind is already made up on \nthis thing--if you feel good about lawyer bashing, if you feel good \nabout making the case that you should have to justify, on an hourly \nbasis, exactly what you do, and all of these things, not calculate the \nrisk, not calculate the cost, then fine, have at it.\n  But I don't know; what is good for the goose isn't good for the \ngander. If we do this with regard to attorney's fees and we don't do \nthis with regard to health care costs and fees, what is the fundamental \ndifference? Tell me the fundamental difference, all of a sudden, in the \ngreat interest of my friends to protect the poor, aggrieved plaintiff, \nwho has been wronged by the insurance company. At any rate, I am as \nanxious to get out of here as everybody is. I\n\n[[Page S7159]]\n\nwanted to make it clear: I think this is bad law, bad policy, a bad \nidea, and it is, in a literal sense, discriminatory.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this legislation that is now before the body \nis not about attorney's fees. It is about patient protection, making \nsure people in America have certain rights that have been taken away \nfrom them. We want to reestablish something that is kind of old-\nfashioned in the minds of many--that is, when you go see your doctor, \nthe doctor determines what kind of medicine you need and what kind of \ncare you need. That is what this legislation is all about. It is not \nabout attorney's fees.\n  If the people on the other side were interested in saving money, one \nof the amendments they should have would address the compensation of \nsome of these employees. There is a list, and you can go to the top 10. \nThe first one, including stock options, made $411,995,000 last year. \nThat is just a little item they might be concerned about a little bit. \nWe have a lot of money that isn't necessarily needed.\n  This is not about how much money people make. What it is about is \ntrying to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. I ask that we move forward \nas quickly as possible and vote and get on with the rest of the \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Tennessee may have some of mine.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. A couple of minutes, if I may, Mr. President.\n  I have been listening to the debate. We are making it much more \ncomplicated than it needs to be. We are talking about whether or not \nthis is a good idea. The sponsors of these two amendments always come \nforth with good ideas. I will not debate that these are possibly a \ncouple of those good ideas.\n  I am afraid we are not permitted to get that far because not every \ngood idea is constitutionally permissible. I simply do not see our \nauthority, even if we want to do this under the Constitution, to say to \na State court, having lifted the preemption that was there before, that \nin its deliberations and in its lawsuits it will be trying, that we \nhave, in a government of enumerated powers, the authority to reach in \nand do that. This is not raising an army. This is not copyrights and \npatents. This is not interstate commerce. I simply see no basis of \nauthority for the Congress to do this, whether it is a good idea or not \nin our system of enumerated powers.\n  If I am incorrect about that or there is something I am not thinking \nabout, I will stand corrected. That is a concern of mine.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I could reply to my distinguished \ncolleague, that very question I entertain because I take pride in my \nrecord of some 23 years in this body to protect State laws.\n  The first thing I did under my amendment was say, if there is a body \nof State law, then my amendment doesn't apply to those decisions in \nState courts. So I think there is some dozen or so that have a \nstatutory framework for the regulation of attorney fees. Those States \nare the one side.\n  But we find authority that it is within the power of the Congress to \nregulate interstate commerce. We have a proposed bill giving new rights \nto litigants. We believe that comes within that clause. That is how I \nproceed to do it.\n  We are just very fearful, I say to my distinguished colleague, that \npatients will not be able to, without this authority of some cap, \nobtain a fair allocation of these proceeds in some few cases. I myself \nhave a high confidence in the bar and the courts to exercise equity and \nfairness. In some instances, it might not prevail.\n  We have studied cases here where some lawyers are getting $30,000 per \nhour, in some of these tobacco cases. Mind you, $30,000 per hour. I \njust think it is time that we, the Congress of the United States, do \nwhat we can within the framework of our constitutional law to exercise \nand put a cap on that.\n  I say to my good friend from Nevada, he has marked up an earlier \nversion of my bill. And at least you started with a pretty good base \nhere, but you took out the essence of it. We did remain with a one-\nthird fee, but giving the court the right to raise or lower this fee \nwithout any guidance whatsoever, even without the guidance of the word \n``reasonableness'' put into the proposal by my friend from Nevada.\n  It seems to me that, while we are apart, we could possibly bridge our \ndifferences, if I could have the assurance that a patient, as we now \ncall them under this proposed legislation--plaintiff, under ordinary \ncircumstances--is given reasonable protections. I have tried to give \nthe court the flexibility in those instances where, for example, if a \ntrial took 2 or 3 weeks and then, through no real fault of the attorney \nor anyone else, there somehow was a mistrial--I have tried them myself. \nJurors get ill, sick. For whatever reason, the court pronounces a \nmistrial and the attorney has to go back and try the whole case over \nagain--that begins to add up in time and expense, and so forth. That \nattorney should be fairly compensated, and his client has to recognize \nthat in rare and extraordinary cases the court can adjust the fee above \nthe one-third. I find in here no guidance whatsoever.\n  Under the Federal law, I laid down a formula which has been approved \nby the Supreme Court and is followed now in our Federal system.\n  I further point out to my distinguished colleague from Nevada that \nthe ERISA framework of laws governs much of the action in Federal \ncourt. And there ERISA puts an affirmative duty on a judge to review \nthat attorney's fee. You are, in effect, modifying the framework of \nERISA here, as I read it quickly, and not putting that affirmative duty \non the court in the Federal system to review those attorney fees.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I apologize to my friend. Did the Senator \nfrom Virginia ask me a question?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, I had been going on for some minutes now. I will go \nback over it again. I say to my good friend, you took an earlier \nversion of my amendment, and in striking it out, No. 1, you left the \none-third cap in, but you give the discretion to the judge to go up or \ndown, with no guidelines by which that jurist goes up or down. In other \nwords, there is no even standards of reasonableness. It could be \nimplied, of course. But I looked upon the lodestar method, which is \nfollowed by the Federal courts in arriving at a fair and equitable fee \nsituation. I just believe there is no guidance for the jurist in the \nproposal of my colleague.\n\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator from Virginia, in every State court in \nAmerica, every day judges are called upon to use their discretion to \ndetermine attorney's fees. In estate cases, in cases where people are \nhired to represent indigent defendants, there are a multitude of cases \nin which judges every day use their discretion to make awards of \nattorney's fees.\n  Here, as the Senator has given a number of examples, if the judge, in \nrare instances, would find that somebody has been paid too much under \nthe contract, he can take a look at that. Or there may be some very \ncomplicated appeal and maybe he would decide that there should be a \nlittle more there.\n  Tobacco has nothing to do with this.\n  Mr. WARNER. I missed the word. What has nothing to do with this?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator talked about the tobacco litigation. I say that \nhas nothing to do with this matter now before the Senate because these \nattorney's fees were very high, of course, and litigation results \nbecause these attorneys recovered not hundreds, thousands, millions, \nbut billions of dollars. Tobacco attorneys were hired by State \nattorneys general. I don't think there is anything that I can ever even \ncontemplate that would be the same in relation to tobacco and these HMO \ncases. I would say that we have pretty well formulated both of our \npositions.\n  I respectfully say that the Senator from Virginia is taking away the \ndiscretion the State judges have. It makes it very complicated to \ndetermine attorney's fees. What we have come forward with is a process \nthat is very specific, direct, and to the point, and leaves some \ndiscretion with State judges.\n  (Mr. NELSON of Florida assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. WARNER. I want to make it clear. I think it is clear in the \namendment that the expenses are over and above the allocation of fees.\n  Mr. REID. I took that directly from your original amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I was also quite anxious to ensure that if a State has a\n\n[[Page S7160]]\n\nframework of law regarding the award of attorney's fees, this does not \napply. I think it is important that we honor those States that have a \nframework and laws which set attorney's fees, which is in my amendment. \nI am just trying to help you improve yours so that you prevail.\n  Mr. REID. Well, I guess there is some reason that could be done. That \nis only going to complicate what we have. We are trying to give as much \ndiscretion as possible to State judges. I think they need that. I think \none of the problems that I have with the Senator's original amendment \nis it takes away from State law, from what States can do. It seems \ninteresting to me that we are so in tune with States rights around here \nall the time, unless it comes to something dealing with injured \nparties--whether it is product liability cases or whatever. We suddenly \nwant to take away what the States have worked on for all these decades. \nI think my friend's amendment takes away a lot of what we have with our \nStates.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will read to my friend section (E) of my \namendment, page 6:\n\n       No preemption of state law.--Subparagraph (A) shall not \n     apply with respect to a cause of action under paragraph (1) \n     that is brought in a State that has a law or framework of \n     laws with respect to the amount of an attorney's contingency \n     fee that may be incurred for the representation of a \n     participant or beneficiary--\n\n  And so forth. In other words, if the State has a framework of State \nlaws, we in the Congress should not be trying to amend them, as I fear \nyou are doing through an omission in yours. I have protected it in \nmine.\n  Mr. REID. Well, I understand what the Senator's intent is. When you \nare looking for intent, you want to be as precise and direct as \npossible. I respectfully say we should get on with the vote. I think we \nhave said everything, but maybe not everyone has said it. You and I \nhave.\n  Mr. WARNER. Let me point out one other thing. Again, there is a \ndifference as to how these things are treated under Federal and State. \nAs I said, ERISA gives certain protections that are involved in the \nFederal court. There Federal law requires relief grievance under ERISA \nand that is not found in my friend's amendment. You say it is implicit \nin every court in the land; therefore, it is not needed to be \nexpressed. Is that your point?\n  Mr. REID. The reason we took your basic amendment and made it \ndirectly to the point as to the one-third is it becomes too complicated \nfor a court to determine attorney's fees based on the complicated \nprogram you have set up. Ours is simple and direct. In rare instances, \na judge can step in and raise them or lower them.\n  Mr. WARNER. I wanted to make sure they were explicit. That is my \nview. We have a difference of opinion on that.\n  Mr. President, I will soon suggest the absence of a quorum so I have \nsome period of time to reflect on perhaps other suggestions I might \nhave. I am willing to allow these amendments to be laid aside if the \nSenator would agree to proceed with others.\n  Mr. REID. We have been laying aside things so long----\n  Mr. WARNER. If that is of no help, we need not do that.\n  Mr. REID. I have no problem having a quorum call and we can talk. I \nreally think we have to move on. I am willing to take my chances, \nwhatever they might be. Other people are waiting around to offer \namendments. We should move on if we can.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I am prepared to move forward with an \namendment, if that is desired by my two colleagues, while you have your \ndiscussions. If you want to go into a quorum call, we will wait.\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to set these two amendments aside and let \nmy friend from Tennessee, who offered probably the best elucidation on \nattorney's fees today--No. 1, he was concise and to the point. I think \nprobably both of these are unconstitutional. I am willing to go \nforward.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the two amendments by Senators Reid and \nWarner be set aside and that the Senator from Tennessee be allowed to \ncall up an amendment. The Senator's amendment is on the improved list, \ncorrect?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendments are laid aside.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 853\n\n (Purpose: To clarify the law which applies in a State cause of action)\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I send to the desk an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Thompson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 853.\n       On page 170, between lines 21 and 22, insert the following:\n       ``(9) Choice of law.--A cause of action brought under \n     paragraph (1) shall be governed by the law (including choice \n     of law rules) of the State in which the plaintiff resides.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I let the amendment be read because it \nis probably the shortest amendment that will be considered tonight. It \nis very simple and straightforward. Basically, what it says is that in \nthese lawsuits that we are dealing with, we apply the law of the State \nof residence and citizenship of the plaintiff in this case.\n  Let's go back just a bit and understand the lawsuit scheme that we \nhave created by this litigation. We have created a Federal cause of \naction in Federal court for matters that are essentially contract; and \nwe have created a State cause of action in State court for matters that \nhave to do with medically reviewable situations.\n  What that has left us with is the ability of a claimant to bring a \nState court claim in any State where the defendant is doing business. \nIf you have a medical insurer and they are doing business in several \nStates, even though you live in Tennessee, you could bring your lawsuit \nin any number of States where that insurer is doing business. That is \nsimply known as forum shopping.\n  The reason people do that is different States have different laws in \nterms of limitations on recovery. They have different rules of \nevidence. Some allow punitive damages--most do. Some cap those punitive \ndamages. Some don't allow punitive damages at all. So I don't believe \nwe want to create a situation where if we are going to have this \nliberal litigation scheme that we have set up, that we allow it to \noccur anywhere in the country, which might be the case with regard to \nsome big defendants.\n  Now, employers in some cases are going to be defendants also, I \nbelieve it is quite clear. You not only have the insurance companies, \nbut you also have the employers to look at and to see whether or not \nthey are doing business in these various States and, if they are, then \nyou could bring your lawsuit in any of those States in which they are \ndoing business. I don't think that serves the purposes that we are \ntrying to serve with this legislation.\n  Therefore, we have the authority, and I think it would be a wise \nexercise of our authority and discretion, to limit those lawsuits. If \nyou are from the State of Tennessee and you have a legitimate claim and \nyou want to bring a lawsuit, you ought to be bound by the law in the \nState from which you come. You should not be able to forum shop.\n  Now, there might be some Federal causes of action that are also of \nthe medically reviewable kind. We have been talking in this debate for \nseveral days about State causes of action, but what we are really \ndealing with is the laws of those States. They are causes of action \nbased on the laws of individual States. So if a person wants to bring \nhis lawsuit, he can still bring it in Massachusetts if he lives in \nTennessee, but he is bound by the law of Tennessee.\n  If there is a diversity situation in Federal court, where the Federal \ncourt has jurisdiction and you have a doing-business requirement \nsatisfied as far as the corporate defendant is concerned, for example, \nyou have diversity. You still are bound by the law of your home State. \nSo that would prevent forum jumping.\n\n  I believe this is desirable. I heard several expressions of agreement \nwith the proposition we did not want to create a system of forum \nshopping in this litigation. We are going to have this law apply to all \n50 States. There will be lawsuits produced in all 50 States, and all 50 \nStates have laws that will be applicable in the suits wherever they are\n\n[[Page S7161]]\n\nbrought. A citizen ought to be bound by the laws of his or her State \nand not be able to shop all over the country for a potentially better \nsituation than what they have in their State. It is a State cause of \naction. They should be bound by the laws of their home State.\n  That is the amendment. I hope my colleagues will see the wisdom of it \nand will reach agreement on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Tennessee, his \nargument is persuasive enough that all the managers on our side left \nthe floor, so I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \npermitted to speak as in morning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Akaka are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I express great appreciation also for the \nSenator's strong support for our Patients' Bill of Rights. This has \nbeen an issue in which he has taken a great personal interest. He has \nbeen one of the strong supporters of this legislation for many, many \nyears. Although he has not been a member of our committee, this is a \nmatter I know he cares deeply about. He has been a strong supporter of \nall the amendments that have protected patients, and I don't think \nthere has been a member who has been a stronger advocate for the \npatients and their rights than our good friend, the Senator from \nHawaii. I thank him very much for his statement and all the work he has \ndone to help bring the bill to where it is.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Nevada will \nmodify his amendment and we will have a voice vote, and the Senator \nfrom Tennessee will have an amendment agreed to, also. Hopefully, we \ncan dispose of those two amendments right now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 849, As Modified\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I call up amendment numbered 849 and I \nsend a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside.\n  The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 849), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Subtitle C of title I is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 122. GENETIC INFORMATION.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Family member.--The term ``family member'' means with \n     respect to an individual--\n       (A) the spouse of the individual;\n       (B) a dependent child of the individual, including a child \n     who is born to or placed for adoption with the individual; \n     and\n       (C) all other individuals related by blood to the \n     individual or the spouse or child described in subparagraph \n     (A) or (B).\n       (2) Genetic information.--The term ``genetic information'' \n     means information about genes, gene products, or inherited \n     characteristics that may derive from an individual or a \n     family member of such individual (including information about \n     a request for or the receipt of genetic services by such \n     individual or a family member of such individual).\n       (3) Genetic services.--The term ``genetic services'' means \n     health services, including genetic tests, provided to obtain, \n     assess, or interpret genetic information for diagnostic and \n     therapeutic purposes, and for genetic education and \n     counseling.\n       (4) Genetic test.--The term ``genetic test'' means the \n     analysis of human DNA, RNA, chromosomes, proteins, and \n     certain metabolites, including analysis of genotypes, \n     mutations, phenotypes, or karyotypes, for the purpose of \n     predicting risk of disease in asymptomatic or undiagnosed \n     individuals.

I ask that the yeas and nays be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I understand both sides have agreed to \nthis amendment. It has to do with genetic testing. We debated it last \nnight. I appreciate Senators Kennedy, Gregg, and McCain working \ntogether, along with the White House, to make sure we are not \ndiscriminating against people based on genetics; that people with the \nbreast cancer gene or colon cancer gene, or whatever gene they may have \nbeen born with, will not be discriminated against in the future. I \nappreciate everybody working with us on this matter.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are prepared to accept this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 849), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to reconsider the vote by which the amendment was \nagreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 853\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I believe I am correct in saying my amendment has been \naccepted and it is agreeable to have a voice vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Thompson \namendment, No. 853.\n  The amendment (No. 853) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 833, As Further Modified\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that the amendment of the Senator from \nVirginia be called up, the yeas and nays be withdrawn, and it be agreed \nto by voice vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, should we lay out a full \nunderstanding of our agreement?\n  Mr. REID. I think we should just vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. Your amendment is withdrawn?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I send a modification to the desk.\n  Mr. REID. This is the Warner substitute.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my modification has been sent to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 833), as further modified, is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To limit the amount of attorneys' fees in a cause of action \n                        brought under this Act)\n\n       On page 154, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       ``(11) Limitation on attorneys' fees.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, or any arrangement, agreement, or contract regarding an \n     attorney's fee, the amount of an attorney's contingency fee \n     allowable for a cause of action brought pursuant to this \n     subsection shall not exceed \\1/3\\ of the total amount of the \n     plaintiff's recovery (not including the reimbursement of \n     actual out-of-pocket expenses of the attorney).\n       ``(B) Determination by district court.--The last Federal \n     district court in which the action was pending upon the final \n     disposition, including all appeals, of the action shall have \n     jurisdiction to review the attorney's fee to ensure that the \n     fee is a reasonable one.\n       On page 170, between lines 21 and 22, insert the following:\n       ``(9) Limitation on attorneys' fees.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, or any arrangement, agreement, or contract regarding an \n     attorney's fee, the amount of an attorney's contingency fee \n     allowable for a cause of action brought under paragraph (1) \n     shall not exceed \\1/3\\ of the total amount of the plaintiff's \n     recovery (not including the reimbursement of actual out-of-\n     pocket expenses of the attorney).\n       ``(B) Determination by court.--The last court in which the \n     action was pending upon the final disposition, including all \n     appeals, of the action may review the attorney's fee to \n     ensure that the fee is a reasonable one.\n       ``(E) No preemption of state law.--Subparagraph (A) shall \n     not apply with respect to a cause of action under paragraph \n     (1) that is brought in a State that has a law or framework of \n     laws with respect to the amount of an attorney's contingency \n     fee that may be incurred for the representation of a \n     participant or beneficiary (or the estate of such participant \n     or beneficiary) who brings such a cause of action.\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

I thank my distinguished colleague from Nevada.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 852, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent my amendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. As I understand it, we are down to two amendments on our \nside: Senator Kyl's and Senator Frist's, which will be the substitute.\n  I hope we can get a time agreement on Senator Kyl. How much time does \nthe Senator need? He does not know. And Senator Carper, on the other \nside, is going to make a statement and maybe offer an amendment.\n  Before they go, since people are a little confused, so they can get \nready, we are heading toward the finish line. Before we get to the \nfinish line, I want to mention that a lot of people do a lot of work \naround here. They are called the staff. They are extraordinary. I \nespecially want to thank my staff, Senator Kennedy's staff, Senator \nFrist's staff, who have worked so hard on this. I am sure there are \nmany folks on the other side, but I specifically want to thank \nStephanie Monroe of my staff, Colleen Cresanti, Steve Irizarry, Kim \nMonk, and Jessica Roberts for all they have done to make this process \nmove smoothly for me and allow me to be successful. They really have \nput in extraordinary hours. I greatly appreciate it. They are \nexceptional people, and we thank them very much.\n  Now I suspect the Senator from Arizona is probably ready.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. If I may say to my friend from Arizona, we have not seen \nhis amendment. If we could see it? I wonder if, in the meantime, we \ncould have\n\n[[Page S7163]]\n\nthe Senator from Delaware make a statement.\n  Mr. KYL. Might the Senator from Nevada yield? I have given a copy \nboth to Senator McCain and also to Senator Gregg to give to you. I am \nsorry if you do not have it yet. Maybe Senator Kennedy has a copy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I just received this a minute ago. I am just reviewing \nit. We will be prepared to go ahead in a few moments. I know the \nSenator from Delaware has waited. I understand it is a short statement. \nThen I hope we go to the amendment and we will be prepared to enter a \nshort time agreement or whatever limitation to which the Senator from \nArizona will be agreeable.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Senator from Delaware, through the Chair, how \nmuch time he wishes to take.\n  Mr. CARPER. No more than 15 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Delaware wishes to speak for up to 15 \nminutes. I ask unanimous consent he speak at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 855\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Carper] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 855.\n\n  Mr. CARPER. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n                (Purpose: To disallow punitive damages)\n\n       On page 153, strike line 9 and all that follows through \n     page 154, line 2, and insert the following:\n       ``(10) Statutory damages.--The remedies set forth in this \n     subsection shall be the exclusive remedies for any cause of \n     action brought under this subsection. Such remedies shall \n     include economic and noneconomic damages, but shall not \n     include any punitive damages.\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, the amendment before us, which I will ask \nto be withdrawn in a few moments, is one Senator Landrieu and I offer, \nand I know has the support of a number of Members of this body from \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  A great deal of effort has gone into crafting a compromise with \nrespect to the appropriate venue, Federal or State, for bringing \nlitigation in cases where an HMO has acted inappropriately.\n  As I have studied this issue over the last week or so, the way the \nunderlying bill assigns venue for State action and for action that is \nmore appropriate in the Federal courts, I have come to believe that the \nsponsors of the legislation figured it out just right. When it comes to \ndetermining damages that might be assigned in cases brought in Federal \ncourts, I personally have concluded that there should not be a cap with \nrespect to economic damages.\n  I further agree with the approach that is taken in the underlying \nbill, that in cases where noneconomic damages are sought in Federal \ncourts, particularly in cases where children may be involved who are \nnot working, who do not have a livelihood, or in cases where a spouse--\nperhaps a woman, but it could easily be a man--who is not in the \nworkforce and stays at home with a family, we may not, if we cap \nnoneconomic damages, be really fair to that young person or to the \nspouse who is working from the home.\n  However, with respect to damages at the Federal level, as they \npertain to punitive claims, I am not comfortable with the approach that \nis embodied in the underlying bill. Senator Breaux and Senator Frist \nhave offered an approach which I think is better in this regard, and I \njust want to mention it. It deals with whether or not there should be \npunitive damages awarded on actions taken in Federal courts. I conclude \nthey have it right and those punitive damages should not be allowed in \nthe Federal courts.\n  Having said that, for actions that are brought in State courts, the \nlaws and rules of the States should prevail. If there are caps in the \nState courts, that is the business of the States, and that is \nappropriate. If there are no caps on punitive damages in actions \nbrought before the State courts, that is appropriate as well.\n  As we try to find the compromise here, I believe the underlying bill \nhas it right with the appropriate middle ground on caps and venue. I \nbelieve the underlying bill has it right with respect to damages in a \nFederal action: No caps on either economic or noneconomic damages. I \nalso believe the underlying bill has it right with respect to the \nproper venue, State versus Federal.\n  I believe my friend from Louisiana and my friend from Tennessee have \na better idea with respect to punitive damages and they simply should \nnot be allowed in Federal court.\n  Senator Landrieu is probably en route to the Chamber now to say a few \nwords with respect to the amendment. I do not see that she has arrived \nyet. If I may, I would like to just reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I want to add a word for my colleague \nfrom Delaware. He and I have been working together on this legislation \nsince it came to the floor and beforehand. He has a very well thought \nout position. Some of his positions I do not entirely share, but he has \nbeen very careful and very thoughtful about all these issues and has \nbeen working very vigorously with us on this legislation. He cares \ndeeply about patient protection. He cares deeply about making sure that \npeople all over this country have real patient's rights. He cares \ndeeply about the uninsured. This is an issue he and I have talked about \nmany times. He has made enormous contributions to the legislation that \nis now on the floor.\n\n  I thank the Senator from Delaware for all of his work in this regard, \nand I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Let me say, too, to my friend from North Carolina, I \nthank him very much for his overstatement of my contribution. He is \nvery generous.\n  I say back to you, you have been just a terrific manager and \ncosponsor of this legislation, and thank you for giving us the \nopportunity to work closely with you and your staff.\n  That having been said, I still do not see Senator Landrieu joining us \non the floor. Were she here, she would speak in support of this \namendment, but would go on to add some concerns she has with respect to \ncapping noneconomic damages, particularly as they pertain, as I \nreferred to earlier, to young people and spouses who may be staying at \nhome and are not in the workplace.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I thank my colleague.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 855 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. CARPER. That having been said, Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the amendment be withdrawn, and I yield the remainder of \nmy time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I rise to say I wish we were voting on the amendment of \nthe Senator from Delaware. I believe the punitive damages issue in this \nbill is a major issue.\n  I understand the decision not to go forward. We know the probable \noutcome of the vote. But there is no question in my mind that his \namendment would cause a movement in the right direction on the issue of \npunitive damages. This bill, as all of us have pointed out who have \nconcerns about it, is going to be candy land for lawyers. One of the \nreasons it is going to be is because of the punitive damage language \nwhich allows forum shopping for the best punitive damage opportunities; \nwhereas, under today's law, punitive damages are radically distributed, \nand should be because the purpose is to create quality health care, and \npunitive damage awards would drive up insurance costs. That is passed \non to the consumer, which means fewer people can afford insurance.\n  As a practical matter, I want to say that I think the Senator from \nDelaware is on the right track, and I hope the conference will listen \nto his comments.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? I say to my friend \nfrom New Hampshire that my fervent hope is that when the bill passes \nthe Senate\n\n[[Page S7164]]\n\nand later the House, and the conference committee is established, the \nconferees will have a full opportunity to revisit this issue. My hope \nis that the final compromise will reflect this amendment.\n  I also want to express to the Senator from New Hampshire my heartfelt \nthanks for the leadership he has provided to the Republican side of the \naisle on this issue, and my appreciation for a chance to work with him, \nas well as the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 854\n\n  Mr. Kyl.

This amendment would amend section 302 of the \nunderlying legislation to provide that employers and health plan \nissuers would be free to offer, and participants and beneficiaries free \nto choose, health plans with two remedy options, in addition to the \nunderlying plan: equitable relief--the benefit or value of the benefit; \nand unlimited economic damages.\n  The bill provides damages as provided under S. 1052 unlimited \neconomic and non-economic, and up to $5 million in punitive damages.\n  This amendment applies only to the new remedies established by S. \n1052 for Federal contract actions and state ``medically reviewable'' \nclaims. It explicitly protects the regulation of medical care delivery \nunder state law.\n  The problem: Increased premium costs lead to greater numbers of \nuninsured. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that S. 1052 would \nresult in a 4.2 percent increase in premiums costs. This predicted \nincrease is in addition to the 10-12 percent increase employers are \nalready facing this year.\n  The CBO report illustrates the cold truth about a critical, but often \noverlooked, public policy issue: The irrefutable link between health-\ncare premium increases and the number of Americans without insurance. \nAs the Congress debates the various health-care proposals, we must keep \nthis linkage in mind.\n  Supporters of S. 1052 are quick to claim that their bill will improve \nhealth care, but not so quick to admit that it will also raise costs \nand cause the ranks of the uninsured to swell. We know this will \nhappen, because cost increases will cause some employers to stop \noffering health-care coverage, making insurance unaffordable for more \nAmericans. This fact is politically inconvenient.\n  We should keep an important statistic in mind. According to the Lewin \nGroup consulting firm, for each one percent premium increase, an \nadditional 300,000 citizens lose their insurance.\n  As I mentioned, the Congressional Budget Office predicts that S. 1058 \nwill increase premiums by 4.2 percent. A premium increase of this \namount would cause about 1.3 million Americans to become uninsured as a \nresult of S. 1052. The Office of Management and Budget recently \npredicted that between 4-6 million more Americans would become \nuninsured as a result of S. 1052.\n  How can we call this a Patients Bill of Rights when it will result in \nfewer patients?\n  I believe our first goal should be to ``do no harm''; or, at a \nminimum, to reduce the harm, as my amendment will do.\n  My amendment would allow employers or plans to offer two options for \nemployees to voluntarily choose, in addition to the general plan \ncovered by this bill, Option No. 1: A low premium policy with a remedy \nlimited to the benefit, or the value of the benefit. Option No. 2: A \nmid level premium policy that would allow for full economic damages \nonly.\n  There are in addition to the higher premium policy that would allow \nfor the full range of damages provided under S. 1052.\n  This amendment should be appealing to employers and plans as a way to \ncontrol their costs and appealing to employees as a way to hold down \ntheir premiums by voluntarily limiting their right to sue.\n  Data from the CBO and the Kaiser Family Foundation estimate that S. \n1052 would cost a typical family with health coverage roughly $300 per \nyear. Certainly, we should promise not to pass legislation that would \nreduce or completely consume the $300 or $600 rebate that many \nAmericans will be receiving sometime this summer as a result of the \ntax-relief bill just signed into law by President Bush.\n  If adopted, this amendment would afford Americans a chance to recoup \nsome of the loss imposed by S. 1052.\n  Some have argued that so-called patients' rights legislation that \nincludes an unlimited right to sue is overwhelmingly popular with \nAmericans. It is worth noting that a Kaiser Family Foundation/Harvard \nSchool of Public Health Survey from January 2001 asked the following \nquestion to voters: ``Would you favor a law that would raise the cost \nof health plans and lead some companies to stop offering health care \nplans to their workers?'' In answer to this question, only 30 percent \nvoiced support, and 70 percent voiced opposition to such a law.\n  Fortunately, we don't have to force people to make that choice. We \ncan give them a choice. For those who prefer the right to sue and are \nwilling to\n\n[[Page S7165]]\n\npay they have their plan. For those who are willing to forgo lawsuit, \nthey can buy their plan. And, state remedies apply in any event--so \ncalled ``quality of care'' suits.\n  Certainly, enhancing a patient's right to sue is cold comfort to \nthose who currently can't afford health insurance, or those who lose \ntheir coverage due to increased costs.\n  Clearly, the proposed legislation to reform health care comes with a \nsteep price tag attached. Before we commit to passing legislation, \nperhaps we should first promise not to pass a bill that will lead to \nmore uninsured Americans.\n  My amendment would merely reduce this price tag, and reduce the harm \nwe will do by enacting S. 1052.\n  This amendment is very simple. I ask for my colleagues' attention \nbecause I can't imagine that anyone would want to oppose this amendment \nif the concern is really about patients rather than lawyers.\n  Let me restate that. If we are really concerned about health care for \npatients rather than fees for lawyers, this amendment will probably do \nmore to provide that we keep people insured than anything else we have \ndone during the last week because it provides for a simple option.\n  For any plan of an employer that provides coverage under this bill, \nthey may also offer another option. That option is a plan that would \nenable their employees to forego damages in court. It is that simple. \nYou can't just do that. You have to be providing a plan that is covered \nby this act, so that the full benefits, including all of the rights to \ngo to court and file lawsuits for damages, are preserved. You still \nhave the right to choose that policy.\n  We all know that policy is going to cost more money. The reason it is \ngoing to cost more money is because lawsuits drive up the cost of \ninsurance, which drives up premiums, which means that fewer employers \ncan pay for insurance, which means that fewer employees are insured. \nAnd that is what is concerning all of us.\n  This amendment makes it possible to offer, in addition to the higher \ncost policy, a lower cost policy that would say you can forego your \nrights to litigation. You can just receive the benefits that ERISA \nprovides for today. Those benefits are health care that you contracted \nfor--or the dollar value of that health care.\n  There is a second option in here. That is a limited one, which is you \ncould also go to court and get unlimited economic damages, but no pain \nand suffering damages or punitive damages. Maybe some companies would \nwrite that kind of a policy, too. But either of those policies would \nhave a lesser premium than the policy that would be offered as the \nunderlying plan under this legislation.\n  To some who say there might be a case where there is a quality of \ncare decision which just needs to go to court, and damages need to be \ncollected, my amendment specifically protects all of the State court \nlitigation that is currently developing about quality of care.\n  Even if an employee exercised an option to buy this lower cost \npolicy, that employee would still have all of the rights of litigation \nfor damages in State court.\n  Some have said: Isn't this a little bit similar to the Enzi \namendment? The answer is no. The Enzi amendment said if a particular \ngroup of employees were merely offered a specific kind of policy, they \nwouldn't be covered by the act. That is not my amendment. All employers \nare covered by the act under my amendment. It is just if they offer a \nplan to their employees, they may in addition to that plan offer this \nlower cost alternative.\n  Why do I offer this?\n  As we know, the Congressional Budget Office predicts that the \nunderlying bill would result in a 4.2-percent increase in premium \ncosts. This is in addition to the 10- or 12-percent increase that \nemployers are already facing this year.\n  The Congressional Budget Office report illustrates the cold truth \nthat has been overlooked in this debate; that is, the irrefutable link \nbetween health care premium increases and the number of Americans \nwithout insurance.\n  There is a study by the Lewin Group, a consulting firm, which says \nthat for each 1 percent of premium increase, an additional 300,000 \ncitizens lose their insurance.\n\n  We have CBO's estimate that the cost of premiums is going to increase \n4.2 percent. We have a study that says every 1 percent, an additional \n300,000 people lose their insurance.\n  Do the math. Under this bill, more than a million Americans are going \nto lose their insurance if something isn't done to keep the cost of \nthose premiums down.\n  The Office of Management and Budget recently predicted that between 4 \nmillion and 6 million more Americans would become uninsured as a result \nof S. 1052.\n  That is where this amendment comes in. It is probably the best way to \nensure that we can get premiums down over an alternative that doesn't \nhave as much risk for the insurer, and, therefore, won't have to have \nas high a premium.\n  But I reiterate, it is not in lieu of the benefits that we are \npromising under this bill but, rather, in addition to. It is an option.\n  For this to occur, three voluntary decisions would have to be made.\n  First of all, some insurance companies would have to develop a \nproduct that they might offer to employers or plans to sell for their \nlower cost option.\n  Second, employers would have to decide that in addition to the plan \noffered under the bill, they would offer one of these lower cost \nalternatives that is on the market.\n  Third, employees would have to decide to take advantage of that lower \ncost option.\n  It is all a matter of choice. Nobody is making anybody do anything. \nNone of the benefits under the legislation go away at all, nor is the \nState court remedying.\n  It seems to me, since it is all voluntary, that there is nothing \nmandatory but it gives us one opportunity to reduce premium costs. We \nall ought to be supportive of this proposal.\n  I ask that the remaining time that I have not be yielded but, rather, \nsee if there are any others who might wish to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if Senator Kennedy will allow me to speak at \nthis point, let me say, first of all, that I think progress is being \nmade. Senator Reid has been working. Everybody has been trying to \ncooperate. I believe, after this very important amendment, we will have \nthe substitute, and hopefully we would be ready to go to final passage.\n  I don't want to usurp the majority's role here, but I want people to \nrealize that we are to the point where perhaps we can begin to wrap \nthis up.\n  I thank Senator Kyl for agreeing to not have lengthy debate. He feels \nvery strongly about it, and this is certainly a very good and valuable \nalternative.\n  I heard Senator Bond of Missouri say repeatedly that when it comes to \nhealth care, we should make it available, affordable, and safe. One of \nour greatest concerns about this bill in its present form is health \ninsurance for patients, and what they have available through managed \ncare is not going to be affordable. Rates are going to go up. They are \ngoing to lose coverage for a variety of reasons. So it is a question of \navailability and affordability.\n\n  This is a good, viable alternative. This provides a low-cost option \nthat will, hopefully, result in more people keeping their coverage. But \nit is an option. It is not in place of; it is in addition to what will \nbe available otherwise. It just gives plans the option of offering a \nlow-cost alternative that forgoes lawsuit damages under the law. The \nState court would still have the ``quality of care'' damage available. \nThose lawsuits would still be there. You don't replace that.\n  So I want to emphasize, it is not in lieu of but it is in addition to \nthe plans offered under the bill. This really is about patients, and it \nreally is about the freedom to have a choice, to have an option to \nchoose to have this coverage but not going to lawsuits later on. By \npaying less, they will be able to afford it. That will give them an \noption. I think this would be a very attractive way to make sure it is \navailable and affordable.\n  I would like to speak at greater length on this myself, but in the \ninterest of time I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n[[Page S7166]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Arizona, Mr. \nKyl, for his amendment, which is strikingly similar in concept--as he \nand I discussed off the floor earlier--to the Auto Choice proposal I \nhave introduced each of the last two Congresses, cosponsored by Senator \nMoynihan and Senator Lieberman. \n  Essentially what is envisioned in these kinds of choice proposals is \ngiving the consumer the option of opting out of the litigation lottery \nin return for a lower premium and lower cost.\n  I want to ask the Senator from Arizona if it is his view that this is \nsimilar in concept to the Auto Choice measure that I just described \nthat we have discussed off the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I may answer the question of the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, I am remiss for not acknowledging that my idea for this \namendment came exactly from the proposal the Senator has just \ndiscussed. It seemed to me that if it worked well in that context, it \nwould also work well in this context. I should have mentioned that \nearlier. I know the Senator did not ask the question to get credit, but \ncredit certainly is due him for this idea.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I cannot announce the support of others, but I wanted \nto mention that on the Auto Choice bill there was also the support of \nMichael Dukakis, Joe Lieberman, Pat Moynihan, the Democratic Leadership \nCouncil, the New York Times, and the Washington Post.\n  I cannot say for sure that they would support the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Arizona, but the concept he describes of giving the \nconsumer the option--the consumer gets the option of leaving aside the \nlitigation lottery in return for a lower premium and defined benefits \nprovided for that lower premium. It does not really deny anybody. It \ndoes not deny them the right to sue. It does not put a cap on damages. \nIt does not tell the lawyers what to charge. It simply says to the \nconsumer: You have a choice.\n  What the Senator from Arizona is suggesting is to take what is a \nsound idea for the automobile insurance market, Auto Choice, and apply \nit to the health insurance market.\n  Under his amendment, employers would have the option of offering \ntheir employees up to two additional insurance choices. Given the \nadditional causes of action permitted under this bill, I believe giving \nconsumers the option not to participate in the personal injury \nlitigation lottery is only appropriate.\n  It is important to note, just like my Auto Choice option, choosing \nSenator Kyl's ``Health Choice'' option would be completely voluntary to \nboth the employer and the employees. An employer who offers his \nemployees health insurance would not be allowed to offer only the \nlimited-litigation health policies. Nothing in the Kyl amendment would. \nThe employer must offer the plans envisioned in the Kennedy-McCain \nbill.\n  Therefore, nothing in the Kyl amendment would take away any right. It \nwould merely allow consumers who don't want to sue their health \ninsurance plan, a lower cost health insurance option.\n  While we have made significant progress at improving this \nlegislation, many of us on this side of the aisle have lingering \nconcerns that this bill will dramatically increase the number of \nuninsured Americans. We ought do everything possible to minimize this \nimpact and that is why I wholeheartedly endorse the proposal of the \nSenator from Arizona. Patients need more choices and should not be \nforced into a system of jackpot justice without their consent.\n  As the Senator from Arizona has pointed out, we hope not to have a \ngreater number of uninsured when this is all over. One of the great \nfears many of us have who are going to be voting against this bill is \nthat that is exactly what the result of it will be. But the Senator \nfrom Arizona has astutely offered an amendment that will certainly \nprovide an opportunity for a number of people to receive lower premiums \nand thereby, hopefully, reducing the increase in the number of \nuninsureds which so many of us fear.\n  So I express my strong support for the Senator's amendment. I tell \nhim, I think it is a very good idea. I hope the Senate will support it. \nIt seems to me it is entirely consistent with the theme of the \nunderlying bill. I commend the Senator from Arizona for his fine \namendment.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as I listened to the proposal by the \nSenator from Arizona, the thought came to my mind about the right of an \nindividual to waive rights. That is deeply ingrained as part of the law \nof the United States, so much so that when you talk about \nconstitutional rights in a criminal case--where the rights are much \nmore deep-seated, much more profound, based on the Constitution--that \nright to waive does exist.\n  In a sense, what the Senator from Arizona is proposing is that an \nindividual who seeks health insurance would have the right to waive \ncertain rights, which is recognized in law.\n  The keyword which I found persuasive in what the Senator from Arizona \nhad to say was the word ``voluntary.'' I would add to that--I think \nthis is part of his concept--that it be a knowing waiver--a voluntary, \nknowing waiver. And I would expect that, as part of that, the \nindividual would have counsel to understand his rights, because you \ncannot understand your rights for damages--the complexities--unless you \nknow what they are, and whatever may be said about lawyers on this \nfloor, you need a lawyer to tell you what your rights are. Then the \nindividual would be in a position to evaluate the reduction in \npremiums, and thereby which savings would be passed on to him for what \nhe was giving up.\n  In that context, I think the proposal passes muster.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I, too, thank the Senator from Arizona, Mr. \nKyl, for bringing this amendment to us.\n  This debate has been framed as though everybody had all of their \ninsurance paid for by the company for which they work. I know that is \nnot the case. Throughout America, most people participate in the cost \nof their insurance. So it is going to be very important for every \nindividual who has to participate in the cost of their insurance to be \nsearching, with their employer, for a lower cost way of doing it. This \nis one of those solutions. This is very innovative. It will fill a void \nwe have left by doing the bill, particularly if the estimates are true \non how much insurance is going to go up based on this ability to sue. \nIf it goes up dramatically, there are going to be a lot more people who \nare going to hope there is this kind of an alternative around.\n  So I congratulate the Senator from Arizona for this approach.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I also join in congratulating the Senator \nfrom Arizona. This seems to be the most commonsense amendment we have \nseen since we have been discussing this issue. It provides choice and \nprovides an opportunity for lower cost insurance, and it allows people \nto choose what they want to pay for, for what they get.\n  So I urge support for the Senator's amendment and thank him for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I also urge support for Senator Kyl's \namendment because I think it deals with the essential nature of what \nthis whole debate is about; that is, the tradeoff between coverage and \ncost. That is what the whole debate is about.\n  Some would have us believe we can have additional coverage without \nadditional cost. It cannot happen. Somebody pays the freight sooner or \nlater. We all know it is going to result in additional health care \ncosts.\n  So what this amendment does is recognize that tradeoff, and it \nprovides the individual the opportunity to make that choice--\nrecognizing that tradeoff--which results in a very good approach and a \nvery good amendment.\n  So I urge my colleagues to give serious consideration to supporting \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues in congratulating \nSenator Kyl for bringing this amendment forward. It is exactly one of \nthe\n\n[[Page S7167]]\n\nitems we need to improve this bill significantly. This bill has a lot \nof problems. We all know that. But an amendment such as Senator Kyl's \nwill at least help it out in some parts. It will be very constructive \nto the whole process. I certainly hope my colleagues in the Senate will \njoin in supporting it. It is the right amendment. I congratulate him \nfor bringing it forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opponents have 10 minutes under the \nprevious order.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, having been on the floor for the better part of the \nlast 8 or 9 days, I rarely have heard such wonderful statements and \ncomments about any amendment as have been given to the Senator from \nArizona. I have gone back and read it and reread it and thought that \nsomehow I must be making a mistake in thinking that this amendment just \ndidn't make it, but in any event, the Senate is going to make that \njudgment.\n  I read the Kyl amendment and it reminded me of the great French \nphilosopher who said that laws, in their sublime impartiality, treat \nthe rich and the poor alike, from sleeping under the bridges and \nstealing bread. This is just exactly what the Kyl amendment does.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield? That quote would be much better if \nit were read in French.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Petite a petite, l'oiseau fit son nid.\n  To continue, this is what this amendment does. It says that any \nemployer can go out and sell an insurance policy that is consistent \nwith this bill. It doesn't indicate what contribution the employer has \nto make. It doesn't indicate that the employer has to make any \ncontribution at all. All it says is he has to sell it.\n  On the other hand, they can sell the other policy--that is cheap--\nwhich the employer can help subsidize for that employee. And that \nbasically undermines this whole bill and denies all of the workers all \nof the protections that we have talked about. That is a great choice. \nThat is really a wonderful choice to have. And we all know what can \nhappen. This basically undermines the whole concept of this \nlegislation.\n  There is no guarantee under the Senator's proposal that there is \ngoing to be a comparable and that the employer is going to do it. All \nthey have to do is just sell the policy. So this is an extremely unfair \nand weighted alternative. Basically, it will provide a way, a vehicle \nfor millions and millions and millions of hard-working American \nfamilies to lose the benefits of this legislation, and it just doesn't \nmake sense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe that perhaps if Senator Kyl or others can yield \nback their time, we are ready to go to the Frist-Breaux substitute. \nSenator Frist is here ready to proceed. Is that acceptable on all \nsides?\n  Mr. REID. We would vote on the Kyl amendment subsequent to the Frist-\nBreaux amendment being offered.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is correct. We would vote in stacked series, Kyl, \nBreaux-Frist, and then I presume we would be ready for final passage.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I could just conclude my remarks in \nsupport of my amendment and in response to Senator Kennedy, how much \ntime remains under my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. I understand that Senator Frist would like to quickly \nproceed. There are several people who would like to speak in support of \nmy amendment. Therefore, what I would like to propose is that we lay my \namendment aside, go to Senator Frist, and I take up the remainder of my \ntime prior to the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The amendment is laid aside.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 856\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 856 and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. FRIST], for himself and Mr. \n     Breaux, proposes an amendment numbered 856.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will be brief, given the late hour.\n  At this juncture, I have introduced an amendment which is a \ncomprehensive approach to the Patients' Bill of Rights. Essentially \nthis bill is the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill which was introduced on May \n15 of this year, modified with several of the amendments, which we will \nspeak to shortly in the introduction either now or, if we have an \ninterruption, we will speak to them in the 15 minutes on this side.\n  What I wish to stress is that this amendment is a comprehensive \nreplacement amendment for the bill. It involves strong patient \nprotections, access to specialists, access to specialty care, access to \nemergency rooms, elimination of gag clauses, continuity of care.\n  It has a strong appeals process, internal and external appeals. It \nrequires full exhaustion of the internal and external appeals process. \nIf the external decision--again, that is an independent physician, \nunbiased, independent of the plan--overrides the plan, then and only \nthen does one go to court for the extraordinary damages. At any time \nduring the appeals process you can go for what is called injunctive \nrelief. Once you go for these damages, what are they? Economic damages \nare unlimited; noneconomic damages are $750,000 or three times economic \ndamages. And that is a change from the underlying Frist-Breaux-Jeffords \nbill.\n  There are no punitive damages. In our bill, as I mentioned, we \nrequire full exhaustion of the internal and external appeals process. \nWe go to Federal court. We have not had very much debate over the last \nweek on the Federal versus State court. Senator Breaux will be speaking \nmore directly to that. It is critical, we believe, that we take this \nnew Federal cause of action to the Federal courts. There are strong \ntimelines.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to make sure people get the care \nthey need when they need it--not a year later or 2 years later or 5 \nyears later. It is a balanced approach. The amendment itself is the \nFrist-Breaux-Jeffords of May 15. We have included the amendments put \nforth by Senator Thompson and modified by Senator McCain on the \nexhaustion of internal/external appeals. We have also included the \nSnowe-DeWine language. That is the direct decisionmaker language that \nthey drew upon from our bill, the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill. But we \ntook the specific Snowe-DeWine amendment and placed it in our bill; in \naddition, the amendment of Senator Bond, with the 1 million uninsured, \nthen the liability would be repealed, which passed on the floor, is \nalso a part of our bill.\n  Secondly, we did raise the noneconomic caps from $500,000 to $750,000 \nor three times economic damages.\n  As a physician, as someone who has taken care of patients, as someone \nwho recognizes that the purpose of a Patients' Bill of Rights is for \npatients to get the care when they need it, not extraordinary lawsuits, \nnot frivolous lawsuits and skyrocketing costs, all of which will be \nabsorbed by the 170 million people, we believe this bill is the \nbalanced, responsible way of delivering a strong enforceable Patients' \nBill of Rights.\n  I yield, if I might, to the cosponsor, coauthor of the bill, Senator \nBreaux. Senator Jeffords will be speaking a little bit later. The three \nof us, as part of the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords amendment, have worked very \nhard over the last 2 years to put together this balanced bill, the only \ntripartisan bill in the Senate which comprehensively addresses the \nPatients' Bill of Rights.\n  I yield to Senator Breaux.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, do we have a time agreement on this \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time established on this \namendment.\n\n[[Page S7168]]\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Let's try it without an agreement. We will see how it \ngoes without any kind of agreement.\n  Mr. President, I rise to comment on the bill that is now before the \nSenate. It is the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords substitute bill.\n  Before doing so, while the Senator from Tennessee is still on the \nfloor, I want to say something about how enjoyable it has been to work \nwith him. While most of us are going to be leaving this Chamber tonight \nor tomorrow sometime to spend time with our family on vacation or have \nan enjoyable period of time that we can rest and relax, the Senator \nfrom Tennessee, because of what he does professionally and what he \nbelieves in, is going to be leaving on a flight tonight to go to \nAfrica. He is going to Africa to do surgery on women and children and \nfamilies who cannot afford health care on the continent of Africa.\n  I want to say how proud all of us can be of one of our colleagues who \nhas that type of attitude. He not only serves his constituents in \nTennessee in this body but also serves so much of humanity in various \nplaces in the world by volunteering at his own cost, on his time, with \nhis medical expertise, serving people who have no health care. We are \ntalking about a Patients' Bill of Rights on the floor of the Senate. He \nreally, truly is practicing that by providing medical services to \npeople who can't afford it in various parts of the world.\n  For those who are interested in getting a Patients' Bill of Rights \nenacted into law, let me say that, without the amendment that we have \noffered, the bill will not become law because the President has clearly \nindicated he will veto a bill that does not contain some of the main \nprinciples that you can find in the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords substitute.\n  What I am talking about is not that complicated. The White House has \nsaid we are creating new Federal rights, Federal remedies, and we are \namending a Federal statute--the ERISA laws of the United States. If \nthere is going to be any litigation dealing with these new Federal \nrights, they ought to be handled in the Federal courts. Why do we \nrecommend that? Why does the President say that is important? So we can \nhave one consistent way of handling all of these potential suits that \nwill be filed. Instead of having 50 different courts, with 50 different \njurisdictions, with 50 different rules of evidence and 50 different \nprocedures on how to handle litigation, you would have any disputes \ndealing with these Federal rights handled in the Federal court systems \nof the United States.\n  Our opponents argue that the Federal courts don't want any more suits \nto be filed. Neither do the State courts. There is not a State court or \ndistrict court anywhere in the United States that is going to say we \nneed more litigation, come sue on a State level. Neither the Federal \nnor State courts want any additional litigation because they are as \nfull as they possibly can be. So the argument that the Federal courts \ndon't want them--well, neither do the States. I think from a matter of \ntrying to make sure we have a system that works, that is, a national \nsystem that protects Federal rights, it should be in Federal court.\n  If this is not part of the final package, the final package, indeed, \nwill not become law, and that would be a very serious mistake for the \npeople in this country.\n  Second, we have recommended some type of caps--a reasonable amount of \ncaps on noneconomic damages. We have no caps on economic damages, of \ncourse, but we suggested a cap of $750,000 for pain and suffering, for \nnoneconomic damages, or three times the amount of economic damages, \nwhichever is greater. We tie it to inflation. I think that is \nreasonable.\n  We had also suggested something I think would be very important for \nthe patients and, indeed, the lawyers who are concerned about \nlitigating cases. There are no caps on our bill for gross negligence. \nAt an earlier time we had offered that there would be no caps for \nwrongful death if a person was killed as a result of some decision made \ndealing with medical necessity. Then there would be no caps whatsoever \neither for gross negligence or wrongful death.\n  Those two ingredients are very important. What happens when this bill \nleaves this body, if we are truly interested in getting an agreement, \nis that somehow between now and the time this bill gets down to the \nWhite House, these concerns are going to have to be addressed in a \nfashion that I think means they are going to have to be adopted. It \ndoes us no good to have a bill that is going to be vetoed. We will help \nno patients. They get a good political issue, but they don't get any \nhelp, any guarantees. We will have spent all of this time arguing about \nthings that cannot become law. So I think the clear thing that our bill \nprovides, which I think is absolutely essential either now or at some \ntime, is that we have a degree of Federal jurisdiction that enforces \nthe Federal rights that we are creating in this legislation, and that \nwe address the question of unlimited damages in a way that allows the \nWhite House to be able to sign this bill.\n\n  I will tell you that in reading what we have done with all of the \namendments--the Snowe, Thompson, and DeWine amendments --where we have \nsplit jurisdiction, and the Kennedy-McCain bill which says some of the \nsuits will be in State court and some in Federal court, our suggestion \nis just the opposite. The new rights will be in Federal court, and all \nthe previous ones in the State courts will remain.\n  We need to do some work on this. We have created something that is as \ncomplicated as the Egyptian hieroglyphics. If you had a flowchart on \nwhat we are suggesting in the bill now before the Senate, we could not \nfigure out where you go and when you go to the different courts and for \nwhat rights. That is unacceptable. This thing needs a lot of work \nbefore it can become law because I am afraid that what we have created \ntonight in this bill is unmanageable and unworkable. Our suggestion \nmakes it a great deal better.\n  I am under no illusions about what is going to happen, but I know I \nam also not under any illusions about what can be signed into law and \nwhat cannot. I fear that what we have tonight cannot be signed into law \nwithout the recommendations we have made.\n  I yield the floor. I see my colleague from Vermont is also with us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, for nearly 5 years, Congress has debated \nhow best to enhance protections for patients enrolled in managed care \nplans without unduly increasing health care costs, imposing significant \nburdens on America's employers, and adding to the ranks of the \nuninsured. Our debate over the last two weeks has given us ample \nopportunity to thoroughly discuss these critical issues.\n  Through the amendment process the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill has \nbeen significantly improved. I particularly commend Senator Snowe for \nher amendment on employer liability and Senator Thompson for his \namendment on exhausting the appeals process.\n  However, I believe the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill is still \nfundamentally flawed in two critical areas. First, the bill would \nsubject plans to excessive damages in the new federal cause of action. \nAnd second, by subjecting plans and employers to a new State cause of \naction, the bill destroys the current national uniformity for \nemployers. The bill would subject employers or their designated agents \nto lawsuits in 50 different States.\n  The better alternative to the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill is our \namendment. It is based on the legislation that I introduced with \nSenator Frist and Senator Breaux. It has much in common with the \nMcCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill. They share 11 provisions that provide new \npatient protections. Each provides for information to assist consumers \nin navigating the health care system. Most importantly, the bills \nprovide for an internal and external independent review process with \nstrong new remedies when the external view process fails. Our primary \narea of disagreement lies in the degree that employers are protected \nfrom multiple causes of action in multiple venues and the provision of \na reasonable cap on damages.\n  President Bush has made clear that our amendment meets the principles \nhe has outlined for patient protection legislation that he would sign \ninto law. This balanced legislation also is supported by a wide range \nof groups representing nearly 400,000 of America's physicians and \nhealth professionals.\n  Our amendment protects all Americans in private health plans and at \nthe\n\n[[Page S7169]]\n\nsame time, it gives deference to the states to allow them to continue \nenforcing managed care laws consistent with the new federal rules.\n  Under our amendment health plans that fail to comply with independent \nreview decisions or that harm patients by delaying coverage will be \nheld accountable through expanded federal court remedies, including \nunlimited economic damages. In addition, patients can go to court at \nany time to get the health benefits they need through injunctive relief \nif going through the internal or external review process would cause \nthem irreparable harm.\n  We hope that everyone who is committed to passing legislation that \ncan become law this year will join us in supporting this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, over the course of the last 2 weeks, \nduring the course of this debate, we have made great progress and \nconsensus has been reached on many issues, beginning with the issue of \nscope, how many Americans would be covered by this patient protection \nlegislation.\n  We have worked with Senators across the aisle and have been able to \nresolve that issue and resolve it in a way that all Americans are \ncovered and there is a floor of protection for all Americans.\n  Second, we were able to resolve the issue of access to clinical \ntrials, an issue on which there has been some disagreement in this \nbody.\n  Third, we have been able to resolve the issue of employer liability \nin a way that protects employers from liability without completely \neliminating the rights of patients. We have done it in a balanced way \nso that 94 percent--every small employer in America--are 100-percent \nprotected.\n  We have also resolved the issue of exhaustive appeals so patients \nwill go through the appeals process to get the care they need before \nthey go to court.\n  Medical necessity is another issue resolved during the course of this \ndebate.\n  All of these issues are the issues of great work many days, many \nhours of compromise, negotiation, and consensus reached in the Chamber \nof the Senate. This substitute abandons a number of those consensus \nagreements, starting with the issue of scope.\n  On the issue of scope, the Senator from Louisiana and I were able to \nfashion a provision that provides a floor and protects all Americans. \nThat provision was voted on and consensus was reached. That consensus \nprovision is not in this substitute.\n  Second, on the issue of exhaustion, the Senator from Tennessee and I \nworked to fashion a provision that provides that all patients exhaust \nthe appeals before they go to court in a way that does not prevent \npatients who have an extended appeal from being harmed by that extended \nappeal. In other words, if it goes on 31 days or more, they can go to \ncourt simultaneous with the appeal. That exhaustion provision on which \nthere was a huge vote in favor of it in the Senate is not in this \nsubstitute.\n  Third, the independence of the review panels: I concede I have not \nseen the language, but assuming it is the same language that was \noriginally in the Frist-Breaux bill, it has no provision specifically \nrequiring the so-called independent review panel be, in fact, \nindependent; nothing requiring that the HMO not be able to control or \ndictate who, in fact, is on the appeals panel. It is like the HMO being \nable to pick the judge and the jury. So there is not established to \nanyone's satisfaction that, in fact, that appeals panel will be \nindependent.\n  Finally, on the issue of going to Federal court versus State court, \nthe American Bar Association, the Federal judiciary, the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, the State attorneys general, all the objective, large legal \nbodies in this country have said that these cases should go to State \ncourt.\n  That is what our legislation provides. Unfortunately, under this \nsubstitute, the vast majority of cases would, indeed, go to Federal \ncourt.\n  Many Americans live hundreds of miles from the closest Federal \ncourthouse. It would be much more difficult for these injured patients \nto get a lawyer to represent them in a Federal action, particularly one \nthat might take place hundreds of miles away, and most important, and \nthe reason so many of these objective bodies said these cases belong in \nState court, is that it will take so long to get the case heard. There \nis such a backlog already, it makes no sense to send these cases \nto Federal court.\n\n  What we have done instead is say: You, HMO, if you are going to \noverrule doctors, if you are going to make health care decisions, we \nare going to treat you exactly as we treat the other health care \nproviders. We treat them exactly the same. It is the reason this is \nsuch a critical provision to the American Medical Association, to all \nthe doctors groups across this country and to the consumer groups \nacross America.\n  There are fundamental differences in our underlying legislation, as \namended, and in the substitute, starting with the issue of scope, about \nwhich we have reached consensus, going to the issue of exhaustion of \nadministrative remedies, which is not in this substitute; the required \nindependence of the review panel is not in the substitute; the \nrequirement that the cases that every objective body says should go to \nState court, including the U.S. Supreme Court, those cases go to \nFederal court instead under this provision.\n  We have made tremendous progress. I am very pleased with the work of \nall of our colleagues--Republicans, Democrats, and Independent--in this \nprocess. The work has been productive. We have done important work in \nthe Senate, but it is not important to us. It is important for the \npeople of this country, the families of this country who deserve more \ncontrol over their health care decisions, who deserve real rights, \nenforceable rights.\n  That is what we have been able to accomplish over the last 2 weeks. \nUnfortunately, in every respect in which this substitute is different \nfrom the underlying legislation, as amended, it favors the HMO versus \nthe patient. In every respect, we favor the patient; they favor the \nHMO.\n  I say to my colleagues who sponsored this amendment, I know they are \nwell-intentioned. I know they worked very hard on it. I respect every \none of them, and I respect the work they have done, but I believe the \nwork we have, in fact, done in this Chamber over the last 2 weeks is a \nmuch better product and, most importantly, will provide meaningful \nprotections for the patients and families of this country who deserve \nfinally to have the law on their side instead of having the law on the \nside of the big HMOs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time limit.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my good friend, Dr. Frist. \nSenator Frist has been the chairman of our Public Health Subcommittee \nand he and I have worked on a lot of different health care issues \ntogether.\n  I thank Senator Jeffords who has been a strong ally on many health \ncare issues over a long period of time.\n  I have also worked extensively with the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. \nBreaux, on many health care issues.\n  The fact is, when you have this combination of people making a strong \nrecommendation, it is worthy for the Senate to give a true examination \nof their product and their recommendation this evening.\n  Having said all of that, it is worthwhile in the final minutes of \nthis debate and before action that we give special consideration to the \nviewpoints of the doctors, the nurses, and the patients who have \nfollowed this issue and have really breathed life into this issue over \na long time.\n  Tonight, at this time, there is only one matter that is before us \nthat has the complete support of the medical profession, the nurses, \nthe doctors, all of the groups that represent the children in this \ncountry, all the groups that represent the disability community, all of \nthe groups that represent the Cancer Society, all the groups that \nrepresent the aged, all the groups that represent the special needs of \npeople who have special medical challenges. They have had a chance to \nreview each and every provision. They know every aspect of every page \nof all the legislation and the amendments, and they come down virtually \nunanimously in\n\n[[Page S7170]]\n\nsupport of the McCain-Edwards legislation.\n  Senator Edwards has already outlined and Senator McCain will further \noutline the various concerns.\n  Let me mention matters we have focused on during this debate.\n  The clinical trials: We are in the century of life sciences, and we \nare putting resources into and investing in the NIH. We are never going \nto get the benefits of the research in the laboratory to the bedside \nunless we have effective clinical trials.\n  We have strong commitments on clinical trials; Breaux-Frist is short \non that, and it will take up to 5 years to begin the clinical trials.\n  Specialty care: We guarantee specialty care. Any mother who brings in \na child who has cancer will be able to get the specialty care. Breaux-\nFrist does not provide it. If it is not within that particular HMO, \nthen it is not a medically reviewable decision. There are restrictions \nin the bill.\n  We have debated the issues of the appeals. Breaux-Frist still has \nprovisions where the HMO will be selecting the appeal organization, \nwhich is effectively selecting the judge and jury in these appeals.\n  Liability: As has been pointed out, Breaux-Frist brings all the \nliability into the Federal system. Every patients group and every group \nthat concerned itself about getting true accountability for patients \nunderstands the importance of keeping liability in the State court.\n  Even though the words are similar, although we have the issues of \nmedical necessity, although we use the words of specialization, \nalthough the words of appeals are used in both bills, there is a \ndramatic and significant difference. Those are the two choices before \nthe Senate.\n  I thank our colleagues and friends on the other side. There really is \nonly one true Patients' Bill of Rights that is going to protect the \npatients in this country, the families, the children, the women, the \nworkers in this Nation, and that is the McCain-Edwards bill. I hope we \nsupport that shortly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask unanimous consent action with respect to Ensign \namendment No. 849 be vitiated and the Senate vote in relation to the \namendment following the disposition of the Kyl amendment, with up to 10 \nminutes equally divided for debate prior to that vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object, I hope the Senator will \nwithhold. I think a continued effort is underway, and if he will \nwithhold at this point--I prefer not to object--let's see if we can't \nwork it out.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I withdraw my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senators Breaux and Frist for \ntheir efforts. I believe they have a goodwill attitude toward this \nissue. I especially thank Dr. Frist for his leadership not only on this \nissue but on so many other health care issues that come before the \nSenate. I respect their commitment in protecting patients and holding \nhealth plans accountable. I do not believe the substitute has a \nmutually shared goal.\n  Both my colleagues, Senators Edwards and Kennedy, point out some of \nthe differences between our two bills. I remind Members that the \namendment does provide very limited relief in Federal court and would \nonly allow a handful of cases to be addressed: Only those patients who \nreceive approval from the external medical review can go to court.\n  Numerous States, including my home State of Arizona, have enacted \nlaws that permit injured patients to hold plans legally responsible for \ntheir negligent medical decisions. I believe this substitute nullifies \nthese laws. My colleagues may assert they do not preempt State law, but \nI respectfully disagree. Delaying and denying care by an HMO is not a \ncontract issue for Federal court. Delaying and denying of care is a \nmedical malpractice and should be determined in State court.\n\n  As we know, this is a substitute. Over the last 2 weeks we have made \nsome very important changes to this legislation, which is the \nappropriate way to legislate. We have made important changes on \nemployer liability thanks to Senator Snowe and Senator DeWine and \nothers; exhausting administrative procedure, thanks to Senator Thompson \nand Senator Edwards; limits on legal fees, an effort undertaken by \nSenator Warner; reasonable scope, protecting all Americans, limitations \non class action suits, and venue to prevent forum shopping, in which \nSenator Thompson and others were involved.\n  Some of these have been included in the substitute, and some have \nnot. I believe all of these changes that have been made through open \nand honest debate on this legislation should be included.\n  Again, we still have avoided the fundamental issue of State and \nFederal court. I believe that issue is not resolved to the satisfaction \nof the patient as opposed to the HMO.\n  I take an additional minute to thank a number of people including the \nWhite House staff, Josh Bolton and Anne Phelps; Senator Gregg's \nstewardship on this side has been exemplary; Senators Frist and Breaux \nhave obviously been very helpful; Senators Snowe, Lincoln, DeWine, \nNelson, and Thompson. I thank both leaders, Senator Daschle and Senator \nLott, as well as Senator Reid and Senator Nickles, who have been \ninvolved in this issue for a long time, as well as Senator Edwards and \nSenator Kennedy.\n  Soon we will vote on this legislation. I believe we will prevail. I \nthink this, like the campaign finance reform bill, has been open, \nhonest, fair debate on which all sides have been heard, and I think, \nagain, the Senate can be proud, no matter what the outcome, of the way \nwe proceeded to address this issue which is important to so many \nmillions of Americans.\n  This is an important issue to American citizens. This is an important \nissue to the person who cannot contribute a lot of money to American \npolitical campaigns. This is an important issue to average citizens \nwhose voices are oftentimes drowned out in Washington, in my view, by \nthe voices of the special interests, whether they be trial lawyers, \ninsurance companies, HMOs, or others.\n  I think putting patients first and the HMOs second, as we crafted \nthis legislation, is an important outcome and why I have to oppose the \nsubstitute and urge my colleagues to vote favorably when we reach final \npassage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will make two or three comments. First, I compliment \nand congratulate Senator Kennedy and Senator Gregg for their patience \nand leadership in managing this bill and also managing the education \nbill. Also, I congratulate Senator McCain and Senator Edwards for their \ncontribution because they are going to pass a bill, and Senator \nDaschle, as well.\n  This has been a battle that some have been wrestling with for a long \ntime. As a matter of fact, a year ago we passed legislation that was \ncalled Patients' Bill of Rights Plus. In my opinion, it is far superior \nto the legislation we are getting ready to pass tonight. It was \nlegislation that allowed every plan to have an appeal, internal and \nexternal, and it was binding --not binding by lawsuits, but if you did \nnot comply with external appeal, you could be fined $10,000 a day--a \ndifferent approach. I think it is far superior.\n  In looking at the language we have today and in the underlying bill, \nthe so-called McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill, maybe some modest \nimprovements have been made. It is the bill that will finally pass, but \nit is a bill that the President will not sign and the President \nshouldn't sign.\n  I hope we will pass good legislation but not pass legislation that \nwill dramatically increase health care costs, as I am afraid it will. \nThere has to be some reason that employers that voluntarily supply \nhealth care, purchase health care for their employees, that employers \nof all sizes are almost unanimous in their opposition. They are not \ncompelled to buy health care for employees, but they want to. Now we \nare getting ready to threaten them with unlimited liability. We keep \nhearing about suing the HMOs, but suing the HMOs and/or employers and \nthreatening them with unlimited liability, economic damages, unlimited \nnoneconomic damages, pain and suffering--there are costs included.\n  Somebody said we solve that because we have a designated \ndecisionmaker. If\n\n[[Page S7171]]\n\nthere is a designated decisionmaker, the net result is, well, if you \nare going to hand off your liability to me, what am I protecting? What \nam I insuring?\n  With contracts that can be abrogated or breached, an independent \nreviewer can say, you have to cover other things, and you have a lot of \nliability if things do not work out. The net result will be the \nindependent reviewer will say, defensive medicine, we will pay for \nanything because they don't want to be sued. They don't want to be \nliable. Then they increase premiums because whatever the liability is, \nthey don't know how much it is or how expensive it is, and they will \nincrease their rates. They don't plan on losing money and they don't \nwant to go out of business, so there will be a lot of defensive \nmedicine and they will charge extra premiums to the employer to make \nsure they don't go out of business.\n  So the cost estimates, some people have said, are 4- or 5-percent per \nyear increases on top of the already 13- or 20-percent increases built \nin, in increased costs for health care. They are probably much more. \nThe costs of the bill could increase the cost of health care by 8 to 10 \npercent. We should know that.\n  Again, we should do no harm. We should not pass legislation that will \nnot work, that will do harm. It will do harm if you increase the number \nof uninsured. It will do harm if you price insurance out of the realm \nof affordability for millions of Americans. I am afraid that is what we \nare doing.\n\n  There is one other issue that has not received maybe enough \nattention. Senator Collins and Senator Nelson raised that. That is the \nissue of scope: Should the Federal Government be taking over regulating \nthat the States do? I am concerned about the language. It was modified \nmodestly. It said the States have to be substantially compliant with \nthese new Federal regulations. That language goes so far that really \nthe States are going to have to adopt almost identical language to what \nwe have put in this bill. The net result? If they don't, HCFA takes \nover--the Health Care Financing Administration.\n  A couple of points: HCFA can't do it, HHS can't do it, the Department \nof Labor cannot do it. I want to make that point one final time.\n  We are ready to pass this mandate and say to the States: If you don't \ndo it, Federal Government, you do it. If the States don't, you do it.\n  The Federal Government does not have the wherewithal to do it. Every \nState has hundreds of personnel involved in enforcing insurance \nregulation, and we are saying, you do it or we are going to take over. \nThat is one of the largest unfunded mandates ever proposed by Congress.\n  I am a little mad at myself for not being able to offer a point of \norder that this is an unfunded mandate. One of the reasons I cannot is \nthat it was not reported out of committee.\n  The unfunded mandates bill, the Congressional Accountability Act, \nsays we have a report that comes out with the committee report and we \ncan raise a point of order if you have an unfunded mandate on cities, \ncounties, States, and the private sector. We cannot do that because we \ndon't have a committee report because the bill was not reported out of \ncommittee. It was a year ago, but it is not now.\n  My point is this is an enormous unfunded mandate on counties and \ncities and States. We are mandating this on all those employees, \nsaying: We know best, the Federal Government knows best. States, we \nknow you have an emergency room procedure, but we are going to dictate \na more expensive one.\n  I could go all the way down the list. My point is, even though we \nhave done it, we cannot enforce it. You have non-enforceable \nprovisions. There is no protection there. It may make us feel better, \nwe may tell the American people we have provided the protections, but \nwe cannot enforce it because the Federal Government cannot and should \nnot take over State regulation of insurance. That is a mistake.\n  I am afraid the combination of the two, the expanded liability--you \ncan sue employers and the providers for unlimited damages in State and/\nor Federal court for economic and noneconomic, unlimited in both cases. \nYou can jury shop. You can find a place that would work. That is going \nto scare employers. Employers beware, the bill we are passing tonight \nmakes you liable. You are going to have to pay a lot more in health \ncare costs as a result of the bill we are passing tonight.\n  Again, my compliments to the sponsors. They worked hard. The \nopponents worked hard. We will pass a bill tonight. But I hope it will \nbe improved dramatically in conference so we will have a bill that is \naffordable, will not scare people away from insurance, will not \nincrease the number of uninsured by millions. My prediction is this \nbill would increase the number of uninsured by millions and cost \nbillions and billions of dollars. I hope that is not the case. I hope \nit is fixed and improved in conference and we will have a bill that \nPresident Bush can sign and become law and of which we will all be \nproud. Unfortunately, I think the underlying bill does not meet that \ntest.\n  With great reluctance I am going to be voting no on the underlying \nMcCain-Kennedy-Edwards bill. I urge my colleagues to do likewise.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I regret deeply I will not be able to \nvote for this bill. My State does not have a problem with the HMOs that \nother people have expressed. Our State would be mandated by this bill \nto change its laws. The sensible amendment offered by Senator Collins \nwas defeated. The Allard amendments that dealt with small business were \ndefeated. The mandates in this bill will hamper our development of a \nsound health care delivery system for Alaska.\n  It is a vast area with a few people. We do not need the interference \nof the Federal Government. We need help. I think this bill will \ninterfere with what we are doing. I hope by the time it comes out of \nconference I will be able to support it. I commend everyone who has \ntried, but this, the underlying bill, will not help our people; it will \nhurt them; and I cannot support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I think this bill is a lot better than \nwhen we started. There remains one area, of course, where we have \nsubstantial disagreement, and that has to do with where the lawsuits \nare going to be brought. The underlying bill still has a bifurcated \nsystem where some suits can be brought to State court and some in \nFederal court. I think that is the main thing the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords \namendment tries to address.\n  We all can read the handwriting on the wall. I think we know how this \nis going to go. But it is very important our colleagues understand what \nwe are doing. With regard to the underlying bill, there is a \npresupposition, apparently, that a client will walk into a lawyer's \noffice with a tag around his neck saying, I'm a State suit, or, I'm a \nFederal suit. That will not be the case. There will be many cases that \nare mixed. Some will have to do with coverage denial, some will have to \ndo with medically reviewable claims, some will be more of a contract \ncase, some will be more of a tort case. Arguably, it could go in either \ncourt. Some will go to Federal court and the defendant will object and \nsay, no, you belong in State court, and the judge will rule. Then there \nwill be an appeal in that venue. Then that will be determined, and then \nit will go possibly to the opposite court. In other words, there will \nbe litigation at one or more levels in order to determine where you are \ngoing to litigate.\n  Some, on the other hand, will go to State court, and there will be a \nfight there as to whether or not that belongs in State court. It may be \nremanded over to Federal court.\n  Some will come in with cases, parts of which will arguably be in \nFederal court and parts of the same case could arguably be in State \ncourt.\n\n  All I am suggesting is there is no easy solution to this. It has been \npointed out that there are some down sides to bringing them in Federal \ncourt, too. They are overcrowded. We have heard examples of federally \nrelated lawyers and judges saying it ought to be in State court. If you \ntook a poll among the State-related lawyers and judges, they would say \njust the opposite. But at least you avoid the problems I am talking \nabout.\n  We are going into a system now where we are creating new law; we are \ncreating new defendants. But wait, it is not just HMOs and employers. \nThe\n\n[[Page S7172]]\n\nindependent decisionmakers are subject to liability, too. The \nindependent medical reviewer is subject to liability, too. They have a \nhigher standard. I believe it is a ``gross or willful misconduct'' \nstandard. It is a higher standard, but they can be sued for settlement \nvalue or whatever.\n  We have a complicated liability framework, so you have different \npeople, different standards, new lawsuits. It is going to be extremely \nconfusing for a long time, and it is going to result in much higher \ncosts.\n  The tradeoffs may be there. The decisions were made that we adopted \nthis in view of all that. But I think it is very important that at a \ntime when health care costs are already going up in double digits, we \nare doing something that quite clearly is going to result in much more \nlitigation, much more confusion about that litigation. Somebody \nultimately has to pay for all that. It is going to ultimately result in \nhigher costs to our citizens. I think it is important we understand \nthat before we cast these votes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We are just about at the point now where I think we can \nbegin voting on amendments. I ask unanimous consent that following the \nfirst amendment, all other votes be limited to 10 minutes. I ask \nfurther that the two managers be permitted to offer a joint managers' \namendment following the passage, prior to the close of business today.\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I will not \nobject, I just want to clarify where we are. I believe we are ready to \nrecognize Senator Kyl--he had a little time left on his amendment--and \nthen I believe we will be ready to have the three votes: Kyl amendment, \nBreaux-Frist, and final passage.\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, on the managers' package we \nare working to try to reach an agreement. Hopefully, we will reach an \nagreement. If we do not reach agreement--is my understanding correct \nthat we have to reach agreement by the end of today? What is the \nparliamentary situation if we do not reach an agreement by the end of \ntoday?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, there would not be a managers' amendment \nif we couldn't find mutual agreement on the amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 854\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Senator Nickles be \nshown as a cosponsor of amendment No. 854.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. There are two people I know of who would like to speak \nbriefly on my amendment. I would like to respond briefly to what \nSenator Kennedy said and then summarize.\n  May I begin by congratulating the authors of the underlying \nlegislation and expressing appreciation for all those who have worked \nwith me. Especially I want to thank my colleague, John McCain, and \ncongratulate him for his successful efforts in moving this legislation \nforward. It is not always easy when colleagues from the same State are \nnot in total agreement on everything, but he let me know early on when \nI first came to the Senate he didn't expect to agree with me on every \nissue. He said he might even be in disagreement on some matters with me \nfrom time to time.\n  I appreciate his efforts and the efforts of all of those who have \nworked with me.\n  Just to summarize for those who were not here earlier, my amendment \nis very simple. It merely provides an option for employers that offer \nplans that are covered by this bill to also provide an alternative for \ntheir employees. That would permit the employees to have as their \nremedy the receipt of the health care or for the cost of that health \ncare rather than going to court and getting damages as they are \npermitted to do under the bill. This should provide a lower cost \nalternative that could be made available to them. That, in turn, should \nprovide a way for employers that might otherwise have to reduce the \nnumber of employees covered, or not have insurance for their employees \nat all, to continue to provide that coverage.\n  As I pointed out before, according to the Congressional Budget Office \ninformation, and the Lewin Group, probably over a million American \ncitizens will lose their health care as a result of the increased \nexpenses that could result from this legislation.\n  The effort that we have all tried to engage is to find ways to reduce \nthose costs so premiums won't go up as much and so employers can \ncontinue to provide the care. The best way to do that is to allow them \nto provide a purely voluntary option for their employees to accept, \nwhich would not have the same lawsuit damage option but would provide \nthem the health care for which they have contracted. It is about health \nbenefits rather than lawsuits. We think this would provide the remedy \nfor that.\n  The only comment that Senator Kennedy made in opposition was that we \nare not regulating how the employer would have to contribute toward the \ninsurance policies for their employees. That is very true. We are not \ndoing that in the underlying bill. We are not doing it in the Breaux-\nFrist amendment. We are not doing it in my amendment. I don't think \nanybody here has suggested we should be mandating from the Federal \nGovernment how much money the employers have to pay for their insurance \noption that they provide for their employees. I do not think that is a \nrelevant point.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time for those who wish to speak to it. \nThen I will be prepared to yield back.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will just take 1 minute.\n  The Kyl amendment will permit a company to offer a sham policy and a \nreal policy. To get the real policy, an employee will have to weigh all \nof his or her rights under the liability provisions of the McCain-\nEdwards bill. Those are the alternatives. It basically undermines the \nwhole concept of this legislation because it will permit employers and \nHMOs to escape any kind of accountability upon which this legislation \nis built. That creates a massive loophole which is undermining the \nwhole purpose of this legislation.\n  I hope the amendment will be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the hour is late, but the Kyl amendment is \nimportant. There is no sham here at all. It is the marketplace at \nwork--voluntarily to provide the employee with options. The employer \nmust provide health care programs if they are going to provide health \ncare programs that fit this bill, that fit the Patients' Bill of \nRights, but in doing so they also can provide a voluntary option if the \nemployee chooses to take it, which simply says you waive your rights to \na lawsuit. And guess what. It might cost that employee less money. Yet \nhe and she, and their families, might still be covered.\n  Isn't that a reasonable option and a voluntary option to provide to \nthe marketplace?\n  How dare we say that every attorney ought to have a right here? Why \nnot say every employee has a right to a marketplace of options that \nthis voluntary approach that the Senator from Arizona provides gives to \nthe health care system of our country?\n  I support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, over the past 8 days we have had \namendment after amendment that have created massive loopholes in the \nvery basic and fundamental fabric of this legislation, which is to \nprotect patients, protect families, protect doctors, and protect \nmedical decisions against the bottom line of HMOs.\n  This is another one of those in the parade, and it should be \nrejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask for 1 minute.\n  Mr. President, the option provided by Senator Kyl is not a loophole. \nIt is an option. Under his plan, all policies that an employer would \noffer would provide the external and internal reviews that we have in \nall of the plans. The option to go to specialists, the gag rule \nprotections that we have made a part of this bill--all of that would be \nin the plan.\n\n[[Page S7173]]\n\n  It would simply give the employee an option, if he thought it would \nsave him money and he or she didn't intend to sue for benefits, to \nchoose a policy that could be cheaper and simply not have certain \nlawsuit rights but, in fact, that operate for liability purposes under \ncurrent law. It is no worse than current law. It is no better than \ncurrent law. That is an option that could save a working family money \nthat they need for their budget.\n  For those who want all matters to be exactly the same, I don't see \nwhy they would resist such an option. I think it is good for the \nemployees.\n  I salute Senator Kyl. I also note that Senator Jeffords had a hearing \nrecently on the uninsured in America. We know there are over 40 million \nuninsured and that every 1 percent increase in insurance costs causes \n300,000 people to drop off the insurance rolls.\n  I think it is a good move. I support it.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, there is nothing mandatory in this \nlegislation. It is all voluntary. It is a simple choice for the \nemployees. I hope my colleagues will support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I yield all time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Kyl \namendment No. 854. The yeas and nays have been ordered and the clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I wish to enter into a colloquy with the \ndistinguished manager of the bill to clarify the intent of the \nsponsors.\n  Section 202 of the bill amends the Public Health Service Act with a \nnew section 2753 that applies all of the requirements of title I of the \nPatients Bill of Rights to each health insurance issuer in the \nindividual market.\n  Current law, at section 2763 provides that none of the preceding \nrequirements of the ``individual market rules'' apply to health \ninsurance coverage consisting of ``excepted benefits''.\n  Similar provisions exist in current law at section 2721 of the Public \nHealth Service Act for the group insurance market. A parallel provision \nexists in ERISA at section 732 for ``excepted benefits''.\n  Is it the intent of the managers of the bill that current law section \n2763 and the parallel provisions for the group market in the Public \nHealth Service Act and ERISA remain in full force notwithstanding the \nlanguage of new section 2753?\n  In other words the requirements of title I of the Patients Bill of \nRights would apply to individual and group health insurance other than \n``expected benefits'' coverage.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. It is the intent of the managers \nof the bill that the requirements of title I do not apply to insurance \ncoverage consisting of ``excepted benefits''.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nbipartisan McCain-Edwards-Kennedy Bipartisan Patient Protection Act. \nManaged care reform, particularly the enactment of a comprehensive \nPatients' Bill of Rights, is one of the most important issues currently \nbefore either body of the U. S. Congress. After all the debate we have \nhad on the floor in the last two weeks, I believe we are at the cusp of \nproviding true, meaningful protections for every American in every \nhealth care plan.\n  Unfortunately, while over 160 million Americans rely on managed care \nplans for their health insurance, HMOs can still restrict a doctor's \nbest advice based purely on financial costs. The fact is, we know that \nthe great promise of managed care--lower costs and increased quality--\nhas in all too many cases turned into an acute case of less freedom and \ngreater bureaucracy.\n\n[[Page S7174]]\n\n  I want to tell my colleagues about the Malone family from Everett, \nWashington. Their son, Ian, was born with brain damage that makes it \nvery difficult for him to swallow, to even cough and gag properly. He \ncannot eat or breathe without being carefully watched. He's fed through \na tube in his stomach since he can't swallow.\n  The doctors at Children's Hospital in Seattle--one of the best \npediatric care institutions in the world--said that Ian could leave the \nIntensive Care Unit but would need 16 hours of home nursing care a day \nfor Ian. And while initially the Malone's health insurance company paid \nfor this care, it decided to cut it off. Ian's father says that ``The \ninsurance company told us to give Ian up for adoption and let the \ntaxpayers step in and pay for his care. They didn't care. It was all \nabout saving money.''\n  It seems that the week's rhetoric has centered on the idea of \nbusiness and employers versus patients--as if these two interests are \ninherently antithetical, rather than complementary. But they are not. \nIn fact, I believe the Bipartisan Patient Protection Act is a balanced \napproach to protecting patients and protecting the business of managed \ncare.\n  My home State of Washington has been a leader in providing health \ncare to all of its citizens and has enacted strong patient protections \nat the state level. Under Washington State law, patients have the right \nto accurate and accessible information about their health insurance; \nthe right to a second opinion; timely access to services by qualified \nmedical personnel; the right to appeal decisions to an independent \nreview board; and the ability to sue providers for damages if they are \nsubstantially harmed by a provider's decisions.\n  I believe that States are the laboratories of democracy and I do not \ntake lightly the possibility that any federal legislation would \nundermine or preempt state law. I spent six years on the Health Care \nCommittee in the State House of Representatives and just this last year \nWashington passed a comprehensive Patient's Bill of Rights. In issues \nsuch as the one before us this week, it is paramount that federal \nlegislation enhance state protections, not undermine them.\n  And that is what this bill does. The McCain-Edwards-Kennedy \ncompromise explicitly preserves strong state patient protection laws \nthat substantially comply with the protections in the Federal bill. \nThis is an extremely important point. The standards for certifying \nstate laws that meet or exceed the Federal minimum standard ensure that \nonly more protective State laws replace the Federal standards.\n  But I find it ironic that opponents of a strong, enforceable, \nPatients' Bill of Rights have traditionally limited the scope of the \npatient protections in their managed care reform legislation to those \nindividuals in self-insured plans, which are not regulated by the \nStates, and assert that the States are responsible for the rest.\n  This approach denies Federal protections to millions of Americans--\nteachers, police officers, firefighters and nurses who work for State \nand local governments; most farmers and independent business owners who \npurchase their own coverage; most workers in small businesses who are \ncovered by small group insurance policies, and millions more who are \ncovered by a health maintenance organization. We need federal \nprotections so that all Americans are guaranteed basic rights.\n  In fact, no state has passed all the protections in the bipartisan \nMcCain-Edwards-Kennedy Patients' Bill of Rights. To fail to enact this \nbill would mean that neighbors, and sometimes workers in the same \ncompany, will have different protections under the law. The scope of \nthis legislation simply ensures that all Americans in all health plans \nhave the same basic level of patient protections.\n  Let me focus for a few minutes on what this bill does.\n  This bill protects a patient's right to hear the full range of \ntreatment options from their doctors, and it prohibits financial \nincentives to limiting medical care.\n  This bill allows patients to go to the first available emergency room \nwhen they are facing an emergency--regardless of whether that \nparticular E.R. is in their managed care network.\n  This bill allows women to go directly to their obstetrician or \ngynecologist without going through a ``gatekeeper,'' and it allows \nparents to bring their children directly to pediatricians instead of \nhaving to go through primary care physicians.\n  This bill allows patients with life-threatening or serious illnesses, \nfor whom standard treatments are ineffective, to participate in \napproved clinical trials.\n  This bill has laid out stringent, tough, enforceable internal and \nexternal review standards, and we have ensured that a truly independent \nbody has the capability and authority to resolve disputes for cases \ndenying access to medical care.\n  This bill promotes informed decision-making by patients, by requiring \nhealth plans and insurance companies to provide details about plan \nbenefits, restrictions and exclusions, and other important information \nabout coverage and rights under the legislation.\n  Finally, the Bipartisan Patient Protection Act holds insurers and \nHMOs accountable for their acts.\n  Twenty years ago, very few Americans were in managed care plans. \nSince the early 1990s, however, insured workers' enrollment in \ntraditional fee-for-service plans has dropped from about 50 percent to \nunder 25 percent. The broad shift to managed care has been driven, \nlargely, by cost concerns. But in our need to control health care \ncosts, it is imperative that we do not forget what we are supposed to \nbe doing--providing health care.\n  There will be few issues more important in the 107th Congress than \nthe one we are voting on today. Health care affects people personally, \nevery day of their lives, and we have a real responsibility to ensure \nthat any changes we make put the patient's interests first. That is \nwhat this bill does, and I proudly rise in support of the Bipartisan \nPatient Protection Act.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I was prepared to offer an amendment to \nS. 1052 concerning mandatory arbitration to ensure that HMOs are held \naccountable for their actions, which after all is one of the primary \npurposes of this bill. I have been asked not to offer that amendment, \nso I wanted to discuss it with the lead sponsors of the bill and ask \nthem to clarify their intent.\n  Some managed care organizations currently require patients to sign \nmandatory binding arbitration contracts before any dispute arises. \nThese provisions effectively deny injured patients the right to take \ntheir HMO to court. Instead they are forced to go into binding \narbitration, which can be a stacked deck against patients. We have \nspent much of the past 10 days debating whether injured patients should \nbe able to go to court to vindicate their rights. It is clear that a \nmajority of the Senate supports such rights, otherwise we would not be \nabout to pass this legislation. So I am asking my colleagues to clarify \nthat it is the intent of the sponsors that injured patients are granted \nlegal rights under this legislation that permit them to go to either \nstate or federal court to pursue compensation and redress, \nnotwithstanding a mandatory arbitration provision in an HMO contract. \nCan they further clarify that it is not the intent of the sponsors of \nthis legislation that patients can lose the legal rights we are \nproviding in this bill by being forced into mandatory binding \narbitration? In these arbitrations, the HMO chooses the arbitrator, \nthere are substantial up-front costs that the patient has to bear, \nthere is limited discovery, no right to appeal, and no public record or \nprecedential value of the decision.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Wisconsin for raising this very \nimportant issue about this legislation. We have come very far on this \nlegislation. It is the intent of the bill's sponsors and of the \nmajority about to pass this bill that patients will have the full legal \nrights provided under this historic legislation. It is not our intent \nto provide these important legal rights on the one hand and then allow \nthem to be taken away by mandatory arbitration contracts entered into \nbefore a dispute arises. We have said that this bill gives patients the \nright to an external appeal process and to go to court, and we intend \nthat cases arising under these rights should be heard by the external \nreviewer in court, and not by private arbitrators.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator would yield, I agree that our bill would \nbe severely undermined if health insurers could avoid the protections \nwe have tried to guarantee in this bill by inserting a clause in the \nfine print of the contract to require binding arbitration of disputes \nthat might later arise.\n\n[[Page S7175]]\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I agree with my distinguished colleagues that HMOs \nshould not be permitted to revoke the protections we have worked so \nhard to provide in this bill through the use of mandatory binding \narbitration provisions in their contracts. Patients have no ability to \nbargain over the fine print of the health insurance contracts. That is \nwhy we have had to provide federal standards in this bill, and it would \nbe wholly contrary to the approach of this bill to allow a backdoor \nroute for these standards and protections to be avoided.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank my colleagues, the prime sponsors of this \nlegislation for these clarifications. Based on these assurances, I will \nnot offer my amendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, during the past five years, we have \ndebated the merits and faults of assorted patients' rights legislation. \nWe have offered statistics, we have shared stories, and we have reduced \nstrong legislation--legislation that held the real possibility of \nprotecting all Americans--to weaker law that protects a minority of the \npopulation. Our work at times spoke of this issue in the abstract, yet \nthere is nothing abstract about it. The 180 million Americans enrolled \nin health care plans have always understood exactly what it means to \nhave insufficient coverage. However, they are not sitting on the edges \nof their seats, watching our heated arguments and waiting breathlessly \nfor an outcome. Instead, they are engaged in the battles they have \nfought for far too long, and their disputes have far higher stakes. \nThey are, quite literally, fighting with managed care organizations for \ntheir lives. The American people are tired, Mr. President, and deserve \nrelief from these battles. They deserve good health and the peace of \nmind that comes with quality care. It is time we cast aside our \npartisan bickering and give the American people the right to health \ncare, as well as the right to seek redress if denied quality health \ncare. It is time to pass the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Recognizing that 43 million Americans go without health insurance \neach day, and millions more carry partial to inadequate health \ncoverage, I have worked with my colleagues both in committee and on the \nfloor to deliver quality care that truly benefits patients. I am \nconvinced that such health care coverage must include liability when \nneeded care is denied, resulting in injury or death. Quality care must \nalso include patients' access to medical specialists, and an appeals \nand review process when such access is denied. The McCain-Edwards-\nKennedy bill includes these stipulations and goes one step further. It \nensures that, for the first time, all Americans enrolled in health \nplans will be given access to the care they need.\n  With this in mind, I would like to enthusiastically endorse the \nMcCain-Edwards-Kennedy Patients' Bill of Rights. A bipartisan effort in \nall regards, the legislation before us will ensure access to the \nquality of care that all Americans need--access which they deserve. \nFirst and foremost, it grants every individual with health coverage the \nsame quality care. Under this McCain-Edwards-Kennedy legislation, for \nexample, women, children, and the critically ill--often, the groups \nthat are denied the care they need--will be given access to doctors who \nwill determine their best medical interests.\n  If denied such care, patients will also be given the opportunity to \nimmediately appeal decisions. By employing independent review boards, \nvictims will be able to seek second opinions prior to the denial of \ncare. The McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill ensures access to medical \ntreatments, before it is too late. To date, thousands of patients have \ndied as a result of decisions made by non-medical HMO personnel who \nmerely sought to reduce cost and increase profits. With this \nlegislation, that need not happen ever again.\n  We have now come to agreements so that the pending legislation will \nallow employees to seek punitive damages only if their employers \nwillfully and negligently deny medical care that results in injury or \ndeath. Though some might argue that this will increase the cost of \nhealth care and, by extension, increase the number of uninsured in \nAmerica, studies in states that have implemented similar protections \nhave shown that this just is not the case. This right serves as a check \nagainst irresponsible decision-making and is critical to the \nlegislation before us.\n  Finally, the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy Patients' Bill of Rights provides \nhope for those suffering from chronic illness by encouraging the use of \nclinical trials if no other treatment exists. Alzheimer's, AIDS, and \ncancer patients, for example, have real hope that alternative therapies \nmay improve their suffering and offer a long-term cure. This element of \nthe legislation is long overdue. I fought along with other members of \nthis body for this right as part of the Medicare program--yet the same \nopportunity does not exist for those with private coverage. It is a \nright--and it is time to help the seriously ill so that they can fight \ntheir illness, not their insurance company.\n  We have been debating this issue for five years, in spite of the fact \nthat we all agree patients deserve quality health care. Here on the \nfloor, we concur on many of the issues that held this legislation up in \nconference last year. I was a member of that conference committee, and \ncan safely say the negotiating we have done here has greatly improved \nthe bipartisan support for the Patients' Bill of Rights, previously \nlacked in conference. We have negotiated and agree upon scope between \nstate and federal law, and on the definition of ``medical necessity,'' \nas well as employer liability. We all agree that women should have \naccess to OBGYN care, children should have access to pediatric care, \nand all patients should have access to emergency room care. I ask, \nthen, what is holding us back? Indisputably, Americans have suffered \ntoo long and have endured too much. They deserve quality care--they \ndeserve the Patients' Bill of Rights, and we must give it to them. I \nurge my colleagues to vote for the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy Patients' \nBill of Rights.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1052, the \nBipartisan Patients Protection Act. After nearly 5 years of debate and \npartisan fighting, I am pleased that the Senate has finally passed a \nreal, meaningful bipartisan Patients Bill of Rights. It is a step that \nis long overdue.\n  For many years, the growth of managed care arrangements helped to \nrein in the rapidly growing costs of health care. That benefits all \npatients across the Nation and helps to keep health care costs in check \nfor everyone.\n  However, there is a real difference between making quality health \ncare affordable and cutting corners on patient care. In Wisconsin, we \nare lucky that most health plans do a good job in keeping costs low and \nproviding quality care. But too often across this nation, HMOs put too \nmany obstacles between doctors and patients. In the name of saving a \nfew bucks, too many patients must hurdle bureaucratic obstacles to get \nbasic care. Even worse, too many patients are being denied essential \ntreatment based on the bottom line rather than on what is best for \nthem.\n  The Patients Bill of Rights will ensure that patients come first--not \nHMO profits or health plan bureaucrats. It makes sure that doctors, in \nconsultation with patients, can decide what treatments are medically \nnecessary. It gives patients access to information about all available \ntreatments and not just the cheapest. Whether it's emergency care, \npursuing treatment by an appropriate specialist, providing women with \ndirect access to an OB-GYN, or giving a patient a chance to try an \ninnovative new treatment that could save their life--these are rights \nthat all Americans in health plans should have. And questions \nconcerning these rights should be answered by caring physicians and \nconcerned families--not by a calculator. This bill puts these decisions \nback in human hands where they belong.\n  This legislation will also make sure these rights are enforceable by \nallowing patients to hold health plans accountable for the decisions \nthey make. First, all health plans must have an external appeals \nprocess in place, so that patients who challenge HMO decisions may take \ntheir case to an independent panel of medical experts. The External \nReviewer must be independent from the plan, and they must be able to \ntake valid medical evidence into account when deciding whether a \ntreatment was inappropriately denied. The vast\n\n[[Page S7176]]\n\nmajority of disputes can and will be resolved using this external \nreview process.\n  I was pleased that during the course of this debate, the Senate \nadopted an amendment that further clarified the rules of the external \nreview process. I shared the concerns of Wisconsin employers and \ninsurers that the original version could have potentially allowed an \nexternal reviewer to order coverage of a medical service that the \nhealth plan specifically disallowed in its plan. I strongly support the \ncreation of a strong, independent external review process to address \ndisputes between a patient and their insurer over whether a service is \nmedically necessary. At the same time, I believe employers who offer \ntheir employees health care coverage and enter into a contract with a \nhealth plan should have a level of certainty as to the specific \nservices that are not covered under the plan.\n  That is why I voted for the McCain-Bayh-Carper amendment, which \npreserves the sanctity of the contract and makes it crystal clear that \na reviewer may not order coverage of any treatment that is specifically \nexcluded or limited under the plan. At the same time, it still allows \nreviewers to order coverage of medically necessary services that are in \ndispute. In addition, if a health plan felt that a reviewer had a \npattern of ordering care of questionable medical benefit, the plan \ncould appeal to the secretary to have that reviewer decertified.\n  I recognize that some preferred the approach offered by Senators \nNelson and Kyl in addressing this issue. However, I opposed the Nelson-\nKyl amendment because it went a step too far. By attempting to have the \nFederal Government create a national definition of ``medical \nnecessity,'' it would create a regulatory nightmare for patients and \nproviders, and could potentially result in a definition that nobody \nsupports and is too rigid to move with the advances in medical \ntechnology and treatment. The compromise amendment offered by Senator \nMcCain struck a more appropriate balance by protecting the sanctity of \nhealth plan contracts while allowing patients real recourse through an \nexternal appeal for medical necessity disputes.\n  Beyond the external review process, if a health plan's decision to \ndeny or delay care results in death or injury to the patient, this bill \nensures that the health plan can be held accountable for its actions. \nAnd this bill, as amended, includes clear protections for employers. I \nwas pleased to support the amendment offered by Senators Snowe and \nNelson which further clarified the difficult issue of employer \nliability.\n  Let me make it clear that our main objective is to make sure that \npatients have access to the treatments they need and deserve, and that \nif a health plan wrongly delays or denies treatment that causes injury \nor death, that patients can hold their health plans accountable--just \nlike they would hold their doctor accountable if their doctor's action \ncaused injury or death. In other words, the patient should be able to \nhold accountable that entity who directly made the decision to \ndeny care, and I think it's critical that we shield from liability all \nemployers who had no hand in making that decision.\n\n  That is why I supported the amendment by Senators Snowe and Nelson, \nwhich provides strong protections for employers from being sued by \nallowing them to choose a ``designated decisionmaker'' to be in charge \nof making medical decisions and to take on all liability risk. In the \ncase of an employer who offers a fully insured health plan, the health \ninsurance company which the employer contracts with is deemed to be \nthat designated decisionmaker, and the employer is therefore protected \nfrom lawsuits. In the case of an employer that offers a self-insured \nhealth plan, that employer may contract with a third-party \nadministrator to administer the benefits of the plan. That third party \nadministrator would agree to be the designated decisionmaker and the \nemployer is shielded from lawsuits. Only those employers that act as \ninsurers and directly make medical decisions for their employees can be \nheld accountable. This group accounts for only approximately 5 percent \nof all employers in the country.\n  This bill now makes it clear that employers--who voluntarily provide \nhealth coverage to their employees and the vast majority of which do \nnot act as insurers by making medical decisions--are shielded from \nlawsuits. This is in total agreement with President Bush's stated \nprinciples of a Patients Bill of Rights he could sign, where he said, \nand I quote: ``Only employers who retain responsibility for and make \nfinal medical decisions should be subject to suit.'' That is exactly \nwhat this bill does. It is one of the main keys to making the rights in \nthis bill enforceable, and I strongly urge that this right be retained \nin any bill that is sent to the President.\n  Most importantly, this bill gives all of these protections to ALL \nAmericans in managed health care plans, not just a few. All 170 million \nAmericans in managed health plans deserve the same protections--no \nmatter what State they live in.\n  As someone who comes from a business background, I understand the \nconcerns of employers. Some of my colleagues on the other side have \nclaimed that our bill will increase health care costs so much that it \nwill make it impossible for employers and families to afford coverage. \nBut the Congressional Budget Office reported that the patient \nprotections in our bill will only increase premiums by 4.2 percent over \n5 years. This translates into only $1.19 per month for the average \nemployee. CBO also found that the provision to hold health plans \naccountable--the provision the other side opposes the most and claim \nwould cause health care costs to skyrocket--would only account for 40 \ncents of that amount. An independent study by Coopers and Lybrand \nindicates that the cost of the liability provisions is potentially less \nthan that, estimating that premiums would increase between three and 13 \ncents a month per enrollee, or 0.03 percent. This is a small price to \npay to make sure that health plans cover the health care services we \nall deserve.\n  I believe this bill meets the President's principles for a real \nPatients Bill of Rights, and I hope that when the House passes its \nbill, we can come together and send a bill to the President he will \nsign. The time has come to end this debate and finally act to protect \npatients. There is no reason whatsoever to continue to allow health \nplans to skimp on quality in the name of saving profits. Patients have \nbeen in the waiting room long enough. It is time for the Senate to act \nand make sure they receive the health care they need, deserve, and pay \nfor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the lobbying on this bill has been \nintensive. There's been a great deal of coverage in recent weeks about \nthe wealthy interests that have collided over whether the nation should \nhave a Patients' Bill of Rights, and what that bill should look like.\n  I think even the media has had a tough time figuring out which side \nof this debate has the power of the ``special interests'' on their \nside. Some have said the money is on the side of the McCain-Kennedy-\nEdwards bill, since interests supporting the bill include the American \nAssociation of Trial Lawyers, the American Medical Association, and \nlabor unions like AFSCME.\n  Others say that the special interests are weighing in against the \nPatients Bill of Rights, because of the powerful business and insurance \ncoalitions fighting to defeat this legislation.\n  So who is right. Where is the money in this debate? The answer is \nsimple, there are donors on both sides. Wealthy interests aren't \naligned exclusively on one side or the other. So for the information of \nmy colleagues and the public, I thought I would take a moment to call \nthe bankroll by examining the donations the interests on both sides \nhave given in the last election cycle.\n  I will start with massive effort to defeat this legislation, brought \nto us by a coalition of insurance and business interests that represent \nsome of the most powerful donors in the campaign finance system today.\n  Opposition to McCain-Edwards-Kennedy is being spearheaded by the \nHealth Benefits Coalition. An analysis by the Center for Responsive \nPolitics puts the cumulative donations of the members of the Health \nBenefits Coalition at $12.9 million in the last election cycle. That \nfigure includes soft money, PAC money and individual contributions made \nby the members of the Coalition.\n  The Coalition includes corporate members such as Blue Cross/Blue\n\n[[Page S7177]]\n\nShield, Aetna Inc., and Humana Inc. But perhaps more importantly, the \nCoalition also includes major business and insurance associations. \nThese organizations include the Chamber of Commerce, the Business \nRoundtable, the American Association of Health Plans, the Health \nInsurance Association of America, the National Retail Federation, the \nNational Restaurant Association, and the Food Marketing Institute, to \nname just a few. And of course whenever organizations like these join \ntogether in a legislative fight, they carry with them the collective \nclout of all the major political donors they represent.\n  The Health Insurance Association of America is an enormous coalition \nof the insurance industry. The insurance industry itself gave nearly \n$40.7 million in PAC, soft, and individual donations in the 2000 \nelection cycle.\n  The American Association of Health Plans, the trade association for \nHMOs and PPOs, spent a total of nearly $2.5 million on lobbying in 1999 \nalone. According to a recent New York Times article, AAHP has budgeted \n$3 to $5 million to make their case against the Patients' Bill of \nRights, and they are willing to spend, quote, ``whatever it takes,'' \nunquote, to get the job done.\n  The Business Roundtable also has spent money on an ad campaign \nagainst the bill, and so has the Health Benefits Coalition itself.\n  The cumulative clout of these expenditures, lobbying expenditures, \nsoft money, PAC money and ad campaigns, from some of the biggest and \nmost powerful organizations in Washington, hasn't gone unnoticed. This \nis an all-out blitz.\n  And this bankroll wouldn't be complete without a description of some \nof the interests giving their support to provisions in this bill: The \nAmerican Medical Association, the Association of Trial Lawyers of \nAmerica, and labor unions, including the American Federation of State, \nCounty and Municipal Employees.\n  According to the Center for Responsive Politics, AFSCME gave more \nthan $8.5 million in soft, PAC and individual contributions in the last \nelection cycle. The Association of Trial Lawyers of America gave more \nthan $3.6 million in PAC, soft and individual contributions during that \nsame period, and the AMA gave more than $2 million.\n  We don't know yet whether the will of the people will be heard above \nthe din of lobbying calls, TV ad blitzes and the cutting of soft money \nchecks to the political parties. I hope we pass a strong Patients' Bill \nof Rights. But whatever the outcome of this bill, we have to ask \nourselves if this is the way we want to legislate, and the way we want \nour democracy to function. I think when the public hears that this \ndebate pits wealthy interests against each other--in some kind of \nshowdown at Gucci Gulch--they tune us out, because suddenly it's no \nlonger about them, it's just another story about how big money rules \nAmerican politics. And when that's the case, all of us lose, no matter \nwhich side of this debate we're on, because our legislative process is \ndiminished, and the American people's faith in us is diminished along \nwith it. I thank the chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today's passage of the Bipartisan Patient \nProtection Act marks a major step forward in the struggle for a \nmeaningful Patients' Bill of Rights. I am hopeful that with the \nadoption of this landmark legislation, patients throughout the country \ncan feel a sense of relief knowing their rights will now be protected.\n  Over the past two decades, our Nation's healthcare delivery system \nhas seen a seismic transformation. Rapidly rising healthcare costs have \nencouraged the development and expansion of managed care organizations, \nspecifically health maintenance organizations. Unfortunately, the \nzealous efforts of HMOs to contain these costs have ended up \ncompromising patient care and stripping away much of the authority of \ndoctors to make decisions about the best care for their patients.\n  During the past several years, many Vermonters have let me know about \nthe problems they face when seeking health care for themselves and \ntheir families. Like most Americans, they want: greater access to \nspecialists; the freedom to continue to be treated by their own \ndoctors, even if they switch health plans; health care providers, not \naccounting clerks at HMOs, to make decisions about their care and \ntreatment; HMOs to be held accountable for their negligence.\n  The Bipartisan Patient Protection Act is the solution that Americans \nhave called for--patient protections that cover all Americans in all \nhealth plans by ensuring the medical needs of patients are not \nsecondary to the bottom line of their HMO.\n  Too many times, I have heard from Vermonters who have faced \ndifficulty in accessing the most appropriate healthcare professional to \nmeet their needs. This legislation will solve that problem by giving \nVermonters--and all Americans who suffer from life-threatening, \ndegenerative and disabling conditions--the right to access standing \nreferrals to specialists, so they do not have to make unnecessary \nvisits to their primary care physician for repeated referrals. These \npatients will also be able to designate a specialist as their primary \ncare physician, if that person is best able to coordinate their care.\n  This legislation makes important strides in allowing patients access \nto a health care provider outside of their plan when their own plan's \nnetwork of physicians does not include a specialist that can provide \nthem the care they need. This provision is especially important for \nrural areas, like many parts of Vermont, which tend to not have an \nexcess of health care providers. Women will now be able to have direct \naccess to their OB/GYN and pediatricians can be designated as primary \ncare providers for children.\n  If an individual gets hurt and needs unexpected emergency medical \ncare, the Bipartisan Patient Protection Act takes important steps to \nensure access to emergency room care without a referral. If a woman is \nsuffering from breast cancer, this bill will protect her right to have \nthe routine costs of participation in a potentially life-saving \nclinical trial covered by her plan. This bill puts into place a wide \nrange of additional protections that are essential to allowing doctors \nto provide the best care they can and to allow patients to receive the \nservices they deserve.\n  Many of our States have already adopted patient protection laws. My \nhome State of Vermont is one state that currently has a comprehensive \nframework of protections in place. This Federal legislation will not \nprohibit Vermont or any other state from maintaining or further \ndeveloping their own patient protections so long as the laws are \ncomparable to the Federal standard. I am pleased that this bill will \nallow states like Vermont to maintain many of their innovative efforts, \nwhile also ensuring that patients in states that currently have no laws \nin place will receive the basic protections they deserve.\n  Each of the important protections I have highlighted will only be \nmeaningful if HMOs are held accountable for their decisions. The key to \nenforcing these patient protections rests in strong liability \nprovisions that complement an effective and responsive appeals process. \nThe Bipartisan Patient Protection Act provides patients with the right \nto hold their HMO liable for decisions that result in irreparable harm \nor death. Managed care organizations are one of the very few parties in \nthis country that are shielded from being held accountable for their \nbad decisions. The time has come for that to change. Opponents of \npatients' rights legislation have been vocal in suggesting that by \nallowing patients to hold HMOs liable in court, there will be an \nexplosion of lawsuits, causing the costs of healthcare insurance to \nskyrocket. This has not been the case in states like Texas, that have \nalready enacted strong patient protections. Rather, it has been shown \nthat most cases are resolved through the external appeals process and \nthat only a very small fraction of cases ever reach the court room. \nUnder this legislation, a patient must exhaust all internal and \nexternal appeals before going to court.\n  I have heard from many Vermonters concerned about the potential \nimpact of new HMO liability provisions on employers. I am disappointed \nthat the opponents of this legislation have exploited and \nmisrepresented this part of the bill. Rather than attempting to \nalleviate concerns by explaining the liability provisions, they have \ninstead resorted to a scare tactic strategy. If you listen to some \nopponents of this\n\n[[Page S7178]]\n\nbill, you would think that any employer who offers health coverage will \nbe sued. I would like to take this opportunity to clarify some of the \nfacts.\n  The Bipartisan Patient Protection Act protects employers with a \nstrong shield that only makes the employer accountable when he or she \ndirectly participates in health treatment decisions. The bill also \nclearly states that employers cannot be held responsible for the \nactions of managed care companies unless they actively make the \ndecision to deny a health care service to a patient. This only occurs \nin about five percent of businesses --generally those employers large \nenough to run their own health plan. Those few companies that directly \nparticipate in the decision to deny a health care benefit to a patient, \nshould accept legal responsibility for those decisions.\n  After nearly 5 years of debate in Congress, the American people are \nfinally closing in on the patients' rights and protections they \ndeserve. But there is still more work to be done. The House of \nRepresentatives must consider this important issue in a timely manner \nand I am hopeful their bill will include provisions similar to the \nbipartisan patient protection legislation passed in the Senate. Most \nimportantly, I am hopeful that President Bush will hear the voices of \nAmericans and not those of the special interests and their well-\nfinanced lobbyists, and sign this important legislation into law. The \nAmerican people have spoken; the time for enacting strong patient \nprotections is long overdue.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am proud to support the bipartisan \nMcCain-Kennedy Patients Bill of Rights. It is legislation that is long \noverdue. Time and again, we have heard the 180 million Americans \nenrolled in managed care demand patient rights. Time and again, Members \nof this Senate have promised to provide them those rights. Finally, \nwith the Patients Bill of Rights legislation before us, we stand ready \nto deliver.\n  The McCain-Kennedy Patients Bill of Rights ensures Americans that \nthey can receive the very health care they pay for. In exchange for \ntheir monthly premiums, patients deserve a guarantee that they can see \ntheir own doctor, visit a specialist, and go to the closest emergency \nroom; a guarantee that their doctor can discuss the best options for \ntreatment, not just the cheapest; and a guarantee that their doctor's \norders will be followed by their HMO. The McCain-Kennedy bill \nguarantees all of those rights.\n  When those rights are violated, and harm results from the delayed \napplication or outright denial of treatment, the McCain-Kennedy bill \nguarantees patients that they can hold their health plan accountable. \nAnd, that is what all of the rights to access care hinge upon--the \nability to hold a health plan liable if access to care is denied.\n  We have spent days on the floor of the Senate debating the issue of \nliability. But, the argument here is simple. In this country, if the \ndecision of an individual or corporation results in harm or death to a \nconsumer, the decisionmaker is held accountable. That holds true for \nevery individual, and for every company except an HMO. HMOs, businesses \nwho make countless decisions daily that affect the health of millions \nof Americans, do not face this same accountability. The number of \npatients who are suffering as a result is staggering.\n  Every day, 35,000 patients in managed care plans have necessary care \ndelayed. Too many of these patients pay the ultimate price for the \ncallousness displayed by these managed care plans. I would like to \nshare the story of one woman from my state of Massachusetts who lost \nher life after being denied care by her HMO.\n  Mrs. White was diagnosed with leukemia in October 1997, and was \nunable to find a bone marrow match for transplant. After 2 years of \nbattling the disease she went into remission. She then learned that \nMassachusetts General Hospital was working with a newly-developed anti-\nrejection drug which would allow patients like herself, with less than \nperfectly-matched donors, to have bone marrow transplants. But, her HMO \ndenied her care the day before she was due to be admitted to the \nhospital.\n\n  Six months later, Mrs. White enrolled in a new health plan which \ncovered the costs of the transplant. However, during the 6-month \nimpasse, Mrs. White fell out of remission, and her body was less able \nto sustain the new bone marrow. She died 3 months after the procedure \nwas performed.\n  Real stories like these demonstrate why HMOs must be held accountable \nfor their decisions. Real people like Mrs. White are the reasons why \nthere are liability provisions in the McCain-Kennedy Patients Bill of \nRights--liability protections that allow patients to sue their health \nplans in state court when an HMO's decision to withhold or limit care \nresults in injury or death. My colleagues on the other side of the \naisle seek to misconstrue that point. But, let's be clear: this bill \nestablishes the right to sue an HMO as a protection for America's \npatients, not as a reward to America's trial lawyers.\n  Opponents of the Kennedy-McCain Patients Bill of Rights have \npredicted that the liability language in the bill will cause a future \nflood of frivolous lawsuits against managed care companies. But recent \nhistory paints a very different picture.\n  The President's home State of Texas enacted a patients bill of \nrights--which includes a provision to hold HMOs accountable--in 1997, \nalbeit without the support of then-Governor Bush. Since that time, 17 \nlawsuits have been brought against managed care insurers in Texas. Let \nme repeat that--17 lawsuits in 4 years. That is a trickle, not a flood, \nof litigation.\n  Mr. President, no one wants to encourage unnecessary lawsuits that \nincrease the cost of providing health care. That is why the McCain-\nKennedy bill sets out a comprehensive internal and external review \nprocess that seeks to remedy complaints before they reach a courtroom. \nExcept in cases of irreparable harm or death, patients must exhaust \nthis review process before pursuing a legal remedy.\n\n  But we must establish a legal remedy. A right without legal recourse \nfails to exist. The liability provision in this legislation simply \nestablishes a mechanism by which to enforce the very patient \nprotections it provides. Managed care insurers can easily avoid any \nliability, as long as they act responsibly and ensure that their \npatients receive the quality medical care prescribed for them by their \nphysicians.\n  Let's be clear about another issue.\n  As chairman of the Small Business Committee, I am well aware of the \nsubstantial challenges small businesses face in providing employee \nbenefits while holding down costs. I understand the concerns small \nbusiness owners have over the Kennedy-McCain bill's potential to expose \nthem to liability for the sole, laudable initiative of offering health \ninsurance coverage to their employees. But that is not the intent of \nthis legislation.\n  The McCain-Kennedy bill only holds accountable those employers who \ndirectly participate in the medical decisions governing an employee's \ncare if harm or injury occurs. The logic here is simple. If employers \nact like HMOs, it is only fair that they be held to the same \naccountability standards. For employers who do not directly participate \nin these medical decision there should be no liability.\n  I understand that many businesses remain weary of the safeguards \nagainst employer liability that are included in the Kennedy-McCain \nlegislation. Negotiations are underway to strike a compromise and \nstrengthen these safeguards so that we may arrive at a Patients Bill of \nRights that we all can support. I join all of my colleagues in hoping \nthat those negotiations bear fruit.\n  Another attack on this Patients Bill of Rights legislation that we \nhave heard--not just in this chamber but across the television \nairwaves--is that this bill will cause insurance premiums to increase \ndramatically. Nothing could be further from the truth. According to the \nmost recent estimate from the Congressional Budget Office, this \nlegislation will cause premiums to increase an average of 4.2 percent a \nyear. For the average employee, that equates to $1.19 per month in \nadditional premiums, a small price to pay for meaningful patients \nrights extended in this bill.\n\n  Many of my colleagues across the aisle argue that this minor increase \nwill cause large numbers of Americans to become uninsured when, in \nfact, no evidence exists to support this. Nevertheless, I am encouraged \nby their concern for the uninsured in our country,\n\n[[Page S7179]]\n\nthe 43 million Americans--the 15 percent of our population--who have no \nhealth care coverage at all. I challenge my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to continue the discourse on this critical issue and look \nforward to working towards extending health coverage to every American \nonce we have passed this bipartisan Patients Bill of Rights.\n  The McCain-Kennedy Patients' Bill of Rights legislation has \nwidespread support from patients groups and health care providers--the \ntwo parties that we should really be focused on in this debate. To \ndate, over 500 health care provider and patients' rights groups have \nendorsed our bill.\n  An April 2001 Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that 85 percent of \nAmericans supported a comprehensive Patients' Bill of Rights that \nincludes provisions to hold HMOs accountable. Mr. President, patients \nand health care providers have spoken loud and clear. They want \nexpanded rights for patients now, rights that our legislation will \nprovide. I urge all of my colleagues to pass the McCain-Kennedy \nPatients Bill of Rights.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise to talk specifically about how \nimportant the Patients' Bill of Rights is to improving the mental \nhealth care Americans receive.\n  For far too long, mental health consumers have been discriminated \nagainst in the health care system--subjected to discriminatory cost-\nsharing, limited access to specialists, and other barriers to needed \nservices.\n  This is particularly true of the mental health care that children \nreceive. More children suffer from psychiatric illness than from \nLeukemia, AIDS and diabetes combined. Yet, while we recognize the human \ncosts of these physical illnesses, we often forget the cost of \nuntreated psychiatric illness. For young people, these costs include \nlost occupational opportunities because of academic failure, increased \nsubstance abuse, more physical illness, and, unfortunately, increased \nlikelihood of physical aggression to themselves or others.\n  That is why I am so pleased that McCain-Edwards-Kennedy goes a long \nway towards addressing the inequities in mental health care and \nensuring access to needed mental health care services.\n  For example, the proposal ensures access to critical prescription \ndrugs.\n  We have made tremendous progress in developing medication to treat \nmental illnesses. Although medication is often only one component of \neffective treatment for mental illnesses, access to the newest and most \neffective of these medications is crucial to successful treatment and \nrecovery.\n  These new medications are more effective, have fewer side effects, \nand save money in the long run. Yet unfortunately, all too often \nmanaged care organizations prevent patients from accessing these life-\nsaving drugs.\n  How? They use restrictive formularies that restrict access to \npreferred drugs--often the newer and more effective ones. The HMO's \nare, in effect, undermining our own drug regulations and approval \nprocesses.\n  Fortunately, the bipartisan McCain-Edwards-Kennedy Patients' Bill of \nRights protects patients by providing exceptions from the formulary \nwhen medically indicated. So, when a doctor thinks a certain medication \nis the best treatment for a patient, that patient will get that \nmedication.\n  Also--and this is a critical difference with the Breaux-Frist \nalternative--our bill requires that non-formulatory medication be \nsubject to same cost-sharing requirements. Breaux-Frist does not--\ncontinuing the discriminatory treatment of mental health treatments.\n\n  The McCain-Edwards-Kennedy proposal is also superior for mental \nhealth care because it ensures access to specialists. The bill allows \nstanding referrals--so that primary care providers do not have to \ncontinue authorizing visits. It also requires plans to allow patient \naccess to non-participating providers if the plan's network is \ninsufficient. So that patients can see the provider who can best meet \ntheir needs. The Breaux-Frist plan--in another contrast--does not allow \naccess to out-of-network specialists.\n  In the end, this can result in more costly treatment. And for some \nillnesses, the longer the duration or the greater the number of \nsignificant episodes, the harder to treat and more intractable the \ndisease becomes.\n  Finally, the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy proposal, unlike Breaux-Frist, \nprovides the right to a speedy and genuinely independent external \nreview process when care is denied.\n  Let me just tell the personal story of a constituent of mine to \nillustrate the importance of these protections. Earlier this year, a \nmother in Gloucester County, NJ wrote to me about problems she had \nencountered getting treatment for her daughter. Her teenage daughter \nhad attempted suicide, and been hospitalized for 8 days. She was \ndiagnosed with depression and borderline personality disorder, and both \nher physician and therapist recommended intensive outpatient therapy, \ncalled ``partial care'' therapy. But the managed behavioral care \norganization determined that this treatment was not ``medically \nnecessary.'' Instead of the intensive five and a half hour, twice a \nweek therapy program, the insurer wanted to send her for one hour a \nweek of therapy. This, despite the recommendation of her physician and \ntherapist.\n  Like any loving parent would, the mother fought back, calling the \ncompany many times. She was told to wait--even though, to quote her \nletter, her daughter ``was self-mutilating and her behavior was \nbecoming dangerous to herself and possibly others.'' The mother finally \nenlisted the help of several people at the treatment program, who also \nwrangled with the company, and she even wrote to my office, and I wrote \nto the company on their behalf. Eventually, the company relented, and \nher daughter is now doing well in that intensive eleven hour a week \nprogram.\n  But it shouldn't have to be like that for families. Doctors, not \ninsurers, should decide what treatment a patient receives. When a \nphysician says that a certain therapy is necessary to help a suicidal \nteenager, an insurance company should cover it. As my constituent so \npoignantly wrote to me about her daughter, and I quote: ``This \ntreatment is important and necessary [because] by learning the skills \nshe needs to cope with her illness she can have a safe, normal, \nadolescence and adult life. If we address this illness now instead of \nwaiting until the next time she hurts herself we have a better chance \nof her leading a happy and normal life.''\n  Unfortunately, a study by the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill \nfound that less than half of surveyed managed behavioral health care \ncompanies define suicide attempt as a medical emergency.\n  This year, 2,500 teenagers will commit suicide in the United States. \nOver 10 million children and adolescents have a diagnosable psychiatric \nillness that results in a academic failure, social isolation and \nincreased difficulty functioning in adulthood. Only one out of five \nwill get any care and even less will get the appropriate level of care \nthey need and deserve.\n  So unless we provide critical patient protections, including the \nright to a fair and independent appeals process for review of medical \nnecessity decisions, more families like my constituent will have to \nwonder if an insurance company will cover critical care that a doctor \nhas prescribed for a loved one.\n  In sum, the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill will provide people access to \nthe mental health care they need to lead healthy, productive lives. I \nam pleased to support it.\n\n\n                      harkin peer-review amendment\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, for too long, American families have been \nleft in the waiting room while HMOs refuse to provide the health care \nservices that families need and deserve. The results have often been \ntragic.\n  Now we are on the verge of a big victory for the American people--\npassing a meaningful Patient's Bill of Rights. S. 1052 represents the \nculmination of five long years of bi-partisan work to ensure that \npatients in managed care get the medical services they need, deserve, \nand have paid for. We have debated this issue for years, negotiated \ndifferences of opinion to find common ground, and worked across party \nlines to develop the best bill possible.\n  S. 1052 truly represents the best of all our collective ideas and \nmost importantly, meets the needs of the American people.\n  Let me say that again. This bill--the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill--\nmeets\n\n[[Page S7180]]\n\nthe needs of the American people. And when you cut through the rhetoric \nand political posturing, that is what this debate is all about--\nguaranteeing the American people basic and fundamental health care \nrights.\n  One of the cornerstones of a meaningful Patients' Bill of Rights is \naccess to a swift internal review and a fair and independent external \nappeals process. Without a strong review system in place--where real \nmedical experts make the decisions and not the HMO accountants--all the \nother protections would be compromised.\n  Our amendment would strengthen the review system to ensure the \nintegrity of the appeals process and protect patients by requiring that \nthe appropriate health care professional makes the medical decision. It \nensures that health care professionals who can best assess the medical \nnecessity, appropriateness, and standard of care, make determinations \nregarding coverage of a denied service.\n\n  As currently drafted, S. 1052 only requires that physicians \nparticipate in the review process. While the bill does not prohibit \nnon-physician providers from participating in a review at a physicians \ndiscretion, it does not guarantee their involvement in relevant medical \nreviews.\n  I think we all agree that the intent of the appeals process is to put \nmedical decisions in the hands of the best and most appropriate health \ncare providers. In many cases, this will undoubtably be a physician. \nHowever, when the treatment denied is prescribed by a non-physician \nprovider, it is critical that the case be reviewed by a provider with \nsimilar training and expertise.\n  For example, when a 59-year-old man fell in his home, he experienced \nincreased swelling, decreased balance, decreased range of motion. \ndecreased strength and increased pain in his right ankle and knee. A \nphysical therapy treatment plan would have included specific exercises \nto increase strength, range of motion, and balance--enabling the \npatient to better perform activities of daily living and to prevent \nfurther deterioration of his health.\n  A reviewer who was not a licensed physical therapist, and did not \nhave the expertise, background, or experience as a physical therapist, \ndenied physical therapy coverage.\n  Without physical therapy intervention, the patient was severely \nlimited in activity and spent significant time in bed. The time in bed \nresulted in further deterioration of the original problems and the \ndevelopment of wounds from the prolonged static position in bed.\n  A physical therapist reviewer would have recognized the importance of \npatient mobility while in bed to prevent bedsores and interventions to \nimprove the patient's function with his right ankle and knee to enable \nhim to independently walk.\n\n  Utilizing health care professionals with appropriate expertise and \nexperience in the delivery of a service that has been denied by a \nhealth plan guarantees beneficiaries the best possible review of their \nappeal.\n  My amendment is supported by a wide range of health care \nprofessionals, including:\n  The American Association of Nurse Anesthetists, The American \nChiropractic Association, The American College of Nurse Midwives, The \nAmerican College of Nurse Practitioners, The American Occupational \nTherapy Association, The American Optometric Association, The American \nPharmaceutical Association, The American Physical Therapy Association, \nThe American Podiatric Medical Association, The American Society for \nClinical Laboratory Science, The American Speech-Language-Hearing \nAssociation, The National Association of Orthopaedic Nurses, The \nNational Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners, The National \nAssociation of Social Workers, and The Center for Patient Advocacy.\n  I do not believe that non-physician providers were deliberately \nexcluded from the review process. In fact, just the opposite is true--I \nbelieve it was the intent of the bill's authors to develop the best \npossible review process. However, unless my amendment is adopted, I \nworry that we will fall short of our shared goal of giving patient's \naccess to the best and most appropriate health care services in every \ninstance.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the patient \nprotection legislation currently before the Senate. Over the past \ndecade, as private health coverage has shifted from traditional \ninsurance towards managed care, many consumers have expressed the fear \nthey might be denied the health care they need by a health plan that \nfocuses more on cost than on quality.\n  In response to these concerns, the Senate has considered several \nbills to provide sensible patient protections to Americans in managed \ncare plans. During the last Congress, the Senate took at least 19 \nrollcall votes and passed two pieces of comprehensive patient \nprotection legislation. Like many of my colleagues, I found these \ndebates quite instructive, in that they called the Senate's attention \nto the numerous areas where there already exists a great deal of \nbipartisan agreement.\n  I believe that every American ought to have access to an emergency \nroom. No parent should ever be forced to consider bypassing the nearest \nhospital for a desperately ill child in favor of one that is in their \nhealth plan's provider network. If you have what any normal person \nwould consider an emergency, you should be able to go to the nearest \nhospital for treatment, period.\n  I believe that every American ought to be able to designate a \npediatrician as their child's primary care physician. This common-sense \nreform would allow parents to take their child to one of their plan's \npediatricians without having to get a referral from their family's \nprimary care physician.\n  I believe a doctor should be free to discuss treatment alternatives \nwith a patient and provide them with their best medical advice, \nregardless of whether or not those treatment options are covered by the \nhealth plan. Gag clauses are contractual agreements between a doctor \nand an HMO that restrict the doctor's ability to discuss freely with \nthe patient information about the patient's diagnosis, medical care, \nand treatment options. We all agree that this practice is wrong and \nhave voted repeatedly to prohibit it.\n  I believe that consumers have a right to know important information \nabout the products they are purchasing, and health insurance is no \ndifferent. Health plans ought to provide their enrollees with plainly \nwritten descriptions of the plan's benefits, cost sharing requirements, \nand definition of medical necessity. This will ensure that informed \nconsumers can make the health care choices that are in their best \ninterests and hopefully prevent disputes between patients and their \nplans.\n  In addition, the following examples highlight areas of bi-partisan \nagreement: Cancer Clinical Trials--Health plans ought to cover the \nroutine costs of participating in clinical trials for patients with \ncancer; Point of Service Options--Health plans for large employers \nought to offer a point of service option so that patient's can go to a \ndoctor outside their plan's network, even if it means paying a little \nmore; Continuity of Care--We ought to ensure that pregnant and \nterminally ill patients aren't forced to switch doctor's in the middle \nof their treatment; Formulary Reform--Health plans ought to include the \nparticipation of doctors and pharmacists when developing their \nprescription drug plans, commonly known as formularies; and Self-Pay \nfor Behavioral Health Services--Individuals who want to pay for mental \nhealth services out of their own pockets ought to be allowed to do so.\n  These are items for which there is broad support among Democrats, \nRepublicans, the White House, and most importantly, the American \npeople. While their may not be unanimous agreement on every detail, I \nbelieve these disagreements could be resolved in relatively short \norder.\n  This may lead one to ask one very important question , ``If these \nideas are so popular, why haven't they already been enacted?\"\n  The answer is very simple, lawsuits. The Kennedy-McCain bill insists \non vast new powers to sue. Leafing with abandon through the yellow \npages under the word ``attorney'' is not what most Americans would call \nhealth care reform.\n  Simply put, I believe that when you are sick, you need to go to a \ndoctor, not a lawyer. I am opposed to increasing litigation for the \nsimple reasons that it will drive up premiums, force\n\n[[Page S7181]]\n\n21,000 Kentuckians out of the health insurance market, prevent millions \nmore uninsured from being able to purchase insurance, and aggravate an \nalready seriously flawed medical malpractice system. I am opposed to \nexposing employers to onerous lawsuits, simply for doing what's right \nby their employees and providing them with health insurance. We ought \nto herald these employers, not sue them. While I am pleased the Senate \nadopted Ms. Snowe's additional employer protections, I am still \nconcerned that millions of Americans may lose access to the quality \nhealth care that their employers provide.\n  The proponents of these costly new liability provisions contend that \nyou can't hold plans accountable without expanding the right to sue \nemployers and insurers. I couldn't disagree more. The proper way to \nensure that plans are held accountable is to provide strong, \nindependent external appeals procedures to ensure that patients receive \nthe care they need. Far too many Americans are concerned that their \nhealth plan can deny them care. I believe that if a health plan denies \na treatment on the basis that it is experimental or not medically \nnecessary, a patient needs the ability to appeal that decision. The \nreviewer must be an independent, medical expert with expertise in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of the condition under review. In routine \nreviews, the independent reviewer must make a decision within 30 days, \nbut in urgent cases, they must do so in 72 hours. After all, when you \nare sick, don't you really need an appointment with your doctor, not \nyour lawyer.\n\n  As if driving 1.26 million Americans out of the health insurance \nmarket wasn't reason enough to oppose the Kennedy-McCain bill, I am \nalso strongly opposed to expanding liability because it exacerbates the \nproblems in our already flawed medical malpractice system. I might not \nbe so passionate in my opposition to new medical malpractice lawsuits, \nif lawsuits were an efficient mechanism for compensating patients who \nwere truly harmed by negligent actions. Unfortunately, the data shows \njust the opposite. In 1996, researchers at the Harvard School of Public \nHealth performed a study of 51 malpractice cases, which was published \nin the New England Journal of Medicine. In approximately half of those \ncases, the patient had not even been harmed, yet in many instances the \ndoctor settled the matter out of court, presumably just to rid \nthemselves of the nuisance and avoid lawyer's fees and litigation \ncosts. In the report's conclusion, the researchers found that ``there \nwas no association between the occurrence of an adverse event due to \nnegligence or an adverse event of any type and payment.'' In everyday \nterms, this means that the patient's injury had no relation to the \namount of payment recieved or even whether or not payment was awarded.\n  These lawsuits drag on for an average of 64 months--that is more than \n5 years. Even if at the end of this 64 months, only 43 cents of every \ndollar spent on medical liability actually reaches the victims of \nmalpractice, source: RAND Corporation, 1985. Most of the rest of the \njudgement goes to the lawyers. That is right, over half of the injured \nperson's damages are grabbed by the lawyers. Why would anyone want to \nexpand this flawed system, which is so heavily skewed in favor of the \npersonal injury lawyers?\n  Prior to the first extensive debate on this legislation in the Senate \nin 1999, The Washington Post said that ``the threat of litigation is \nthe wrong way to enforce the rational decision making that everyone \nclaims to have as a goal'', source: The Washington Post 3/16/99, and \nthat the Senate should enact an external appeals process ``before \nsubjecting an even greater share of medical practice to the vagaries of \nlitigation'', source: The Washington Post 7/13/99. More recently, the \nPost said that: ``Our instinct has been, and remains, that increasing \naccess to the courts should be a last resort that Congress should first \ntry in this bill to create a credible and mainly medical appellate \nsystem short of the courts for adjudicating the denial of care'', The \nWashington Post, 5/20/01. The Post is not alone in this view. My \nhometown paper, the Louisville Courier-Journal agreed when it stated \nthat ``there is good reason to be wary of giving patients a broad right \nto sue.''\n  Over the past two weeks, the Senate has had numerous opportunities to \nimprove this legislation. Unfortunately, the Senate missed far too many \nof them. In particular, we missed an opportunity to improve Kennedy-\nMcCain bill when the Senate rejected Mr. Frist's Amendment, which would \nhave established a more responsible mechanism for holding HMO's \naccountable in court and ensuring that patient's receive the care they \nneed.\n  As I noted earlier, I support a majority of the patient protections \nincluded in this bill. That is why I take no joy in voting against this \nlegislation. However, my concern for the 21,000 Kentuckians who will \nlose insurance because of the vast expansion of liability included in \nthis bill prevents me from being able to support it. My colleague from \nKentucky, Dr. Ernie Fletcher, has developed a compromise proposal in \nthe House of Representatives which represents an improvement over the \nbill the Senate just passed. Therefore, I am hopeful that the House of \nRepresentatives will improve this product and that the Conference \nCommittee will return to the Senate a bill that I can support, and that \nthe President can sign into law.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this is an important bill.\n  I want to see a Patients' Bill of Rights signed into law, but I am \nafraid some of my colleagues here, on the other side of the aisle, have \nrejected any efforts to move the reasonable Frist-Breaux-Jeffords \nbipartisan, or I should say tri-partisan bill. They have put lawyers \nand litigation ahead of patients and medical care.\n  I would like to say a few words on the liability provisions of this \nlegislation.\n  We all recognize that the liability provisions of this legislation \nare critical. These elements are key to providing patients with quality \nhealth care instead of extended court time.\n  When I refer to the liability provisions, of course I am talking \nabout a family of issues, including: exhaustion of appeals, employer \nliability, caps on damages, and class action lawsuits. Each of these is \nimportant, and indeed critical to patient care and health care \ndelivery, and needs to be addressed and corrected before the President \ncan sign a bill.\n  With regard to the provision on exhaustion of appeals, I believe the \nThompson amendment, which we just approved is certainly a big \nimprovement over the McCain-Kennedy language. The amendment will make \ncertain that no judicial proceedings commence prior to patients \nexhausting all of the internal and external review mechanisms. This is \npurely a common sense amendment, which properly maintains emphasis on \nspeedy resolution of patient problems without lengthy and costly court \nproceedings.\n  I want to emphasize that nothing in the amendment prohibits patients \nfrom having their day in court. Nor does this amendment prevent them \nfrom receiving immediate, needed care. It just requires them to go \nthrough the internal and external review process before going to court \nfor damages. The amendment still allows for those patients who really \nneed immediate care to get that care while they go through the \nadministrative appeal process.\n  It is important to underscore that no one will suffer irreparable \nharm under the amendment.\n  To reiterate, this amendment does not prohibit patients from going to \ncourt for care; it simply asks them to go through internal and external \nreview before going to court to seek liability and damages. What is \nwrong with that?\n  If we go down the route of the McCain-Kennedy bill, we are not \nhelping the patient get care. What we are doing is rendering both the \ninternal and new external appeal process pointless. Why are we \nbothering to establish stricter standards for internal reviews and set \nup an external appeal process if the work of the appeals panel doesn't \nmatter and can be bypassed through a judicial process? Unfortunately, \nthat is exactly what McCain-Kennedy does--allows patients to bypass the \nadministrative appeal process and go directly to court.\n  The main difference between the McCain-Kennedy bill and the Thompson \namendment is this--with Thompson, we emphasize care over court. The \nThompson amendment places the emphasis where it should be--on \nguaranteeing that people get the health care that they need, when they \nneed it.\n\n[[Page S7182]]\n\n  I believe the Thompson amendment is important in a number of ways. It \nwill help curb unnecessary lawsuits. It provides patients with a fair \nreview process. And most importantly, it codifies current law by \nallowing patients to file injunctive relief when they need immediate \ncare.\n  The Thompson amendment will not only protect the rights of patients \nbut will also improve the McCain-Kennedy legislation.\n  As far as employer liability is concerned, the language of the \nMcCain-Kennedy legislation was completely unacceptable. The bill \nclaimed to limit federal or state causes of action against a group \nhealth plan, employer, or plan sponsor, but it specifically authorizes \na cause of action against an employer if such person or \npersons directly participated in the consideration of a claim for \nbenefits and in doing so failed to exercise ordinary care. But, at the \nsame time, the McCain-Kennedy bill specifically excluded any cause of \naction against a doctor or hospital.\n\n  I think the Snowe-DeWine amendment adopted yesterday starts to \naddress these concerns. The Snowe-DeWine language includes protections \nfor employers who delegate plan decision making to a third party. It \nhelps strengthen the definition of the designated decision maker so \nthat some employers will not be unfairly exposed to liability. However, \nother employers would not be protected. I am serious when I say this \ncould result in employees losing health coverage. Employers will not \nwant to chose between offering health insurance to their employees and \nopening themselves up to liability and huge court costs.\n  I find it ironic that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, \nwho always claim they are trying to find ways to lower the uninsured \npopulation, are actually pressing for legislation that will \ndramatically increase the uninsured population.\n  And if you don't believe me, talk to any expert who is not a trial \nlawyer because the message is loud and clear that unless the bill is \nimproved, health coverage will be severely jeopardized, and employees \nwill lose their insurance. Is this the result that we want, especially \nin legislation that claims to be a Patients' Bill of Rights? I think \nnot.\n  As far as damage caps are concerned, the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords \nlegislation is a step in the right direction. The McCain-Kennedy \nlanguage is not.\n  The problem with the current McCain-Kennedy legislation is that it \nallows patients to go both to federal and state court to collect \ndamages. For federal causes of action, economic and non-economic \ndamages are unlimited. And even though the bill's proponents claim \nthere are no punitive damages provisions, as a former medical \nmalpractice attorney, I know punitive damages when I see them.\n  Supporters of the McCain-Kennedy approach claim their bill doesn't \nallow punitive damages in federal court. That is absolutely not true. \nUnder their bill, a defendant in federal court can be hit with up to $5 \nmillion in ``civil assessment'' damages. Let's call it like it is. The \npurpose of the civil assessment is to punish providers, plain and \nsimple. The bill includes no limits on state law damages. It is very \napparent to everyone in this chamber that the trial lawyers have been \nprincipally involved in drafting these liability provisions and they \nhave done so with their own interests in mind. This provision is simply \nnot in the best interest of the American people.\n  The McCain-Kennedy language allowing for unlimited damages is \nunworkable. Economic and non-economic damages are uncapped. In my \nopinion, non-economic damages should be capped.\n  Another issue that is extremely important is class action. The \nMcCain-Kennedy language had no restrictions on class actions on its \nnewly permitted state causes of action nor for its newly created \nfederal causes of action for damages. Fortunately, the DeWine language \nattempts to restrict the litigation nightmare that would have resulted \nfrom the McCain-Kennedy language.\n  Finding common ground on these issues--exhaustion of appeals, \nemployer liability, caps on damages and class action is crucial to the \nsuccess of the Patients' Bill of Rights legislation. It is incumbent \nupon us to do this right and to do what is in the best interest of \npatients, not trial attorneys. I am confident that if we are all \nwilling, we can make these provisions legally sound. We have spent far \ntoo many years on this issue not to do it right. We have a real \nopportunity to pass meaningful patients' rights legislation. Let's not \nsquander this opportunity by acting expeditiously.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise to speak about an issue that has \nbeen touched upon by many people during this debate on the Patients' \nBill of rights, the problem of the uninsured.\n  Let me first say that I am very pleased that today we are passing a \nstrong, enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  I commend the bill's authors, Senators McCain, Edwards and Kennedy, \nfor the tremendous job they have done in crafting a bipartisan bill \nthat will provide strong patient protections and curb insurance company \nabuses.\n  This legislation is an example of how, working together, we can \nimprove the health care Americans receive. But it is just the first of \nmany steps we should be taking to ensure that all Americans receive \nquality health care.\n  During the debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights I have heard many \nSenators argue that this legislation will lead to more uninsured \nAmericans. Indeed, some of my colleagues have faulted supporters of the \nbill for not doing anything to help the uninsured.\n  As someone who have been talking about this issue for several years, \nI am thrilled to hear that my colleagues are concerned about the \nproblem of the uninsured.\n  It is a national disgrace that 42 million Americans do not have \nhealth insurance.\n  Who are the uninsured? They are 17.5 percent of our nonelderly \npopulation. A shameful 25 percent are children. The majority--83 \npercent--are in working families.\n  The consequences of our Nation's significant uninsured population are \ndevastating. The uninsured are significantly more likely to delay or \nforego needed care. The uninsured are less likely to receive preventive \ncare. Delaying or not receiving treatment can lead to more serious \nillness and avoidable health problems. This in turn results in \nunnecessary and costly hospitalizations. Indeed, my own state of New \nJersey struggles to deal with the costs of charity care provided to the \nuninsured.\n  In 1999, for the first time in a decade we saw a slight decrease in \nthe uninsured. But we still have so far to go.\n  I believe that health care is a fundamental right, and neither the \nGovernment nor the private sector is doing enough to secure that right \nfor everyone.\n  We ignore the issue of the uninsured at our peril and at a great cost \nto the quality of life--and to the very life--of our citizens.\n  That is why I am developing legislation that will provide universal \naccess to health care for all Americans.\n  My legislation will have several main components:\n  Large employers would be required to provide health coverage for all \ntheir workers. The private sector must do its part--a minimum wage in \nAmerica should include with it minimum benefits, among them health \ninsurance. But unfortunately, the current system puts the responsible \nemployer who provides health insurance at a disadvantage relative to \nthe employers who do not.\n  Small businesses, the self-employed and unemployed would be able to \nbuy coverage in the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program. If it is \ngood enough for Senators, it is good enough for America.\n  Those who are between the ages of 55 and 64 would be able to buy-in \nto the Medicare program.\n  And we would provide help to small businesses and to low-income \nworkers.\n  But although I am passionate about universal access to health care, I \nrealize we can't get there yet. Not because the popular will is not \nthere, but because the political will isn't.\n  So I support incremental changes, starting with the most vulnerable \npopulations, and building on Medicaid and CHIP, success public \nprograms.\n  I am working on a proposal that would expand Medicaid to cover all \npersons up to 200 percent of the Federal poverty level--an efficient \nway to reach nearly two-thirds of the uninsured.\n\n[[Page S7183]]\n\n  I am also a strong supporter of the Family Care proposal, which would \ncover the parents of children already enrolled in the CHIP program. My \nown state of New Jersey is in fact leading the way on the issue of \nenrolling parents with their kids.\n  Finally, I was pleased to be an original cosponsor of Senator \nBingaman's bipartisan legislation, the Start Healthy, Stay Healthy Act, \nwhich would expand coverage for children and pregnant women. It is \nbased on the common sense principal that children deserve to start \nhealthy and stay healthy.\n  I often say that we are not a nation of equal outcomes, but we should \nbe a nation of equal beginnings.\n  Until we give all Americans access to health care, however, we cannot \nlive up to that promise.\n  But although we cannot get to universal access this year, I believe \nwe can and should be doing all that we can to make incremental \nprogress.\n  In conclusion, I am heartened that in this debate on the Patient's \nBill of Rights so many of my colleagues have expressed concern about \nthe problem of the uninsured. Indeed, I am hopeful that we have turned \na corner on this critical issue.\n  As we move forward, I welcome the opportunity to work with any of my \ncolleagues, on either side of the aisle, to find ways to significantly \naddress the problem of the uninsured. There can be no greater purpose \nto our work in the Senate.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the McCain-\nEdwards-Kennedy Patients' Bill of Rights. It has been 4 years since the \nfirst managed care reform bill was introduced in Congress. After years \nof unyielding and unproductive debate, we came together this week to \nfind common ground for the common good, and pass a bill that will \nsignificantly improve the quality of medical treatment for millions of \nAmerican families. We have worked very hard to get to this day, and \nwith the unfailing commitment of my colleagues on both sides, we have \nproduced a bill that I am very proud to support.\n  This bill does more than just provide new assurances to patients. It \nwill provide a whole new framework for the delivery of health care in \nthis country, helping to transform our managed care system from one in \nwhich health plans are immune for the life and death decisions they \nmake every day to a more fair and accountable system for America's \nfamilies.\n  The purpose of this legislation has broad--and I emphasize broad--\nbipartisan support. According to a CBS news poll from 6/20/01, 90 \npercent of Americans support a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Two years ago, 68 Republicans in the House of Representatives voted \nfor the Norwood-Dingell Patients' Bill of Rights legislation that \nallowed patients to sue HMOs if they are denied a medical benefit that \nthey need. The Ganske-Dingell bill in the House of Representatives \ncurrently has strong support from both Democrats and Republicans. I \nurge my colleagues in the House to take up the Ganske-Dingell Patients' \nBill of Rights and pass it without delay so that we can send a bill to \nthe president for signature.\n  We need to enact a patients' bill of rights now. Every day that goes \nby, nearly 50,000 American people with private insurance have benefits \ndelayed or denied by their health plans. These critical decisions made \nby health plans impact thousands of families at times of great stress \nand worry. Our most fundamental well-being depends on our health. \nAnyone who has had a sick family member can tell you of the anxiety \nthey experience during a medical emergency or prolonged illness. It is \nour obligation and within our ability to make it easier for these \nfamilies. This bill will do just that.\n  Opponents of this legislation express concern that if this bill is \nsigned into law, we will see a flood of lawsuits. I would like to point \nout that in the 4 years since Texas enacted legislation allowing \npatients to hold their health insurer liable for denying care, there \nhave been very few lawsuits filed. Four million people in Texas are \ncovered by that State's patient protection law. Only 17 lawsuits have \nbeen filed.\n  The appeals process in this bill is fair and binding. With a strong \nand swift appeals process, patients should be able to receive the care \nthey need, when they need it. The need for recourse in court should be \nminimal.\n  It was never the intent of this legislation to encourage more \nlawsuits. The sole purpose for this bill is to deliver health care to \nthe people who need it. I remain hopeful that as it is the case in \nTexas, there will be very few lawsuits once this bill becomes law.\n  Rather, under this Patients' Bill of Rights, patients will get the \ncare they need and deserve with less delay and less dispute. No longer \nwill a cancer patient have to worry about access to clinical trials for \nnew treatments. No longer will a family with a sick child have to worry \nabout access to a pediatric specialist. No longer will a pregnant woman \nhave to worry about switching doctors mid-pregnancy if her doctor is \ndropped from a plan.\n  Doctors will be able to prescribe the care they feel is necessary \nwithout feeling pressured to make cost-efficient decisions. And managed \ncare companies will be held responsible when their denials of care \nthreaten the lives of patients.\n  In sum, under this legislation, our health care system will better \nreflect and respect our values, putting patients first and the power to \nmake medical decisions back in the hands of doctors and other health \ncare professionals.\n  We can all be proud of this outcome and the path we followed to get \nhere. The Senate worked through a lot of complicated issues and \nproblems, reconciled legitimate policy differences, and reached \nprincipled compromise where we could. The result is real reform, and a \nbill of rights that is right for America.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the strong, enforceable Patients' \nBill of Rights which the Senate is finally going to vote on today. \nAfter years of consideration, and a hard legislative battle over the \nlast few weeks, the bipartisan vote which this bill is about to receive \non final passage reflects the overwhelming support the bill has from \nthe American people.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights assures that medical decisions will be \nmade by doctors, nurses and hospitals, not by someone in an insurance \noffice somewhere with no personal knowledge of the patient and no \nprofessional background to make medical judgments. It guarantees access \nto needed health care specialists. It requires continuity of care \nprotections so that patients will not have to change doctors in the \nmiddle of their treatment. And, the bill provides access to a fair, \nunbiased and timely internal and independent external appeals process \nto address denials of needed health care. This legislation will hold \nHMOs accountable for their decisions like everyone else in the United \nStates. The Patients' Bill of Rights also assures that doctors and \npatients can openly discuss treatment options and includes an \nenforcement mechanism that ensures these rights are real.\n  We have taken a big step forward today on comprehensive managed care \nreform for 190 million Americans. I am hopeful that the House of \nRepresentatives will again pass a real Patients' Bill of Rights and \nthat the President will reconsider his stated intention to veto the \nlegislation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank all my colleagues, both supporters \nand opponents of our legislation, for their patience, their courtesy, \nand their commitment to a full and fair debate on the many difficult \nissues involved in restoring to doctors and HMO patients the right to \nmake the critical decisions that will determine the length and quality \nof their lives.\n  I think we are all agreed on this one premise, that the care provided \nby HMOs has been inadequate in far too many instances. This failure is \nattributable to the fact that virtually all the authority to make life \nand death decisions has been transferred from the people most capable \nof making medical decisions to those people most capable of making \nbusiness decisions. I do not begrudge a corporation maximizing its \nprofits, exercising due diligence regarding its fiduciary \nresponsibility to its shareholders. The corporate bottom line is their \nprimary responsibility, and I respect that. But that is why, we should \nnot grant them another, competing responsibility, especially when that \nsecondary responsibility is the life and health of our constituents. I \nknow\n\n[[Page S7184]]\n\nthat even the opponents of our legislation are agreed on returning more \nauthority to doctors and their patients, and addressing many of the \nmost distressing failures of managed health care.\n  Where we differ, and differ significantly, is over the questions of \nremedies for negligence on the part of the insurers, and though we have \ntried to find common ground we are not there yet. But the Senate, \nseldom acts in perfect unison, and the majority has spoken in support \nof our legislation. I am grateful for that, for I come to appreciate \njust how important this matter is to the American people, and I am \nproud of the Senate for taking this step in addressing the people just \nconcerns.\n  We have made considerable progress in reconciling differences of \nopinion on several issues, from employer liability to class action \nsuits to establishing a reasonable cap on attorney fees, and exhausting \nall other remedies before going to court. We have addressed small, but \nimportant issues like protecting from litigation doctors who volunteer \ntheir time and skill to underprivileged Americans. I want to thank all \nsenators involved in reaching those compromises, Senators DeWine, \nSnowe, Lincoln, Thompson, and Nelson especially, for their diligence \nand good faith. I know they want to pass a bill that the President will \nsign, as do I, and they have worked effectively toward that end.\n  I know that we have outstanding differences remaining. I know that \nthe President is not persuaded that the legislation that we have \nadopted today is the best remedy for the urgent national problem we all \nrecognize. I pledge to continue working with the administration and \nwith our friends on the other side of the Capitol to see if we might \nyet reach common ground on all the important elements of this \nlegislation. I am convinced that we can get there, and I appreciate the \nPresident's dedication to that same end.\n  I thank the sponsors of this legislation, Senator Edwards, the always \nformidable Senator Kennedy, Senators Specter and Chafee, and all the \nother cosponsors for their skill, hard work, and dedication. I thank \nthem also for their patience. We are not always on the same side of a \ndebate, and I suspect that working at close quarters with me can prove \nchallenging even when we are in agreement.\n  I thank Senators Frist, Breaux, and Jeffords and all those who \nsupported their alternative legislation. Throughout this debate they \nhave been motivated by their convictions about what is in the best \ninterests of the American people, as have Senator Nickles, the \nRepublican manager, Senator Gregg, and all Senators who have disagreed \nwith the majority over some provisions in this legislation. I commend \nthem all for their principled opposition.\n  I am grateful for the leadership of Senators Lott and Daschle, and \nthe assistant majority leader, Senator Reid, for their skill, courtesy, \nand fairness in managing this debate.\n  Finally, let me thank those who do most of the work around here but \nget the smallest share of the credit for our accomplishments, our \nstaffs. I want to thank the minority staff director of the Commerce \nCommittee, Mark Buse, committee counsel Jeanne Bumpus, and most \nparticularly, my health care legislative assistant, Sonya Sotak for \ntheir extraordinary hard work, and talented counsel to me and other \nmembers. I thank the staffs of Senators Edwards, and Kennedy, \nleadership staff for the majority and minority, and all staff who have \nmade our work easier and more effective.\n  This has been a good, long, open, and interesting debate, \ndistinguished by good faith on all sides. It has been privilege to have \nbeen part of it. We have achieved an important success today in \naddressing the health care needs of our constituents. We have much work \nto do, and I want to continue working with other Members, our \ncolleagues in the other body, and with the President and his associates \nto make sure that we will enact into law these important protections \nfor so many Americans who have waited for too long for them. We have \nbeen negligent in addressing this problem, but today we have taken an \nimportant step forward in correcting our past mistake. With a little \nmore good faith and hard work, we will give the American people reason \nto be as proud of their government as I am proud of the Senate today.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it has been more than 5 years since we \nbegan this effort to make sure that Americans who have health insurance \nget the medical care they have paid for.\n  It has been more than three years since the first bipartisan \nPatients' Bill of Rights was introduced in the House . . . and nearly 2 \nyears since the last time we debated a real Patients' Bill of Rights in \nthe Senate.\n  Today--at long last--the Senate is doing what the American people \nwant us to do. Today--at long last--we are standing up for America's \nfamilies.\n  Today--at long last--we are telling HMOs they are going to have to \nkeep their promises and provide their policyholders with the health \ncare they've paid for.\n  The bill we are about to vote on provides comprehensive protections \nto all Americans in all health plans.\n  It is a good bill--and a remarkable example of what we can achieve in \nthis Senate when we search together in good faith for a principled, \nworkable compromise.\n  Over the last 10 days, we have stood together--Republicans and \nDemocrats--and rejected amendments that would have made this bill \nunworkable. And we have accepted amendments that made it better.\n  Thanks to the hard work of Senators Snowe, DeWine, Lincoln and \nNelson, we provided additional protections for employers who offer \nhealth insurance.\n  With help from Senators Breaux and Jeffords, we agreed that states \ncan continue to use their own standards for patient protection.\n  With Senator Bayh and Senator Carper's help, we strengthened the \nexternal review process to ensure the sanctity of health plan \ncontracts.\n  At the same time, we turned back an array of destructive amendments \ndesigned to weaken the protections in this bill.\n  We live in an amazing time. Some of the most remarkable advances in \nhealth care in all of human history are occurring right now. Polio and \nother once-feared childhood diseases have been all but wiped out in our \nlifetimes because of increased immunization rates. We are seeing organ \ntransplants, bio-engineered drugs, and promising new therapies for \nrepairing human genes.\n  But medical advances are useless if your health plan arbitrarily \nrefuses to pay for them--or even to let your doctor tell you about \nthem.\n  This bill guarantees that people who have health insurance can get \nthe care their doctors say they need and deserve.\n  It ensures that doctors, not insurance companies, make medical \ndecisions.\n  It guarantees patients the right to hear of all their treatment \noptions, not just the cheapest ones.\n  It says you have the right to go to the closest emergency room, and \nthe right to see a specialist.\n  This bill says that women have the right to see an OB/GYN--without \nhaving to see another doctor first to get permission.\n  It guarantees that parents can choose a pediatrician as their child's \nprimary care provider.\n  It allows families and individuals to challenge an HMO's treatment \ndecisions if they disagree with them.\n  And, it gives families a way to hold HMO's accountable if their \ndecisions cause serious injury or death--because rights without \nremedies are no rights at all.\n  This bill achieves every goal we set for it over the past 5 years, \nand we owe that to the stewardship and commitment of Senators McCain, \nEdwards, and Kennedy.\n  During these last 10 days, they have shown a seemingly limitless \nability to find the workable middle ground without sacrificing people's \nbasic rights. They have put the Nation's interests ahead of their own \npartisan interests. I thank them for their service to this Senate, and \nto our Nation.\n  I also want to thank Senators Nickles and Gregg for being honest with \nus about their disagreements with this bill, and fair in the way they \nhandled those disagreements.\n  This is the way the Senate should work. A Senate that brings up \nimportant bills and allows meaningful debate on them is a tribute to us \nall.\n  One final reason I found this debate so encouraging is the great \nconcern we\n\n[[Page S7185]]\n\nheard expressed by many opponents of this bill for the growing number \nof Americans who have no health insurance. We agree that this is a \nserious problem, and look forward to working with those Senators to \naddress it as soon as possible.\n  The effort to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights now returns to the \nHouse.\n  Last year, 68 House Republicans joined Democrats to pass a strong \npatient protection bill very much like this one. We urge our colleagues \nin the House to resist the special interests one more time. Together, \nwe can send a strong, enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights to President \nBush.\n  We hope that when that happens, the President will reconsider his \nthreatened veto. We hope he will remember the promise he made last fall \nto the American people to pass a national Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Texas has proven that we can protect patients' rights--without \ndramatically increasing premiums. It is time--it is past time--to pass \na Patients' Bill of Rights to protect all insured Americans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill, as amended, pass?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, we are all waiting for the majority \nleader to come to the floor and deliver the reorganization message. As \npart of that, I believe he is going to announce that Senator Leahy, the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, is going to make public the blue \nslip process.\n  As a member of that committee, I would like to take a few moments and \nmake a few comments about my experience with the blue slip--in essence, \nwhat I think about it.\n  For those who do not know what the blue slip is, it is a process by \nwhich a Member can essentially blackball a judge from his or her State \nwhen that Member has some reason to do so.\n  Why would I object so much? I object so much because there is a \nhistory of this kind of thing. Historically, many private clubs and \norganizations have enabled their board of directors to deliver what is \ncalled a blackball to keep out someone they don't want in their club or \norganization. We all know it has happened. For some of us, it has even \nhappened to us.\n  The usual practice was, and still is in instances, to prevent someone \nof a different race or religion from gaining access to that \norganization or club. This is essentially what the blue slip process is \nall about.\n\n  The U.S. Senate is not a private institution. We are a public \ndemocracy. I have come to believe the blue slip should hold no place in \nthis body. At the very least, the use of a blue slip to stop a nominee, \nto prevent a hearing and therefore prevent a confirmation, should be \nmade public. I am pleased to support my chairman, Pat Leahy, and the \nJudiciary Committee in that regard.\n  Under our current procedure, though, any Member of this Senate, by \nreturning a negative blue slip on a home State nominee, or simply by \nnot returning the blue slip at all, can stop a\n\n[[Page S7186]]\n\nnomination dead in its tracks. No reason need be given, no public \nstatement need be made, no one would even know whom to blame. With a \nsecret whisper or a backroom deal, the nomination simply dies without \neven a hearing. This is just plain wrong.\n  I have watched the painful process over the last 9 years. During 6 of \nthose years, the blue slip itself contained the words, ``no further \nproceedings on this nominee will be scheduled until both blue slips \nhave been returned by the nominee's home State Senators.'' As a result, \nI saw nominees waiting 1, 2, 3, even 4 years, often without as much as \na hearing or even an explanation as to why the action was taken. These \nnominees put their lives on hold. Yet they never have a chance to \ndiscuss the concerns that may have been raised about them. These \nconcerns remain secret and the nomination goes nowhere.\n  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I believe our duty is either \nto confirm or reject a nominee based on an informed judgment that he or \nshe is either fit or not fit to serve; to listen to concerns and \nresponses, to examine the evidence presented at a hearing, and to have \na rationale for determining whether or not an individual nominee should \nserve as a district court judge or circuit court judge or even a U.S. \nSupreme Court Justice. That duty, in my view, leaves no room for a \nsecret block on nominees by any Member which prevents their hearing and \nconfirmation.\n  I believe in the last three Congresses, based on information I have \nbeen able to come upon, that the blue slip has been used at least 21 \ntimes. Consider this: An individual graduates college with honors, \nfinishes law school at the top of the class; he or she may even clerk \nfor a prestigious judge or join a large law firm, or maybe practice \npublic interest law or even serve as staff of the Judiciary Committee. \nIn fact, a nominee can spend years of his or her life honing skills and \ndeveloping a reputation among peers, a reputation that finally leads to \na nomination by the President of the United States to a Federal court.\n  This must be the proudest day of his or her life. Then the nominee \njust waits. First for a few weeks. He or she is told things should be \nmoving shortly but the Senate sometimes takes a while to get moving. \nThen the months start to go by, and maybe friends or associates make \nsome inquiries as to what could be wrong. They don't hear anything, so \nthe nominee is told just to wait a little longer; things will work \nthemselves out.\n  I have had nominees call me and say: I have children in school. We \nneed to move. Shall we do it? I don't know what to do. Do I continue my \nlaw practice?\n  A year passes with still no hearing or explanation; finally, the \nsecond year, and maybe the third, or even the fourth, if one is \n``lucky'' enough to be renominated in the next session. The time goes \nby without so much as a word as to why the nomination has not moved \nforward.\n  Simply put, the nominee has been blackballed by a blue slip, and \nthere is nothing that can be done about it--no one to hold accountable.\n  I believe that if a Member wants to use a blue slip to stop a nominee \nfrom moving forward, that blue slip should be public. And I also \nbelieve that the Member should be prepared to appear before the \nJudiciary Committee and explain why the Senate should not consider the \nnominee and hold a hearing.\n  Making the blue slip public is no guarantee that a nominee will \nreceive a hearing. It is no guarantee that an up or down vote will ever \nbe held. But at least the nominee will have the chance to see who has \nthe problem, and what that problem is. In many cases, a nominee may \nchoose to withdraw. In others, perhaps a misunderstanding can be \ncleared up. Either way, the process will be in the open, and we will \nknow the reasons.\n  I believe that many members of this Senate did not even realize they \nheld the power of the blue slip until just recently.\n  In my view, the rationale behind the blue slip process is faulty. The \nprocess was designed to allow home state Senators--who may in some \ninstances know the nominee better than the rest of the Senate--to have \na larger say in whether the nominee moves forward. More often than not, \nhowever, this power is and will be used to stop nominees for political \nor other reasons having nothing to do with qualifications.\n  As a matter of fact, the Member who uses the blue slip, who doesn't \nsend it in, or sends it in negatively, may never have even met the \nnominee.\n  If legitimate reasons to defeat a nominee do exist, those reasons can \nbe shared with the Judiciary Committee in confidence, and decisions can \nbe made based on that information--by the entire Committee.\n  The blue slip process as it now stands is open to abuse.\n  I would join with those--I am hopeful there are now those--on the \nJudiciary Committee who would move to abolish the blue slip.\n  Before I conclude, I want to read from a recent opinion piece by G. \nCalvin Mackenzie, a professor at Colby College and an expert on the \nappointment process. In the April 1, 2001 edition of the Washington \nPost, Mackenzie wrote:\n\n       The nomination system is a national disgrace. It encourages \n     bullies and emboldens demagogues, silences the voices of \n     responsibility, and nourishes the lowest forms of partisan \n     combat. It uses innocent citizens as pawns in politicians' \n     petty games and stains the reputations of good people. It \n     routinely violates fundamental democratic principles, \n     undermines the quality and consistency of public management, \n     and breaches simple decency.\n\n  I find myself in agreement with every word in that quote. It is quite \nan indictment of our nominations process. On both sides of the aisle, \nwe hear: Well, they did it, so we are going to do it. Well, they \nblocked our nominee, so now we will block their nominee.\n  I don't believe that has any merit whatsoever. I believe at some \npoint we have to stop this cycle. At some point, nominees have to come \nto the Senate Judiciary Committee, go promptly or as promptly as they \ncan go to a hearing, have the questions asked, and we do our duty which \nwe took our oath to do, which is to make the judgment whether that \nnominee qualifies to be a Federal court judge or district court judge.\n  I make these remarks to say that this is one Member of the Judiciary \nCommittee who will happily vote to do away with the blue slip.\n  Thank you very much. I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The battlefield exploits of \nthe 442nd, 100th, and the MIS immediately come to mind. Less known but \nequally deserving of\n\n[[Page S7187]]\n\nrecognition are the sacrifices of the civilian nisei on the homefront, \nwho continued to support the war effort while enduring the prejudice of \nfellow citizens as well as the wholesale violation of their civil \nrights by the U.S. Government.\n  This new memorial honors the valor and sacrifice of the hundreds of \nbrave men who fought and died for their country, and it also speaks to \nthe faith and perseverance of 120,000 Japanese Americans and nationals, \nwho solely on the basis of race, regardless of citizenship or loyalty, \nwithout proof or justification, were denied their civil rights in what \nhistory will record as one of our Nation's most shameful acts. This \nmemorial commemorates these events in our Nation's history. It will \nremind us of the consequences of allowing hysteria and racial prejudice \nto override constitutional rights, and, I hope, that we teach this \nlesson to our children to avoid a repetition of our mistakes.\n  I congratulate the National Japanese American Memorial Foundation for \nthe tremendous effort that went into organizing and building the \nMemorial to Patriotism. Thousands of Americans from around the country \ndonated funds to build the memorial. Over 2,000 Hawaii residents \ncontributed approximately $1 million to this worthy project. The \ncompleted memorial is both inspiration and educational. First and \nforemost, the memorial honors the memory of those who gave their lives \nin defense of our freedom and liberty and remembers all those who were \ndislocated or interned from 1942 to 1945. In addition, the memorial \ndraws on a few striking elements to cause one to meditate on the \nwartime experiences of Japanese Americans. The crane sculpture by Nina \nAkamu, a Hawaii-born artist, speaks to the prejudice and injustice \nconfronted by Japanese Americans, and in a larger context speaks to the \nresiliency of the human spirit over adversity. The bell created by Paul \nMatisse encourages reflection, its toll marking the struggle and \nsacrifice of Japanese Americans in our Nation's history and reminding \nus of our shared responsibility to defend the civil rights and \nliberties of all Americans.\n  I would also like to congratulate our friend and colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye] and my friend, Secretary of \nTransportation Norm Mineta, a former Member of Congress, for their \nleadership in gaining Congressional authorization for the memorial and \ntheir support for the work of the National Japanese American Memorial \nFoundation.\n  Today's formal opening of this Memorial to Patriotism by the National \nJapanese American Memorial Foundation in the Nation's capital is a \ntimely and necessary endeavor, for it reminds us and future generations \nof Americans that courage, honor, and loyalty transcend race, culture, \nand ethnicity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/29/senate-section/article/S7187-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   JUSTICE FOR U.S. PRISONERS OF WAR\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as we move into recess for our annual \nIndependence Day celebration, I wish to offer my deepest gratitude for \nall veterans of this country who took the call for arms in silent and \nnoble duty and sacrificed more than we can ever repay. From the \nRevolutionary War to the Persian Gulf War, American men and women have \nalways answered the call to secure and preserve independence and \nfreedom both here and abroad. We are forever in their debt.\n  I also want to take this occasion to recognize and honor a special \ngroup of brave, indeed extraordinary, soldiers who served this country \nso gallantly in WWII. I want to pay special tribute to those who served \nin the Pacific, were taken prisoner, and then enslaved, and forced into \nlabor without pay, under horrific conditions by Japanese companies.\n  While I in no way wish to suggest that other American troops did not \nsuffer equally horrific hardships or served with any less courage, the \nsituation faced by this particular group of veterans was unique. As \nrecognized in a unanimous joint resolution last year, all members of \nCongress stated their strong support for these brave Americans. As with \nmany of our colleagues here today, I am committed to supporting these \nveterans in every way possible in their fight for justice.\n  This weekend the Prime Minister of Japan will be meeting with the \nPresident of the United States. I cannot praise this President enough \nfor his thoughtfulness in hosting this event for the leader of Japan.\n  On this Independence Day, as we honor and appreciate America's \nfreedom, we cannot help but think of those who served our country. \nFreedom, indeed, is not free. The price is immeasurable. I hope the \nPrime Minister will understand, as I know he does, the value we place \nupon our veterans--the very people who fought and paid the price.\n  Our country appreciates the decades of friendship the United States \nand Japan have shared. Often, we probably do not recognize as we should \nthe value of our bilateral relationship with Japan. On many occasions, \nwe get bogged down in trade disputes. But ultimately we have found ways \nto resolve past trade differences, and I am confident we can address \nall current and future trade issues.\n  It is with this sincere hope and appreciation that I raise the memory \nof injustices perpetrated by private companies in Japan against \nAmerican servicemen, and I hope that we can find a resolution to this \nproblem. There is no more appropriate time to open the door to this \nlong overdue dialogue between the United States and Japan. This is a \nmoral issue that will not go away. We can work with Japan to close this \nsad chapter in history. In so doing, we will fortify and continue our \nbilateral relationship with Japan.\n  In closing, I urge all Americans, during this next week as we \ncelebrate our freedom and our great history, to thank our soldiers who \ngave their lives and their freedom to fight for our nation. I thank \nthem and express my support that they will be helped and protected. I \nwill fight for them as they fought for me, my children, and all other \nAmericans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/29/senate-section/article/S7187-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7187-S7188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RETIREMENT OF VICE ADMIRAL JAMES F. AMERAULT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise to \ntake this opportunity to recognize the exemplary service and career of \nan outstanding naval officer, Vice Admiral James F. Amerault, upon his \nretirement from the United States Navy at the conclusion of more than \n36 years of honorable and distinguished service. It is my privilege to \ncommend him for outstanding service to the Navy and our great nation.\n  Vice Admiral Amerault embarked on his naval career thirty-six years \nago, on the 29th of June 1965. In the years since that day, he has \ndevoted great energy and talent to the Navy and protecting our national \nsecurity interests. It would be hard to calculate the innumerable hours \nthis man has stood watch to keep our nation safe. He has been steadfast \nin his commitment to the ideals and values that our country embodies \nand holds dear.\n  Following his commissioning at the United States Naval Academy, he \nembarked on the first of many ships that would benefit from his \nleadership and expertise. Vice Admiral Amerault served at-sea as \nGunnery Officer and First Lieutenant on board USS Massey (DD 778). He \nthen served as Officer in Charge, Patrol Craft Fast 52 in Vietnam, a \nchallenging and dangerous assignment that kept him in harm's way. His \ncourage and commitment to our nation was more than evident during these \ntumultuous years as he conducted more than 90 combat patrols in hostile \nwaters off the coast of South Vietnam. One example of his valor and \nheroism is quoted from Commander Coastal Division Fourteen on 21 \nDecember 1967, ``On the night of 4 August 1967 the patrol craft in the \narea adjacent to the one you were patrolling came under enemy fire. \nDisregarding your own safety, you directed your patrol craft to within \n300 yards of the beach and bombarded the enemy position with intense \n.50 caliber and 81mm mortar fire. During this exchange your patrol \ncraft was narrowly missed by a barrage of recoilless rifle fire.'' \nAgain, his valor and heroism was established early in his career. He \nwas awarded a Bronze Star Medal with Combat V and the Navy Combat \nAction Ribbon for his service.\n  Vice Admiral Amerault's follow-on sea tours demonstrated the tactical \nbrilliance that would become his trademark. His next tour was on board \nUSS Taylor (DD 468) as Engineer Officer.\n\n[[Page S7188]]\n\nDuring this tour he earned a coveted Shellback certificate for crossing \nthe equator. He then reported as Chief Engineer on board USS Benner (DD \n801) where he earned his first of three Navy Commendation Medals.\n  Several sea tours followed in steady progression. He was Executive \nOfficer in USS Dupont (DD 941). He also was Executive Officer in USS \nSierra (AD 18). He served as commissioning Commanding Officer of USS \nNicholas (FFG 47) and Commanding Officer of USS Samuel Gompers (AD 37). \nIt is difficult to convey the challenges and hardships that were faced \nby this officer and his family during these many and arduous sea tours.\n  As Vice Admiral Amerault progressed in the Navy he served as Staff \nCombat Information Center Officer for Commander, Cruiser Destroyer \nGroup TWO; and commanded Destroyer Squadron SIX, Amphibious Group FOUR, \nand the Western Hemisphere Group. Again, these were all difficult tours \nof tremendous responsibility that required an incredible commitment to \nduty and country.\n  Vice Admiral Amerault's shore assignments have included Director, \nNavy Program Resource Appraisal Division and Executive Assistant to the \nDirector, Surface Warfare Division on the staff of the Chief of Naval \nOperations.\n  His flag assignments have included Director, Operations Division, \nOffice of Budget and Reports, Navy Comptroller; Director, Office of \nNavy Budget; and Director, Fiscal Management Division in the office of \nthe Chief of Naval Operations.\n  His final tour in the Navy as Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Fleet \nReadiness and Logistics) has demonstrated his brilliant logistics \nacumen. With dynamic leadership he has refocused the Navy's logistics \nsystems to more accurately meet the needs of the war fighter and the \nNavy of the future.\n  A scholar as well, VADM Amerault is a graduate of the Naval \nPostgraduate School (MS Operations Research) and the University of Utah \n(MA Middle East Affairs and Arabic), and was the Navy's 1986-87 Federal \nExecutive Fellow at the RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, California.\n  As he ascended to the highest echelons of leadership in the Navy, \nVice Admiral Amerault garnered many commendations that further \nhighlight his stellar career. They include the Distinguished Service \nMedal; Legion of Merit (seven awards); the Bronze Star with V; the \nMeritorious Service Medal (two awards); the Joint Service Commendation \nMedal; the Navy Commendation Medal (three awards); and Vietnam, Desert \nStorm, and numerous other campaign medals.\n  Vice Admiral Amerault also has the distinction of being the Navy's \n``Old Salt''--the active duty officer who has been qualified as an \nofficer of the deck underway the longest.\n  Standing beside this officer throughout his superb career has been \nhis wife Cathy, a lady to whom he owes much. She has been his key \nsupporter, devoting her life to her husband, to her family, and to the \nmen and women of the Navy family. She has traveled by his side for \nthese many years. They are the epitome of the Navy family team.\n  From the start of his career at the Naval Academy, through Vietnam, \nthe Gulf War, Kosovo and beyond--thirty-six years--Vice Admiral \nAmerault has served with uncommon valor. He is indeed an individual of \nrare character and professionalism--a true Sailor's Sailor! I am proud, \nMr. President, to thank him on behalf of the United States of America \nfor his honorable and most distinguished career in the United States \nNavy, and to wish him ``fair winds and following seas''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/29/senate-section/article/S7188-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECOGNIZING VOLUNTEER REFEREES FOR THE 2001 SIGMA NU CHARITY BOWL\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, recently the Epsilon Xi Chapter of Sigma Nu \nat the University of Mississippi celebrated the eleventh anniversary of \nthe Charity Bowl in Oxford, Mississippi. Founded in 1989, the Sigma Nu \nCharity Bowl has helped many unfortunate men and women, who from \naccidents or injuries have been permanently paralyzed. Since 1990, over \n$500,000 has been raised to help these individuals.\n  Throughout the years, the Epsilon Xi Sigma Nu Charity Bowl has become \none of the largest college philanthropy events in the nation. Every \nyear, Sigma Nu competes in a football game against another fraternity \nfrom Ole Miss or another university. It has become an annual event that \nthe citizens of Oxford, the parents of the players, and the Ole Miss \ncommunity enjoy each year. This year's recipient was a very deserving \nyoung man named James Havard, who enjoyed watching Sigma Nu defeat Phi \nDelta Theta 18-13.\n  I would like to recognize some very special men who generously gave \ntheir time and talents in order to make the Charity Bowl a great \nsuccess. Steve Freeman, Michael Miles, Kevin Roberts, Scott Steenson, \nand Michael Woodard are to be commended and honored for their efforts \nin serving as volunteer referees for the charity bowl football game. \nThey graciously took time out of their busy schedules in order to make \nthe game more enjoyable for the players and the fans, but more \nimportantly they gave James Havard an opportunity to enjoy a better \nlife.\n  These men belong to the Professional Football Referees Association \nCharities, PFRA. The PFRA is also very involved in helping out other \ncharitable organizations such as the Make-A-Wish Foundation. This \ndistinguished organization has been very helpful in getting aid to \nindividuals like James, and they have given many people a chance to \nhave a better life.\n  These men and the PFRA are to be commended for a job well done, and \nfor their continued efforts in improving the lives of others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/29/senate-section/article/S7188-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7188-S7189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     THE ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES IN GLOBAL AND NATIONAL COMMERCE ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of the most significant accomplishments \nof the 106th Congress was the Electronic Signatures in Global and \nNational Commerce Act, commonly known as ``ESIGN.'' This landmark \nlegislation establishes a Federal framework for the use of electronic \nsignatures, contracts, and records, while preserving essential \nsafeguards protecting the Nation's consumers. It passed both houses of \nCongress by an overwhelming majority, and went into effect in October \n2000.\n  I helped to craft the Senate version of the bill, which passed \nunanimously in November 1999, and I was honored to serve as a conferee \nand help develop the conference report. I am proud of what we achieved \nand the bipartisan manner in which we achieved it. It was an example of \nlegislators legislating rather than politicians posturing and \nunnecessarily politicizing important matters of public policy.\n  Much of the negotiations over ESIGN concerned the consumer protection \nlanguage in section 101(c), which was designed to ensure effective \nconsumer consent to the replacement of paper notices with electronic \nnotices. We managed in the end to strike a constructive balance that \nadvanced electronic commerce without terminating or mangling the basic \nrights of consumers.\n  In particular, ESIGN requires use of a ``technological check'' in \nobtaining consumer consent. The critical language, which Senator Wyden \nand I developed and proposed, provides that a consumer's consent to the \nprovision of information in electronic form must involve a \ndemonstration that the consumer can actually receive and read the \ninformation. Companies are left with ample flexibility to develop their \nown procedures for this demonstration.\n  When the Senate passed ESIGN in June 2000, I expressed confidence \nthat the benefits of a one-time technological check would far outweigh \nany possible burden on e-commerce. I also predicted that this provision \nwould increase consumer confidence in the electronic marketplace.\n  One year later, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of \nCommerce have issued a report on the impact of ESIGN's consumer consent \nprovision. In preparing the report, these agencies conducted extensive \noutreach to the on-line business community, technology developers, \nconsumer groups, law enforcement, and academia. The report concludes:\n\n       [T]hus far, the benefits of the consumer consent provision \n     of ESIGN outweigh the burdens of its implementation on \n     electronic commerce. The provision facilitates e-commerce and \n     the use of electronic records and\n\n[[Page S7189]]\n\n     signatures while enhancing consumer confidence. It preserves \n     the right of consumers to receive written information \n     required by state and federal law. The provision also \n     discourages deception and fraud by those who might fail to \n     provide consumers with information the law requires that they \n     receive.''\n\n  Significantly, the consumer consent provision is benefitting \nbusinesses as well as consumers. The report states that businesses that \nhave implemented this provision are reporting several benefits, \nincluding ``protection from liability, increased revenues resulting \nfrom increased consumer confidence, and the opportunity to engage in \nadditional dialogue with consumers about the transactions.'' The \ntechnological check has not been significantly burdensome, and ``[t]he \ntechnology-neutral language of the provision encourages creativity in \nthe structure of business systems that interface with consumers, and \nprovides an opportunity for the business and the consumer to choose the \nform of communication for the transaction.''\n  The report also finds that ESIGN's consumer safeguards are helping to \nprevent deception and fraud, which is critical to maintaining consumer \nconfidence in the electronic marketplace.\n  ESIGN is a product of bipartisan cooperation, and it is working well \nfor the country. We should learn from experience as we take up new \nlegislative challenges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/29/senate-section/article/S7189-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IN MEMORY OF OLIVER POWERS\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

He was a respected, well-\nliked, and dedicated member of the Senate Recording Studio staff. He is \nsurvived by his wife of 28 years, Anita; two sons, Isaiah and Lucas; \nhis mother, Ella Belle Powers of Chickasha, Oklahoma, and brother, Roy \nPowers, of Norman. Our hearts go out to them.\n  Oliver was a native of Chickasha, Oklahoma, where he graduated from \nhigh school in 1971. He was also a graduate of the University of \nScience and Arts of Oklahoma, also located in Chickasha, and went on to \nearn a Master's Degree in Journalism from the University of Oklahoma. \nOliver began his service to the U.S. Senate in 1986, when he became \ndirector of audio and lighting for the Senate.\n  Oliver will be missed by all of those who knew him through his \ncommunity, his church, and his work here in the Senate. Oliver embodied \nthe best of what we've come to expect from Oklahomans. He was hard \nworking, yet soft-spoken and gentle; highly professional, yet humble, \nand always kind and respectful to others. He was representative of so \nmany staff here that work tirelessly and anonymously on behalf of the \nSenate.\n  On behalf of the United States Senate, let me say thank you to Anita, \nIsaiah, Lucas and the other members of the Powers family for sharing \nhim with us these many years.

ICTY\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the authorities \nof Serbia for, at long last, handing over Slobodan Milosevic to the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal. It is ironic, and perhaps fitting, \nthat his arrest and transfer to the international court took place on \nJune 28--one of the most noted dates in Serb history, when in 1389 the \nSerbs were defeated at the battle of Kosovo Polje, ushering in a period \nof Ottoman Turkish rule. It is my hope that future generations of Serbs \nwill remember June 28, 2001 with the same sense of historic importance \nand as the beginning of true and long-lasting democracy and respect for \nthe rule of law.\n  Mr. Milosevic has been charged by an independent, impartial, \ninternational criminal tribunal with crimes against humanity and \nviolations of the laws or customs of war against the ethnic Albanian \npopulation of Kosovo. And according to the Prosecutor of the Tribunal, \nwe can expect more indictments against him for earlier crimes in \nCroatia and Bosnia.\n  His extradition to the Hague is historic, if long overdue. As a \nformer head of state, there were many who believed that he would never \nbe made to answer for the charges against him. That this day finally \ncame underscores the commitment of the international community to \ninvestigating and prosecuting individuals for war crimes. And it sets \nan important precedent in international law; namely, that the Geneva \nConventions and their Protocols will be upheld and enforced regardless \nof one's position or influence. The message in all of this is clear and \ninspiring: with patience and perseverance, democracy and the rule of \nlaw will prevail.\n  Serbian Prime Minister Djindjic deserves praise for his leadership on \nthis issue and for recognizing that if Serbia wants to join the \ndemocratic family of nations, then it must uphold and respect the rule \nof law. Many others have contributed their efforts over the years \nleading up to this historic day and deserve mention: former Secretary \nof State Madeleine Albright, U.S. Ambassador-at-large for War Crimes, \nDavid Scheffer, and ICTY Prosecutors Justice Louise Arbour and Carla \nDel Ponte, to name just a few.\n  The wars that tore apart the former Yugoslavia--and which threaten \nMacedonia today--were largely, although not exclusively, of Mr. \nMilosevic's doing. He fomented extreme ethnic nationalism and unleashed \nhis army and special police forces on the civilian populations of \nCroatia, Bosnia and Kosovo. Millions of people were driven from their \nhomes and more than a quarter of a million are believed to have died. \nFor his policies he earned himself the name, ``the Butcher of \nBelgrade.'' His victims deserve accountability and his former citizens \ndeserve to know what was done in their name.\n  It must be stressed that the Serb people are not on trial; only Mr. \nMilosevic. The United States seeks friendship and partnership with all \nof the people of the former Yugoslavia. Our presence and contributions \nat the donor's conference are evidence of our intentions.\n  Yet while we welcome yesterday's developments, we must also not \nforget that 26 accused remain on the run, most of them in Bosnia and \nSerbia. I call on the accused to turn themselves over to the \njurisdiction of the Tribunal to answer the charges against them without \nfurther delay. It is the honorable thing to do. But failing this, the \nlocal authorities must take swift and decisive action, if necessary \nwith the support of international peacekeeping troops, to deliver these \nfugitives from justice to the court in the Hague. There will never be \nlong-lasting peace and stability in the region so long as these \nindividuals remain on the run. The fact that they have evaded justice \nfor so long--in the case of Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic it's \nalready six year--makes a mockery of justice and it must end.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/29/senate-section/article/S7189-3", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, I rise today to join Cape Verdeans in the \nJuly 5th celebration of Cape Verde Independence Day.\n  Every country is rich with its own history and unique story of how it \nachieved democracy, and Cape Verde is no exception. In 1462, Portuguese \nsettlers arrived at Santiago and founded\n\n[[Page S7190]]\n\nRibeira Grande, now Cidade Velha, the first permanent European \nsettlement city in the tropics. After almost three centuries as a \ncolony, in 1951 Portugal changed Cape Verde's status to an overseas \nprovince. Then in December 1974, an agreement was signed which provided \nfor a transitional government composed of Portuguese and Cape Verdeans. \nIn 1975, Cape Verdeans elected a National Assembly, which received the \ninstruments of independence from Portugal.\n  For the first fifteen years of independence, Cape Verde was ruled by \none party. Then in 1990 opposition groups came together to form the \nMovement for Democracy. Working together they ended the one party state \nand the first multi-party elections were held in January 1991.\n  Cape Verde now enjoys a stable democratic government. It is an \nexample to other States as to what can be accomplished. These \ndemocratic changes have meant better global integration as the \ngovernment has pursued market-oriented economic policies and welcomed \nforeign investors. Tourism, light manufacturing and fisheries have \nflourished. Cape Verde has made the difficult transition from a colony \nto a successful independent and democratic State.\n  Today, there are close to 350,000 Cape Verdean-Americans living in \nthe United States, almost equal to the population of Cape Verde itself. \nThese Americans hold a special right since the Cape Verdean \nConstitution formally considers all Cape Verdeans at home and abroad as \ncitizens and voters. Thus, July 5th is a day of independence for all \nCape Verdean-Americans as well as those in Cape Verde.\n  As we approach the independence day of our own country and reflect on \nfreedom and democracy, it is especially fitting that we remember and \ncelebrate those special independence days of other peaceful \ndemocracies, such as Cape Verde. Join with me in wishing all those with \ndirect and ancestral ties to Cape Verde a happy independence day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/29/senate-section/article/S7190-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HEALTH CARE FOR THE GUARD AND RESERVE\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1119, a \nbill that would require the Secretary of Defense to conduct a study of \nthe health care coverage of the military's Selected Reserve.\n  Most South Dakotans know at least one of the 4,500 current members of \nthe South Dakota Guard and Reserves--the so-called Selected Reserve--or \nthe thousands of former Guardsmen and Reservists. Sometimes, the \nconnection is even more direct. Before joining the Army, my oldest son \nwas a member of the South Dakota Army Guard in Yankton. South Dakota's \nGuard and Reserve members have supported overseas operations, including \nthose in Central America, the Middle East, Europe and Asia. Members of \nthe South Dakota Air Guard are currently preparing for its mission \nlater this year, where it will patrol the ``No-Fly Zone'' in Iraq.\n  South Dakota's Guard and Reserve units consistently rank in the \nhighest percentile of readiness and quality of its recruits. But \nkeeping and recruiting the best of the best in the South Dakota \nNational Guard and Reserves is becoming more of a challenge as our \nmilitary's operations tempo has remained high while the number of \nactive duty military forces has decreased. This tempo places \nsignificant pressure on the members of the reserve component, and has \nexposed possible health care deficiencies.\n  Many deploying members and their families have experienced tremendous \nturbulence moving back-and-forth between their civilian health \ninsurance plans and TRICARE Prime, the military's health care system. \nSome junior reservists have no health insurance at all. Some figures, \nfor example, have shown that upward of 200,000 Selected Reservists \nnationwide do not possess adequate insurance. The exact nature of these \ndisturbances and the broader shortfalls of this system are unclear \nbecause examinations have not completed.\n  I am pleased to join with my colleagues in introducing this \nlegislation, which will take a step towards understanding this problem \nand giving Congress direction on how to solve it. I know how poor \nhealth care and broken promises can reduce morale within our military \nand their families. A poor ``quality of life'' among our reserve \ncomponent and active duty personnel has a direct impact on recruitment \nand retention of the best and brightest in our Armed Services. I will \ncontinue to do all I can to ensure our men and women in the military, \nveterans, and military retirees have the health care they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/29/senate-section/article/S7190-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a man who \nemployed his knowledge and vision to take America into Space. I am \nspeaking of Cleveland resident, Abe Silverstein, who just passed away \nthis month at 92 years of age, leaving a legacy of invention and \ninnovation in the field of Space Flight.\n  Abe Silverstein played a part in a number of ``space firsts,'' and \nreceived many prestigious honors for his work. In the company of \nOrville Wright, William Boeing, and Charles Lindbergh, Abe won the \nGuggenheim Award for the advancement of flight.\n  Abe Silverstein designed, tested, and operated the world's first \nsupersonic wind tunnel. It was the largest, fastest, and most powerful \nin the world. The research that was conducted with the tunnel allowed \nAbe to produce faster combat planes in World War II. This tunnel now \nresides in the NASA Glenn Space Research Facility in Cleveland, which \nAbe directed from 1961-1969.\n  He was also the first director of NASA Space Flight Operations and \nworked on the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, and Centaur projects. The \nCentaur project involved the launching vehicles that propelled \nspacecraft to Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.\n  Serving his country in World War II by producing new technology and \nhelping his country achieve its goals in Space was not enough for Abe \nSilverstein. After retiring from NASA, Abe went on to work for Republic \nSteel Corporation, where he developed pollution controls to help keep \nour air cleaner for future generations.\n  Abe Silverstein always was contributing to his country, whether it be \nthrough wind-tunnel research or in serving as a Trustee at Cleveland \nState University. He was a man of great personal virtue and strength of \ncharacter. I am proud, Mr. President, to honor this man today, who his \nNASA colleagues once described as ``a man of vision and conviction, [a \nman who] contributed to the ultimate success of America's unmanned and \nhuman space programs . . . his innovative, pioneering spirit lives on \nin the work we do today.''\n  I thank Mr. Silverstein for all his hard work and sacrifice, and I \nhope that my colleagues will join me in my gratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/29/senate-section/article/S7190-4", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7190-S7191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO LES AND MARILYN GORDON\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

A bill to amend chapter 1 of title 9, United States Code, to \nprovide for greater fairness in the arbitration process relating to \nmotor vehicle franchise contracts; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce S. 1140, ``The \nMotor Vehicle Franchise Contract Arbitration Fairness Act of 2001.'' I \nam pleased to be joined in cosponsorship of this legislation by \nSenators Feingold, Grassley, Leahy, Warner, Breaux, Burns, Reid, Craig, \nTorricelli, Bennett, Snowe, DeWine, Thomas, and Hutchinson. Our bill is \nintended to allow automobile dealers their day in court when they have \ndisputes with the manufacturers.\n  As automobile dealers throughout Utah have pointed out to me, the \nmotor vehicle dealer contract often includes mandatory arbitration \nclauses, and they also point out their unequal bargaining power. This \nis usually the result of various factors, including the manufacturers' \ndiscretion to allocate vehicle inventory and control on the timing of \ndelivery. Manufacturers can, thus, determine the dealer's financial \nfuture with the allocation of the best-selling models. Manufacturers \ncan also exercise leverage over the flow of revenue to dealers, such as \nwarranty payments. Manufacturers can limit dealers' rights to transfer \nownership or control of the business, even to family members. And \nmanufacturers have tried, arbitrarily, to take businesses away from \ndealers without cause.\n  I recognize the efficiencies of mandatory arbitration clauses in \ngeneral, but the specific circumstances in the manufacturer-dealer \nrelationship justifies this widely-supported bipartisan proposal. It is \nworthy to note that Congress in 1956 enacted the Automobile Dealer Day \nin Court Act, which provided a small business dealer in limited \ncircumstances the right to proceed in Federal court when faced with \nabuses by manufacturers. And State legislatures have enacted \nsignificant protections for auto dealers.\n  S. 1140 amends Title 9 of the U.S. Code and make arbitration of \ndisputes in motor vehicle franchise contracts optional. This would \nallow dealers to opt voluntarily for arbitration or use procedures and \nremedies available under State law, such as state-established \nadministrative boards specifically established to resolve dealer/\nmanufacturer disputes.\n  I must note that this legislation is extremely narrow and affects \nonly the unique relationship between small business auto dealers and \nmotor vehicle manufacturers, which is strictly governed by State law. \nThis legislation is necessary to protect the States' interest in \nregulating the motor vehicle dealer/manufacturer relationship.\n  All States, except for Alaska, have enacted laws specifically \ndesigned to regulate the economic relationship between motor vehicle \ndealers and manufacturers to prevent unfair manufacturer contract terms \nand practices. In most States, including my home State of Utah, \neffective State administrative forums already exist to handle dealer/\nmanufacturer disputes outside of the court system. Indeed, in the \nmajority of States, a special State agency or forum is charged with \nadministering and enforcing motor vehicle franchise law. These State \nforums provide an inexpensive, speedy, and non-judicial resolution of \ndisputes.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this worthwhile legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1140\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S7196]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendments made by section 2 shall apply to contracts \n     entered into, amended, altered, modified, renewed, or \n     extended after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, over the years, I have been in the \nforefront of promoting alternative dispute resolution, (ADR), \nmechanisms to encourage alternatives to litigation when disputes arise. \nSuch legislation includes the permanent use of ADR by Federal agencies. \nLast Congress, we also passed legislation to authorize Federal court-\nannexed arbitration. These statutes are based, in part, on the premise \nthat arbitration should be voluntary rather than mandatory.\n  While arbitration often serves an important function as an efficient \nalternative to court, some trade offs must be considered by both \nparties, such a limited judicial review and less formal procedures \nregarding discovery and rules of evidence. When mandatory binding \narbitration is forced upon a party, for example when it is placed in a \nboiler-plate agreement, it deprives the weaker party the opportunity to \nelect any other forum. As a proponent of arbitration I believe it is \ncritical to ensure that the selection of arbitration is voluntary and \nfair.\n  Unequal bargaining power exists in contracts between automobile and \ntruck dealers and their manufacturers. The manufacturer drafts the \ncontract and presents it to dealers with no opportunist to negotiate. \nIncreasingly, these manufacturers are including compulsory binding \narbitration in their agreements, and dealers are finding themselves \nwith no choice but to accept it. If they refuse to sign the contract \nthey have no franchise. This clause then binds the dealer to \narbitration as the exclusive procedure for resolving any dispute. The \npurpose of arbitration is to reduce costly, time-consuming litigation, \nnot to force a party to an adhesion contract to waive access to \njudicial or administrative forums for the pursuit of rights under State \nlaw.\n  I am extremely concerned with this industry practice that conditions \nthe granting or keeping of motor vehicle franchises on the acceptance \nof mandatory and binding arbitration. While several States have enacted \nstatutes to protect weaker parties in ``take it or leave it'' contracts \nand attempted to prevent hits type of inequitable practice, these State \nlaws have been held to conflict with the federal Arbitration Act (FAA).\n  In 1925, when the FAA was enacted to make arbitration agreements \nenforceable in Federal courts, it did not expressly provide for \npreemption of State law. Nor is there any legislative history to \nindicate Congress intended to occupy the entire field of arbitration. \nHowever, in 1984 the Supreme Court interpreted the FAA to preempt state \nlaw in Southland Corporation v. Keating. This, State laws that protect \nweaker parties from being forced to accept arbitration and to waive \nState rights, such as Iowa's law prohibiting manufacturers from \nrequiring dealers to submit to mandatory binding arbitration, are \npreempted by the FAA.\n  With mandatory binding arbitration agreements becoming increasingly \ncommon in motor vehicle franchise agreements, now is the time to \neliminate the ambiguity in the FAA statute. The purpose of the \nlegislation we are introducing is to ensure that in disputes between \nmanufacturers and dealers, both parties must voluntarily elect binding \narbitration. This approach would continue to recognize arbitration as a \nvaluable alternative to court, but would provide an option to pursue \nother forums such as administrative bodies that have been established \nin a majority of States, including Iowa, to handle dealer/manufacturer \ndisputes.\n  This legislation will go a long way toward ensuring that parties will \nnot be forced into binding arbitration and thereby lose important \nstatutory rights. I am confident that given its many advantages \narbitration will often be elected. But it is essential for public \npolicy reasons and basic fairness that both parties to this type of \ncontract have the freedom to make their own decisions based on the \ncircumstances of the case.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to \naddress this unfair franchise practice.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, with my \ndistinguished colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, the Motor Vehicle \nFranchise Contract Arbitration Fairness Act of 2001. I want to \nrecognize the efforts of the Senator from Iowa, Senator Grassley, in \nadvancing this legislation in the last Congress, and note how pleased I \nam that the distinguished ranking member and former chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee has decided to take the lead on this bill this \nyear. By the time the 106th Congress concluded, we had the support of \n56 Senators for this bill. So I believe we have an excellent \nopportunity to pass this bill this year, and I look forward to working \nwith the Senator from Utah to make that happen.\n  While alternative methods of dispute resolution such as arbitration \ncan serve a useful purpose in resolving disputes between parties, I am \nextremely concerned about the increasing trend of stronger parties to a \ncontract forcing weaker parties to waive their rights and agree to \narbitrate any future disputes that may arise. In every Congress since \n1994, I have introduced the Civil Rights Procedures Protection Act, \nwhich amends certain civil rights statutes to prevent the involuntary \nimposition of arbitration to claims that arise from unlawful employment \ndiscrimination and sexual harassment.\n  A few years ago, it came to my attention that the automobile and \ntruck manufacturers, which often present dealers with ``take it or \nleave it'' contracts, are increasingly including mandatory and binding \narbitration clauses as a condition of entering into or maintaining an \nauto or truck franchise. This practice forces dealers to submit their \ndisputes with manufacturers to arbitration. As a result, dealers are \nrequired to waive access to judicial or administrative forums, \nsubstantive contract rights, and statutorily provided protection. In \nshort, this practice clearly violates the dealers' fundamental due \nprocess rights and runs directly counter to basic principles of \nfairness.\n  Franchise agreements for auto and truck dealerships are typically not \nnegotiable between the manufacturer and the dealer. The dealer accepts \nthe terms offered by the manufacturer, or it loses the dealership, \nplain and simple. Dealers, therefore, have been forced to rely on the \nStates to pass laws designed to balance the manufacturers' far greater \nbargaining power and to safeguard the rights of dealers. The first \nState automobile statute was enacted in my home State of Wisconsin in \n1937 to protect citizens from injury caused when a manufacturer or \ndistributor induced a Wisconsin citizen to invest considerable sums of \nmoney in dealership facilities, and then canceled the dealership \nwithout cause. Since then, all States except Alaska have enacted \nsubstantive law to balance the enormous bargaining power enjoyed by \nmanufacturers over dealers and to safeguard small business dealers from \nunfair automobile and truck manufacturer practices.\n\n[[Page S7197]]\n\n  A little known fact is that under the Federal Arbitration Act, FAA, \narbitrators are not required to apply the particular Federal or State \nlaw that would be applied by a court. That enables the stronger party, \nin this case the auto or truck manufacturer, to use arbitration to \ncircumvent laws specifically enacted to regulate the dealer/\nmanufacturer relationship. Not only is the circumvention of these laws \ninequitable, it also eliminates the deterrent to prohibited acts that \nState law provides.\n  The majority of States have created their own alternative dispute \nresolution mechanisms and forums with access to auto industry expertise \nthat provide inexpensive, efficient, and non-judicial resolution of \ndisputes. For example, in Wisconsin, mandatory mediation is required \nbefore the start of an administrative hearing or court action. \nArbitration is also an option if both parties agree. These State \ndispute resolution forums, with years of experience and precedent, are \ngreatly responsible for the small number of manufacture-dealer \nlawsuits. When mandatory binding arbitration is included in dealer \nagreements, these specific State laws and forums established to resolve \nauto dealer and manufacturer disputes are effectively rendered null and \nvoid with respect to dealer agreements.\n  Besides losing the protection of Federal and State law and the \nability to use State forums, there are numerous reasons why a dealer \nmay not want to agree to binding arbitration. Arbitration lacks some of \nthe important safeguards and due process offered by administrative \nprocedures and the judicial system: 1. arbitration lacks the formal \ncourt supervised discovery process often necessary to learn facts and \ngain documents; 2. an arbitrator need not follow the rules of evidence; \n3. arbitrators generally have no obligation to provide factual or legal \ndiscussion of the decision in a written opinion; and 4. arbitration \noften does not allow for judicial review.\n  The most troubling problem with this sort of mandatory binding \narbitration is the absence of judicial review. Take for instance a \ndispute over a dealership termination. To that dealer, that small \nbusiness person, this decision is of commercial life or death \nimportance. Even under this scenario, the dealer would not have \nrecourse to substantive judicial review of the arbitrators' ruling. Let \nme be very clear on this point; in most circumstances an arbitration \naward cannot be vacated, even if the arbitration panel disregarded \nstate law that likely would have produced a different result.\n  The use of mandatory binding arbitration is increasing in many \nindustries, but nowhere is it growing more steadily than the auto/truck \nindustry. Currently, at least 11 auto and truck manufacturers require \nsome form of such arbitration in their dealer contracts.\n  In recognition of this problem, many States have enacted laws to \nprohibit the inclusion of mandatory binding arbitration clauses in \ncertain agreements. The Supreme Court, however, held in Southland Corp. \nv. Keating, 104 S. Ct. 852 (1984), that the FAA by implication preempts \nthese State laws. This has the effect of nullifying many State \narbitration laws that were designed to protect weaker parties in \nunequal bargaining positions from involuntarily signing away their \nrights.\n  The legislative history of the FAA indicates that Congress never \nintended to have the Act used by a stronger party to force a weaker \nparty into binding arbitration. Congress certainly did not intend the \nFAA to be used as a tool to coerce parties to relinquish important \nprotections and rights that would have been afforded them by the \njudicial system. Unfortunately, this is precisely the current \nsituation.\n  Although contract law is generally the province of the States, the \nSupreme Court's decision in Southland Corp. has in effect made any \nState action on this issue moot. Therefore, along with Senator Hatch, I \nam introducing this bill today to ensure that dealers are not coerced \ninto waiving their rights. Our bill, the Motor Vehicle Franchise \nContract Arbitration Fairness Act of 2001, would simply provide that \neach party to an auto or truck franchise contract has the option of \nselecting arbitration, but cannot be forced to do so.\n  The bill would not prohibit arbitration. On the contrary, the bill \nwould encourage arbitration by making it a fair choice that both \nparties to a franchise contract may willingly and knowingly select. In \nshort, this bill would ensure that the decision to arbitrate is truly \nvoluntary and that the rights and remedies provided for by our judicial \nsystem are not waived under coercion.\n  In effect, if small business owners today want to obtain or keep \ntheir auto or truck franchise, they may be able to do so only by \nrelinquishing their legal rights and foregoing the opportunity to use \nthe courts or administrative forums. I cannot say this more strongly, \nthis is unacceptable; this is wrong. It is at great odds with our \ntradition of fair play and elementary notions of justice. I therefore \nurge my colleagues to join in this bipartisan effort to put an end to \nthis invidious practice.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN:\n  S. 1142. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe minimum tax preference for exclusion for incentive stock options; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a proposal \nwith regard to the perverse impact of the Alternative Minimum Tax, AMT, \non Incentive Stock Options, ISOs. I previously introduced this proposal \non April 30, 2001, as Section 5 of S. 798, the Productivity, \nOpportunity, and Prosperity Act of 2001. I am reintroducing this \nproposal as a separate bill to highlight the importance of this issue.\n  Incentive stock options and the AMT did not exist when Franz Kafka's \n``The Castle'' was published in 1926. The book describes the relentless \nbut futile efforts of the protagonist, K., to gain recognition from the \nmysterious authorities ruling from their castle a village where K. \nwants to establish himself. The world he inhabits is both absurd and \nreal. Kafka's characters are trapped, and punished or threatened with \npunishment before they even have offended the authorities.\n  The AMT/ISO interaction would be one that Kafka would appreciate. In \nthe case of ISOs an employee who receives ISOs as an incentive can be \ntaxed on the phantom paper gains the tax code deems to exist when he or \nshe exercises an option, and be required to pay the AMT tax on these \n``gains'' even if the ``gains'' do not, in fact, exist when the tax is \npaid. This means the taxpayer may have no gains, no profits or assets, \nwith which to pay the AMT and might even have to borrow funds to pay \nthe tax or even go into default on his or her AMT liability.\n  This Kafkaesque situation is unfair. It is not fair to impose tax on \n``income'' or ``gains'' unless the income or gains exist. With the AMT \ntax on ISOs, it is not relevant if the ``gains'' exist in a financial \nsense. That they exist on paper is sufficient to trigger the tax.\n  This situation is also inconsistent with many well-established \nFederal Government policies. For example, our country favors stock \noptions as an incentive for hard-working and productive employees of \nentrepreneurial companies. In most cases, entrepreneurs take enormous \nrisks, receive less compensation than employees working for established \ncompanies, and have no company-sponsored pension plan. In addition, our \ncountry favors employee-ownership of firms. This ownership gives these \nemployees a huge stake in the success of the company and motivates them \nto dedicate themselves to the firm's success. Finally, our country also \nfavors long-term investments that generate growth. We know that growth \nis most likely to arise when entrepreneurs take risks over the long-\nterm and build fundamental value for their companies and shareholders \nand owners. The policy favoring long-term investments is reflected in \nthe fact that capital gains incentives are available only if an \ninvestment is held for at least one year. An investment sold before the \nend of this ``holding period'' receives no capital gains benefit. The \napplication of the AMT to ISOs is inconsistent with all three of these \npublic policies.\n  Let me explain the difference between ISOs and NSOs. Incentive stock \noptions are sanctioned by the Internal Revenue code. Under current law \nthe employee pays no tax when he or she exercises the option and buys \nthe company's shares at the stock option price. The company receives no \ntax deduction\n\n[[Page S7198]]\n\non the spread, the difference between the option price and the market \nprice of the stock. If the employee holds the stock for two years after \nthe grant of the option and one year after the exercise of the option, \nhe or she pays the capital gains tax on the difference between the \nexercise and sale price on the sale of the stock. The tax payment is \ndeferred until the stock is sold and the tax is paid on the real gains \nthat are realized from the sale.\n  NSOs are stock options that do not satisfy the tax code requirements \nfor ISOs. They are ``non-qualifying stock options'' or NSOs. With NSOs \nthe employee is taxed immediately when the option is exercised on the \nspread between the grant and exercised price. This forces an employee \nto sell stock as soon as he or she exercise their options so that they \ncan pay the tax on the spread. This is a zero sum game for the \nemployee, selling the stock he or she has just bought to pay a tax on \nthe spread. Even worse, because the stock is not ``held'' for one year, \nthis tax is paid at the ordinary income tax rates, not the preferential \ncapital gains tax rates. The company receives a business expense \ndeduction on the spread.\n  If this were the whole story, it is clear that companies would tend \nto offer ISOs rather than NSOs to their employees. Employees would be \nencouraged to hold their shares for at least a year after the option is \nexercised, which helps to bind them to the company. They would then \nqualify for capital gains tax rates on the realized gains.\n  The problem is that ISOs come with a major liability, the application \nof the Alternative Minimum Tax, AMT, to the spread at the time of \nexercise. This tax is due to be paid even if the stock is held for the \nrequired period and even if the stock is eventually sold at a fraction \nof its value at the time the option is exercised. This tax at the time \nof exercise is inconsistent with the rule that applies to all other \ncapital gains transactions, where the tax is paid when the gains are \n``realized,'' when the investment is sold with gains or losses. This \ntax at the time of exercise defeats the purpose of ISOs, forces \nemployees to sell their stock, to pay the AMT tax, before the end of \nthe holding period, and pay ordinary income tax rates. The difference \nbetween ordinary income tax rates and capital gains tax rates can be 15 \npercent or more.\n  The AMT tax is imposed on the spread at the time the option is \nexercised and it is irrelevant if the stock price at the time when the \nAMT tax is paid or when the stock is sold is a fraction of this price. \nThe ``gains'' at the time of exercise are what count, not real gains in \na financial sense when the investment is finally sold.\n  The application of the AMT at the time of exercise to ISOs is a major \ndisincentive for companies to offer ISOs to their employees. The \npurpose of the ISO law when it was enacted by Congress back in 1981 was \nto encourage long-term holdings of the stock. This purpose is defeated \nby the AMT application at the time of exercise. Even if firms could \neducate their employees about the AMT liability, the fact that this tax \nis imposed at the time of exercise on phantom gains would remain a \nmajor disincentive for them to offer ISOs. The risks are too great that \nthe employee will have no real gains with which to pay the tax, that \nemployee will have to sell stock immediately at ordinary income tax \nrates to make sure that funds are available to pay the tax when it is \ndue, or take the risk of holding the stock.\n\n  My understanding is that the firms that are most likely to grant ISOs \nare those firms that have no ability to use the corporate deduction \nthat is available for NSOs. These are small firms with no tax liability \nfor which the deduction is simply a tax loss carryforward with no \ncurrent year value. With these firms the ISO held out the possibility \nof the employees receiving capital gains tax treatment of their gains. \nIt is particularly sad that it is these firms and these employees which \nare feeling the brunt of the AMT/ISO problem.\n  The application of the AMT to ISOs is strange because long-term \nholdings of stock, as required by the ISO law, are classic capital \ngains transactions and we do not apply the AMT to the tax benefit \nconferred by the capital gains tax. Under the AMT only ``tax preference \nitems'' enumerated in the AMT are included when the AMT calculation is \nmade. The capital gains differential, the difference between the \nordinary tax rate on income and the lower capital gains rate, is a tax \nbenefit but that differential is not included in the AMT. Given all the \nproblems we are now seeing with the AMT the capital gains differential \nshould not be included as a preference item. But, by an accident of \nhistory, the AMT is still applied to ISOs. This makes no sense and it \nis an anomaly in the tax code. When the Congress restored the capital \ngains differential, and did not include it as an AMT tax preference \nitem, we should have enacted a conforming amendment regarding the AMT \nand ISOs. We didn't, and we should do so now.\n  With the AMT applied to ISOs, taxpayers are caught in a Catch-22 \nsituation. If they hold the stock for the required year, they can \nqualify for capital gains treatment on the eventual sale of the stock. \nBut, in doing so they are taking a huge risk that the AMT tax bill will \nexceed the value of the stock when the AMT is paid. If the tax is too \nlarge, they may have to sell their stock before the capital gains \nholding period has run and pay ordinary income tax rates on any gains. \nThis is a form of lottery that serves no public policy.\n  The AMT was created to ensure the rich cannot use tax shelters to \navoid paying their ``fair share.'' Taxpayers are supposed to calculate \nboth their regular tax and the AMT bill, then pay whichever is higher. \nThe AMT is likely to snare 1.5 million taxpayers this year and nearly \n36 million by 2010. But the case with ISOs is one where the taxpayers \nmay never see the ``gains,'' and noneless owe a tax on them. Whatever \nthe merits might be for the AMT for taxpayers with real gains, they \nhave no bearing on taxpayers who may never see the gains. It is simply \nunfair to impose a tax on gains that exist only on paper. If the \nemployee does realize gains, they should and will pay tax on them, but \nonly if and when the gains are realized.\n  Of course, with the recent huge drop in values for some stocks, many \nentrepreneurs are now being hit with immense AMT tax bills on the paper \ngains on stocks that are now worth a fraction of the price at the time \nof exercise. At a townhall meeting held in California by Representative \nLofgren and Representative Bob Matsui, Kathy Swartz, a Mountain View \nwoman, six months pregnant and soon to sell her ``dream house'' because \nshe and her husband Karl owe $2.4 million in AMT, asked, ``How many \nvictims do you need before you say it's horrible?'' We are talking \nabout taxpayers who in fact owe five- to seven-figure tax bills on \ngains they never realized.\n  My bill would change those tax rules so that the AMT no longer \napplies to ISOs and no tax is owed at the time when the entrepreneur \nexercises the option. This change would eliminate the unfair taxation \nof paper gains on ISOs. This would encourage long-term holdings of \nstock, not immediate sale of the stock as a hedge against AMT tax \nliability. It would do nothing to exempt entrepreneurs from paying tax \non their real gains when they eventually sell the stock.\n  My bill would solve this problem going forward. It would not, as \ndrafted, provide relief to the taxpayers who already have been hit with \nAMT taxes on phantom gains. There is a bipartisan group in the House \nand Senate focusing on this group of taxpayers. This group has a strong \nclaim for relief based on the inherent unfairness of the AMT as applied \nto ISOs. The unfairness of this law leads me to call for reform going \nforward should be remedied for current, as well as future taxpayers.\n  Let me be clear about the cost and budget implications of my bill. \nThe Joint Tax Committee on Taxation has found that my proposal would \nreduce government tax revenues by $12.412 billion over ten years. I am \npuzzled by this estimate, but there is no way for me to appeal it. The \nJTC does not provide explanations for its estimates, but I would assume \nthat this estimate is based on the likelihood that there would be fewer \ntax payments at the time options are exercised as firms move from NSOs \nto ISOs, those employees with ISOs would not be paying the AMT, and \nthere will be more employees who hold the stock and pay capital gains \ntax rates. Offsetting this,\n\n[[Page S7199]]\n\nthere will be fewer companies taking the deduction for NSOs. The \nrevenue loss year-by-year is as follows: --$1.821 billion (2002), --\n$1.126 (2003), --$858 (2004), --$825 (2005), --$941 (2006), --$1.106 \n(2007), --$1.341 (2009), --$1.620 (2010), and $1.910 (2011). The loss \nduring the 2002-2006 period is --$5.494 billion. I will not propose to \nenact my bill unless this sum is financed and will have no impact on \nthe Federal budget.\n  I am pleased that Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) has introduced legislation \non AMT/ISO in the other body (H.R. 1487). Her bill has attracted a \nbipartisan group of cosponsors. I look forward to working with her and \nother Members to remedy this inequity in the tax code and to do so with \nregard to current as well as future taxpayers.\n  Let me note that I have proposed in S. 798 to provide a special \ncapital gains tax rate, in fact to set a zero tax rate, for stock \npurchased by employees in stock option plans, by investors in Initial \nPublic Offerings, and similar purchases of company treasury stock. This \nzero rate would be effective, however, only if the shares are held for \nat least three years, so the AMT gamble would be even more dramatic. \nDuring the first year of that holding period, the AMT would have to be \npaid and during the remaining period the value of the stock could well \ndive from the exercise price creating an even more invidious trap.\n  Kafka ``The Castle'' should remain as magnificent fiction. We have no \nplace for taxes on phantom income and paper gains. Our taxpayers should \nbe able to communicate effectively with the castle, not be caught in a \nbureaucratic nightmare that makes no sense and serves no policy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 1143. A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint \ncoins in commemoration of former President Ronald Reagan; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the ``Ronald Reagan \nCommemorative Coin Act of 2001.''\n  The bill I am introducing today would accomplish two worthy goals. \nFirst, it would help honor Ronald Reagan, the 40th President of the \nUnited States. Second, it would also help raise much needed resources \nto help families across the United States provide care for their loved \nones who have been stricken by Alzheimer's disease.\n  I believe that a commemorative coin program would honor Ronald \nReagan's life and contributions to our Nation, while also raising funds \nto help American families in their day to day struggle against this \nterrible disease.\n  This legislation's worthiness and timeliness were underscored just \nlast night when ABC televised a powerful program in which Diane Sawyer \ninterviewed Nancy Reagan. Watching Mrs. Reagan as she so openly and \neloquently shared touching insights about their ongoing struggle with \nAlzheimer's disease was moving. There is no doubt about the truly deep \nbonds that unite Ronald and Nancy Reagan and that we need to do what we \ncan to fight the disease that has slowly taken its terrible toll on the \nReagans and so many other American families.\n  Ronald Reagan has worn many hats in his life, including endeavors as \na sports announcer, actor, governor and President of the United States. \nHe was first elected president in 1980 and served two terms, becoming \nthe first president to serve two full terms since Dwight Eisenhower.\n  Ronald Reagan's boundless optimism and deep-seated belief in the \npeople of the United States and the American Dream helped restore our \nNation's pride in itself and brought about a new ``Morning in \nAmerica.'' His challenge to Gorbachev to ``tear down this wall,'' his \nsuccessful revival of our economic power, his determination to rebuild \nour armed forces in order to contain the spread of communism, and his \ninternational summitry skills as seen at Reykjavik, Iceland, combined \nto help bring an end to the Cold War. Ronald Reagan left our Nation in \nmuch better shape than it was when he took office.\n  As Alzheimer's sets in, brain cells gradually deteriorate and die. \nPeople afflicted by the disease gradually lose their cognitive ability. \nPatients eventually become completely helpless and dependent on those \naround them for even the most basic daily needs. Each of the millions \nof Americans who is now affected will eventually, barring new \ndiscoveries in treatment, lose their ability to remember recent and \npast events, family and friends, even simple things like how to take a \nbath or turn on lights. Ronald Reagan, one of the most courageous and \noptimistic Presidents in American history, is no exception.\n  Shortly after being shot in an assassination attempt, Ronald Reagan's \ncourage and good humor in the face of a life threatening situation were \nevident when he famously apologized to his wife Nancy saying ``Sorry \nhoney. I forgot to duck.'' Unfortunately, once Alzheimer's disease \ntakes hold, it delivers a slow mind destroying bullet that none of us \ncan duck to avoid. As Ronald Reagan wrote shortly after learning of his \ndiagnosis ``I only wish there was some way I could spare Nancy from \nthis painful experience.'' From the moment of diagnosis, it's ``a truly \nlong, long, goodbye,'' Nancy Reagan said.\n  Fortunately for all of us, when Ronald Reagan courageously announced \nin such an honest and public manner that he had Alzheimer's, rather \nthan covering it up, he did a great deal to help alleviate the negative \nstigma that has long faced those suffering from this terrible disease. \nMuch of the shame and pity traditionally associated with Alzheimer's \nwas transformed almost overnight into sympathy and understanding as \npublic awareness suddenly shot up and those suffering from Alzheimer's, \nand their families, knew that they were not alone.\n\n  While Ronald Reagan's health didn't deteriorate right away, according \nto Mrs. Reagan, he had his good days and bad days, ``just like \neverybody else.'' In recent years, however, Reagan's condition has \ncompletely deteriorated. ``It's frightening and it's cruel,'' Nancy \nsaid, speaking of the disease and what it has done to her husband and \nfamily. ``It's sad to see somebody you love and have been married to \nfor so long, with Alzheimer's, and you can't share memories,'' Mrs. \nReagan said.\n  In the introduction to a recently released book based on the touching \nlove letters exchanged between herself and Reagan, Nancy elaborated on \nher sense of loss when she wrote, ``You know that it's a progressive \ndisease and that there's no place to go but down, no light at the end \nof the tunnel. You get tired and frustrated, because you have no \ncontrol and you feel helpless.'' She also said, ``There are so many \nmemories that I can no longer share, which makes it very difficult.''\n  Nancy Reagan has earned our Nation's admiration for her steadfast and \nloving dedication to her husband as she has watched her beloved husband \nslowly fade away. Likewise, families all across our Nation, day in and \nday out, choose to personally provide care for their loved ones \nsuffering from Alzheimer's, rather than putting them in institutions. \nThey deserve our respect and support.\n  Fortunately, Nancy Reagan has had access to vital resources that help \nher care for her husband. This is how it should be. Unfortunately, \nthere are many American families out there who do not have access to \nthese resources. This bill will help alleviate that by raising money to \nhelp American families who are struggling while providing care for \ntheir loved ones.\n  Fortunately, funding for Alzheimer's research has increased \nsignificantly over the past several years. Ronald Reagan's courage in \ncoming forward and publically announcing his condition played an \nimportant role in raising public awareness of Alzheimer's and paved the \nway for the recent increases in research funding. This bill would \ncomplement these efforts.\n  Once again, the legislation I am introducing today authorizes the \nU.S. Mint to produce commemorative coins honoring Ronald Reagan while \nraising funds to help families care for their family members suffering \nfrom Alzheimer's disease. I urge my colleagues to support passage of \nthis legislation.\n  Ronald Reagan's eternal optimism and deep seated belief in an even \nbetter future for our Nation was underscored when he said, ``I know \nthat for America, there will always be a bright future ahead.'' This \nbill, in keeping with this quote's spirit, will help provide for a \nbetter future for many American families.\n\n[[Page S7200]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1143\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title III of the Stewart B. McKinney \nHomeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11331 ed seq.) to reauthorize the \nFederal Emergency Management Food and Shelter Program, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that will \nre-authorize a small but highly effective program, the Emergency Food \nand Shelter Program, or EFS for short. The EFS program, which is \nadministered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, supplements \ncommunity efforts to meet the needs of the homeless and hungry in all \nfifty States. I am very pleased that my colleagues on the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs, Senators Collins, Levin, Durbin, and Akaka, are \njoining me as original co-sponsors of this legislation. Our committee \nhas jurisdiction over the EFS program, and it is my hope that together \nwe can generate even more bipartisan support for a program that makes a \nreal difference with its tiny budget. The EFS program is a great help \nnot only to the Nation's homeless population but also to working people \nwho are trying to feed and shelter their families at entry-level wages. \nServices supplemented by the EFS funding, such as food banks and \nemergency rent/utility assistance programs, are especially helpful to \nfamilies with big responsibilities but small paychecks.\n  One of the things that distinguishes the EFS program is the extent to \nwhich it relies on non-profit organizations. Local boards in counties, \nparishes, and municipalities across the country advertise the \navailability of funds, decide on non-profit and local government \nagencies to be funded, and monitor the recipient agencies. The local \nboards, like the program's National Board, are made up of charitable \norganizations including the National Council of Churches, the United \nJewish Communities, Catholic Charities, USA, the Salvation Army, and \nthe American Red Cross. By relying on community participation, the \nprogram keeps administrative overhead to an unusually low amount, less \nthan 3 percent.\n  The EFS program has operated without authorization since 1994 but has \nbeen sustained by annual appropriations. The proposed bill will re-\nauthorize the program for the next three years.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe work opportunity credit to encourage the hiring of certain \nveterans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation to help the \nestimated 1.5 million veterans who are now living in poverty by giving \na tax credit to those employers who hire them and put them on the road \nto financial independence. This idea was proposed and is supported by \nthe National Coalition for Homeless Veterans and the Non-Commissioned \nOfficers Association.\n  This legislation is based upon the current tax credit offered for \nemployers who hire those coming off welfare. Veterans groups tell me \nthat the current tax credit is underutilized by veterans because many \nare not receiving food stamps or are not on welfare. Because the bill I \nam introducing today bases eligibility on the poverty level, more \nveterans will be able to benefit from this credit.\n  My bill would allow employers to receive a hiring tax credit of 50 \npercent of the veteran's first year wages and a retention credit of 25 \npercent of the veteran's second year wages. Only the first $20,000 of \nwages per year will count toward the credit.\n  I offered this legislation as an amendment to the tax bill. While my \namendment failed on a procedural vote, 49-50, opponents indicated that \nenacting this legislation would be a good thing to do. This being the \ncase, I am hopeful that the Senate will take up and pass the bill I am \nintroducing today in a bipartisan manner. It is the least we can do for \nour veterans who so bravely served our Nation and deserve our help.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1145\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Act of March 3, 1875, to permit the \nState of Colorado to use land held in trust by the State as open space; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nfulfill the wishes of my fellow Coloradans to allow the State to \nprotect 300,000 acres of State land as open space.\n  The origins of this issue date back to 1875 when Congress passed the \nlegislation which authorized the Territory of Colorado to form a \nconstitution, State government and be admitted into the Union. The 1875 \nEnabling Act established that Sections 16 and 36 of each township in \nthe new State would be ``granted to said State for the support of \ncommon schools.'' The Federal directive to the State was clear: provide \na sound financial basis for the long-term benefit of public schools. \nThe Colorado State Constitution further strengthened this position and \nrequired that the new State Board of Land Commissioners manage its land \nholdings ``in such a matter as will secure the maximum possible \namount'' for the public school fund.\n  Today, there are some three million surface acres of State trust \nlands which are leased for ranching, farming, oil and gas production \nand other uses. Some of these lands are the most beautiful parcels in \nthe state and offer a tremendous natural resource.\n  Through the years, the lands have been a reliable, but a dwindling \nsource of funds to the overall education budget. Currently, the State \nof Colorado spends approximately $3.5 billion annually on public \nschools, of this amount revenues from State trust lands account for \nabout $22 million.\n  Now, however, Coloradans priorities have changed, including a strong \ndesire to protect open space and the environment. These changes became \nevident in a 1996 voter approved State Constitutional Amendment which \ngave more flexibility in the management of the trust lands. Among other \nthings, the Amendment established a 300,000 acre Stewardship Trust. The \nvoters recognized that certain State trust lands may be more valuable \nin the future if they are kept in the trust land portfolio rather than \ndisposed of for a short term financial gains. The lands in the new \nStewardship Trust will be managed ``to maximize options for continued \nstewardship, public use or future disposition'' by protecting and \nenhancing the ``beauty, natural values, open space and wildlife \nhabitat'' on these parcels. Further, it struck the provision requiring \n``maximizing revenue'' and replaced it with a requirement that the land \nboard to manage its land holdings ``in order to produce reasonable and \nconsistent income over time.''\n\n[[Page S7202]]\n\n  While the Amendment has withstood court challenges, it still remains \nthat the Stewardship Trust could, in the future, cause a breach of the \nEnabling Act. In order to correct this potential breach, I am \nintroducing this legislation with the full support of the State of \nColorado to ensure that the wishes of the voters are upheld and the \nStewardship Trust is fully implemented. There are two key points of the \nlegislation. First, the bill allows 300,000 acres of state trust lands \nto be used for open space, wildlife habitat, scenic value or other \nnatural value. Second, it exempts these lands from the requirement that \nthey generate income for the common schools.\n  The Colorado State Land Board has a clear mission for implementing \nthe Stewardship Trust: to protect the crown jewels of the state trust \nlands and ensure that these lands receive special protection from sale \nor development.\n  It is also clear that Colorado voters wanted to set aside 300,000 \nacres from potential development. I want to help the State fulfill \nthese goals.\n  This is a unique bill and ensures the state's flexibility in managing \nthe trust lands. It does not change the intent of the Stewardship \nTrust, just ensures that the Enabling Act and the State Constitution \nare consistent.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                                S. 1146\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. COLORADO TRUST LAND.\n\n       Section 7 of the Act of March 3, 1875 (18 Stat. 475, \n     chapter 139) (commonly known as the ``Colorado Enabling \n     Act''), is amended by inserting before the period at the end \n     the following: ``and for use for open space, wildlife \n     habitat, scenic value, or other natural value, regardless of \n     whether the land generates income for the common schools as \n     described under section 14, except that the amount of land \n     used for natural value shall not exceed 300,000 acres''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NICKLES:\n  S. 1147. A bill to amend title X and title XI of the Energy Policy \nAct of 1992; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nthe Thorium Remediation Reauthorization Act of 2001. This bill will \nprovide authorization for the Federal Government to pay its share of \ndecommissioning and remediation costs for a thorium facility in West \nChicago, Illinois. In a DOE proceeding, it was determined that the \ngovernment is responsible for 55.2 percent of all West Chicago cleanup \ncosts because 55.2 percent of West Chicago tailings resulted from \nFederal contracts. Under Title X of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 \n(``EPACT''), the thorium licensee pays for all West Chicago cleanup \ncosts, and is then reimbursed, though annual appropriations, the \ngovernment's share of those costs.\n  There is already more than a $60 million shortage in authorized \nfunding for the Federal share of West Chicago cleanup costs. Despite \nthat, the thorium licensee has continued to pay all decommissioning \ncosts at the West Chicago factory site, as well as remediation costs at \nvicinity properties known as Reed-Keppler Park, Residential Properties, \nand Kress Creek. Remediation of Reed-Keppler Park was finished late \nlast year and remediation of more than 600 Residential Properties is \nexpected to be substantially complete by the end of this year. \nDecommissioning of the factory site, with the exception of groundwater, \nis expected to conclude in 2004. Cleanup requirements at Kress Creek \nhave not been determined, and until those are established, the costs \nassociated with the cleanup of that vicinity property cannot be \naccurately projected.\n  The significant costs associated with the West Chicago cleanup are a \nresult, in large part, of extensive government use of the facility \nduring the development of our country's nuclear defense program, \nincluding the Manhattan project. With the exception of Kress Creek and \ngroundwater, total cleanup costs at the factory site and all vicinity \nproperties can now be estimated with reasonable certainty. The $123 \nmillion authorized by this bill will permit the government to begin \nreimbursing the amount it is already in arrears to the thorium \nlicensee. It also will provide the authorization necessary for the \ngovernment to pay its share of costs, excluding costs for Kress Creek \nand for groundwater, that will be incurred by the licensee through \ncompletion of West Chicago cleanup.\n  Funding for this reauthorization would come from the General \nTreasury. Thus, this legislation will not diminish the availability of \nfunds in the DOE's Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund, from which \nboth Title X uranium licensees and the DOE's gaseous diffusion plants \nreceive funding.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1147\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to convey the Lower Yellowstone Irrigation Project, \nthe Savage Unit of the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program, and the \nIntake Irrigation Project to the appurtenant irrigation districts; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a piece of \nlegislation that helps a large number of family farmers on the border \nof Montana and North Dakota. The Lower Yellowstone Irrigation Projects \nTitle Transfer moves ownership of these irrigation projects from \nFederal control to local control. Both the Bureau of Reclamation and \nthose relying on the projects for their livelihood agree there is \nlittle value in having the Federal Government retain ownership.\n  I introduced this legislation in the last Congress, and continue to \nbelieve it helps us to achieve the long term goals of Montana \nirrigators, and the mission of the Bureau of Reclamation. Just this \nweek I attended the confirmation hearing of John W. Keys, III, who is \nthe designate for Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation. I asked \nhis position on title transfers of irrigation projects like the Lower \nYellowstone, where local irrigation districts have successfully managed \nthe Federal properties, and where the Bureau has encouraged the \ntransfer of title to the Districts. His response to me was very \nencouraging. He stated this type of title transfer ``makes sense and is \nan opportunity to move facilities from Federal ownership to more \nappropriate control.'' He has promised to work with me and the \nIrrigation District to make this a reality, and I look forward to it.\n  The history of these projects dates to the early 1900's with the \noriginal Lower Yellowstone project being built by the Bureau of \nReclamation between 1906 and 1910. The Savage Unit was added in 1947-\n48. The end result was the creation of fertile, irrigated land to help \nspur economic development in the area. To this day, agriculture is the \nnumber one industry in the area.\n  The local impact of the projects is measurable in numbers, but the \ngreatest impacts can only be seen by visiting the area. About 500 \nfamily farms rely on these projects for economic substance, and the \nentire area relies on them to create stability in the local economy. In \nan area that has seen booms and busts in oil, gas, and other \ncommodities, these irrigated lands continued producing and offering a \nfoundation for the businesses in the area.\n  As we all know, the agricultural economy is not as strong as we'd \nlike it to be, but these irrigated lands offer a reasonable return over \ntime and are the foundation for strong communities based upon the \nideals that have made this country successful. The 500 families \nimpacted are hard working, honest producers, and I can think of no \nbetter people to manage their own irrigation projects.\n\n[[Page S7203]]\n\n  Every day, we see an example of where the Federal Government is \ntaking on a new task. We can debate the merits of these efforts on an \nindividual basis, but I think we can all agree that while the \ngovernment gets involved in new projects there are many that we can \nsafely pass on to state or local control. The Lower Yellowstone \nProjects are a prime example of such an opportunity, and I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in seeing this legislation passed as quickly as \npossible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire:\n  S. 1150. A bill to waive tolls on the Interstate System during peak \nholiday travel periods; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the \nInterstate Highway System Toll-Free Holiday Act.\n  As we move into this Fourth of July holiday to celebrate our nation's \n225th birthday, many will do so in true American fashion by loading up \nthe kids and the dog in the family car and heading out for a fun \nholiday vacation. Unfortunately, many of those family trips will \nquickly turn into frustration. Just as you get on the road and begin \nthat family outing, you are greeted by a screeching halt, faced with \nwhat seems to be an endless line that is not moving. Soon, the kids \nwill grow restless and angry. You've just reached the end of the line \nof the first toll booth and the delay and frustration begins. Of \ncourse, when you do finally make it to the booth, they take your money. \nEvery holiday, no exception. I want to help make those holiday driving \nvacations more enjoyable by removing that toll booth frustration. My \nlegislation will provide the much deserved relief from all of that \nholiday grief.\n  The Interstate Highway System Toll-Free Holiday Act provides that no \ntolls will be collected and no vehicles will be stopped at toll booths \non the Interstate System during peak holiday travel periods. The exact \nduration of the toll waivers will be left to the States to determine, \nbut will include, at a minimum, the entire 24 hour period of each legal \nFederal holiday. The bill will also authorize the Secretary of \nTransportation to reimburse the State, at the State's request, for lost \ntoll revenues out of the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded by the tax \nthat we all pay when we purchase gas for our cars. I want to keep the \nState highway funds whole, and, at the same time, provide relief to all \nthose who simply want a hassle-free holiday trip.\n  There are currently some 2,200 miles of toll facilities on the 42,800 \nmile Interstate System. On peak holiday travel days, traffic increases \nup to 50 percent over a typical weekday. In New Hampshire last year, \nthe I-95 Hampton toll booth had a 10 percent average increase in \ntraffic over the four-day Fourth of July weekend compared to the \nprevious weekend. That is equivalent to an additional 8,000 vehicles \npassing through this one toll booth every day. That increase in volume \nat the toll sites is not only an inconvenience in time and money, but \nalso adds to safety concerns and, because vehicle emissions are higher \nwhen idling, air quality suffers. I am pleased that this bill will \nalleviate the headaches and problems associated with increased toll \nbooth traffic on holidays.\n  This is just one of what will be a series of bills that I will be \nintroducing, as the Ranking Member of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, to address transportation needs in New Hampshire and across \nthe Nation, as we prepare for the reauthorization of the next major \ncomprehensive highway bill in 2003.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1150\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

WAIVER OF TOLLS ON THE INTERSTATE SYSTEM DURING PEAK \n                   HOLIDAY TRAVEL PERIODS.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section, the terms ``Interstate \n     System'', ``public authority'', ``Secretary'', ``State'', and \n     ``State transportation department'' have the meanings given \n     the terms in section 101(a) of title 23, United States Code.\n       (b) Waiver.--\n       (1) In general.--No tolls shall be collected, and no \n     vehicle shall be required to stop at a toll booth, for any \n     toll highway, bridge, or tunnel on the Interstate System \n     during any peak holiday travel period determined under \n     paragraph (2).\n       (2) Peak holiday travel periods.--For the purposes of \n     paragraph (1), the State transportation department or the \n     public authority having jurisdiction over the toll highway, \n     bridge, or tunnel shall determine the number and duration of \n     peak holiday travel periods, which shall include, at a \n     minimum, the 24-hour period of each legal public holiday \n     specified in section 6103(a) of title 5, United States Code.\n       (c) Federal Reimbursement.--\n       (1) In general.--For each fiscal year, upon request by a \n     State or public authority and approval by the Secretary, the \n     Secretary shall reimburse the State or public authority for \n     the amount of toll revenue not collected by reason of \n     subsection (b).\n       (2) Requests for reimbursement.--On or before September 30 \n     of a fiscal year, each State or public authority that desires \n     a refund described in paragraph (1) shall submit to the \n     Secretary a request for reimbursement, based on actual \n     traffic data, for the amount of toll revenue not collected by \n     reason of subsection (b) during the fiscal year.\n       (3) Use of reimbursed funds.--A request for reimbursement \n     under paragraph (2) shall include a certification by the \n     State or public authority that the amount of the \n     reimbursement will be used only for debt service or for \n     operation and maintenance of the toll facility, including \n     reconstruction, resurfacing, restoration, and rehabilitation.\n       (4) Authorization of appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated from the Highway Trust Fund (other than \n     the Mass Transit Account) such sums as are necessary to carry \n     out this subsection.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 1151. A bill to amend the method for achieving quiet technology \nspecified in the National Parks Air Tour Management Act of 2000; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today along with my good friend and \ncolleague from Nevada, Senator Ensign because I am deeply concerned \nthat the Federal Aviation Administration has failed to develop the \nincentives for quiet technology aircraft.\n  The bill we are introducing today, the ``Grand Canyon Quiet \nTechnology Implementation Act,'' completes the Congressional mandates \ncontained in the National Park Air Tour Management Act of 2000 which \ncalled for the implementation of ``reasonably achievable'' quiet \ntechnology standards for the Grand Canyon air tour operators.\n  Key provisions of the Act called for the Federal Aviation \nAdministration, by April 5th of this year, to: 1. Designate reasonably \nachievable requirements for fixed-wing and helicopter aircraft \nnecessary for such aircraft to be considered as employing quiet \naircraft technology; and 2. establish corridors for commercial air tour \noperations by fixed-wing and helicopter aircraft that employ quiet \naircraft technology, or explain to Congress why they can't. The agency \nhas failed to comply with any of these provisions.\n  The Act also provides that operators employing quiet technology shall \nbe exempted from operational flight caps. This relief is essential to \nthe very survival of many of these air tour companies. By not complying \nwith these Congressional mandates, the Federal Aviation Administration \nplaces the viability of the Grand Canyon air tour industry in jeopardy.\n  While Senator Ensign and I along with the air tour community have \nsought to work with the Federal agencies in a cooperative manner, our \nrepeated overtures have been summarily ignored, which forces us to take \nfurther legislative action.\n  Our bill simply requires the Federal Aviation Administration to do \nits job. It identifies ``reasonably achievable'' quiet technology \nstandards and provides relief for air tour operators who have spent \nmany years and millions of dollars of their money voluntarily \ntransitioning to quieter aircraft to help restore natural quiet to the \nGrand Canyon.\n  I would like to compliment my good friend from Arizona, Senator John \nMcCain for his vision and leadership in the Senate in recognizing that \nquieter aircraft was the key to restoring natural quiet to the Grand \nCanyon. During his tenure as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, \nit was Senator McCain who insisted on the quiet technology provisions \ncontained in the National Park Air Tour Management Act\n\n[[Page S7204]]\n\nof 2000. It was Senator McCain who wanted to ensure that those air tour \ncompanies which already have made huge investments in current \ntechnology quiet aircraft modifications were rewarded for their \ninitiative. It was Senator McCain, an advocate for restoring natural \nquiet to the Grand Canyon, who took the lead in seeking to ensure that \nthe elderly, disabled and time-constrained visitor still would be able \nto enjoy the magnificence of the Grand Canyon by air. The legislation \nwe are introducing today, supports Senator McCain's vision.\n  The National Park Air Tour Management Act of 2000 is clear. It calls \nfor the implementation of ``reasonably achievable'' quiet technology \nincentives. Our Grand Canyon Quiet Technology Implementation \nlegislation is based on today's best aircraft technology.\n  Some may ask what is ``reasonably achievable?'' It constitutes the \nfollowing: replacing smaller aircraft with larger and quieter aircraft \nwith more seating capacity reducing the number of flights needed to \ncarry the same number of passengers; adding propellers on turbine-\npowered airplanes or main rotor blades on helicopters which reduces \nprop tip speeds by reducing engine RPMs; modifying engine exhaust \nsystems with high-tech mufflers to absorb engine noise; modifying \nhelicopter tail rotors with high-tech components for quieter operation.\n  These modifications typically reduce the sound generated by these \naircraft by more than 50 percent.\n  This is what is ``reasonably achievable'' in aviation technology. In \nthe year 2001, this is essentially all that can be done to make \naircraft quieter. Operators which have spent millions of dollars to \nmake these modifications, in our view, have complied with the intent of \nthe law and deserve relief.\n  Let us not forget the original intent of this legislation to help \nrestore natural quiet to the Grand Canyon and, as the 1916 Organic Act \ndirects, to provide for the enjoyment of our national parks ``in such \nmanner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the \nenjoyment of future generations.''\n  Air touring is consistent with the Park Service mission.\n  Based on current air tour restrictions, more than 1.7 million \ntourists will be denied access to the Grand Canyon during the next \ndecade at a cost to air tour operators conservatively estimated at $250 \nmillion.\n  Senator Ensign and I agree that, to the extent possible and \npractical, that the quieter these air tour aircraft can be made to be, \nthe better for everyone. That's why it is so important that the Grand \nCanyon Quiet Technology Implementation Act become the law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Grand Canyon Quiet \nTechnology Implementation Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1151\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Food Security Act of 1985 to establish a \ngrassland reserve program to assist owners in restoring and protecting \ngrassland; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Grassland \nReserve Act'', a bill to authorize a voluntary program to purchase \npermanent or 30 year easement from willing producers in exchange for \nprotection of ranches, grasslands, and lands of high resource value. I \nam pleased that Senators Feingold, and Thomas, have joined as original \ncosponsors.\n  Grasslands provided critical habitat for complex plant and animal \ncommunities throughout much of North America. However, many of these \nlands have been, and are under pressure to be, converted to other uses, \nthreatening and eliminating plant and animal communities unique to this \ncontinent. A significant portion of the remaining grasslands occur on \nworking ranches. Ranchland provides important open-space buffers for \nanimal and plant habitat. Moreover, ranching forms the economic \nbackbone for much of rural western United States. Loss of this economic \nactivity will invariably lead to the loss of the open space that is \nindispensable for plant and animal communities and for citizens who \nlove the western style of life.\n  As a rancher from a rural community in Idaho, I have noticed the \nchanges taking place in some parts of my State where, for a number of \nreasons, working ranchers have been sold into ranchetts leaving the \nlandscape divided by fences and homes where cattle and wildlife once \nroamed. Currently, no Federal programs exist to conserve grasslands, \nranches, and other lands of high resource values, other than wetlands, \non a national scale. I believe the United States needs a voluntary \nprogram to conserve these lands, and the Grasslands Reserve Act does \njust that.\n  Specifically, this bill establishes the Grasslands Reserve program \nthrough the Natural Resources Conservation Service to assist owners in \nrestoring and conserving eligible land. To be eligible to participate \nin the program an owner must enroll 100 contiguous acres of land west \nof the 90th meridian or 50 contiguous acres of land east of the 90th \nmeridian. A maximum of 1,000,000 acres may be enrolled in the program \nin the form of a permanent or a 30-year easement. Land eligible for the \nprogram includes: native grasslands,\n\n[[Page S7205]]\n\nworking ranches, other areas that contain animal or plant populations \nof significant ecological value, and land that is necessary for the \nefficient administration of the easement.\n  The terms of the easements allow for grazing in a manner consistent \nwith maintaining the viability of native grass species. All uses other \nthan grazing, such as hay production, may be implemented according to \nthe terms of a written agreement between the landowner and easement \nholder. Easements prohibit the production of row crops, and other \nactivities that disturb the surface of the land covered by the \neasement. The Secretary will work with the State technical committees \nto establish criteria to evaluate and rank applications for easements \nwhich will emphasize support for grazing operations, plant and animal \nbiodiversity, and native grass and shrubland under the greatest threat \nof conversion. The Secretary may prescribe terms to the easement \noutlining how the land shall be restored including duties of the land \nowner and the Secretary. If the easement is violated, the Secretary may \nrequire the owner to refund all or part of the payments including \ninterest. The Secretary may also conduct periodic inspections, after \nproviding notice to the owner, to determine that the landowner is in \ncompliance with the terms of the easement. The easement may be held and \nenforced by a private conservation, land trust organization, or a State \nagency in lieu of the Secretary, if the Secretary determines that \ngranting such permission will promote grassland protection and the \nlandowner agrees.\n  This legislation requires the Secretary to make payments for \npermanent easements based on the fair market value of the land less the \ngrazing value of the land encumbered by the easement, and for 30 year \neasements the payment will be 30 percent of the fair market value of \nthe land less the grazing value of the land encumbered by the easement. \nPayments may be made in one lump sum or over a 10 year period. \nLandowners may also choose to enroll their land in a 30-year rental \nagreement instead of a 30-year easement where the Secretary would make \nthirty annual payments which approximate the value of a lump sum \npayment the owner would receive under a 30-year easement. The Secretary \nis required to assess the payment schedule every five years to make \nsure that the payments do approximate the value of a 30-year easement. \nUSDA is also required to cover up to 75 percent of the cost of \nrestoration and provide owners with technical assistance to execute the \neasement and restore the land.\n  I believe this legislation fills a need we have in our agriculture \npolicy and I look forward to working with other members to include the \nGrasslands Reserve program in a responsible and balanced farm bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my \ncolleague from Idaho to introduce legislation that provides fair \ncompensation to producers and other landowners who maintain open spaces \nfor plants and animals to thrive.\n  This bill creates a voluntary program authorizing the United States \nDepartment of Agriculture, USDA, to obtain either 30-year or permanent \neasements from landowners in exchange for a cash payment. Easements \nallow for grazing while maintaining the viability of native grass \nspecies. Moreover, these uses must only occur upon the conclusion of \nthe local bird nesting season.\n  Vast amounts of grassland are being lost to urban development every \nyear in large part because of economic pressures faced by ranchers, \nlivestock producers, and other grassland owners.\n  Currently, there are no long-term programs to protect grasslands on a \nnational scale. The Grassland Reserve Act provides real options to \nfinancially-strapped land owners of grasslands who wish to keep their \nlands in a natural state. There is a need for this bill because \nexisting programs to protect lands, such as the Forest Legacy program, \ntarget forested lands only.\n  This legislation represents a win-win situation for both the \nenvironment and people who make their livelihood on grasslands. The \nloss of grassland is a serious problem for preserving wildlife habitat \nand a rural way of life. This bill is a step in the right direction to \nprotect these lands from future development.\n  I have always felt that protecting our Nation's unique natural areas, \nincluding grasslands, should be one of our highest priorities. I invite \nmy colleagues to join Senator Craig and me in supporting this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself and Mr. Warner) (by request):\n  S. 1155.

Res. 118\n\n       Whereas American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native \n     Hawaiians were the original inhabitants of the land that now \n     constitutes the United States;\n       Whereas American Indian tribal governments developed the \n     fundamental principles of freedom of speech and separation of \n     powers that form the foundation of the United States \n     Government;\n       Whereas American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native \n     Hawaiians have traditionally exhibited a respect for the \n     finiteness of natural resources through a reverence for the \n     earth;\n       Whereas American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native \n     Hawaiians have served with valor in all of America's wars \n     beginning with the Revolutionary War through the conflict in \n     the Persian Gulf, and often the percentage of American \n     Indians who served exceeded significantly the percentage of \n     American Indians in the population of the United States as a \n     whole;\n       Whereas American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native \n     Hawaiians have made distinct and important contributions to \n     the United States and the rest of the world in many fields, \n     including agriculture, medicine, music, language, and art;\n       Whereas American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native \n     Hawaiians deserve to be recognized for their individual \n     contributions to the United States as local and national \n     leaders, artists, athletes, and scholars;\n       Whereas this recognition will encourage self-esteem, pride, \n     and self-awareness in American Indians, Alaska Natives, and \n     Native Hawaiians of all ages; and\n       Whereas November is a time when many Americans commemorate \n     a special time in the history of the United States when \n     American Indians and English settlers celebrated the bounty \n     of their harvest and the promise of new kinships: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate designates November 2001 as \n     ``National American Indian Heritage Month'' and requests that \n     the President issue a proclamation calling on the Federal \n     Government and State and local governments, interested groups \n     and organizations, and the people of the United States to \n     observe the month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and \n     activities.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, along with thirty of my colleagues today \nI am pleased to introduce a resolution to recount the many \ncontributions American Indians and Alaska Natives have made to this \ngreat Nation and to designate November, 2001, as ``National American \nIndian Heritage Month'' as Congress has done for nearly a decade.\n  American Indians and Alaska Natives have left an indelible imprint on \nmany aspects of our everyday life that most Americans often take for \ngranted. The arts, education, science, the armed forces, medicine, \nindustry, and government are a few of the areas that have been \ninfluenced by American Indian and Alaska Native people over the last \n500 years. In the medical field, many of the healing remedies that we \nuse today were obtained from practices already in use by Indian people \nand are still utilized today in conjunction with western medicine.\n  Many of the basic principles of democracy in our Constitution can be \ntraced to practices and customs already in use by American Indian \ntribal governments including the doctrines of freedom of speech and \nseparation of powers.\n  The respect of Native people for the preservation of natural \nresources, reverence for elders, and adherence to tradition, mirrors \nour own values which we developed in part, through the contact with \nAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives. These values and customs are \ndeeply rooted, strongly embraced and thrive with generation after \ngeneration of Native people.\n  From the difficult days of Valley Forge through our peace keeping \nefforts around the world today, American Indian and Alaska Native \npeople have proudly served and dedicated their lives in the military \nreadiness and defense of our country in wartime and in peace.\n  It is a fact that on a per capita basis, Native participation rate in \nthe Armed Forces outstrips the rates of all other groups in this \nNation. Many American Indian men made the ultimate sacrifice in the \ndefense of this Nation, some even before they were granted citizenship \nin 1924.\n  Many of the words in our language have been borrowed from Native \nlanguages, including many of the names of\n\n[[Page S7258]]\n\nthe rivers, cities, and States across our Nation. Indian arts and \ncrafts have also made a distinct impression on our heritage.\n  It is my hope that by designating the month of November 2001, as \n``National American Indian Heritage Month,'' we will continue to \nencourage self-esteem, pride, and self-awareness amongst American \nIndians and Alaska Natives of all ages.\n  November is a special time in the history of the United States: we \ncelebrate the Thanksgiving holiday by remembering the Indians of the \nNortheast and English settlers as they enjoyed the bounty of their \nharvest and the promise of new kinships.\n  By recognizing the many Native contributions to the arts, governance, \nand culture of our Nation, we will honor their past and ensure a place \nin America for Native people for generations to come. I ask for the \nsupport of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for this \nresolution, and urge the Senate to pass this important matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/29/senate-section/article/S7258-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       SENATE RESOLUTION 119--COMBATING THE GLOBAL AIDS PANDEMIC\n\n  Mr. BAYH (for himself, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Leahy, \nMr. Bingaman, Mr. Lugar, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \nKennedy, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. DeWine, Mr. \nBiden, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Levin, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Specter, Mr. \nTorricelli, Mr. Graham, and Ms. Snowe) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 119\n\n       Whereas the international AIDS pandemic is of grave \n     proportions and is growing;\n       Whereas the epicenter of the AIDS pandemic is sub-Saharan \n     Africa, and incidences of contraction of HIV, AIDS, and \n     related diseases are growing in the Caribbean basin, Russia, \n     China, Southeast Asia, and India at alarming rates;\n       Whereas AIDS pandemic-related statistics are especially \n     staggering in sub-Saharan Africa--\n       (1) the infection rate is 8 times higher than the rest of \n     the world;\n       (2) in the region, over 17,000,000 people have already lost \n     their lives to AIDS or AIDS-related illnesses, with another \n     24,000,000 living with AIDS, according to the World Health \n     Organization and Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS;\n       (3) in many countries in the region, life expectancy will \n     drop by 50 percent over the next decade;\n       (4) more than 12,000,000 African children have lost 1 or \n     both parents to AIDS or AIDS-related illnesses, and that \n     number will grow to more than 35,000,000 by 2010;\n       (5) if current trends continue, 50 percent or more of all \n     15-year olds in the worst affected countries, such as Zambia, \n     South Africa, and Botswana, will die of AIDS or AIDS-related \n     illnesses; and\n       (6) one-quarter of the sub-Saharan African population could \n     die of AIDS or AIDS-related illnesses by 2020, according to \n     the Central Intelligence Agency;\n       Whereas confronting the AIDS pandemic is a moral imperative \n     of the United States and other leading nations of the world;\n       Whereas confronting the AIDS pandemic is in the national \n     interest of the United States, given that 42 percent of \n     United States exports go to the developing world, where the \n     incidence of AIDS is growing most rapidly;\n       Whereas in today's globalized environment, goods, services, \n     people--and disease--are moving at the fastest pace in world \n     history;\n       Whereas we cannot insulate our citizenry from the global \n     AIDS pandemic and related opportunistic disease, and we must \n     provide leadership if we are to reverse global infection \n     rates;\n       Whereas the AIDS pandemic is perhaps the most serious and \n     challenging transnational issue facing the world in the post-\n     Cold War era;\n       Whereas the AIDS pandemic is decimating local skilled \n     workforces, straining fragile governments, diverting national \n     resources, and undermining states' ability to provide for \n     their national defense or international peacekeeping forces;\n       Whereas United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, \n     asserts that between $7,000,000,000 and $10,000,000,000 is \n     needed annually to address the AIDS pandemic, yet current \n     international assistance efforts total roughly a little more \n     than $1,000,000,000 per annum;\n       Whereas the United States has joined the call from the \n     United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, and others in \n     support of a global fund to assist national governments, \n     international organizations, and nongovernmental \n     organizations in the prevention, care, and treatment of AIDS \n     and AIDS-related illnesses; and\n       Whereas the United Nations Special Session on AIDS, taking \n     place in June 2001, and the Group of Eight Industrialized \n     Nations meeting in July 2001, are key opportunities for more \n     states, governments, international organizations, the private \n     sector, and civil society to donate assistance to the global \n     fund: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the tragedy of the AIDS pandemic in human \n     terms, as well as its devastating impact on national \n     economies, infrastructures, political systems, and all \n     sectors of society;\n       (2) strongly supports the formation of a Global AIDS and \n     Health Fund;\n       (3) calls for the United States to remain open to providing \n     greater sums of money to the global fund as other donors join \n     in supporting this endeavor;\n       (4) calls on other nations, international organizations, \n     foundations, the private sector, and civil society to join in \n     providing assistance to the global fund;\n       (5) urges all national leaders in every part of the world \n     to speak candidly to their people about how to avoid \n     contracting or transmitting the HIV virus;\n       (6) calls for the United States to continue to invest \n     heavily in AIDS treatment, prevention, and research;\n       (7) urges international assistance programs to continue to \n     emphasize science-based best practices and prevention in the \n     context of a comprehensive program of care and treatment;\n       (8) encourages international health care infrastructures to \n     better prepare themselves for the successful provision of \n     AIDS care and treatment, including the administration of AIDS \n     drugs;\n       (9) urges the Administration of President George W. Bush to \n     encourage participants at the United Nations General Assembly \n     Special Session on AIDS in June, and the Group of Eight \n     Industrialized Nations meeting in July, to contribute to the \n     global fund; and\n       (10) calls for United States representatives at the United \n     Nations General Assembly Special Session on AIDS and Group of \n     Eight Industrialized Nations meeting to emphasize the need to \n     maintain focus on science-based best practices and prevention \n     in the context of a comprehensive program of care and \n     treatment, combating mother-to-child transmission of the HIV \n     virus, defeating opportunistic infections, and improving \n     infrastructure and basic care services where treatment \n     medicines are available, and seek additional resources to \n     support the millions of AIDS orphans worldwide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/29/senate-section/article/S7258-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           SENATE RESOLUTION 120--ORGANIZATION OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE (for himself and Mr. Lott) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 121\n\n       Whereas whales have very low reproductive rates, making \n     whale populations extremely vulnerable to pressure from \n     commercial whaling;\n       Whereas whales migrate throughout the world's oceans and \n     international cooperation is required to successfully \n     conserve and protect whale stocks;\n       Whereas in 1946 the nations of the world adopted the \n     International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, which \n     established the International Whaling Commission to provide \n     for the proper conservation of the whale stocks;\n       Whereas the Commission adopted a moratorium on commercial \n     whaling in 1982 in order to conserve and promote the recovery \n     of the whale stocks;\n       Whereas the Commission has designated the Indian Ocean and \n     the ocean waters\n\n[[Page S7259]]\n\n     around Antarctica as whale sanctuaries to further enhance the \n     recovery of whale stocks;\n       Whereas many nations of the world have designated waters \n     under their jurisdiction as whale sanctuaries where \n     commercial whaling is prohibited, and additional regional \n     whale sanctuaries have been proposed by nations that are \n     members of the Commission;\n       Whereas several member nations of the Commission have taken \n     reservations to the Commission's moratorium on commercial \n     whaling and 1 member nation is currently conducting \n     commercial whaling operations in spite of the moratorium and \n     the protests of other nations;\n       Whereas the Commission has adopted several resolutions at \n     recent meetings asking member nations to abandon plans to \n     initiate or continue commercial whaling activities conducted \n     under reservation to the moratorium;\n       Whereas another member nation of the Commission has taken a \n     reservation to the Commission's Southern Ocean Sanctuary and \n     continues to conduct unnecessary lethal scientific whaling in \n     the waters of that sanctuary;\n       Whereas the Commission's Scientific Committee has \n     repeatedly expressed serious concerns about the scientific \n     need for such lethal whaling;\n       Whereas scientific information on whales can readily be \n     obtained through non-lethal means;\n       Whereas the lethal take of whales under reservations to the \n     Commission's policies have been increasing annually;\n       Whereas there continue to be indications that whale meat is \n     being traded on the international market despite a ban on \n     such trade under the Convention on International Trade in \n     Endangered Species (CITES), and that meat may be originating \n     in one of the member nations of the Commission;\n       Whereas engaging in unauthorized commercial whaling and \n     lethal scientific whaling undermines the conservation program \n     of the Commission: Now, therefore, be it,\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) at the 53rd Annual Meeting the International Whaling \n     Commission the United States should--\n       (A) remain firmly opposed to commercial whaling;\n       (B) initiate and support efforts to ensure that all \n     activities conducted under reservations to the Commission's \n     moratorium or sanctuaries are ceased;\n       (C) oppose the lethal taking of whales for scientific \n     purposes unless such lethal taking is specifically authorized \n     by the Scientific Committee of the Commission;\n       (D) seek the Commission's support for specific efforts by \n     member nations to end illegal trade in whale meat; and\n       (E) support the permanent protection of whale populations \n     through the establishment of whale sanctuaries in which \n     commercial whaling is prohibited;\n       (2) at the 12th Conference of the Parties to the Convention \n     on International Trade in Endangered Species, the Uunited \n     States should oppose all efforts to reopen international \n     trade in whale meat or downlist any whale population; and\n       (3) the United States should make full use of all \n     appropriate diplomatic mechanisms, relevant international \n     laws and agreements, and other appropriate mechanisms to \n     implement the goals set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2).\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, As Chairman of the Oceans and Fisheries \nSubcommittee, I rise today to submit a resolution regarding the policy \nof the United States at the upcoming 53rd Annual Meeting of the \nInternational Whaling Commission, IWC. I wish to thank the Ranking \nMember of the Subcommittee, Ms. Snowe, for co-sponsoring this \nresolution. I wish to also thank my colleagues Mr. Hollings, Mr. \nMcCain, Mr. Biden, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Kennedy  and Mr. \nFeingold for co-sponsoring as well.\n  The IWC will meet in London from July 23-27th. Despite an IWC \nmoratorium on commercial whaling since 1985, Japan and Norway have \nharvested over 1000 minke whales since the moratorium was put in place. \nWhales are already under enormous pressure world wide from collisions \nwith ships, entanglement in fishing gear, coastal pollution, noise \nemanating from surface vessels and other sources. The need to conserve \nand protect these magnificent mammals is clear.\n  The IWC was formed in 1946 in recognition of the fact that whales are \nhighly migratory and that they do not belong to any one Nation. In \n1982, the IWC agreed on an indefinite moratorium on all commercial \nwhaling beginning in 1985. Unfortunately, Japan has been using a \nloophole that allows countries to issue themselves special permits for \nwhaling under scientific purposes. The IWC Scientific Committee has not \nrequested any of the information obtained by killing these whales and \nhas stated that Japan's scientific whaling data is not required for \nmanagement. Norway, on the other hand, objects to the moratorium on \nwhaling and openly pursues a commercial fishery for whales.\n  This resolution calls for the U.S. delegation to the IWC to remain \nfirmly opposed to commercial whaling. In addition, this resolution \ncalls for the U.S. to oppose the lethal taking of whales for scientific \npurposes unless such lethal taking is specifically authorized by the \nScientific Committee of the Commission. The resolution calls for the \nU.S. delegation to support an end to the illegal trade of whale meat \nand to support the permanent protection of whale populations through \nthe establishment of whale sanctuaries in which commercial whaling is \nprohibited.\n  I ask unanimous consent to insert into the Record a statement from \nthe World Wildlife Fund, WWF, concerning the upcoming meeting of the \nIWC and the protection of whales.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Statement of World Wildlife Fund\n\n       Today, populations of nearly all the great whales are at \n     depressed levels, a legacy of unsustainable whaling during \n     the last two centuries. Some, such as the North Atlantic \n     right and Antarctic blue whales, survive as a few hundred \n     individuals at the brink of extinction, having failed to \n     rebound from past exploitation. Others are believed to be \n     returning to healthy levels. While direct human impacts on \n     whales remain a concern, other more diffuse threats may \n     ultimately exact a greater toll. Rapid climate warming in the \n     next few decades is expected to disrupt whale migration, \n     breeding, and food support. And accumulation of DDT, PCBs, \n     and other toxic contaminants in the marine food chain is \n     already affecting some whales and may endanger their immune \n     systems and ability to reproduce. Such broad-based threats to \n     the marine environment are difficult to address in ways that \n     will alleviate harm to whales specifically, and make it all \n     the more important that whales are not also threatened by \n     uncontrolled commercial whaling.\n       The International Whaling Commission, IWC, was established \n     under the 1946 International Convention for the Regulation of \n     Whaling, and is the sole international regulatory body \n     charged with the management of cetaceans. International \n     regulation of whaling was recognized by the UN Convention on \n     the Law of the Sea, and reaffirmed by Agenda 21 as essential \n     for these highly migratory species.\n       Despite the global moratorium on commercial whaling put in \n     place by the IWC in 1986, over 1000 Northern and Southern \n     minke whales are still being caught each year. Within the \n     IWC, Japan continues to catch hundreds of whales (many in the \n     Southern Ocean which is designated as an IWC whale sanctuary) \n     using a loophole for scientific research, while Norway \n     pursues an openly commercial hunt under a legal ``objection'' \n     to the moratorium. For over a decade, both countries have \n     proceeded without IWC approval and indeed in the face of \n     repeated censure by the Commission. Norway is currently \n     moving to re-open international trade in whale products \n     despite a ban under CITES, and Japan has just extended its \n     scientific whaling to include sperm and Bryde's whales as \n     well as the two species of minkes.\n       Japan and Norway's insistence on hunting whales despite the \n     moratorium has brought IWC to a dangerous impasse. No sound \n     management scheme currently exists to ensure the \n     sustainability of whaling, although a Revised Management \n     Scheme, RMS, that could help to do so has been under \n     discussion in the IWC for several years.\n       Japan and Norway have long said they viewed completion of \n     the RMS as a turning point in their efforts to lift the \n     whaling moratorium, and both countries have harshly \n     criticized IWC for failing to reach agreement on the RMS. In \n     recent IWC talks, however, the great majority of countries \n     present sought to include crucial safeguards on the \n     supervision and control of whaling in the RMS. They did so \n     over the strenuous and repeated objections of Japan and \n     Norway, who seemed unwilling to agree to safeguards that \n     would ensure that commercial whaling does not threaten whale \n     populations.\n       In addition, Japan and Norway are supported in the IWC by \n     the votes of a loyal group of countries, many of them small \n     island states that receive significant assistance from Japan. \n     This gives the whalers a blocking minority of votes and has \n     exacerbated the IWC's deadlock.\n       Because a tiny minority of countries in the IWC refuses to \n     cease commercial whaling, it is imperative that new \n     safeguards (including highly precautionary catch limits and \n     provisions on monitoring, surveillance, and control such as \n     DNA sampling of all whales caught, a diagnostic DNA register, \n     and sanctions for non-compliance) be agreed that will contain \n     their activities and bring them back under full IWC control \n     at the earliest possible date. An RMS could advance this goal \n     provided it contains sufficient safeguards, including a \n     Revised Management Procedure that sets all catch limits at \n     zero unless otherwise calculated and approved. Such an RMS \n     should replace the now obsolete 1974 management scheme.\n       The IWC 53rd Conference of Parties meets at Hammersmith, \n     London, in late July of\n\n[[Page S7260]]\n\n     this year. The Hammersmith meeting must make progress in \n     resolving the impasse within IWC, bringing whaling by Norway \n     and Japan under international control as a matter of urgency, \n     and ensuring that any discussion on the RMS incorporate \n     rigorous safeguards to rein in current and potential whaling \n     abuses.\n       The IWC's mandate requires first and foremost that it \n     prevent the return of uncontrolled large-scale commercial \n     whaling. This is the near-term agenda by which it will be \n     judged and is currently the main contribution it has to offer \n     conservation of cetaceans more broadly. For the IWC to remain \n     relevant over the long term, however, it must expand its \n     scope of engagement to address the other human activities \n     which threaten whales and focus action on ensuring the \n     survival of the most endangered species.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, the resolution that Senator Kerry and I are \nsubmitting is very timely and important. As we work here in the Senate \ntoday, representatives of nations from around the globe are preparing \nfor the 53rd Annual Meeting of the International Whaling Commission to \nbe held in London July 23-27, 2001. At this meeting, the IWC will \ndetermine the fate of the world's whales through consideration of \nproposals to end the current global moratorium on commercial whaling. \nThe adoption of any such proposals by the IWC would mark a major \nsetback in whale conservation. It is imperative that the United States \nremain firm in its opposition to any proposals to resume commercial \nwhaling and that we, as a nation, continue to speak out passionately \nagainst this practice.\n  It is also time to close one of the loopholes used by nations to \ncontinue to whale without regard to the moratorium or established whale \nsanctuaries. The practice of unnecessary lethal scientific whaling is \noutdated and the value of the data of such research has been called \ninto question by an international array of scientists who study the \nsame population dynamics questions as those who harvest whales in the \nname of science. This same whale meat is then processed and sold in the \nmarketplace. These sentiments have been echoed by the Scientific \nCommittee of the IWC which has repeatedly passed resolutions calling \nfor the cessation of lethal scientific whaling, particularly that \noccurring in designated whale sanctuaries. They have offered to work \nwith all interested parties to design research protocols that will not \nrequire scientists to harm or kill whales.\n  Last year, Japan expanded their scientific whaling program over the \nIWC's objections. The resolution that we are offering expresses the \nSense of the Senate that the United States should continue to remain \nfirmly opposed to any resumption of commercial whaling and oppose, at \nthe upcoming IWC meeting, the non-necessary lethal taking of whales for \nscientific purposes.\n  Commercial whaling has been prohibited for many species for more than \nsixty years. In 1982, the continued decline of commercially targeted \nstocks led the IWC to declare a global moratorium on all commercial \nwhaling which went into effect in 1986. The United States was a leader \nin the effort to establish the moratorium, and since then we have \nconsistently provided a strong voice against commercial whaling and \nhave worked to uphold the moratorium. This resolution reaffirms the \nUnited States' strong support for a ban on commercial whaling at a time \nwhen our negotiations at the IWC most need that support. Norway, Japan, \nand other countries have made it clear that they intend to push for the \nelimination of the moratorium, and for a return to the days when whales \nwere treated as commodities.\n  The resolution would reiterate the U.S. objection to activities being \nconducted under reservations to the IWC's moratorium. The resolution \nwould also oppose all efforts made at the Convention on International \nTrade in Endangered Species, CITES, to reopen international trade in \nwhale meat or to downlist any whale population. In addition, the IWC, \nas well as individual nations including the United States, has \nestablished whale sanctuaries that would prevent whaling in specified \nareas even if the moratorium were to be lifted. Despite these efforts \nto give whale stocks a chance to rebuild, the number of whales \nharvested has increased in recent years, tripling since the \nimplementation of the global moratorium in 1986. This is a dangerous \ntrend that does not show signs of stopping.\n  Domestically, we work very hard to protect whales in U.S. waters, \nparticularly those considered threatened or endangered. Our own laws \nand regulations are designed to give whales one of the highest \nstandards of protection in the world, and as a result, our own citizens \nare subject to rules designed to protect against even the accidental \ntaking of whales. Commercial whaling is, of course, strictly \nprohibited. Given what is asked of our citizens to protect against even \naccidental injury to whales here in the United States, it would be \ngrossly unfair if we retreated in any way from our position opposing \ncommercial, intentional whaling by other countries. Whales migrate \nthroughout the world's oceans, and as we protect whales in our own \nwaters, so should we act to protect them internationally.\n  Whales are among the most intelligent animals on Earth, and they play \nan important role in the marine ecosystem. Yet, there is still much \nabout them that we do not know. Resuming the intentional harvest of \nwhales is irresponsible, and it could have ecological consequences that \nwe cannot predict. Therefore, it is premature to even consider easing \nconservation measures.\n  The right policy is to protect whales across the globe, and to oppose \nthe resumption of commercial whaling. I urge my colleagues to support \nswift passage of this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/29/senate-section/article/S7260-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7260-S7261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 122--RELATING TO THE TRANSFER OF SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC \n TO THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR YUGOSLAVIA, AND FOR OTHER \n                                PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Leahy) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 122\n\n       Whereas Slobodan Milosevic has been transferred to the \n     International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia to face \n     charges of crimes against humanity;\n       Whereas the transfer of Slobodan Milosevic and other \n     indicted war criminals is a triumph of international justice \n     and the rule of law in Serbia;\n       Whereas corruption and warfare under the Milosevic regime \n     caused Yugoslavia extensive economic damage, including an \n     estimated $29,400,000,000 in lost output and a foreign debt \n     that exceeds $12,200,000,000; and\n       Whereas democrats and reformers in the Federal Republic of \n     Yugoslavia deserve the support and encouragement of the \n     United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That (a) the Senate hereby--\n       (1) recognizes the courage of Serbian democrats, in \n     particular, Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, in \n     facilitating the transfer of Slobodan Milosevic to the \n     International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia; and\n       (2) calls for the continued transfer of indicted war \n     criminals to the International Criminal Tribunal for \n     Yugoslavia and the release of all political prisoners held in \n     Serbian prisons.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that the United States \n     should remain committed to providing foreign assistance to \n     support the success of economic, political, and legal reforms \n     in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Senator Leahy and I welcome the news of \nthe transfer yesterday of Slobodan Milosevic to the International \nCriminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia, ICTY. Last year, we worked to include \nlanguage in the fiscal year 2001 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill \nto condition assistance to Serbia on, among other issues, certification \nby the President that the government is cooperating with the ICTY on \nthe ``surrender and transfer'' of war criminals to The Hague.\n  While our efforts to secure justice for the victims of Milosevic's \natrocities through Section 594 of P.L. 106-429 contributed to dramatic \nevents in early April, when Milosevic was first arrested, and again \nyesterday, the real credit for facilitating the transfer belongs to \nSerbian democrats and reformers, in particular Prime Minister Zoran \nDjindjic. I am pleased that they recognize the importance of forward \nprogress on the issue of war crimes, and I think it bodes well for the \ncountry's overall prospects for successful economic, political, and \nlegal reforms.\n  The resolution we submit today recognizes the courage of Serbian \ndemocrats and reaffirms our commitment to providing U.S. foreign \nassistance to support much needed reforms in the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia (FRY). We hope that Prime Minister Djindjic, and other \nreformers, continue to demonstrate courageous leadership, such as\n\n[[Page S7261]]\n\nthey did yesterday. Other indicated war criminals should be transferred \nto The Hague and all political prisoners in Serbian jails should be \nimmediately released.\n  There is no victory sweeter than justice. It is now up to the ICTY to \ndeliver justice to the victims and the survivors of atrocities \ncommitted in Kosovo, Bosnia, and Croatia.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last year, when Senator McConnell and I \nincluded language in the fiscal year 2001 Foreign Operations bill to \ncondition United States assistance in Serbia on the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia's cooperation with the War Crimes Tribunal, we could not \npredict what the effect of our provision would be. While we both wanted \nto support democracy and economic reconstruction in Serbia, we also \nfelt strongly that if Serbia's leaders wanted our assistance they \nshould fulfill their international responsibility to apprehend and \nsurrender indicted war criminals to The Hague.\n  I am very grateful for the way Senator McConnell and his staff have \nworked closely with me and my staff on this. It has been a classic case \nof how conditioning our assistance and working together, with the \nAdministration, can achieve a result that significantly advances the \ncause of international justice. Milosevic's transfer to the War Crimes \nTribunal should bring hope to millions of people throughout the former \nYugoslavia.\n  Above all, as Senator McConnell has already noted, we should \ncongratulate Prime Minister Djindjic and other Serb leaders who have \nrisked their lives and their careers for their country's future. It is \na legacy that few people in history can claim. Those who have \ncriticized Prime Minister Djindjic for surrendering Milosevic should be \naware that for the United States there is no alternative. We will not \nsupport a Serb Government that does not cooperate with the War Crimes \nTribunal. We expect the apprehension and transfer to The Hague of the \nother publicly indicted war criminals who remain at large in Serb \nterritory, and the release of the remaining political prisoners in \nSerbia's jails.\n  I also want to recognize the Serb people who suffered terribly under \nMilosevic's disastrous policies, and who increasingly saw that in order \nto rebuild their country and establish democracy and the rule of law on \na solid footing, it was necessary to bring to justice the people who \ndevastated the former Yugoslavia in their names. We submit this \nresolution on their behalf, and on behalf of Milosevic's other victims, \ndead and alive, in Kosovo, Bosnia, and Croatia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/29/senate-section/article/S7261-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 123--AMENDING THE STANDING RULES OF THE SENATE TO \n CHANGE THE NAME OF THE COMMITTEE ON SMALL BUSINESS TO THE ``COMMITTEE \n                ON SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP''\n\n  Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Bond) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 57\n\n       Whereas the United States has always been a country of \n     immigrants and was built on the hard work and dedication of \n     generations of those immigrants who have gathered on our \n     shores;\n       Whereas, over the past 120 years, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid \n     Society (HIAS), the oldest international migration and \n     refugee resettlement agency in the United States, has \n     assisted more than 4,500,000 migrants of all faiths to \n     immigrate to the United States, Israel, and other safe havens \n     around the world;\n       Whereas, since the 1970s, HIAS has resettled more than \n     400,000 refugees from more than 50 countries in the United \n     States and provided high quality resettlement services \n     through a network of local Jewish community social service \n     agencies;\n       Whereas HIAS has helped bring to the United States such \n     outstanding individuals as former Secretary of State Henry \n     Kissinger, artist Marc Chagall, Olympic gold-medalist Lenny \n     Krayzelberg, poet and Nobel Laureate Joseph Brodesky, and \n     author and restaurateur George Lang;\n       Whereas HIAS has assisted with United States refugee \n     programs overseas, often as a joint voluntary agency, \n     providing refugee processing, cultural orientation, and other \n     services in Moscow, Vienna, Kiev, Tel Aviv, Rome, and Guam;\n       Whereas through publications, public meetings, and radio \n     and television broadcasts, HIAS is a crucial provider of \n     information, counseling, legal assistance, and other \n     services, including outreach programs for the Russian-\n     speaking immigrant community, to immigrants and asylum \n     seekers in the United States;\n       Whereas HIAS plays a vital role in serving the needs of \n     refugees, immigrants, and asylum seekers, and continues to \n     work in areas of conflict and instability, seeking to rescue \n     those who are fleeing from danger and persecution; and\n       Whereas on September 9, 2001, HIAS will celebrate the 120th \n     anniversary of its founding: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That (a) Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS), and \n     the immigrants and refugees that HIAS has served, for the \n     contributions they have made to the United States; and\n       (2) congratulates HIAS on the 120th anniversary of its \n     founding.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that the President should \n     issue a proclamation recognizing September 9, 2001, as the \n     120th anniversary of the founding of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid \n     Society, and calling on the people of the United States to \n     conduct appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs to \n     demonstrate appreciation for the contributions made by HIAS \n     to the United States.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am proud to submit a resolution \nhonoring the 120th anniversary of the founding of the Hebrew Immigrant \nAid Society. During its distinguished history, the Society has helped \nmore than 4.5 million immigrants of all faiths who have come to the \nUnited States, Israel, and other safe havens around the world. Since \n1970, the Society has assisted more than 400,000 refugees from more \nthan 50 countries in resettling in the United States, and these \nindividuals have provided indispensable contributions to this country.\n  I also commend the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society for its continuing \nefforts to remind this country of the importance of a wise policy on \nrefugees. As crises occur throughout the world, the Society has helped \nensure that the United States has an effective and humane response to \neach human tragedy. By maintaining a vigorous refugee resettlement \nprogram, we set an example for other nations to follows.\n  The Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society continues to have a vital role in \nserving the needs of refugees, immigrants, and asylum seekers. Our \ncountry owes it an enormous debt of gratitude, and I urge the Senate to \nagree to this well-deserved tribute.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/29/senate-section/article/S7261-3", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7261-S7262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 58--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE TENTH \n         ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ASIA PACIFIC PARLIAMENTARY FORUM\n\n  Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Inouye) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 158\n\n       Whereas the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum was founded by \n     former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone in 1993;\n       Whereas the Tokyo Declaration, signed by 59 \n     parliamentarians from 15 countries, entered into force as the \n     founding charter of the forum on January 14 and 15, 1993, \n     establishing the basic structure of the forum as an inter-\n     parliamentary organization;\n       Whereas the original 15 members, one of which was the \n     United States, have increased to 27 member countries;\n       Whereas the forum serves to promote regional identification \n     and cooperation\n\n[[Page S7262]]\n\n     through discussion of matters of common concern to all member \n     states and serves, to a great extent, as the legislative arm \n     of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation;\n       Whereas the focus of the forum lies in resolving political, \n     economic, environmental security, law and order, human \n     rights, education, and cultural issues;\n       Whereas the forum will hold its tenth annual meeting on \n     January 6 through 9, 2002, which will be the first meeting of \n     the forum hosted by the United States;\n       Whereas approximately 270 parliamentarians from 27 \n     countries in the Asia Pacific region will attend this \n     meeting;\n       Whereas the Secretariat of the meeting will be the Center \n     for Cultural and Technical Exchange Between East and West in \n     Honolulu, Hawaii;\n       Whereas the East-West Center is an internationally \n     recognized education and research organization established by \n     the United States Congress in 1960 largely through the \n     efforts of the Eisenhower administration and the Congress;\n       Whereas it is the mission of the East-West Center to \n     strengthen understanding and relations between the United \n     States and the countries of the Asia Pacific region and to \n     help promote the establishment of a stable, peaceful and \n     prosperous Asia Pacific community in which the United States \n     is a natural, valued and leading partner; and\n       Whereas it is the agenda of this meeting to advance \n     democracy, peace, and prosperity in the Asia Pacific region:\n        Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the Senate (the House of \n     Representatives Concurring), That the Congress--\n       (1) expresses support for the tenth annual meeting of the \n     Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum and for the ideals and \n     concerns of this body;\n       (2) commends the East-West Center for hosting the meeting \n     of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum and the \n     representatives of the 27 member countries; and\n       (3) calls upon all parties to support the endeavors of the \n     Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum and to work toward achieving \n     the goals of the meeting.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Inouye and myself, I \nrise to submit a Senate Concurrent Resolution concerning the \nforthcoming tenth annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary \nForum, APPF, that will take place in Honolulu in January 2002.\n  The Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum consists of 27 countries of \nwhich the United States is one of the original founders. Our former \ncolleague, Senator Bill Roth, was one of the leaders of this \norganization which was created as a parliamentary counterpart to the \nheads of state meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation, APEC, \norganization.\n  The first meeting was held in Singapore in 1991, and, earlier this \nyear, Chile sponsored the ninth annual meeting. Next year, for the \nfirst time, the annual meeting will be hosted by the United States in \nHawaii. The Center for Cultural and Technical Exchange Between East and \nWest, better known as the East West Center, will provide the \nSecretariat for the meeting which is expected to attract approximately \n270 parliamentarians from countries in the Asia-Pacific region.\n  Participating countries include Australia, Canada, Chile, China, \nRussia, Mexico, South Korea, Peru, Ecuador, Costa Rica, Mongolia, the \nPhilippines, and New Zealand. Discussions and debates are frank and \nopen. The meetings provide an opportunity for legislators in these \ncountries to hear and exchange views on a diversity of topics including \nhuman rights, security, law, the economy, and the environment.\n  I invite my colleagues to attend next year's early January meeting in \nHawaii. It is an occasion to meet with leaders on both sides of the \nPacific for frank discussions and to experience as well the spirit of \nAloha.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/29/senate-section/article/S7262-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 850.

Madam President, I now ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to S. Res. 120, the organizing resolution submitted \nearlier today by myself and Senator Lott.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 120) relative to the organization of \n     the Senate during the remainder of the 107th Congress.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that three \nletters with reference to the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 29, 2001.\n       Dear Colleague: We write as Chairman and Ranking Republican \n     Member of the Judiciary Committee to inform you of a change \n     in Committee practice with respect to nominations. The ``blue \n     slips'' that the Committee has traditionally sent to home \n     State Senators to ask their views on nominees to be U.S. \n     Attorneys, U.S. Marshals and federal judges, will be treated \n     as public information.\n       We both believe that such openness in the confirmation \n     process will benefit the Judiciary Committee and the Senate \n     as a whole. Further, it is our intention that this policy of \n     openness with regard to ``blue slips'' and the blue slip \n     process continue in the future, regardless of who is Chairman \n     or which party is in the majority in the Senate.\n       Therefore, we write to inform you that the Chairman of the \n     Judiciary Committee, with the full support of the former \n     Chairman and Ranking Republican Member, is exercising his \n     authority to declare that the blue slip process shall no \n     longer be designated or treated as Committee confidential.\n           Sincerely,\n     Patrick J. Leahy,\n       Chairman.\n     Orrin G.

We write as Chairman and Ranking \n     Republican Member on the Judiciary Committee to inform you \n     that we are prepared to examine carefully and assess such \n     presidential nominations.\n       The Judiciary Committee's traditional practice has been to \n     report Supreme Court nominees to the Senate once the \n     Committee has completed its considerations. This has been \n     true even in cases where Supreme Court nominees were opposed \n     by a majority of the Judiciary Committee.\n       We both recognize and have every intention of following the \n     practices and precedents of the Committee and the Senate when \n     considering Supreme Court nominees.\n           Sincerly,\n     Patrick J. Leahy,\n       Chairman.\n     Orrin G. Hatch,\n       Ranking Republican Member.\n                                  ____\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Rules and Administration,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 29, 2001.\n       Dear Colleague: On June 29, 2001, the Senate passed the \n     organizing resolution which states, in part, that subject to \n     the authority of the Standing Rules of the Senate, any \n     agreements entered into regarding committee funding and space \n     prior to June 5, 2001, between the chairman and ranking \n     member of each committee shall remain in effect, unless \n     modified by subsequent agreement between the chairman and \n     ranking member.\n       In the assignment of office space to Senate committees, \n     pursuant to Rule XXV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, it \n     is the practice of the Committee on Rules and Administration \n     to assign all such space to the chairman of each committee. \n     Further, the Rules Committee does not traditionally intervene \n     in the internal space allocation decisions of the committees \n     and therefore is not a party to any agreements between the \n     chairman and ranking member regarding space allocations. It \n     is the intent of the Committee on Rules and Administration to \n     continue such practice.\n           Sincerely,\n     Christopher J. Dodd,\n       Chairman.\n     Mitch McConnell,\n       Ranking Member.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. 120) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 120\n\n       Resolved, That the Majority Party of the Senate for the \n     107th Congress shall have a one seat majority on every \n     committee of the Senate, except that the Select Committee on \n     Ethics shall continue to be composed equally of members from \n     both parties. No Senator shall lose his or her current \n     committee assignments by virtue of this resolution.\n       Sec. 2 Notwithstanding the provisions of Rule XXV the \n     Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate are hereby \n     authorized to appoint their members of the committees \n     consistent with this resolution.\n       Sec. 3 Subject to the authority of the Standing Rules of \n     the Senate, any agreements entered into regarding committee\n\n[[Page S7286]]\n\n     funding and space prior to June 5, 2001, between the Chairman \n     and Ranking member of each committee shall remain in effect, \n     unless modified by subsequent agreement between the Chairman \n     and Ranking member.\n       Sec. 4 The provisions of this resolution shall cease to be \n     effective, except for Sec. 3, if the ratio in the full Senate \n     on the date of adoption of this resolution changes.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, the resolution we have just adopted is \none that provides for the reorganization of the U.S. Senate.\n  This is a unique time of transition for the Senate, and I understand \nthat it is a difficult time for many of my Republican colleagues.\n  If there is one thing that supercedes the status of any Senator or \nany party, it is our desire to do the work we were sent here to do. \nThat, of course, requires getting the Senate organized to do it.\n  By passing this resolution, our colleagues can retake their rightful \nplaces on committees, committees can take action on legislation, and \nimportantly, we can move forward with Presidential nominations.\n  This organizing resolution is the result of thorough bipartisan \nnegotiations over the last several weeks.\n  Many people deserve credit. First and foremost, I thank Senator Lott. \nSenator Lott and I have been through many challenges together. Each of \nthose challenges has strengthened our friendship, and our working \nrelationship, and this is no exception.\n  I also thank Senators McConnell, Domenici, Gramm, Hatch, and Specter. \nTheir good faith in the negotiating process, and their patience as the \nprocess played out, were instrumental in helping us reach this point.\n  This resolution provides for a one-seat margin on Senate committees, \nwhich is consistent with Senate precedent.\n  It clarifies that--subject to the standing rules of the Senate--the \nagreements on funding and space that were made between chairmen and \nranking members early in this Congress will remain in effect for the \nduration of this Congress.\n  This resolution also makes it clear that all of these provisions will \nsunset if the ratio in the Senate changes during this Congress.\n  I especially commend Senator Leahy. Senator Leahy, in his typically \nfair and wise way, played a critical role in solving the most difficult \nquestions we faced in these negotiations: those involving Supreme Court \nand other Presidential nominees.\n  Together, he and Senator Hatch were able to find a truly constructive \nsolution to the way in which we handle ``blue slips,'' and the way in \nwhich we consider nominees to the Supreme Court.\n  On the subject of blue slips, Senators Leahy and Hatch have agreed \nthat these forms--traditionally sent to home-state Senators to ask \ntheir views on nominees to be U.S. Attorneys, U.S. Marshals, and \nfederal judges--will now be treated as public information.\n  I share their belief that this new policy of openness will benefit \nnot only the Judiciary Committee, but the Senate as a whole. I also \nshare their hope that this policy will continue in the future, \nregardless of which party is in the majority.\n  In the course of our negotiations, a number of our Republican \ncolleagues also raised concerns about how Democrats would deal with \npotential Supreme Court nominations, should that need arise.\n  A second letter to which Senators Leahy and Hatch agreed says clearly \nthat all nominees to the Supreme Court will receive full and fair \nconsideration.\n  This is the same position I stated publicly many times during our \nnegotiations, and I intend to see that the Senate lives up to this \ncommitment.\n  It has been the traditional practice of the Judiciary Committee to \nreport Supreme Court nominees to the Senate floor once the committee \nhas completed its consideration. This has been true even for a number \nof nominees that were defeated in the Judiciary Committee.\n  Now, Senators Leahy and Hatch have put in writing their intention \nthat consideration of Supreme Court nominees will follow the practices \nand precedents of the Judiciary Committee and the Senate.\n  In reaching this agreement, we have avoided an unwise and unwarranted \nchange to the Standing Rules of the Senate and a sweeping revision to \nthe Senate's constitutional responsibility to review Supreme Court \nnominees.\n  In sum, this is a good, balanced, resolution--one that will enable us \nto run this Senate in a spirit of fairness.\n  In a letter to Thomas Jefferson, James Madison explained that the \nConstitution's Framers considered the Senate to be the great ``anchor'' \nof the Government.\n  For 212 years, that anchor has held steady. The Senate has withstood \nCivil War and constitutional crises. In each generation, it has been \nbuffeted by the winds and tides of political and social change.\n  Today I believe we are proving that this great anchor of democracy \ncan withstand the forces of unprecedented internal changes as well.\n  I am confident that this resolution is the right way to keep the \nSenate working. I am appreciative of the support given by all our \ncolleagues today as we now adopt it.\n  If I may, I will say one other thing about this particular \nresolution. There is a member of my staff whose name is Mark Childress; \nour colleagues know him. I am indebted to him for many reasons, as I am \nto all of my staff. But no one deserves more credit and more praise for \nthe job done in reaching this successful conclusion than Mark \nChildress. Publicly, I acknowledge his contribution, his incredible \nwork and effort. I thank him from the bottom of my heart for what he \nhas done to make this possible.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to insert in the \nRecord a memo from the Congressional Reference Service. As this memo \nmakes clear, the Senate has a long record of allowing the Supreme Court \nnominees of the President to be given a vote on the floor of the \nSenate. No matter what the vote in committee on a Supreme Court \nnominee, it is the precedent of the Senate that the individual \nnominated is given a vote by the whole Senate.\n  The letter inserted in the Record as a part of the agreement \naccompanying the organization resolution refers to the ``traditional'' \npractice of reporting Supreme Court nominees for a vote on the floor. \nThis memo from CRS shows that since 1881, there is only one case where \nthe nominee was not given a floor vote. In that case, there was no \nopening on the Court for the nominee to fill and thus the nominee was \nwithdrawn. So this precedent is even purer than the ``99 and 44/\n100ths'' soap test.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                Congressional Research Service\n\n                                     Washington DC, June 28, 2001.\n     Senate Consideration of Supreme Court Nominations since 1880\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Senate Republican Leader,\n       This memorandum is in response to your request, made during \n     our telephone conversation earlier today, for a short written \n     answer to the specific question, ``Is it the case that since \n     1880 all Supreme Court nominations, irrespective of Judiciary \n     Committee recommendation, have received consideration by, and \n     a vote of, the full Senate?''\n       Research by CRS has found that from President James A. \n     Garfield's nomination of Stanley Matthews on March 14, 1881 \n     to the present, every person nominated to the Supreme Court \n     except one has received Senate consideration and a vote on \n     his or her nomination. Nonetheless, it should be noted, \n     during the time frame of 1880 to the present, there also have \n     been two other instances, besides the already mentioned \n     exception, in which Supreme Court nominations failed to \n     receive consideration; in both cases, however, the \n     individuals in question were re-nominated shortly thereafter, \n     with one receiving Senate confirmation and the other Senate \n     rejection.\n       The one instance when the Senate did not consider and vote \n     on an individual nominated to be a Supreme Court Justice \n     involved President Lyndon B. Johnson's nomination of federal \n     appellate judge Homer Thornberry in 1968. Judge Thornberry \n     was nominated to be an Associate Justice on June 26, 1968, \n     the same day on which President Johnson nominated then-\n     Associate Justice Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice. Judge \n     Thornberry was nominated to fill the Associate Justice \n     vacancy that was to be created upon Justice Fortas's \n     confirmation as Chief Justice. However, after being favorably \n     reported by the Judiciary Committee, the Fortas nomination \n     failed to gain Senate confirmation. On October 1, 1968, the \n     fourth day of Senate consideration of the Fortas nomination, \n     a motion to close debate on the nomination failed by a 45-43 \n     vote. Three days later, on October 4, 1968, President Johnson \n     withdrew both the Fortas and Thornberry nominations.\n       Prior to Senate action on the Fortas nomination, the \n     Judiciary Committee held hearings simultaneously on Fortas \n     and Thornberry, but upon conclusion of the hearings\n\n[[Page S7287]]\n\n     reported out only the Fortas nomination. One detailed history \n     of the Fortas nomination reported that it was apparent ``that \n     the committee would take no action on Thornberry until the \n     Fortas nomination was settled.''\n       As noted in the second paragraph of this memorandum, there \n     also have been two instances in which Supreme Court \n     nominations failed to receive Senate consideration, only to \n     be followed by the individuals in question being re-nominated \n     shortly thereafter and then receiving Senate consideration. \n     The earlier of these instances involved President Rutherford \n     B. Haye's nomination of Stanley Matthews on January 26, 1881 \n     in the final days of the 46th Congress. According to one \n     historical account, the nomination did not enjoy majority \n     support in the Senate Judiciary Committee and was not \n     reported out by the Committee or considered by the full \n     Senate before the end of the Congress. However, Matthews was \n     renominated by Hayes's successor, President Garfield, on \n     March 14, 1881. Although the second nomination was reported \n     with an adverse recommendation by the Judiciary Committee, it \n     was considered by the full Senate and confirmed on May 12, \n     1881 by a vote of 24-23.\n       A second instance in which a Supreme Court nomination \n     failed to receive Senate consideration, only to have the \n     individual in question be re-nominated, involved Grover \n     Cleveland's nomination of William B. Hornblower in 1893. \n     Hornblower was first nominated on September 19, 1893, with no \n     record of any Judiciary Committee action or Senate \n     consideration of the nomination indicated in Journal of the \n     Executive Proceedings of the Senate volume for that (the \n     53rd) Congress. Hornblower was re-nominated by President \n     Cleveland on December 6, 1893.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 123, submitted \nearlier today by Senators Kerry and Bond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 123) amending the Standing Rules of \n     the Senate to change the name of the Committee on Small \n     Business to the ``Committee on Small Business and \n     Entrepreneurship.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I would like to take a few minutes to \nexplain the historic importance of the Resolution I am putting forward \nwith Senator Bond to change the name of the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness to the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship. This is the first piece of legislation I am putting \nforward as the new Chairman of the Small Business Committee. I am \npleased that it is a bipartisan Resolution, continuing the tradition of \nthe Committee.\n  I would like to thank Senator Bond for cosponsoring this Resolution, \nand the Majority Leader and Republican Leader for their cooperation and \nsupport in bringing it to the floor of the Senate so quickly.\n  As many of my colleagues may know, the needs and circumstances of \ntoday's entrepreneurial companies differ from those of traditional \nsmall businesses. For instance, entrepreneurial companies are much more \nlikely to depend on investment capital rather than loan capital. \nAdditionally, although they represent less than five percent of all \nbusinesses, entrepreneurial companies create a substantial number of \nall new jobs and are responsible for developing a significant portion \nof technological innovations, both of which have substantial benefits \nfor our economy.\n  Taken together, an unshakable determination to grow and improved \nproductivity lie at the heart of what distinguishes fast growth or \nentrepreneurial companies from more traditional, albeit successful, \nsmall businesses. Early on, it is often impossible to distinguish a \nsmall business from an entrepreneurial company. Only when a company \nstarts to grow fast and make fundamental changes in a market do the \ndifferences come into play. Policies that support entrepreneurship \nbecome critical during this phase of the business cycle. Our public \npolicies can only play a significant role during this critical phase if \nwe understand the needs of entrepreneurial companies and are prepared \nto respond appropriately.\n  I believe that adding ``Entrepreneurship'' to the Committee on Small \nBusiness's name will more accurately reflect the Committee's valuable \nrole in helping to foster and promote economic development by including \nentrepreneurial companies and the spirit of entrepreneurship in the \nUnited States.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this Resolution. Thank you.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, that any statements relating thereto be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 123) was agreed to.\n  (The resolution is located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nSubmitted Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/29/senate-section/article/S7287-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7287-S7288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COMPLIMENTING SENATORS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, let me just say this before I make my \nfinal comments. Senator Kennedy is on the floor and I want to \nacknowledge, as I did just now upstairs and as I did a couple of weeks \nago as we completed our work on the education bill, a historic and \nlandmark piece of legislation, how grateful I am, once again, to the \nsenior Senator from Massachusetts, the chairman of the Health, \nEducation, and Labor Committee.\n  I have said privately and publicly that I believe he is one of the \nmost historic figures our Chamber has ever had the pleasure of \nwitnessing. We saw, again, the leadership and the remarkable ability \nthat he has to legislate over the course of the last couple of weeks. I \ndidn't think that what he had to endure in the education bill could \nhave been any harder. In many respects, I think the last 2 weeks were \nharder. It was harder reaching a consensus. We had very difficult and \ncontentious issues to confront, amendments to consider. In all of it, \nhe, once again, took his responsibilities as we would expect of him--\nwith fairness, with courtesy, and with a display of empathy for all \nMembers, the likes of which you just do not see on the Senate floor.\n  So on behalf of all of our caucus, I daresay on behalf of the Senate, \nI thank Senator Kennedy, our chairman, for the work he has done.\n  I also acknowledge and thank our colleague from North Carolina, \nSenator John Edwards. Senator Edwards has done a remarkable job. In a \nvery short period of time, he has demonstrated his capabilities for \nsenatorial leadership. He came to the Senate without the experience of \npublic service, but in a very brief period of time he has demonstrated \nhis enormous ability to adjust and adapt to Senate ways. He has become \na true leader. I am grateful to him for his extraordinary contribution \nto this bill.\n  Let me also thank Senator John McCain. This bill is truly bipartisan \nin many ways, but it is personified in that bipartisanship with the \nrole played by Senator McCain, not unlike other bills in which he has \nparticipated. I will mention especially the campaign finance reform \nbill.\n  Senator McCain has been the key in bringing about the bipartisan \nconsensus that we reached again today. On a vote of 59-36, we showed \nthe bipartisanship that can be displayed even as we take on these \ncontentious and difficult issues. That would not have been possible \nwere it not for his effort.\n  Let me thank, as well, Senator Judd Gregg and many of our colleagues \non the Republican side for their participation. They fought a hard \nfight; they made a good case; they argued their amendments extremely \nwell; and they were prepared to bring this debate to closure tonight. I \nam grateful to them for their willingness to do so.\n  Finally, I thank Senator Harry Reid. He wasn't officially a part of \nthe committee, but Senator Reid has made a contribution once again to \nthis bill, as he has on so many other bills, that cannot be replicated. \nThis would not have happened were it not for his remarkable--and I \nwould say incredible--efforts on the Senate floor each and\n\n[[Page S7288]]\n\nevery day. He is a dear friend. He is someone unlike anyone I think we \nhave seen in recent times. He cares deeply for this body and has worked \ndiligently to bring about a successful conclusion to this bill. We \nthank him.\n  Having thanked our colleagues, let me also thank our staff --our \nfloor staff, my personal staff, the leadership staff, the staff of the \ncommittee. Were it not for them, we simply could not have done our \nwork. I am extraordinarily grateful to them as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/29/senate-section/article/S7288-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR MONDAY, JULY 9, 2001\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Madam President, I want to take a brief moment to thank \nsome very special people who were absolutely instrumental in bringing \nus to the point of the passage of the legislation which gives so much \nhope--and should give so much hope--to millions of American families \nwho now are going to be treated by the doctors in whom they have \nconfidence, by the health care staff from whom they are going to get \ntrue recommendations, and not have judgments and decisions overridden \nby their HMOs. We have not finished the job, but this is a giant step \nforward.\n  I want to, as others have done--I feel strongly about it --first \nthank some special Members of this body. We just heard our leader, \nSenator Daschle. I can remember when Senator Daschle was asked after he \nassumed the leadership role as the majority leader in the Senate, what \nwas going to be his first priority, and he mentioned the Patients' Bill \nof Rights. For 5 years--for 5 years--we have waited for this moment \nthis evening. For 5 years we have waited, and in the short time he has \nassumed the leadership of the Senate, in a closely divided Senate, he \nhas been able to develop the broad support evidenced in vote after \nvote, bipartisan in such important public policy areas.\n  I thank my good friend, John Edwards, whose leadership at critical \ntimes during this debate and during very important moments was \nabsolutely indispensable and essential. He was extremely effective in \nhis quiet and soft spoken way, but with a steeliness and a strength \nthat is reflected in his great passion on so many of the issues which \nare in his soul. He has made an enormous difference in making sure we \nreached this point tonight.\n  I thank John McCain. Senator McCain, as he has said many times, \ntraveled this country as a Presidential candidate and saw the \nimportance of this legislation. He came back and wanted to know how he \ncould play a role in making sure it came to fruition. He was willing, \nas he has on so many issues, to take on tough challenges and stay the \ncourse, but he has been an absolutely extraordinary leader on this \nissue, as on many others. It has been a great pleasure to work with him \nclosely on this matter.\n  As has been mentioned, John Edwards has provided extraordinary \nleadership on this issue. He was indispensable in so many different \naspects of the development of the legislation, likely all of those that \ndeal with accountability. We know the importance of the relationship \nbetween accountability and patient protections in this bill. He was \nalways a steadying force, a strong force, a tireless voice for patients \nand has made an extraordinary mark on this legislation for which we are \ngrateful. This has been a historic team, and I am grateful for them.\n  I have great appreciation for Harry Reid. I listened the other \nevening when my good friend, Senator Byrd, mentioned that he had been a \ndeputy leader. He said Senator Reid was really one of the best. Having \nbeen a deputy leader myself many years ago, it truly can be said he is \nthe best I have seen in all the time I have been in the Senate. He is a \ntireless worker and always there to find common ground.\n  He has this incredible ability to say no and make you feel good, \nwhich is very difficult but challenging at best for anyone to do, and \nhe does it on a regular basis, repeatedly, and still Members of this \nbody know he is a selfless devotee to this institution and to the \nissues in which he is involved. He has made such an extraordinary \ndifference in this legislation as well.\n\n  I want to thank some other Senators. I see chairing tonight my good \nfriend, and becoming a better friend, Debbie Stabenow. All of us, as we \nhave been working on this legislation, know this has been such a \nmotivating force in her public life experience. She has been an \nextraordinary resource and supporter for this legislation. No one in \nthis body cares more deeply about this issue than Senator Stabenow. She \nreminds us all of that wonderful child, Jessica, of whom she has \nspoken. She continues to be a presence in this Senate on this issue.\n  I thank a number of our colleagues who were involved, and I will not \nbe able to mention them all, but I think of Senator Snowe and Senator \nDeWine who worked across the aisle to fashion a very important \namendment that helped clarify some important provisions that we had not \nfelt needed further clarification, but they pointed out the reasons for \nit and were constructive in working through it.\n  I thank my friend, Dr. Frist, who has been the chairman of our Public \nHealth Subcommittee and with whom I have worked on many different \nissues. We differed on this issue, but we worked closely on many other \nissues. I have great respect for him.\n  I thank Judd Gregg who has been a worthy adversary as well as an ally \non different public policy issues this year. I enjoy working with him.\n  Some Senators I had not expected to be as involved as they have been \nand yet were enormously helpful are Senator Nelson, Senator Landrieu, \nSenator Lincoln, and Senator Bayh. Senator Jeffords spent a lot of time \non this issue previously and worked with us and knows the issue \ncarefully.\n  I have listened to him in small meetings, including at the White \nHouse with the President, explaining the importance of this legislation \nenormously effectively as he does. He has been a wonderful help \ngenerally. We didn't always agree on some of these issues, but \nnonetheless I value both his friendship and his views.\n\n  Senator Breaux has been very much involved with health policy issues \nand was very involved in this.\n  Tom Harkin has been a champion on the Patients' Bill of Rights from \nthe\n\n[[Page S7289]]\n\nbeginning. He has been there every time we needed a strong voice. He \nknows this issue. He speaks passionately about it. He understands the \nsignificance and the importance not only in the areas of disability \nprotections and health standards and medical necessity, but he also \nunderstands the nuances and the standards which were used and how that \nimpacts broad numbers of our populations. He was absolutely invaluable \nthroughout this process.\n  I thank particularly the staff members. These issues are complex. It \nis difficult to always be able to anticipate the interrelationship \nbetween these issues, the importance of what we are doing and how it \naffects other legislation we have passed, what the impact will be with \nStates and local communities, the impact with the business community, \nconsumers, and others. We have been enormously well served across the \nboard by the staff who have worked tirelessly on this issue just as \nthey did on the education issue. There are an incredible number of very \ncapable men and women who have devoted an extraordinary amount of time \nand effort and who have made an extraordinary mark on this legislation.\n  I thank all of them: For Senator McCain, Sonya Sotak, Jean Bumpus, \nCassandra Wood and Mark Busee; for Senator Edwards, Jeff Lane, Miles \nLackey, Kyle Kinner, Hunter Pruett, and Lisa Zeidner. I want to thank \nthe staff of Senator Daschle and Senator Reid, all of the floor staff \nand the clerks, including Marty Paone, Lula Davis, Gary Myrick, and \nalso in particular Elizabeth Hargrave and Deborah Adler. I thank them \nvery much. Senator Daschle has mentioned Mark Childress and Mark \nPatterson. They are leaders of a very capable and able team that works \nvery closely with Senator Daschle. They are not only fiercely loyal and \ncommitted to him but they are enormous sources of help and assistance \nto all Members in our caucus. We are all very grateful to all of them. \nFor Senator Gregg, Stephanie Monroe, and Steve Irrigarry, and Kim Monk.\n  Now to my own staff, to whom I am incredibly grateful. No one has \nworked longer or harder, has been more committed or with greater \nsuccess in terms of legislative achievement than David Nexon, the head \nof my health care team. Dave has been an invaluable resource. I always \nremember a story from when I interviewed him for the job and asked him \nto write an essay about health care. I still remember his strong \ncommitment in that essay to universal coverage, comprehensive coverage, \nquality at a price people can afford. He has never let up on that \nideal. It is one of the reasons I admire him so much. I am incredibly \ngrateful to him.\n  I will mention others in no particular order. I thank Michael Myers \nwho is our chief of staff for our whole committee and takes on the \nbroad responsibilities in health, education, and all the matters of \nthat committee. Michael and I go back a long time, initially working \ntogether on refugee issues. He was so resourceful and effective and \nhelpful in our efforts in that cause. And now, he has been good enough \nto stay the course with me and has just been an extraordinary leader \nfor our committee. I am grateful to him for his friendship and \nleadership on the committee.\n  I thank Jeff Teitz who is a master of many complicated aspects of the \nbill. If you have a complex issue that needs to be mastered, call Jeff \nTeitz.\n\n  Sarah Bianchi is full of energy and intelligence and has had a \ndistinguished career in working with former Vice President Gore. She \nhas been a great addition to our team.\n  Jerry Wesevich, I thank him so much for his steady presence. I \nmentioned a little while ago that this is Jerry's last day working in \nthe Senate. He will be working for the legal service programs down in \nTexas and New Mexico. This is a person, like so many others on the \nHill, strongly committed to improving our society, and I regret losing \nhim. I know though that he will be involved in making a better \ncommunity.\n  Janie Oates is the master of all trades and knows every TRIO program, \nevery program that reaches out to the most needy people in our country \nand society, and has been enormously helpful to me in this endeavor as \nwell.\n  I also thank Stacey Sachs who was here day in and day out and always \nseemed to have the answer. I remember the debate over the questions on \nthe standard of medical necessity and the points being made about the \nstandard we used in the Federal employers health plan. Stacey knew, \nyes, that was true but in the appeal provision a different standard was \nused. She knew the details of it, which was a key point. She is an \nextraordinary reservoir of good common sense and knowledge.\n  Jim Manley has been a great help and a good friend and has helped so \nmuch in terms of being able to communicate these issues and this whole \npolicy area effectively. Jim has been tireless. Elizabeth Field, Marty \nWalsh, so many others worked not just here on the floor but outside, as \nwell, in terms of working with the various groups and helping to bring \nwhat is happening at the grass roots here to the Senate floor. Amelia \nDungan and Jackie Gran. I thank David Bowen very much. He is a great \nmaster in understanding so much of the new research and what is \nhappening in the outer edges of biomedical research. We had debate on \nsome of those issues, and we will have more later. These are complex \nethical issues and questions. Dave is a master of all of them. Beth \nCameron and Paul Kim also deserve thanks. Paul joined our staff and has \nbeen enormously valuable and helpful, as he was in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Thanks also goes out to our many dedicated interns, Dan Munoz, Madhu \nChugh, Tarak Shah, Nina Dutta, Nicole Salazar-Austin, Abby Moncrieff, \nEddie Santos, Kent Mitchell, Haris Hardaway, Nirav Shah, Charita Sinha, \nLes Chun and Wyley Proctor. Their energy and dedication certainly \nhelped us along the way.\n  I appreciate our Presiding Officer and our Senate staff for their \npatience this evening while we make sure that the history of tonight \nwill include so many who did so much to make tonight a very important \nstep toward helping our fellow American citizens get better quality \nhealth care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/29/senate-section/article/S7289-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, JULY 9, 2001\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
