Mr. President, I have come to the Chamber today to \nspeak about a subject that is of great importance to the people of my \nState, and I think people throughout the country, and that is the issue \nof retirement security.\n  We give a lot of speeches in the Senate about security: national \nsecurity, homeland security--a variety of securities. We are concerned \nabout security. The American people are concerned about security.\n  But there is one aspect of security that has not gotten a whole lot \nof attention so far in this Congress, and I am here today to call \nattention to it. That aspect of security is retirement security.\n  The collapse of Enron and the resulting collapse of the retirement \nplans of many Enron workers and plans across the country that held \nsubstantial amounts of Enron stock have underscored the need for \nchanges in our pension laws and our retirement plan laws.\n  Frankly, I am disappointed that the House, in passing a watered-down \nversion of the administration's modest proposals, has failed to \nincrease retirement safety for those American workers who do have \npensions, since that is all on which that bill really focuses.\n  The one proposal they should have watered down--that was the \n``conflicted adviser'' provision in that bill--was left intact. It has \nthe effect of removing one of the few protections in current law \nagainst conflicts of interest by financial service companies.\n  I am hoping the Senate will follow the lead of the Senate Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee and also the Finance Committee \nand their respective chairs and provide a more meaningful piece of \nlegislation drafted to protect the rights of workers instead of \nexposing them to greater risks. So that is an issue that has been \nbrought to national attention because of the collapse of Enron.\n  At the same time I refer to that, let me say that an even more \ntroubling trend is the fact that we have heard nothing from the \nadministration and, really, in either House of Congress about the lack \nof pension coverage of any kind for large segments of our working \npopulation--both the lack of coverage and the substantial reduction in \nretirement wealth for most of the workers in this country.\n  Approximately 2 weeks ago, Dr. Edward Wolff of the Economic Policy \nInstitute--he is a professor at New York University--presented his \nreport entitled ``Retirement Insecurity: The Income Shortfalls Awaiting \nthe Soon-to-Retire.'' I would like to take a few minutes to highlight \nsome of the points that were made in that report. I believe it makes \nthe case, in a very compelling way, of the need for more attention to \nthis issue for everyday workers.\n  The report and the most recent Department of Labor statistics \ndemonstrate that retirement plan coverage has not increased in the past \n30 years despite all of the efforts to expand coverage. Let me show a \nchart I have to make the case.\n  This shows the retirement plan coverage rates for full-time, private \nsector workers. You can see this covers the period 1972 to 1999. When \nyou look at all workers, you see the retirement plan coverage rate for \nall workers in 1972 was 48 percent; in 1999--nearly 30 years later, 27 \nyears later--it was 51 percent. So there has been a very modest \nincrease, but modest indeed.\n\n  When you look at the figures for male workers, you see there has been \nan actual decline in the coverage rates for full-time, private sector \nmale employees during that period, 1972 to 1999. Mr. President, 54 \npercent of male workers had pensions of some type. When I say \n``pensions,'' I include in that 401(k) plan participation; they had \nsome kind of a plan where they were putting away money for \nretirement. It was 54 percent in 1972; 52 percent in 1999.\n\n  The percentage for women has improved because they were at 38 percent \nin 1972 and they are now at 49 percent. But it is substantially below \nwhere it ought to be.\n  That means roughly half of America's private sector employees will \nhave to enjoy their retirement on the other two legs of the proverbial \nthree-legged stool. Some who are listening may not be aware of this \nmetaphor, but the three-legged stool is what people who focus on \nretirement circumstances are always referring to. They say: You have \nthree legs you can depend upon for your retirement income; one is \nSocial Security, the second is your savings, and the third is your \npension.\n  What these statistics show is that one of those so-called legs that a \nperson can depend upon in this so-called three-legged stool, the \npension part, is not there for half of the workers in this country. In \ntruth, my guess is that many private sector workers who do not have a \npension or retirement plan probably do not have a second leg on that \nstool either because they do not have any significant savings. So they \nare essentially left with Social Security as their only real source of \nsupport after their retirement.\n  For minorities, the prospects are even dimmer. Unfortunately, the \ncoverage for minorities is unacceptably low; it has been for a long \ntime and continues. This chart makes the point for different groups of \nemployees. For all workers in 1999, the percentage of private wage and \nsalaried workers covered under their employer's pension plan was 44 \npercent. When you go down to Black, non-Hispanic workers, it was 41 \npercent; Asian and Pacific Islanders, non-Hispanic, 38 percent; others, \nminorities, non-Hispanic, 35 percent; and Hispanic workers, 27 percent. \nThat last figure is important to me because 40 percent of the people in \nmy State are Hispanic. This statistic indicates that only 27 percent of \nthe private sector employees who are Hispanic in this country actually \nhave a pension on which they can rely.\n  There has been an interesting shift I will point out. This comes out \nof Dr. Wolff's report. There has been a shift from defined benefit \nplans to defined contribution plans. Let me explain what that is. A \ndefined benefit plan essentially guarantees that when the worker \nretires, they will receive a specific amount, a defined benefit, \nregardless of what has happened to the economy or to the investment, \nthe retirement funds, or anything else in the interim while they were \nworking.\n  In 1975, when you looked at all of these various pensions people had \nin the private sector, 71 percent of them were defined benefit plans \nand only 29 percent were defined contribution.\n  Defined contribution, of course, means the risk is much more on the \nemployee. It does not guarantee you any particular payment on a monthly \nbasis or a yearly basis once you retire. It says you put in a specified \namount each month while you are working, and then at the end of your \nwork time, we look to see what the investment of those funds has added \nup to and how much there is for you to actually get in the way of \nretirement. So there is much less risk on the employer, much more risk \non the employee in a defined contribution plan.\n  The interesting thing about this chart is the defined benefit plans \nused to represent 71 percent of all pension plans; now they are 35 \npercent. The defined contribution plans used to represent 29 percent; \nthey are now 65 percent. So there has been a dramatic shift away from \ndefined benefits to defined contributions.\n\n  When this trend started, the case was made by those who advocated it \nthat this was going to allow much greater expansion of pension \ncoverage; we were going to be able to cover a great many more workers \nif we shifted to a defined contribution plan instead of a defined \nbenefit plan. So we did. We had a dramatic shift from defined benefit \nplans to defined contribution plans. Unfortunately, there has not been \nany increase in the percentage of workers covered, as that earlier \nchart made the case very clearly.\n\n[[Page S4247]]\n\n  One of the reasons many of these companies shifted to defined \ncontribution plans is that the employee makes the majority of the \ncontributions to the plan when it is defined contribution--not the \nemployer but the employee. As I indicated before, the risk is shifted \nto the employee. The risk of the funds not being well invested and the \ninvestments not turning out well shifts to the employee rather than the \nemployer.\n  Clearly, half of our private sector employees did not get any benefit \nout of this bargain because they don't have a pension of any kind from \nthe start. As I am about to explain, it does not appear that a majority \nof the covered workers got much out of this either.\n  Let me put up a few more charts that are interesting. One which is \nhard to read is a chart that shows, State by State, the pension \ncoverage we have in the private sector around the country. This is a \nchart that got my attention. You cannot read it from any distance, I am \nsure, but you can see that in Washington State, 45 percent of private \nsector workers have pension coverage. It is substantially better in \nsome other States. In Vermont--the Presiding Officer has an interest in \nVermont--40 percent of the private sector employees have some kind of \npension. That means either some kind of defined contribution or defined \nbenefit plan. They may have a 401(k). That would be in that 40 percent.\n  The reason this chart catches my attention is that if you go over \nthis chart and look at all of the percentages, the State with the \nlowest percent is New Mexico. Twenty-nine percent of the private sector \nemployees in my State actually have some kind of pension.\n  I have a chart I also want to put up for the attention of various \nSenators. It shows the percentage of private sector workers without \npension coverage. It shows about the top 15 States. In New Mexico, 71 \npercent of the private sector employees, according to these statistics, \ndon't have any kind of a pension; Louisiana, 69 percent; Nevada, 67 \npercent; Florida, 66 percent; Mississippi, 66 percent.\n  People might look at this and say, you are generally talking about \nsouthern, southwestern States, close to the border. There are all kinds \nof problems there with the economy.\n  Let's go to some others. I know my colleague from North Dakota is in \nthe Chamber. According to this chart, 61 percent of the private sector \nemployees in North Dakota do not have a pension. This is data from the \nemployee benefits supplement to the Census Bureau statistics in 1993.\n  The national average, according to that period, in 1993, was 50 \npercent; South Carolina, 61 percent; in Texas, where our President was \nGovernor, 62 percent did not have a pension.\n  The reason I point this out is to make the point that this is a real \nissue for a great many Americans. I know we have had people come to the \nfloor and say--in fact, I think my colleague from Texas spoke a couple \nweeks ago and said the biggest economic issue that this Congress has to \ndeal with is to make permanent the repeal of the estate tax. Well, to \nchange the law as it will be 9 years from now, as relates to the estate \ntax, when I look at these statistics, I don't think that is the biggest \neconomic issue from the point of view of the people I represent. We \nhave other big economic issues, one of which is pension coverage.\n  At the same time that coverage rates were made flat and employees \nshifted towards the defined contribution plans, the retirement income \nof retirees and those nearing retirement has decreased as compared to \ntheir current incomes.\n  I have another chart that makes that point. Let me put it up. This is \na chart that I think is very interesting because it deals with the \nissue of the share or percentage of households with an expected \nretirement income that is more than half of their current income. We \nare not suggesting that people in retirement are likely to have incomes \nequal to their current income. We are saying that once they retire we \nwould like them to have incomes that are at least half of their current \nincome.\n  In 1989, according to this chart, 70 percent of the people who were \nretiring had incomes that equaled half of their current income. So they \nhad as much as a 50-percent reduction in their income, but it wasn't \nworse than that. In 1998, a couple years ago--the most recent year for \nwhich we have statistics--that dropped to 57 percent. So only 57 \npercent of households had an income that was half of their current \nincome by that time.\n  So who are the winners? Who has benefited from all these changes that \nhave occurred, according to Dr. Wolff's report? The data released in \nthis report demonstrates that only those with retirement incomes of \nover a million dollars saw their retirement wealth, in 1999, increase \nas compared to their retirement wealth in 1982. This chart takes each \nof these different groups--if your wealth is $25,000, or if it is \n$25,000 to $49,999, $50,000 to $100,000, $100,000 to $250,000. And then \nthe final part of the chart is a million dollars and over.\n  So if you have $1 million and over in your wealth, you have probably \nseen that increase during that period from 1983 to 1998. But if you are \nnot in that income category and in that wealth category, then you did \nnot.\n  So the conclusions from this report are pretty stark. Coverage rates \nhave been stagnant. The percentage of our private sector workers that \nhave coverage--some kind of pension--has been stagnant for several \ndecades. Minorities still have worse coverage than nonminorities. There \nhas been very little improvement in that regard. The promise of \nincreased coverage due to the shift toward the defined contribution \nplans that we used to hear about has not occurred.\n  Finally, the relative wealth of almost all classes of retirees--that \nis, everybody except the people with wealth of over $1 million--\ndecreased over the past two decades, even though we have seen a huge \nrunup in the stock market. All of the statistics I have given you here \nare through 1998. We all know there was a booming stock market in the \n1990s, up through 1998. The stock market has come down substantially--\nat least certain parts of it--in the last couple of years. None of that \nis reflected in any of these statistics. So we will have to get updated \nfigures as quickly as they come out. But I don't want to suggest that I \nam taking last week's information in order to make the case. We are \nmaking the best case we can, assuming that the stock market did not \ndrop, as we all know it did.\n\n  We will see a further erosion in retiree wealth when we get those \nupdated statistics. It is time to start thinking about ways to improve \ncoverage. We cannot let these trends continue. We need to talk about \nreducing and dealing with other issues than just the repeal of the \nestate tax, as we go through the rest of this Congress. We also have \nproposals, as I am sure the Presiding Officer knows, that suggest that \nthe top priority for this Congress ought to be privatizing the Social \nSecurity system. That is the one remaining leg of the stool that exists \nwhich has not yet been whittled away.\n  These statistics make the case convincingly that at least that should \nbe left alone and we should get about the business of trying to help \npeople save for retirement and have a pension upon which they can \ndepend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico raises a point \nthat a lot of people are not talking about much. They talk about \npension reform a lot around here but they fail to mention that a good \nmany Americans have no pension.\n  The Senator from New Mexico used statistics--for example, 61 percent \nin my home State, and I think 70-some in New Mexico, have no pension. \nWe should do pension reform, but we also ought to think through how do \nwe encourage additional retirement savings and pensions to be offered \nto workers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/13/senate-section/article/S4247-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4247-S4248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE NEW FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

It took us \ntoo long to get done, but it is done. I appreciate the work that all of \nus did together and the cooperation in the final analysis to get it to \nthe President. I am pleased and relieved that this morning, finally, \nthis bill is now signed into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/13/senate-section/article/S4248-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SELLING FOOD TO CUBA\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me talk about two other issues \nbriefly. One is a letter I received last Friday from Secretary of State \nColin Powell. This relates to a decision by the State Department to \ncancel the visas for Cubans coming to our country to buy additional \nfood. Since the hurricane, they have purchased over $70 million in \nAmerican food. That is available for them to purchase because I and my \ncolleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, and others changed the law to \nallow food sales to Cuba. Strangely enough, they have to pay in cash \nand do it through a French bank; nonetheless, they can finally buy \nAmerican food.\n  We ought never use food as a weapon, and we have done it for 40 years \nwith Cuba. That is over. They are now buying food from this country. We \nhad a group of people representing Alimport, including Pedro Alvarez \nand others, coming to this country to buy food. They were coming, in \nfact, to North Dakota and they were going to buy dried beans and wheat. \nThey were granted a visa by the State Department, and then immediately \nthat visa was revoked. I asked Secretary Powell, ``By what authority \nwas it revoked and why?''\n  Let me use a couple of charts to see what happened on this issue. \nThis is a news story about it:\n\n       A State Department official confirmed Wednesday that the \n     administration policy is not to encourage sales of food to \n     Cuba.\n\n  In the letter from Secretary Powell, he disavows that, but that is \nwhat they told us: It is our policy not to encourage food sales to \nCuba. I said it is a brainless policy to decide you do not want to sell \nfood to Cuba; you ought to sell food to Cuba. We sell it to China, a \nCommunist country. We sell it to Vietnam, a Communist country. And we \nare told we do not want to sell food to Cuba? Does anybody think Fidel \nCastro has not eaten a meal along the way because we had an obstruction \non the sale of food to Cuba? No, it just hurts sick people, poor \npeople, and hungry people. This is what this policy has represented.\n  At a hearing last week when I raised this question with Secretary \nPowell, he said: I have never heard of this policy not to encourage \nfood sales to Cuba. In fact, he said additional sales should be \nencouraged so long as American farmers benefit.\n  The Farm Bureau said the cancellation of Mr. Alvarez's visa will \nadversely affect the sale of corn, rice, wheat, poultry, soybeans, \nlentils, and eggs, valued at $35 million.\n  I received a four-page letter from Secretary Powell. Frankly, it does \nnot answer any of the questions. It says Mr. Alvarez's visa was revoked \nbecause of a 1985 then-President Ronald Reagan directive. He also said: \nMr. Alvarez was here once before and he lobbied to undermine the U.S. \nembargo. I guess when he was here before, he said Cuba would like to \nhave a circumstance where they could buy food from American farmers. \nThe State Department considers that undermining America's interest. \nGive me a break. Mr. Secretary, that does not undermine anything. I \nhope the State Department and others will pay a little more attention \nto the issue of terrorists getting bombs, not Cubans buying dried beans \nand wheat.\n  The subcommittee which I chair is going to hold a hearing, and I will \nask the Assistant Secretary, Mr. Reich, to come to Congress and explain \nwho decided to revoke these visas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/13/senate-section/article/S4248-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4248-S4249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TRADE AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to speak to the underlying \nlegislation we will be on following the vote on the judgeship this \nafternoon. That is the trade bill. We are going to be discussing once \nagain so-called fast-track trade authority. I am not going to support \nthe bill, but I do have some amendments.\n  I think fast track is fundamentally undemocratic. Our trade deficit \nis ballooning; it is now over $450 billion in merchandise trade \ndeficits. And every time we have had a new agreement, we have been \ninjured further.\n  I am going to offer several amendments to fast track when it is \nbefore the Senate. One deals with wheat from Canada. The unfairly \nsubsidized wheat coming in from Canada has injured our farmers in a \ndramatic way. The International Trade Commission says this wheat trade \nis unfair, and the trade ambassador, to his credit, says it is unfair. \nBut there is no specific remedy. It is a five-point remedy in the sweet \nby-and-by; we will never quite get to it.\n  My amendment will say we want specific remedies identified and \nreported to us within 6 months of what the trade ambassador is going to \ndo to take specific action and remedy the unfair wheat trade that \nexists with Canada and the unfair trade that exists in other markets \nwith respect to Canada. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, this administration is proposing on June 30 to allow long-haul \nMexican trucks into this country. That is in contravention of \neverything Congress debated just months ago on this issue. I am going \nto offer an amendment that tries to stop that.\n  Mr. President, you know and I know and everyone in this country knows \nMexican truckdrivers are not driving with the same safety requirements \nimposed in Mexico that we impose in this country. They do not have the \nsame safety inspections. They do not have the same requirements with \nrespect to length of service or hours of service or logbooks. I ask \neveryone to read the newspaper accounts of people riding with Mexican \nlong-haul truckers, and you will discover the truckers drove \ncontinuously for 24 hours or drove unsafe equipment.\n  The fact is this administration on June 30 is going to allow those \nlong-haul Mexican trucks to come into this country to do long hauls, \nand that is wrong, it is unsafe, and it ought not happen.\n  The safety requirements the Senate would have imposed some months ago \nwhen we debated this issue are nowhere near in place. The inspection \nstations do not exist. The compliance and enforcement requirements in \nMexico do not exist. The fact is, we are going to have American \nfamilies driving up and down American streets and highways with long-\nhaul Mexican trucks and no one is going to know whether that driver has \nbeen driving 24 straight hours or driving a rig with faulty brakes \nbecause it has not been inspected. I am going to offer an amendment on \nthat issue.\n  In addition, I am going to offer an amendment dealing with Cuba, and \nthat amendment will impose the same circumstances that were dropped out \nof the agriculture conference just last week. The amendment is very \nsimple. It says when Cuba buys grain from our country, it ought not \nhave to pay cash through a French bank; it ought to be able to buy \ngrain with commercially accepted credit from our country.\n  I am going to support the Dayton-Craig amendment which is very \nimportant. Our trade negotiators are prepared to negotiate away \nantidumping authority, the ability on behalf of our producers to remedy \ntrade that is unfair because someone else is dumping into our \nmarketplace. If we eliminate the antidumping remedies, we will put our \nproducers in desperate trouble. Their amendment is right on point. I \nintend to ask to cosponsor that amendment, and I will be very \nsupportive of it.\n\n  I also will be supportive of an amendment to be offered by Senator \nDurbin and will ask to be a cosponsor of that. That amendment deals \nwith labor and environmental standards with respect to trade. The issue \nfor this country should continue to be this: We want people to access \nthe American marketplace, to give the American consumer the widest \nrange of goods from all around the world, but we want it, when those \ngoods come in as a result of trade, to be fair trade.\n\n[[Page S4249]]\n\n  We do not want goods that come from prison labor in China. We do not \nwant goods to come into our marketplace that are made by 12-year-old \nkids working 12 hours a day being paid 12 cents an hour. That is not \nfair trade. It is not what this country ought to support, and it is not \nwhat we ought to allow into our marketplace.\n  Conditions of fair trade are very important, and as we discuss trade \nin this Chamber with the advent of the fast track debate, it is very \nimportant for us to say to the American people that there is an \nadmission price to the American economy, and the admission price to \nother countries is that their markets must be open to us and their \nmarkets and laws must represent fair trade with this country. That is \nnot a standard that now exists.\n  I do not want to put a wall around our country. I believe in expanded \ntrade. I believe in greater trade opportunity. But I believe also this \ncountry needs to have the spine and the backbone to stand up for its \nown economic interest and demand that trade be fair trade.\n  That will represent the several amendments I will be offering and \nsupporting, including the three I mentioned I will be offering soon.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The senior Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from North Dakota for \nseveral comments he made. I particularly commend him for his comments \nabout the issue regarding Cuba and how we might do a better job than we \nhave over the past 40 years of bringing democracy to that country.\n  After 40 years of failed policies, one might think a new approach \nwould be in order. I take note as well that as we speak today, a former \nPresident of the United States, President Carter, is in Cuba speaking \nto dissidents and human rights activists, as well as members of the \nGovernment of Cuba. That kind of exposure, that kind of engagement is \ngoing to do more to bring about the change we want to see in Cuba than \nthe insistence of a failed policy we have followed for the past four \ndecades.\n  I commend my colleague from North Dakota for his comments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/13/senate-section/article/S4249-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4249-S4250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to express my \ndeep disappointment at the announcement made last week by Under \nSecretary of State John Bolton with respect to the ``unsigning,'' as \nthey have called it, of the International Criminal Court. This \ndecision, in my view, is irresponsible, it is isolationist, and \ncontrary to our vital national interest.\n  Many of our closest allies--in fact, every one of our NATO allies--\nhas put their faith and vision in this new legal instrument, the \nInternational Criminal Court. To date, 66 nations have ratified the \nInternational Criminal Court and over 130 nations have signed on to \nthis particular effort, including those nations I mentioned--all of our \nNATO allies--countries such as France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and \nthe like. These are governments with deep ties to our Nation. We share \na deep sense of common values, a deep sense of democracy, and a deep \nsense of justice.\n  It is outrageous that the United States has now put itself in a \nposition of joining only a handful of rogue nations that are frightened \nto death of the International Criminal Court as we enter the 21st \ncentury. We should be joining these countries and supporting them in \ntheir commitment to making the Court work and strengthening \ninternational respect for the rule of law. That is what we stand for as \nAmericans. That is what we are trying to export around the world. In \naddition, we try to export the notion of justice, of fair justice, such \nas the symbols we see outside this building a block away: The Supreme \nCourt, Justice blindfolded with the scales equally divided.\n  That is what we have stood for as a nation for more than two \ncenturies. What a great shame it is that as we enter the 21st century, \nin an effort to establish an international criminal court of justice, \nthe Bush administration is going to ``unsign'' a document, a treaty, \nthat I think would have gone a long way to helping us achieve the very \ngoals incorporated in the Treaty of Rome.\n  We should have been rejoicing that finally with the entry and divorce \nof the court, any individual who commits genocide, war crimes, and \ncrimes against humanity would be on notice that he or she would be \nprosecuted for those offenses. I find it disheartening there is a lack \nof historical perspective when it comes to this issue. Let's remember \nit was the atrocities of World War II, the Holocaust, that lead to the \nestablishment of the Nuremberg Tribunal to bring those who committed \nsuch acts of violence and human rights violations to justice, which \nhighlighted the fact that there was a void in the international legal \nsystem. Those who participated in the Nuremberg process came to believe \nstrongly that a permanent international criminal court should be \nestablished to try future heinous international criminals. The hope was \nthat the existence of such a court would also serve as a deterrent to \nthose who might consider committing such crimes.\n  Unfortunately, the proposal floundered during 50 years of superpower \nrivalry, but the United States kept arguing that we ought to do this, \nthrough Republican and Democratic administrations. Conservatives, \nliberals, moderates all suggested and all argued at one time or another \nfor the importance of the establishment of such a court.\n  I have no doubt that such a court would have been extremely useful \nhad it existed during the last quarter of the 20th century. It should \nstill be fresh in our minds the fact that the end of the cold war, and \nthe explosion of ethnic brutality led to the necessity of creating ad \nhoc tribunals for Rwanda and Yugoslavia, but there was no means \navailable for trying the Idi Amins and Saddam Husseins of this world, \nor others who have been able to evade their nation's justice. With very \nfew exceptions, the world has stood helpless in the face of such crimes \nagainst humanity.\n  Had the court existed, it just might have deprived these tyrants of \nthe safe havens from prosecution. It just might have deterred some of \nthe worst atrocities and also prevented the U.S. service members from \nbeing sent into harm's way to reestablish the rule of law.\n  President Clinton, to his credit, appreciated that fact, and that is \nwhy he signed the treaty. He was not starry-eyed about it. However, he \nrecognized that additional safeguards with respect to the operation of \nthe court were needed in order to reassure those skeptical about the \ninternational organization, and he rightly decided that since the court \nwas still a work in progress, and given the role of the United States \nas a leader in the promotion of the rule of law, that it was in the \nnational interest of the United States to remain engaged with our \nallies as they moved forward to bring the Rome statute into force.\n  Some in the United States harbor the unreasonable fear that Americans \nwill be taken before this tribunal on politically motivated charges, \nfears that I believe are unfounded but fears that have not been \ndispelled with the erasing of our signature. U.S. men and women in \nuniform are no safer today than they were before Monday's announcement. \nIn fact, I argue they are in greater jeopardy because the court, as it \nis presently construed, does have flaws because we disengage from \nrewriting the court to try to establish better rules--the court is \ngoing into existence in a matter of weeks. Whether we signed it or not, \nit is becoming the international rule of law, and today that court \ncould have been stronger had we decided to remain engaged in helping \nframe the structure of the institution.\n\n  These men and women in uniform may be in some jeopardy, and my hope \nwould be they would not, but had we stayed engaged in this process, we \ncould have eliminated even that slight possibility. Moreover, to the \nbest of my knowledge, what we have done with respect to the ICC, the \n``unsigning'' of a treaty, is without precedent. I am sure there are \nlegal scholars on diplomacy that can correct me if I am wrong, but I \ncannot find a single example in the more than two centuries of history \nwhere an American President has unsigned an agreement.\n  Think of the precedent-setting nature of that act. Let's be clear: \nThe\n\n[[Page S4250]]\n\nU.S. withdrawing its signature, if it can so be done, does not annul \nthe court. In fact, it does not do that at all. But it would encourage \nother nations to remove their signatures from treaties that are vital \nto U.S. interests, and they will cite the example of an American \nPresident who unsigned a treaty for which he did not particularly care.\n  The fear in Washington is that American soldiers abroad, as I said, \nwould be charged unjustly with war crimes. Such a possibility is very \nremote. The court already contains strong safeguards that ensure it \nwill deal only with the most serious of international crimes and can \ntake a case only if a nation's own judicial system has declined to \ncarry out a conscientious investigation of the charges.\n  Does anyone really believe that in this country we would not pursue a \nperson in uniform who had committed heinous crimes to come before a bar \nof justice?\n  The Rwandan and former Yugoslavian tribunals, which have rendered \nfair and reasonable judgments, show that America has little to fear \nfrom such a court. The Clinton administration negotiators were able to \nsignificantly improve the court's rules. Continued engagement, as I \nsaid a moment ago, by the Bush administration could have built upon \nthat record.\n  One would have thought it was in the interest of the United States \nnot to miss a chance to affect the selection of judges in the \ndefinition of new crimes, issues that should matter to us and to our \nallies. Apparently that is not the case.\n  A few weeks ago, on April 11, governments gathered in New York to \nmark what they called the depositing of the 66th instrument of \nratification of the Rome statute, meaning that the international \ncriminal court will come into existence this July. The court is going \nto exist and, unfortunately, we are going to be on the outside.\n  We have made further announcements we will not even support or assist \nthe court as it tries to gather information against those who may have \ncommitted these dreadful crimes that the court would have jurisdiction \nover.\n  I am deeply disturbed by this action. I think it is a huge mistake. \nWhat are the implications of this course the Bush administration has \nset for the United States? The United States no longer can credibly \nvoice its opinion on who should be selected to be the court's judges \nand prosecutors, nor will we be taken seriously if we attempt to use \nour seat in the U.N. Security Council to refer situations to the court, \nsuch as the current conflict in Sudan that has already claimed over 2 \nmillion lives as a result of war crimes, genocide, and crimes against \nhumanity.\n\n  Finally, our words will fall on deaf ears when we purport to act as \nan unbiased watchdog of the court's integrity having denounced its \nfundamental purposes. We have also lost the opportunities that ensure \nthe court stays focused on its primary task, that of bringing to \njustice the world's worst criminals.\n  I have cited a number of vital American interests that are wrapped up \nin this institution, the court. Those interests are not going to be \nerased with the name of the United States gone from the Rome statute. \nThe administration may have struck a responsive cord with a right-wing \nantimultilateralist constituency with this announcement, but it has \njeopardized the interests of all Americans in so doing.\n  The administration could have taken the higher road, the responsible \nroad, recognizing that there is a constructive and useful role the \nUnited States could perform without making a decision at this juncture \nconcerning U.S. ratification. Sadly, President Bush has chosen not to \ndo so.\n  While some may be cheering the administration's decision, those of us \nwho care deeply about promoting the rule of law are not. The issue has \nparticular significance for me. My father, Thomas Dodd, was an \nexecutive trial counsel at Nuremberg in 1945 and 1946. The Nuremberg \ntrials of the leading Nazi war criminals following World War II was a \nlandmark of the struggle to deter and punish crimes of war and \ngenocide, setting the stage for the Geneva and genocide conventions. It \nwas also largely an American initiative.\n  Today, instead of America being a leader in the pursuit of global \njustice, we would act to throw up roadblocks toward that goal. Make no \nmistake about it, today was a setback in the promotion of global \njustice. Today was a setback for what America is supposed to stand for, \nand I regret this decision very deeply indeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/13/senate-section/article/S4250-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4250-S4251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TERRORISM INSURANCE\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I note the presence of the distinguished \nSenator from Nevada who has spoken to me on numerous occasions about \nthe efforts to get a bill passed dealing with terrorism insurance. In \nhis State, and I think particularly Las Vegas, major construction \nefforts have been slowed down tremendously because of the inability to \nacquire terrorism insurance. We have been very close since last fall in \ncoming to an agreement to bring up a bill and to allow a series of \namendments to be offered, debated, disposed of, and then to move on to \nreconcile the differences with the House-passed bill so that we might \neliminate this roadblock that is causing a slowdown in economic growth \nin this country.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side--I have worked very closely \nwith Senator Gramm of Texas, with the minority leader, the Republican \nleader, Trent Lott, to try to come up with a framework that can work. \nOn this side of the aisle, Senator Daschle, our Democratic leader, \nalong with Senator Schumer and others who have been interested in the \nsubject matter, we have received unanimous consent--my colleague from \nNevada can correct me if I am wrong on this side to move forward with a \nproposal allowing for a series but limited number of amendments, to a \ndefined period of time to be considered and then final passage of a \nbill. There have been objections filed on the other side so we have not \nbeen able to proceed.\n\n  Let there be no doubt, there is 100-percent agreement on this side of \nthe aisle to move to the terrorism insurance bill. Every day we wait, a \nday delayed is a job lost, a project gets stalled and the economy \nsuffers. This is a serious issue. We ought to be able to get to a bill, \nconsider amendments, let there be a decision by this body whether to \nsupport or reject amendments, get to final passage and try to resolve \nthis issue.\n  To those who call my office on an hourly basis wondering whether we \nwill get a terrorism insurance bill, let me be as clear as I possibly \ncan: There is no objection on this side of the aisle; there is on the \nother.\n  My hope is we can resolve the objections. This has gone on week after \nweek after week. There is no reason we cannot define amendments, allow \nfor their consideration, allow for their disposition, and get to the \nthird reading and final passage of a bill. My hope is that will happen \nthis week so we can resolve the differences with the House and send a \nbill to the President for his signature.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, he is absolutely right. We have worked \nhard under the direction and guidance of the Senator from Connecticut \nand gotten everyone to sign off on a package we can bring to the floor. \nThe other side wanted two amendments and then four amendments; and we \nhave agreed. It seems to me we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of \nthe good. It needs to be done.\n  I am sure the Senator would agree, if someone has a problem, propose \nfloor amendments, we will debate and vote and move on. This has become \nserious. The Senator from Connecticut has had developers in his office, \nthe people who lend money and want to lend money, people in the \nconstruction business, in addition to the specialized construction \nbusiness, in addition to developers. I can go through a list of others \nwho have been to see us who are extremely concerned about our country, \nin addition to their businesses.\n  I have heard on a number of occasions the majority leader \nacknowledging the work of the Senator on this issue, and I join with \nhim. We need to nudge this forward a bit more and get this matter \nresolved. Time is wasting. In another 10 days we will be taking a week \nbreak to go home for the Memorial recess, and then the Fourth of July. \nIn the meantime, there are construction projects not going forward.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator for his comments. He is exactly right. \nIn\n\n[[Page S4251]]\n\naddition to the organizations he mentioned, this means jobs. Business \ncannot get lending from the banks because the banks will not lend money \nwithout terrorism insurance. There is no proposal that allows us to \nbridge the gap since September 11.\n  It is very difficult to get this insurance because it is very \ndifficult to price. Prior to the events of September 11 we had some \nacts of terrorism, but they were isolated and limited. What happened on \nSeptember 11 has changed so many aspects of this country, including the \nquestion of how to calculate the cost of terrorism insurance. Banks do \nnot want to lend money. This is a practical matter. I wish it were \notherwise. They do not want to lend money when the terrorism insurance \nwill not be written, and it will not get written because people do not \nknow how to price or cost it.\n  The idea was to frame some proposal to allow a bridge for a couple of \nyears while the pricing of this product could be calculated, and to get \nthe Federal Government out of it altogether but have us presently \ninvolved as a backstop should some catastrophic event occur. We would \nhave a backstop so it would not wipe people out.\n  I am told today that if we have an event such as September 11 again, \nthe insurance that exists today could only deal with about 20 percent \nof the cost of what happened on that day. Knowing that, we begin to \nunderstand why banks are not lending the money; why, then, developers, \ncontractors, and so forth, are not going forward with their projects; \nand why people are being laid off. We have a ripple effect. That is the \nreason we need this bill.\n  I am not suggesting this is a perfect bill. But we do believe this \nproposal provides that gap for 23-36 months to allow for the pricing \nand free market factors to take over the costing out of terrorism \ninsurance. In the absence of that happening, we get further delays. All \nthe insurance contracts are being rewritten this year.\n  It is a major economic issue, one that cries out for an answer. I \nurge my colleagues on the other side not to hold this up any longer and \nnot object to moving forward. If Members have a proposal, come forward \nand we will accommodate that amendment and vote on it one way or the \nother but don't stop the bill from moving forward altogether.\n  That is what is happening today and what has gone on for several \nmonths. It is causing great economic damage to the country. Talk to any \nmajor financial institution, talk to any major insurance company in \nthis country, and they will say the same thing. The Republican \nobjections to going forward on this bill are costing this country \ndearly. We need them to lift those objections, consider this bill, up \nor down, vote it up or down, but move on. Quit objecting to moving \nforward.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will discuss a bill we have introduced \nin the last several weeks that I think is very important. It is called \nthe Medicare Equity for Veterans Act of 2002. It is designed to provide \nsome fairness between Medicare and VA health care. There are a number \nof Members who have introduced the bill that will require Medicare \nservices to reimburse the VA facilities for services rendered to \ncertain Medicare-eligible veterans. These service men and women have \npaid into Social Security and Medicare as have the rest of us but are \nprohibited from utilizing the program when they are treated at a VA \nfacility. It is only fair that they be allowed to use their Medicare \ncoverage in the private sector or at a VA facility.\n  An interesting thing has happened in the numbers with respect to \nveterans. The number of veterans enrolled in VA health care systems has \nmore than doubled since 1996. Many VA facilities-eligible veterans, \ncalled priority 7, or category C veterans, being veterans who have \nserved but their disabilities are not related to their military service \nand are able, financially, to care for themselves. This is where we \nhave seen the greatest increase in the patient load.\n  At the VA facility in Cheyenne, WY there were only 131 of these \npriority 7 veterans who were treated in fiscal year 1997.\n  However, in fiscal year 2001, the same facility treated over 2,200 \npriority 7 veterans. So, clearly, the VA is experiencing substantial \ngrowth in that area and it is utilizing facilities--and that is good.\n  But the veterans are unable, even though they are eligible, to use \ntheir Medicare assistance. With this increase in numbers, \nunfortunately, the VA health care system has not kept pace in terms of \nits finances. In my State, Medicare would expand access to services in \nmost communities and would provide primary care to those for whom it is \nnot now available.\n  Specifically, the Medicare Equity for Veterans Act of 2002 \nestablishes a 3-year demonstration program at 10 VA sites, 3 of which \nmust be in rural areas. The Secretary of VA and HHS will either choose \na Medicare+Choice or preferred provider option model for these sites. \nThe options would give the Secretary some flexibility in that way.\n  We have more and more veterans who are in this category 7 who would \nlike very much to use VA facilities to care for their needs. They are \neligible for Medicare, and Medicare would then reimburse the VA. We \nwould be able to do two things, of course: to be able to finance the VA \nfacilities and at the same time be able to let these eligible veterans \nuse their Medicare services.\n  I hope we can move this bill. I think it will be very good for VA \nveterans. I think it will also be good for Medicare. It can probably be \ndone more cheaply than the private sector. The combination is a good \nremedy to some of the problems we have.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/13/senate-section/article/S4251-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I will speak in morning business but really \non the subject of our 6 o'clock vote, the nomination of Paul Cassell to \nbe judge for the district court serving the State of Utah.\n  I am not from Utah, obviously. And you might ask, what is an Arizona \nSenator doing speaking on behalf of a nominee from another State? The \nanswer to that question is, I have gotten to know Paul Cassell, and I \nam a very big fan of Paul Cassell. I think he will do a superb job on \nthe bench. I just want to take a couple minutes of my colleagues' time \nto explain why.\n  It is not often we have the opportunity, as Senators, to vote for a \nnominee, who we really have gotten to know in our work in the Senate, \nto serve as a district judge in another State. But Paul Cassell has \ntestified before the Senate Judiciary Committee and has worked many \nhours with Senator Feinstein and myself and some other Senators in \nhelping to craft the victims' rights constitutional amendment.\n\n[[Page S4252]]\n\n  You can have a view either for or against that amendment, but \nProfessor Laurence Tribe from Harvard and Professor Paul Cassell from \nthe University of Utah are the two legal professors, constitutional \nscholars, who have helped us most. They may represent different points \non the political spectrum perhaps, but in terms of their legal \nscholarship and their ability to work together in helping us to craft \nthis amendment, they have performed a magnificent service.\n  Again, whatever one thinks of the particular amendment, you cannot \ndeny that these two professors have contributed significantly to the \nwork of the Senate and, therefore, to the American people as a result \nof their work.\n  Let me just tell you a little bit about Professor Cassell first and \nthen talk about his work on behalf of victims of crime. As I say, that \nis one of the primary reasons I am so supportive of him.\n  As I said, he is a member of the facility at the University of Utah \nCollege of Law where he teaches criminal procedure and evidence and \nsome other courses as well.\n  He has published over 25 Law Review articles, as well as major op-eds \nand various periodicals.\n  Before entering academia, Professor Cassell served as an assistant \nU.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia and as Associate \nDeputy Attorney General at our Department of Justice.\n  He clerked for then-Judge Antonin Scalia in the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the D.C. Circuit and then for Chief Justice Warren Burger of the \nU.S. Supreme Court.\n  Those of us familiar with these facts know if you are able to clerk \nfor both a member of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and then for the \nChief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, you are a law student graduate \nwith something on the ball. Certainly, Professor Cassell fits that \ncategory.\n  He received his J.D. in 1984 from Stanford University, where he was \nOrder of the Coif and president of the Stanford Law Review.\n  So his academic credentials and his postacademic career have been \noutstanding.\n  He tried a number of cases when he was assistant U.S. attorney. As a \nmatter of fact, he prosecuted 17 felony jury trials, and some of them \nwere very famous cases. I will let others talk about those cases. But \none of the most interesting things to me that Professor Cassell did--\npurely without pay; as a volunteer--was to represent the victims of the \nOklahoma City bombing case.\n\n  You may ask, why did the victims in the Oklahoma City bombing case \nneed representation? You can imagine, having as many victims as there \nwere in that case--people who were either injured in the bombing or the \nfamilies of people who were killed, all wanting to be involved or \nparticipate in some way in that case, including even just the ability \nto be in the courtroom--it was a major battle.\n  As a matter of fact, the judge in that case--not once but twice--\nruled that the families of the victims did not have a right to be in \nthe courtroom during the trial. This was not because there were so many \npeople that they could not all fit into the courtroom, although that \nwas another issue, but the reason the court ruled that way was that the \ndefense had argued it would be prejudicial to the defense, to the \ndefendants, if the victims or their families were actually in the \ncourtroom during the trial. Never mind that a judge always has the \nability to say: Everybody will be motionless, will show no emotion, \nwill behave themselves; and if they do not, then I will toss them out \nof the courtroom. That was not good enough in this case.\n  We in Congress passed a law saying: You have to let the people who \nwere victims of the Oklahoma City bombing case sit in the courtroom. \nThe case went back to the judge, and again the judge said no. One of \nthe reasons he said no had to do with the reason for the victims' \nrights constitutional amendment, which I will not go into now, but \nbasically he said the defendants' rights are in the U.S. Constitution, \nand the mere statute of Congress cannot override that. So these victims \nare going to have to have special rights. They are going to have to be \nin the Constitution. That is another argument, as I said.\n  But Paul Cassell, out of the goodness of his heart, represented all \nthe victims in that case. I think the victims I have talked to would \ntell you, to a person, they were extraordinarily indebted to Paul \nCassell for his service to them in that case.\n  There is much more I could say about this individual. Paul Cassell is \na decent person who believes very strongly in the rights of both \ndefendants and victims in the courtroom. He has served as a prosecutor \nfor the United States of America and, therefore, has represented our \nGovernment in many cases against some truly bad felons. He has \nexperience on the criminal side and on the civil side and has \nexperience as a law professor, teaching not only constitutional law but \nevidence. That makes him uniquely qualified to go from where he is now \nto the bench.\n  It is not often that we find people who have this wide array of \nexperience willing to serve on the Federal district court. It is much \ntoo easy in today's world for lawyers to make good money in the \npractice of law. But it is obvious that Paul Cassell has never been \ninterested in just making money. He has wanted to serve, first, the \npeople of the United States of America as an assistant U.S. attorney \nand then through his professorship to serve victims of crime and others \non a purely pro bono basis.\n  We have a unique person who not only is extraordinarily well \nqualified from his academic experience and the breadth of his practice \nexperience but who also has demonstrated a desire to serve the people. \nFor a person as young to have that kind of commitment and to be willing \nto go on the Federal district court is unique and certainly should \ncause us to vote for his confirmation.\n  I know him personally. We couldn't do better than to confirm Paul \nCassell to serve on the Federal district court in the State of Utah. I \ncommend my colleagues to support his confirmation when we vote in a \nlittle over an hour.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Bush administration continues its push \nfor fast track trade authority under the fictitious term ``trade \npromotion authority.'' This is legislation that would enable the \nPresident to negotiate trade agreements without full congressional \ninput. With fast track authority, there would be only limited Senate \ndebate. With fast track authority the full Senate will have no \nopportunity to amend. Most Members of Congress will have no opportunity \nto protect the interests of the people, the communities, and the \nindustries of their particular States, including ensuring the \nprotection of the standard of living of our workers and their families \nwithin those States and communities.\n  Although the Constitution clearly gives Congress the duty--and the \npower, it gives Congress the power--``to regulate commerce with foreign \nnations,'' with fast track authority the Congress will simply applaud a \npresidential trade-negotiating effort by approving a trade agreement, \nor boo the effort by disapproving it. That is pretty unlikely, that it \nwould be disapproved.\n  Members of Congress should never allow our options to be so \nrestricted. We were sent here to promote and to protect the interests \nof our States as well as the national good, and those goals are best \nserved by debate and amendment, particularly with regard to trade \ndeals.\n  The workers of this Nation are losing ground, in large part, due to \npoor trade agreements. For Congress to abdicate its constitutional \nauthority here is to, in my view, turn its back on millions of American \nworkers--the workers who are the backbone of this Nation, and who \ndeserve more than a cursory, neglectful wink and nod.\n\n[[Page S4253]]\n\n  Let us focus for a moment on just one sector of our economy, \nmanufacturing. There is no question that manufacturing has continued to \ngrow during the past several decades. For example, real, inflation \nadjusted, manufacturing sales as a percentage of GDP continue to \nincrease.\n  And there is no question that certain manufacturing industries such \nas those involved in high-technology products--for example, electronic \nequipment, industrial machinery, and chemicals--have prospered.\n  United States production of electronic equipment rose by nearly 400 \npercent--to be precise, 393.5 percent--while industrial machinery \nincreased by 155 percent. Even fabricated metal products and motor \nvehicles have experienced an increase in real output since 1990.\n  There is also no question that in recent decades a number of our \nvital industries could be placed on an endangered species list. \nBeginning in the 1970s and continuing through the 1990s, for too many \nAmerican industries the story of American manufacturing has been a \ntragic story of bankruptcies, consolidations, plant closings, plant \nshutdowns, and movement overseas. These industries missed the economic \nboom of the 1990s because they have been drowning in a flood of cheap \nimports.\n\n  Since 1997, 33 steel companies have filed for bankruptcy, affecting \n73,000 workers.\n  During the 1990s, 352 paper mills and paper converting plants \npermanently closed. Last year alone, 36 mills closed, and 15 more are \nslated for closing this year.\n  The American textile industry is suffering its worst crisis since the \nGreat Depression of the 1930s. During the past year, more than 10 \nAmerican textile mills have closed, and industrial giants such as \nBurlington Industries, Malden Mills, and Guilford Mills have sought \nbankruptcy protection.\n  Between 1989 and 2000, the real dollar value of apparel industry \noutput failed by nearly 20 percent--19.6 percent to be exact. There was \na 27.9-percent decline in the instruments industry and a 3.7-percent \ndecline in the real output of the paper products industry.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, at least 18 American \nindustries experienced negative or slow output growth between the years \n1980 and 2000--so much so that each one could be added to the \nendangered industries list.\n  The decline in these industries is reflected, to some extent, in the \ndecline in employment in the manufacturing industries. In 1970, \napproximately one-third of the private sector workforce was engaged in \nmanufacturing. By 2000, it had fallen to 17 percent.\n  So from 1970 to 2000, employment in the manufacturing industries fell \nfrom one-third of the private sector workforce to 17 percent--half--\nfrom 33 percent to 17 percent. Cut in half. That is like the wisest man \nof all time threatening to cut the baby in half.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, at least 19 \nindustries--nearly all in manufacturing--experienced the loss of one-\nthird or more jobs since 1980. There was a 52-percent decrease in \nmachine tools, a 67-percent decrease in employment in blast furnaces \nand steel mills, and an 83-percent decrease in employment in nonrubber \nfootwear. Read it and weep.\n  I realize that a substantial portion of this decline in manufacturing \nemployment is due to increased productivity. Millions of workers are \nlosing their jobs because of technological progress, more efficient \nmanagement of resources, and because productivity has grown faster than \nsales. Nevertheless, there is no question but that certain sectors of \nour economy--especially those in the industries I have mentioned--are \nbeing clobbered by imports.\n  Between 1994 and 2000, the U.S. trade deficit of $182 billion \nincreased 141.6 percent to $439 billion--inflation adjusted 2000 \ndollars. This soaring trade deficit has taken an incredible toll on \nAmerican jobs. Between 1994 and 2000, according to an analysis by the \nEconomic Policy Institute, trade deficits eliminated a net total of 3 \nmillion actual and potential jobs from the U.S. economy.\n  The manufacturing sector has shouldered the burden of this increased \ndeficit, as the manufacturing trade deficit rose by 158.5 percent. Of \nthe 3 million trade-related job losses between 1994 and 2000, 1.9 \nmillion were in manufacturing. This means that nearly two of every \nthree lost jobs were in manufacturing. In other words, 1.9 million jobs \nout of 3 million jobs were in manufacturing. That is, manufacturing \nconstituted 65 percent of all trade-related job losses.\n  These trade-related job losses happened as increased globalization \nencouraged American industries to pack up and seek other lands where \nlabor is cheaper and where industries do not have to comply with the \nenvironmental and safety standards in the United States. The \nInternational Trade Commission has reported that roughly half of the \ntotal productive capacity in the apparel industry has shifted from \ndeveloped countries to less developed countries over the past three \ndecades, where workers earn far less than their American counterparts.\n\n  What are we doing? What are we doing in our trade agreements to \nprotect American jobs? The answer has to be: Not enough.\n  Globalization has also left our industries more vulnerable to the \nunfair predatory trade practices of foreign countries. Look at the \nAmerican steel industry, which has been absolutely devastated by the \ndumping of cheap foreign steel and of government-subsidized, imported \nsteel. Last October, the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled that \nimports of foreign steel have indeed caused serious injury to American \nsteelmakers. The Commission reported that imported steel has seriously \nhurt domestic steelmakers in about half of 33 product lines examined, \ncovering about 80 percent of what steel companies produce in America.\n  ``Fifty years of foreign government intervention in the global steel \nmarket''--someone said last month in announcing tariffs on imported \nsteel--``has resulted in bankruptcies, serious dislocation, and job \nloss.'' Who was that someone? The President of the United States, \nPresident Bush.\n  NAFTA, which was enacted under fast-track authority, and which I \nvoted against, was supposed to eliminate most of these causes of the \nAmerican trade deficit and lessen the foreign assaults upon American \nindustries. Instead, the increased globalization unleashed under NAFTA \nand the World Trade Organization has exacerbated the problem, not \nsolved it. I have been on the right side in both instances; I have \nopposed both. Since 1994, when NAFTA created the free trade zone, North \nCarolina has lost more than 125,500 jobs in the textile and apparel \nindustries, or 47 percent of the workforce.\n\n  The Mississippi Business Journal reports that the garment industry in \nMississippi has virtually disappeared in the post-NAFTA era. We gave it \naway.\n  This decline in American manufacturing has meant a declining standard \nof living, not just for the affected workers and their families but for \ntheir communities and their States.\n  Workers have been forced out of higher wage, industrial jobs into \nlow-paying service jobs. In 1980, private-sector service employment \nconstituted 65 percent of the American private sector workforce; by the \nyear 2000, the percentage had soared to 77 percent.\n  Service jobs are notoriously low-skill, low-paying jobs that offer \nlimited opportunities for advancement because there are relatively few \nmanagement positions. Look at South Carolina, a State that is near the \ntop of the job creation list in the 1990s but it ranks 35th in average \nwages--$25,493. A study of a 5-year period, 1992 to 1997, in that State \nindicated the creation of 94,572 service jobs, a 40.6-percent increase \nin a sector that pays lower than the statewide average. The higher \npaying manufacturing sector, the traditional mainstay of South \nCarolina's economy, lost nearly 1,000 jobs during the 5-year period. In \n1997, the State's service employees earned an average $22,693, compared \nto the average of $29,820 for employees in the State's manufacturing \njobs. Economists in the State of South Carolina point out that even \nwith the growth in the service industries, South Carolina's per capita \nincome is among the Nation's lowest.\n\n  Unfortunately, the holders of these service jobs are often thought to \nbe students looking for summer work, or marginal workers seeking \nspending money, or people simply in need of a quick stopover job while \non their way\n\n[[Page S4254]]\n\nto a better paying career. In other words, service jobs are presented \nas great jobs for people who do not really need them, in many \ninstances. The truth is, people do need these jobs, and many of the \nholders of these jobs are adults who depend on that paycheck to pay \nrent or child care. Many are former industrial workers simply trying to \nexist in the new economy.\n  Studies of counties in Colorado, Missouri, and Mississippi found a \ndeclining standard of living for workers and their communities as they \nmoved from manufacturing jobs to service jobs.\n  Martha Burt of the Urban Institute found that the growth of \nhomelessness in the United States in the 1980s was not, as commonly \nsupposed, the result of drug addiction, or the deinstitutionalization \nof the mentally ill, nor the cutbacks in social programs during the \nReagan administration, but the shift from an industrial economy to a \nservice economy. With the decline in manufacturing jobs in the 1970s, \nshe explains, huge numbers of former full-time factory workers earning \nunion wages were replaced with part-time workers in retail stores, \nrestaurants, and other service jobs, where wages are too low to enable \nthem to afford the price of housing.\n  The facts are, as the Stearns Trustee Professor of Political Economy \nat Northeastern University, Barry Bluestone, emphasizes, even workers \nwho retain manufacturing jobs also face a bleak future, a future of a \ndeclining standard of living, if we do not revise our trade polices and \ninsist upon effective labor and environmental standards in our trade \nagreements. This is because competition from countries which lack, or \ndo not enforce, labor and environmental standards, continues to have a \nlarge, negative impact on employment in key sectors of our economy, and \non American wages and living standards across the board.\n  With the rise of international competition and the shift to lower \nwage service jobs in the United States, real wages have stagnated, \nmaking life much more difficult for all American workers. Real average \nweekly earnings peaked in 1972 at $315.44. Today, even with some \nrecovery in real wages due to the rapid growth in the economy in the \n1990s, the average weekly wage is nearly 12 percent less than at its \npeak.\n  This decline in real wages is forcing American workers to work longer \nhours than ever before in order to maintain their living standards. \nThey are running in place--sweating on a treadmill operated by the \nhyper zealots of free trade regardless of consequences. In fact, the \nUnited States is the only major developed country that has experienced \nan increase in the average workweek and the average work year. Since \n1982, the average workweek among prime-age workers in the United States \nhas increased from 39.6 hours to 41.3 in 2000.\n  This means that the average work year has increased from around 1,840 \nhours to over 2,020. Put simply, stagnating wages are forcing Americans \nto work longer and longer hours just to maintain their standard of \nliving. They are not getting ahead. They are simply maintaining what \nthey have worked so hard for, if, indeed, they are even maintaining \nthat.\n  This is why the Congress must protect and exercise its right to amend \ntrade agreements. Why do we give away Congress' power to amend trade \nagreements?\n  We must insist on establishing universal labor and environmental \nstandards. We must insist on protecting American industries from even \nmore devastation by unfair competition from firms operating abroad, \nexploiting cheap labor pools, and tolerating working conditions which \nare unacceptably harsh, and environmental standards which are \nnonexistent.\n  These essential universal labor and environmental standards can be \nextracted only through our trade agreements.\n  In the 1930s, the United States instituted a range of laws and \nregulations to protect workers and the environment. We did this at the \nFederal level so that individual States could not take unfair advantage \nof other States by lowering their minimum wages, permitting child and \nprison labor, ignoring occupational and safety provisions, eliminating \nor reducing unemployment benefits, or disregarding environmental \nstandards. We leveled the playing field domestically. No one could \nmanipulate for advantage.\n  Now we must level the playing field in international competition, \nwhere American workers are too often forced to play by the rules in a \nrigged game. In our new, globalized economy, we run the risk of \nundermining our own hard won labor and environmental standards if other \ncountries choose to have none of their own or refuse to enforce \nreasonable requirements. Congress, which has the constitutional power, \nand therefore the duty ``to regulate commerce with foreign nations,'' \nmust have the means to insist on reasonable labor and environmental \nstandards as part of any and all trade agreements. This is to the \nbenefit not only of American workers, but also of workers, both \nchildren and adults, who are laboring under oppressive, unsafe, and \nunhealthy conditions in other lands.\n  Over the years, I have seen administrations--Republican and \nDemocratic--repeatedly negotiate trade agreements that reflected \npriorities other than those of the American people. I say that with a \nbackground of 50 years in Congress, the House of Representatives and \nthe Senate, so let me say it again. I have seen administrations--\nRepublican and Democratic--repeatedly negotiate trade agreements that \nreflected priorities other than those of the American people. I have \nseen this Nation genuflect at the altar of big business interests. I \nhave witnessed the holy battle cry of ``free trade'' become a club by \nwhich to beat into submission any voice that expressed an argument for \nbalance and fairness. That is understandably the outcome of trade talks \nthat ignore the constitutional role of the Congress in international \ncommerce.\n\n  While it is not surprising that Republican and Democratic \nadministrations would attempt to enter into trade agreements that \nreflect their own priorities, it is absolutely distressing--it is \nextremely puzzling to this Senator--that the Members of Congress would \nwillingly give up their right to shape trade agreements that reflect \nthe priorities of the American people, and the best interests of the \nUnited States. It just demonstrates how cowed and how intimidating we \nin public life have become by the absolute terror of bumper sticker \npolitics. Free trade is the battle cry. Don't complicate it with real \nworld concerns.\n  As a U.S. Senator from West Virginia, I am always--first, last, and \nall the time--for the protection of the interests of this country, of \nthis Nation's workers, and this country's manufacturing industries and \nI am going to continue being that way by opposing the granting of \nblanket fast track authority for this or any other President.\n  Call it trade promotion authority, if you will--it is still fast \ntrack--to give away American interests when it comes to trade.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/13/senate-section/article/S4254-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \ngo into executive session and proceed to the consideration of Executive \nCalendar No. 815, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Paul G. Cassell, of \nUtah, to be United States District Judge for the District of Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 6 \np.m. will be for debate on the nomination, equally divided between the\n\n[[Page S4255]]\n\nchairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee or their \ndesignees.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  I know Professor Cassell is a friend of the distinguished senior \nSenator from Utah, who has urged his confirmation. I do not know \nwhether, as a courtesy, the senior Senator wanted to go first.\n  Mr. HATCH. Whatever the distinguished chairman prefers.\n  I thank the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to voice my strong support for \nProfessor Paul G. Cassell, who is President Bush's nominee to the \nDistrict Court for the District of Utah.\n  This nomination is very important to my home State of Utah. In fact, \nthe chief judge of the Federal District Court in Utah is sitting in the \naudience. This is so important for them, for everyone in Utah, and to \nme personally. I would like to take a few minutes to introduce this \nexemplary lawyer to the Senate, and to explain why Professor Cassell is \none of the most qualified people ever nominated to the district court \nbench.\n  Listen to the highlights of Professor Cassell's resume: He graduated \nfrom Stanford Law School, where he was president of the Stanford Law \nReview and a member of the Order of the Coif--the highest honors you \ncan have in law school. He served as a law clerk to then-Judge Antonin \nScalia on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, and to Chief \nJustice Warren E. Burger of the U.S. Supreme Court. He then went to the \nJustice Department, where he served as an Associate Deputy Attorney \nGeneral, handling a variety of complex legal issues--including the \nefforts to defend the constitutionality of the United States Sentencing \nGuidelines, passed by Congress to regulate unwarranted sentencing \ndisparity. Next, he worked as an assistant U.S. attorney in the Eastern \nDistrict of Virginia. In that position, Cassell tried more than a dozen \njury trials in felony criminal cases, obtaining guilty verdicts in \nevery case that reached the jury.\n  I would like to highlight a couple of cases he tried there. Cassell \nsuccessfully prosecuted the CEO of a failed savings and loan for theft \nof $500,000; two investors and a real estate agent who had defrauded a \nHUD program; a drug dealer who was smuggling guns and a federally \nlicensed firearms dealer who had aided him in this effort; and the \nnotorious ``yellow glove'' bank robber, who had perpetrated a string of \narmed robberies in Virginia and Maryland. He also successfully \nprosecuted the largest seizure of crack cocaine in the history of \nNational Airport at that time. For his efforts in cases such as these, \nCassell was recognized by the Attorney General with a Special \nAchievement Award.\n  Professor Cassell's impressive resume and his experience in court are \nno doubt the reason why a substantial majority of the ABA review \ncommittee rates Professor Cassell ``well qualified'' to be a federal \njudge. it is also the reason why a number of people who know Professor \nCassell's work and character have written to me in support of his \nnomination.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a selection of such \nletters printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I apologize for my laryngitis. I have had \nit for about 2 weeks.\n  Professor Cassell's educational achievements, Department of Justice \nexperience, and successes in trial are just a warm-up, in my opinion, \nfor an even more important chapter of his career. In 1992, Cassell and \nhis wife, Trish, returned to the West after he accepted a teaching \nposition at the University of Utah College of Law. It was there that he \nunleashed his intellect and tremendous work ethic for the benefit of \nhis students, the faculty, the citizens of Utah, and the Nation's \nvictims of crime.\n  Professor Cassell quickly became one of the students' favorite \nteachers. He has always prepared well for his classes, he uses relevant \nreal-world examples from his career as a prosecutor, and he teaches \nwith an approachable demeanor--and even a sense of humor. These are \nsome of the qualities that led, in 1997, to Professor Cassell's being \none of the youngest law professors ever to receive the Faculty \nAchievement Award for Teaching Excellence--the ``teacher of the year'' \naward. Three years later in 2000, Cassell became one of the youngest \nchaired faculty members at the University of Utah when he was awarded \nthe James I. Farr Professorship of Law.\n  As a scholar, Professor Cassell has become a national expert on \ncriminal procedure and evidence. His scholarship includes over 25 law \nreview articles, which have been published in such prestigious journals \nas the Stanford Law Review, the Michigan Law Review, the UCLA Law \nReview, the Brigham Young University Law Review, and the Utah Law \nReview. He has also made presentations at law schools around the \ncountry, including Harvard, Stanford, Berkeley, Michigan, Northwestern, \nand UCLA. He has shared his knowledge and expertise with Congress, \ntestifying numerous times before congressional committees on issues \npertaining to criminal justice, including testimony on victims' rights, \ncapital punishment, Miranda, and criminal cases in the United States \nSupreme Court.\n  Unlike many scholars, however, Professor Cassell has also put his \nintellect to practical use in his community. For example, Professor \nCassell has been actively involved in fighting domestic violence and \nsexual assault in Utah. He has served as the chair of the Legislative \nCommittee of the Utah Council on Victims of Crime as well as a member \non the Utah Supreme Court's Advisory Committee on Rules of Criminal \nProcedure.\n  Professor Cassell has donated an extraordinary amount of time \nadvocating on behalf of his fellow Utahns in court. In fact, he has \ndone as much or more pro bono legal work as anyone I can remember ever \nappearing before the Judiciary Committee. He has represented dozens and \ndozens of crime victims, all without charge.\n  Let me give just one example--a case that came to my attention \nbecause of the moving letter I received from the victim's mother. It is \nthe case called State v. Casey, in which Cassell argued on behalf of a \n12-year-old Utah boy who had been victimized by sexual assault. When \nthe boy was denied his right to speak in opposition to a plea bargain \nreducing the charge from a first-degree aggravated felony to a \nmisdemeanor, Cassell had the case certified to the Utah Supreme Court \nas one involving an issue of ``exceptional importance'' and argued the \nissue on the boy's behalf. The boy's mother wrote me a letter about \nCassell's work in that case, saying that Cassell:\n\n     . . . was the first attorney who listened to us with interest \n     and understanding.\n\n  She explained that:\n\n       Paul worked long and late hours on our case . . . at no \n     financial gain for himself.\n\n  Because of Cassell's work, she said her family:\n\n     . . . can now start to move forward with our lives, putting \n     the tragic past behind us.\n\n  It is not only Utahns who can say such things about Paul Cassell, \nbecause in addition to his work in our home State, Cassell has worked \nfree of charge on behalf of crime victims all across the country. For \nexample, in 1996, Cassell undertook to represent 89 victims of the \nOklahoma City bombing. They had been ordered not to watch court \nproceedings in the case if they were going to provide so-called impact \ntestimony at the death-penalty phase of Timothy McVeigh's trail. This \norder appeared to contravene the requirements of the victims bill of \nrights, a Federal statute passed by Congress to guarantee crime victims \nthe right to attend court proceedings. Cassell appealed to the tenth \ncircuit, which rejected the petition on the grounds that crime victims \nlacked standing to present their claims to a appellate court. Cassell's \npetition for rehearing in the case was supported by 49 Members of \nCongress--of both political parties--as well as the United States \nDepartment of Justice, all six State Attorneys General in the tenth \ncircuit, and some of the leading crime victims' groups in the country, \nsuch as Mothers Against Drunk Driving and the National Crime Victims \nConstitutional Amendment Network. When the petition for rehearing was \ndenied, Cassell\n\n[[Page S4256]]\n\nhelped crime victims come to Congress to obtain remedial legislation. \nCongress passed the Victims' Rights Clarification Act of 1997 by a \nmargin of 418 to 19 in the House and unanimously here in the Senate. \nThat would not have happened but for Professor Cassell. When President \nClinton signed the act into law, he endorsed Cassell's position, \nexplaining ``when someone is a victim, he or she should be at the \ncenter of the criminal justice process, not on the outside looking \nin.''\n\n  Again, all of that work was done by Professor Cassell without any \ncompensation. Those victims would not have has any voice at all in the \ncriminal justice system if it weren't for the selfless sacrifice and \ndedication of Professor Cassell.\n  In sum, Mr. President, Professor Cassell's record demonstrates \neverything that this body should hope for in a judicial nominee: \nunquestioned competence; a track record of hard work; a personal \ndedication to justice; and a commitment to public service. To that, I \nwould like to add my personal opinion. I know Paul Cassell, and I know \nhim to be not only an extraordinary lawyer and an extraordinary \nscholar, but also one of the most decent, honest, honorable, and \nfairminded people I have ever know. He is going to be an absolutely \ngreat judge, and an excellent addition to the Utah District Court \nbench. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of his confirmation.\n  I thank the Chair and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, \n           Violence Against Women Office,\n                                   Washington, DC, March 18, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: I am writing to express my strong \n     personal support for the appointment of Professor Paul \n     Cassell to the Federal District Court of Utah. I believe, \n     based on my pass association with Professor Cassell, that he \n     will make an excellent judge.\n       Professor Cassell and I have worked together for over five \n     years as co-members of the Utah Council on Victims of Crime \n     and I have come to respect his integrity, great knowledge of \n     the law, and ability to assist others in the comprehension of \n     the often complex issues at hand. Often in my work as State \n     Coordinator for the Utah Governor's Cabinet Council on \n     Domestic Violence, Professor Cassell was of invaluable \n     assistance in analyzing legislation as it was being proposed \n     and many times provided an expert opinion on existing federal \n     and state statutes. Issues of confidentiality, victim \n     notification and courtroom video taping became more \n     understandable as he worked to provide a solid, legal \n     foundation for others to follow.\n       It is my belief that Professor Cassell is exactly the right \n     kind of balanced individual that will make him an exceptional \n     Federal District Court Judge.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                  Diane M.

Cassell.\n\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I am writing to you in your capacity as \n     ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee to express \n     my strong support for the nomination of Professor Paul G. \n     Cassell to the United States District Court for the District \n     of Utah. He is an active practitioner, prolific scholar, and \n     fervent advocate for victims' rights.\n       Professor Cassell is not ``anti-defendant'' as some have \n     charged, but pro-victim. As a national leader of the victims' \n     rights movement, Professor Cassell was instrumental in \n     achieving reforms in Utah law that have given voice to \n     victims of crime. Professor Cassell has exposed shoddy \n     scholarship attacking capital punishment and advocated for \n     moderating Miranda's sweeping exclusionary rule. However well \n     supported and reasonable, these positions have understandably \n     not won him points in the defense community. But in the \n     larger community, Paul Cassell is highly regarded for his \n     service in the public interest.\n       In addition, I personally know Paul Cassell to be a man of \n     absolute integrity and fairness. He personifies the principal \n     of ``justice.'' He has the ability to put personal opinion \n     and bias, and fairly and impartially adjudicate the issues \n     brought before him.\n       In sum, Professor Cassell is well respected in Utah and \n     would be a credit to the federal bench in this State. I urge \n     you to support his nomination.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                Mark L. Shurtleff,\n     Attorney General.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   March 18, 2002.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Sir: I am writing this letter to you today to express \n     my deep support for the nomination of Paul Cassell to a \n     position as a Federal Judge.\n       I have had the pleasure of working with Mr. Cassell over a \n     long period of time on a very important case involving my \n     family and our rights as victims. During that time I had many \n     conversations with Paul and I felt that I came to know him \n     reasonably well as both a person and an attorney.\n       As an attorney, Paul's accomplishments are many, and I am \n     sure that you have already been made aware of the many great \n     experiences and achievements of his distinguished career. I \n     wish to speak more intimately of my personal experience with \n     Mr. Cassell's handling of our own case.\n       Our case was probably the most difficult and emotionally \n     draining experience of our lives. My family was forced to \n     deal with a tragedy that we never imagined would happen to \n     us. We were confronted with many obstacles that we never \n     anticipated and we grew increasingly frustrated with the \n     confusion, and seeming contradictions of the Justice System \n     as we were lied to, and mislead, by many different people \n     throughout the process, including people that we thought were \n     supposed to be on our side.\n       During the height of our frustration with the handling of \n     our case we began to search for someone to provide us with \n     legal help and representation and we were fortunate enough to \n     find Mr. Cassell. Paul agreed to help us without ever \n     charging us a penny as he tirelessly worked to resolve our \n     case in a favorable and just way. He was always honest and \n     upfront with us about our case, even when the answer was not \n     what we wanted to hear. Paul had a gift for being able to \n     wade through all the legal confusion and explain things \n     clearly and understandably to us. Paul impressed me as a \n     person who is able to see things fairly from all different \n     perspectives and help opposing sides find the right solution \n     to a problem. Our case did not end with exactly the decision \n     that we hoped for, but thanks to Paul Cassell we were able to \n     find some measure of justice and closure, and we feel much \n     better about the outcome of our case. It is my firm belief \n     that you would be very hard pressed to find any better \n     attorney than Mr. Cassell!\n       As a person, Paul is a very honest, fair-minded, and \n     compassionate man. In today's world it has become \n     increasingly hard to find people whose judgement you can \n     completely trust and rely upon, but Paul Cassell is just such \n     a person. At a time when more and more people are becoming \n     jaded about the law and losing confidence in our Justice \n     System, Paul Cassell is the right type of person to help \n     bring integrity back into the legal profession and restore \n     the faith of the American people in their courts, both \n     victims and defendants.\n       I hope I never again find myself or my family in the \n     position of having to deal with our legal system in such a \n     personal way. But if I do, I hope that the Judge who hears \n     our case and the attorney's on both sides of the issue are \n     people like Paul Cassell, because if they are then I know \n     we'll be in the best possible hands.\n       I sincerely hope that you will support Paul Cassell's \n     nomination as a Federal Judge. Please don't reject him over \n     something so trivial as political party affiliation or \n     ideology. Accept him because he's a very good person who \n     truly has Americans best interests at heart. Now, more than \n     ever, America desperately needs great leaders, like Paul \n     Cassell, and I know that you will not find a better candidate \n     for the job!!!\n       Thank you for your careful consideration,\n     Sterling James Poll.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   March 18, 2002.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Sir: I am writing you today to make you aware of why I \n     feel Paul Cassell would make an excellent choice for a Judge.\n       Life brought circumstances to my family and I that we had \n     never imagined we would have to deal with. We found ourselves \n     thrust into the U.S. legal system. We were totally unprepared \n     for this. We found the legal system to be confusing, \n     contradictory and unsympathetic. We were in great need of \n     help. Help to get us through, help to understand, and help to \n     find justice. We began calling attorneys on the phone in \n     search of the information that we needed. Many phone calls \n     later, we did find someone who recommended Paul Cassell.\n       We called Paul Cassell, and he was the first attorney who \n     listened to us with interested and understanding. He advised \n     us with no hesitation, and immediately said he would take our \n     case--Pro-Bono. We then began our relationship with Paul.\n       Paul worked long and late hours on our case. We found him \n     to be honest and forthright about what was going on with our \n     case. He explained in plain terms what exactly would happen \n     at our hearings. He made us aware of all possibilities, from \n     both perspectives of the case. He saw our case through to the \n     Utah Supreme Court.\n       Our case did not have the results that we had hoped for, \n     however, we are a family, now\n\n[[Page S4257]]\n\n     have some closure to a very tragic situation. We all feel \n     that due to the work Paul Cassell did for us, at no financial \n     gain for himself, we did everything that could possibly have \n     been done to get the justice we feel we deserved. We can not \n     start to move forward with our lives, putting the tragic past \n     behind us. In particular, my fourteen-year-old son, is now \n     starting to make progress and feel good about himself. He \n     knows that he has helped to make the pathway a little easier \n     for other people in the same situation.\n       I feel that Paul has all the qualities a judge for our \n     country should have. He is honest, forthright, concerned \n     about whether or not justice has been served. We spent time \n     with him, had many conversations with him, where we came to a \n     clear understanding of how much he cares for the people of \n     our country. We could see how important the justice system is \n     to him. There are not many attorneys that would take on a \n     case Pro-bono, where he is going to have to spend many hours \n     of his own personal time, just to help people in need.\n       I recommend Paul Cassell highly, for a judgeship. If you \n     are interested in what is going to be best for the people of \n     our country, I truly feel that you are not going to find any \n     better man for the job.\n           Thank you for your time and consideration,\n     Cynthia F. Casey.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      National Organization of    \n                                               Parents of Murdered\n\n\n                                               Children, Inc.,\n\n                                   Cincinnati, OH, March 18, 2002.\n     Senator Orrin Hatch,\n     C/O Alex Dahl.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: On behalf of the National Organization \n     of Parents Of Murdered Children, Inc., and its over 100,000 \n     members, I am writing to strongly support Paul Cassell's \n     confirmation for the Federal District Court for the District \n     of Utah. Paul has been a tremendous asset to POMC and its \n     members.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Nancy Ruhe-Munch,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                   Viad Corp.,\n\n                                       Phoenix, AZ, July 19, 2001.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I am writing to express my strong \n     support for the confirmation of Prof. Paul Cassell's \n     nomination to the United States District Court for the \n     District of Utah.\n       I have known Prof. Cassell through our work together in the \n     cause of establishing and enforcing rights for crime victims. \n     Paul is a person of compassion and fairness. He has deep \n     respect for the rule of law and for the role of the judiciary \n     in preserving and protecting it. He is at all times \n     respectful of others and displays a temperament that will \n     always remain faithful to the obligations of a federal judge. \n     He has a strong work ethic and will clearly be able to meet \n     the rigors of a busy trial court.\n       Paul is a person of intellectual and moral integrity; he \n     will serve with distinction on the District Court when he is \n     confirmed, giving equal justice to all who appear before him. \n     I urge you and all of your colleagues to confirm the \n     nomination of Prof. Paul Cassell.\n       Thank you for considering these views.\n           Sincerely,\n     Steve Twist,\n       Assistant General Counsel, Viad Corp; Chief Counsel, \n     National Victims Constitutional, Amendment Network.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                           Rutgers\n\n\n                                     University School of Law,\n\n                                       Newark, NJ, March 16, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate \n         Office building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Hatch: I write to support \n     enthusiastically and without reservation the nomination of \n     Professor Paul G. Cassell to be a federal district judge. I \n     have known Paul for many years, and I believe he will make a \n     highly capable judge. I wrote a letter supporting his tenure \n     at the University of Utah College of Law several years ago, \n     and he has continued to shine as a legal thinker and writer.\n       Professor Cassell is intelligent, thoughtful, and willing \n     to explore different approaches to problems that arise in the \n     law. He writes extremely well and is top flight in his \n     analysis of cases and doctrines. Indeed, he has on occasion \n     pointed out an analytical flaw in a doctrinal argument I was \n     making, thus allowing me to reshape the argument before \n     publishing it. Professor Cassell has continued the tradition \n     of Justice John Harlan and Professor Grano by holding the \n     premises of Miranda v. Arizona up to the light and asking why \n     the Constitution should consider police interrogation such a \n     threat to autonomy and free will.\n       We have ``dueled'' in a friendly way in print (Volume 43 of \n     the UCLA Law Review, pages 821-959), before a TV camera (in \n     the PBS Debates-Debates series), before the Senate \n     Subcommittee on Criminal Justice Oversight, and at the \n     University of Michigan symposium on Miranda and Dickerson \n     (November, 2000).\n       Professor Cassell and I disagree on some issues and yet \n     respect each other. This fact alone says volumes, I think, \n     about how effective he will be as a judge in dealing with \n     lawyers and others in his courtroom. I predict that Paul \n     Cassell will research the law energetically, understand it as \n     well as anyone can, and apply it fairly and consistently.\n       Should you wish further details, please let me know.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     George c. Thomas III,\n       Professor of Law, Judge Alexander P. Waugh, Sr. \n     Distinguished Scholar.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             Georgetown University Law Center,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 25, 2002.\n     Re judicial nominee Paul Cassell (U.S. District Court, \n         District of Utah).\n\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n\n     Senator Orrin Hatch, Hart Office Building, U.S. Senate, \n       Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy and Senator Hatch: I understand that my \n     colleague in teaching, Professor Paul Cassell of the \n     University of Utah Law School, has been nominated by \n     President George W. Bush to serve as a United States District \n     Judge for the District of Utah. I know Paul very well, and I \n     recommend him enthusiastically. (I write in my personal \n     capacity as a professor of civil rights law at Georgetown \n     University Law Center for the past twenty-seven years. I have \n     previously been privileged to contribute to the work of the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee by consulting with or advising \n     Senators from both parties, including Senator Joseph Biden of \n     Delaware regarding judicial nominations, Senator Orrin Hatch \n     of Utah concerning technical perfections to a civil rights \n     act, and Senator Charles McC. Mathias of Maryland concerning \n     substantive provisions of several proposed bills expanding \n     civil rights. I write this letter at my own initiative after \n     seeing Professor Cassell by chance last week and learning of \n     his then-pending hearing. I am sending a courtesy copy of \n     this letter to my former colleague Professor Viet Dinh, now \n     Assistant Attorney General.)\n       I have known Paul Cassell for over twelve years. I met him \n     after he married one of my former students, Georgetown \n     University Law Center graduate Patricia Cassell. Because he \n     and I are both interested in constitutional law and civil \n     rights, I have followed his academic work for many years, \n     including his writing concerning the Miranda case and other \n     related issues in criminal law. Although Paul's academic work \n     has engendered some political criticism because it challenges \n     a hallmark case from the Warren era, it is wholly and \n     completely within the mainstream of American academic \n     discourse. Paul's arguments have been challenging, well-\n     reasoned, and broadly judicious in their criticism of the \n     established order. His writings have not been narrowly \n     focused on political considerations but have considered \n     what works best for society and the legal order (such as \n     whether Miranda actually protects society's victims), in \n     the best tradition of American legal scholarship. It is \n     true that Paul's work calls for the disestablishment of a \n     court-declared ``constitutional right,'' but the same was \n     true of attacks on The Dred Scott Case, which recognized a \n     constitutional right to hold slaves, and Lochner v. New \n     York, which recognized a right to be free of government \n     regulation of the employment contracts of workers. I \n     disagree with some positions Paul has taken, including his \n     distrust of the Miranda decision itself, but disagreement \n     with the courts' declarations of ``rights'' is a part of \n     the job of every American law professor, and Paul has \n     handled his part of that discussion with rectitude and \n     complete fidelity to our academic tradition and to the \n     rule of law.\n       I also respect Paul quite highly because, though he fits \n     within the broad academic mainstream, he has shown \n     independence and has resisted pressure to conform for \n     conformity's sake, especially regarding currently prevailing \n     majority positions that strongly favor the criminal-law \n     decisions of the 1960's. In my view this shows an independent \n     mind that is very desirable in a federal judge, especially \n     one sitting at the district level where conformist local \n     pressure may often make it difficult to rule on contentious \n     subjects. Yet even with his independent thinking, Paul's \n     emphasis in public discussions has also been marked by a \n     desire to bring balance to the public debate, such as by \n     recognizing the interests of victims of crime as well as \n     defendants charged with crimes. The ability to see \n     countervailing values, and to listen to them, is a valuable \n     asset for any judge, especially a federal judge sitting with \n     life tenure. In all my dealings with Paul, airing many \n     difficult issues of public policy, I have never heard him \n     raise his voice or denigrate the personal commitment or \n     integrity of an opponent. His personality and temperament are \n     ideal for a federal district judge.\n       I have been privileged to attend an academic workshop with \n     Paul and to meet his family and children on several \n     occasions, and even skied with him and his family on one \n     occasion when my family vacationed in Utah. He is a \n     wonderfully kind and generous\n\n[[Page S4258]]\n\n     person, completely unpretentious and unaffected despite his \n     high standing in his community and his nationwide renown in \n     academia. He commands strong respect from his colleagues at \n     the University of Utah and elsewhere. He leads a balanced \n     life that includes much pro bono work for the public interest \n     and other community activities. Far from being an ideologue \n     or a single-issue activist, Paul is a multi-dimensional \n     person with solid American values and an admirable commitment \n     to making life better for all Americans.\n       Finally, I realize that there has been some criticism of \n     Paul for his critical views on the Miranda case, especially \n     his representation of the Fourth Circuit and Congress in a \n     Supreme Court case challenging the Miranda rule. But Paul's \n     role in that case showed his usual fidelity to the rule of \n     law, not a challenge to it. In all my years of knowing Paul, \n     I have never seen an indication that he would try to subvert \n     the system to achieve his goals; his work has always been \n     entirely open and direct, using the traditional methods of \n     persuasion and openness that characterize both honest \n     professors and honest judges. Most pertinently for potential \n     future trial-court judges, I have complete confidence that \n     Paul would never intentionally mis-find facts to protect his \n     rulings from the bench or otherwise manipulate the process to \n     accomplish personal goals. My narrow disagreement with Paul \n     on Miranda does not alter one essential point: if my rights \n     were at stake, or the rights of any of my traditional civil-\n     rights clients when I practiced many years ago, I would \n     affirmatively want Paul Cassell to judge the facts and the \n     law of my case. his confirmation and appointment could do \n     nothing but strengthen my trust in the American judiciary.\n       With much respect and admiration, I remain\n           Yours truly,\n     Charles F. Abernathy.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Northwestern School of Law\n\n\n                                     of Lewis & Clark College,\n\n                                     Portland, OR, March 15, 2002.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I write to voice my support for the \n     appointment of Professor Paul Cassell to the Federal District \n     Court of Utah. Professor Cassell and I have worked together \n     on many legal matters involving the rights of crime victims, \n     particularly sexual assault and domestic violence victims. He \n     is extraordinarily intelligent and a tireless advocate who \n     through his down-to-earth style can distill complex legal \n     theories into simple and persuasive arguments.\n       As a Democrat and a feminist, I may not always agree with \n     professor Cassell. However, as an academic activist with a \n     specialty in violence against women issues, I am unaware of a \n     single instance where professor Cassell and myself disagreed \n     on the legal issues or strategy involved in our many \n     collaborations. As the Director of the Crime Victim Appellate \n     Clinic and the founder of its Violence Against Women Project, \n     I have had the privilege to collaborate with Professor \n     Cassell on a variety of violence against women cases. I can \n     say without hesitation that Professor Cassell is one of the \n     preeminent leaders in safeguarding the rights of sexual \n     assault and domestic violence survivors in the criminal \n     justice system.\n       During our two years of working together, Professor Cassell \n     and my organization, the National Crime Victim Law Institute \n     (NVCLI), have represented many survivors of sexual assault \n     and domestic violence. For example, just last year in Hagen \n     v. Massachusetts, No. SJC-08627 (Mass. 2001), we helped file \n     an amicus brief on behalf of Jane Doe, Inc., Massachusetts \n     Coalition Against Sexual Assault and the National Alliance of \n     Sexual Assault Coalitions, defending a rape victim's right to \n     have the convicted rapist begin serving his sentence thirteen \n     years after the sentence was imposed. The issue is currently \n     pending before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.\n       In Cronan v. Cronan, 774 A.2d 866 (R.I. 2001), representing \n     a battered woman with the support of the Rhode Island \n     Coalition Against Domestic Violence and the National Alliance \n     of Sexual Assault Coalitions, Professor Cassell and the NCVLI \n     successfully argued that a battered woman had properly \n     initiated criminal charges against her husband.\n       Just two weeks ago, in State v. Gomez (Utah Supreme Court \n     March 4, 2002), Professor Cassell and the NCVLI filed a brief \n     on behalf of the Rape Recovery Center (the largest rape \n     crisis center in Utah) with the support of the National \n     Alliance to End Sexual Violence defending the privilege for \n     confidential communications to rape crisis counselors.\n       Just last week, in State v. Blake (Utah Supreme Court March \n     14, 2002), Professor Cassell filed a brief on behalf of the \n     Rape Recovery Center with the support of the National \n     Alliance to End Sexual Violence defending the right of a rape \n     victim to keep confidential communications made to a mental \n     health therapist.\n       Notwithstanding our areas of disagreement, I believe that \n     Professor Cassell has the temperament, integrity and \n     commitment to follow the letter and spirit of established law \n     that will make him an exceptional Federal District Court \n     Judge.\n           Respectfully,\n     Gina S.

Professor Cassell and I have had occasion to \n     work together on several legal matters involving the rights \n     of crime victims. He is an exceedingly bright and thoughtful \n     advocate with a superior ability to synthesize complex ideas \n     into a simple and persuasive argument.\n       Professor Cassell has a keen understanding of the limits of \n     law while fiercely defending the unique role law plays in \n     promoting civility. This is a particularly appropriate \n     characteristic for any judicial nominee.\n       As an academic activist with a focus on women's rights, I \n     do not always agree with Professor Cassell but he has \n     frequently provided pro bono legal services to rape crisis \n     centers, domestic violence advocates, and other victims' \n     organizations who are advancing the cause of justice for \n     women. For example, Professor Cassell and I recently worked \n     together to file briefs protecting the confidentiality of \n     rape crisis counseling records in Utah.\n       Notwithstanding areas of disagreement, I value Professor \n     Cassell's integrity, his willingness to debate openly and his \n     commitment to the idea that the law works best with many \n     diverse voices at the decision-making table.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Wendy J.

Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Hatch: I am writing on behalf of \n     Professor Paul G. Cassell to support his nomination to the \n     United States District Court for the District of Utah. I have \n     known Professor Cassell for more than 17 years, both as a \n     close personal friend and a professional colleague. He is \n     without peer in either category.\n       I came to know Professor Cassell professionally in 1984 \n     when we clerked at the same time for the United States Court \n     of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. From the \n     beginning, Paul distinguished himself as a brilliant writer, \n     a thoughtful legal scholar, and a decent and honorable \n     person.\n       Subsequently, I worked with Paul at the United States \n     Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Virginia. There \n     I had the privilege of trying my first federal criminal jury \n     trial as a federal prosecutor with Paul serving as lead \n     counsel. Later I enjoyed the even greater privilege of \n     serving as the best man at Paul's wedding. Although in recent \n     years our families have seen less of each other since his \n     move to Utah, we remain in close contact and my family had \n     the pleasure of hosting Paul, his wife Trish, and their three \n     daughters during his recent trip to Washington for the \n     confirmation hearing.\n       Based on this lengthy personal and professional \n     relationship, I can say without hesitation or reservation \n     that Paul would be a tremendous asset to the federal bench. \n     Paul would bring to the bench an incisive legal mind as well \n     as a fundamental decency and respect for all who appear \n     before him, without regard to their status as plaintiff or \n     defendant, lawyer or client, accused or accuser. In my \n     conversations with Paul since his nomination, he has \n     emphasized how proud he is to have been honored by this \n     nomination and how committed he is to serve with honor and \n     distinction. Given that Paul's intellectual prowess is \n     exceeded only perhaps by his humility and decency, I have no \n     doubt that given the opportunity he will so serve.\n       In observing Paul's confirmation hearing, it was clear that \n     many of the questions focused on his ability and willingness \n     to accept and consider different points of view and to put \n     aside his views as an advocate and follow the laws as a \n     Judge. In that regard, I would make the following \n     observations: I am a life-long Democrat and sine leaving the \n     United States Attorneys Office I have worked as a criminal \n     defense counsel. I regularly appear before district judges \n     throughout the country on behalf of those accused with a wide \n     variety of offenses. Although I routinely find myself in \n     disagreement with Paul on numerous legal issues including the \n     death penalty (which I oppose) and Miranda (which I support), \n     I have no doubt that we in the defense bar and our clients, \n     would receive fair and even-handed treatment in Paul's \n     courtroom. For although Paul undoubtedly views my beliefs \n     with the same skepticism as I view his, he is unfailingly \n     receptive to my differing\n\n[[Page S4259]]\n\n     views, courteous in addressing our differences, and \n     respectful of my positions. Indeed, he accords respect to \n     everyone that crosses his path, lacks even a touch of \n     arrogance or conceit and is unfailingly polite even in \n     situations where something less might be appropriate. I do \n     not worry that as a judge, Paul might be high-handed, \n     discourteous or have any difficulty following the principles \n     of stare decisis. Given his decency and abiding integrity, I \n     do not think it is in Paul's nature to act other than \n     honorably and courteously.\n       I hope that the foregoing is of assistance in your \n     consideration of Professor Cassell's nomination to the bench. \n     If I can provide further information or answer any questions, \n     please do not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Mark J. Hulkower.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time is available to the Senator \nfrom Utah and the Senator from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 3 minutes 43 \nseconds. The Senator from Vermont has 12 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, with last week's votes, the number of \nFederal judges confirmed since the change in Senate majority 10 months \nago now totals 56. Under Democratic leadership, the Senate has \nconfirmed more judges in 10 months than were confirmed by the \nRepublican-controlled Senate in the 1996 and 1997 sessions combined.\n  Today's vote is on the nomination of Paul Cassell to the United \nStates District Court for the District of Utah. After a great deal of \nthought, I will not be voting for this nominee today. Although this \nnomination is supported by my good friend from Utah, Senator Hatch, we \ndisagree on his suitability to serve as a Federal judge. Senator Hatch \nhas been an admirable and stalwart advocate for this nomination, and I \ncertainly mean him no disrespect in voting against Professor Cassell.\n  The constitutional responsibility to advise and consent to the \nPresident's selection of lifetime tenured judicial nominees should not \nbe devalued to advise and rubber stamp. When the President sends us a \nnominee whose qualifications, judgment or background raise concerns or \nwho has a misunderstanding of the appropriate role of a Federal judge, \nI intend to make my concerns known. This is one of those times. The \nnomination of Professor Paul Cassell raises several areas of serious \nconcern to me.\n  I think it is important to note that we have not engaged in a game of \ntit for tat for past Republican practices, nor have we delayed \nproceedings on this nomination, as so many nominations were delayed in \npast years of Republican control of the Senate. Instead, the Committee \nhas seriously considered the nomination and worked hard to complete the \nCommittee's record of information about this nominee. We have given the \nnominee an opportunity to be heard, promptly scheduled a Committee \nvote, and reported this nomination to the floor, although not \nunanimously. This is far more fairness, courtesy and orderly process \nthan was provided so many nominees during prior years. Professor \nCassell, in his nomination to the District Court, has been given a fair \nhearing and a fair process before the Committee and the Senate.\n  I am proud of the work the Judiciary Committee has done since the \nchange in the majority. I am proud of the way we have considered \nnominees fairly and expeditiously and the way we have been able to \nreport to the Senate so many qualified, nonideological, consensus \nnominees. We also have held hearings for a number of controversial \nnominees, such as Professor Cassell. Controversial nominations take \nmore time and effort, but we are making that effort and taking that \ntime to be fair and thorough in our consideration of those nominations, \nas well. One measure of our fairness is the fact that we are proceeding \neven on controversial nominations such as this one.\n  After thoroughly considering the record of this nominee, chosen for \nlifetime appointment by President Bush, I find that I cannot in good \nconscience vote in favor of Professor Cassell's confirmation. I have \nvoted in favor of 56 other Bush judicial nominees, many of whom had \nbeen involved in partisan politics or ideological groups. I also voted \nin favor of the last person confirmed to the District Court in Utah, \nJudge Ted Stewart, a controversial nominee, and I did so even in the \nimmediate aftermath of the Republicans' unprecedented party-line vote \nagainst Justice Ronnie White of Missouri, because I made a commitment \nto Senator Hatch.\n  At Senator Hatch's request, the Senate Judiciary Committee gave \nProfessor Cassell a hearing on his nomination in March and the \nCommittee voted on his nomination in the beginning of May. That is \nfairer treatment than more than 50 of President Clinton's judicial \nnominees ever got, those who never got a hearing and never got a vote \nby the Committee when the Republicans were in charge. Many others \nwaited for months or years for a vote on their nominations. Our \nJudiciary Committee, however, accorded Professor Cassell a hearing \nalthough his nomination is quite controversial and even though he \nreceived a partial ``not qualified'' rating from the ABA.\n  Professor Cassell is a highly intelligent man, with an admirable \npassion for teaching and advocacy. But his written work, the record \nestablished at our hearing, and the answers he submitted to written \nquestions raise grave doubts about his intellectual forthrightness and \nhis capacity and willingness to put aside the extreme views he has long \nheld. A judge who lacks the open-minded ability to hear both sides of a \ncase cannot be depended on to administer justice impartially. I am \nconcerned that he will be unable to set aside his personal views and \nthat he has, in his work on legal issues, shown a strong tendency \nalready to be motivated by the outcomes he seeks rather than by the \nfacts.\n  In 1992, Professor Cassell launched what became an 8-year campaign \nagainst Miranda v. Arizona, the Supreme Court's landmark ruling that \npolice must provide certain warnings before questioning a suspect in \ncustody. As part of this campaign, he generated a series of statistical \nstudies to try to show that Miranda harms law enforcement.\n  At the same time, he filed briefs in Miranda-related cases around the \ncountry seeking to convince courts to uphold a 1968 law--18 U.S.C. \nsection 3501--that purported to overrule Miranda and make \n``voluntariness'' the sole test for the admissibility of confessions in \nFederal criminal cases.\n  Let me emphasize at the outset that I do not fault Professor Cassell \nfor holding opinions with which I may disagree, or for the zealousness \nof his advocacy. While most criminal justice experts made their peace \nwith Miranda decades ago, reasonable minds can certainly differ as to \nthe wisdom and practicality of this venerable precedent. What troubles \nme about the nominee's campaign against Miranda is the manner in which \nhe waged it.\n  In article after article, Professor Cassell overstated the anti-\nMiranda position, citing his own flawed empirical studies as evidence \nthat Miranda harms law enforcement.\n  These one-sided attacks on Miranda drew unusually sharp criticism for \ntheir failure to meet standard scholarly norms. Academics who reviewed \nthis nominee's research took him to task for being partisan and \nideologically driven while masquerading as an objective scholar. They \ncalled his methods unsound, and accused him of manipulating data to \nreach his preferred result.\n  Professor Cassell's work on Miranda was not restricted to, or even \nprimarily aimed at, the world of academia. Based on his arguably flawed \nstatistical studies, he made several empirical claims to the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and to various Federal courts, including the United \nStates Supreme Court. Clearly, this raises the stakes from simple \nacademic discourse. It is one thing to write something in a law review \narticle--you can write whatever you want in a law review article. But \nit is an entirely different matter to represent something to a \ncongressional committee or to the Supreme Court. A lawyer should have a \ngreat deal of confidence in any information that he presents to one of \nthose bodies. At a minimum, it would be unethical for a lawyer to \npresent information that he knew was unreliable. Professor Cassell's \nuse of his own questionable data to try to influence legislators and \njudges on an issue of profound national importance raises serious \nquestions about his judgment and integrity.\n  I am also concerned by the partisan spin of Professor Cassell's \ncampaign\n\n[[Page S4260]]\n\nagainst Miranda. In his congressional testimony and writings, Professor \nCassell was sharply critical of the Clinton Justice Department for \navoiding litigation regarding the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. \nsection 3501. Among other things, he actually suggested the Department \nhad deliberately and repeatedly misled the courts with respect to \nMiranda, and that its defense of Miranda was driven by politics and not \nby legal analysis. In a 1997 article entitled ``Another Law Janet Reno \nDoesn't Like,'' Professor Cassell took specific aim at the former \nAttorney General, accusing her of ``impeding the enforcement'' of a \nstatute, and ``team[ing] up with defense lawyers to let armed felons \nand other criminals escape prosecution.''\n  Yet Professor Cassell himself had acknowledged in a 1995 article that \nprior Republican Administrations had also failed to defend section \n3501. Although Republican Attorneys General like John Mitchell and Ed \nMeese were cognizant of 18 U.S.C. section 3501, Professor Cassell \nwrote, ``no serious efforts were undertaken . . . to secure any \ndetermination of the constitutionality of the law.'' In addition, ``[A] \nrecommendation by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Policy in \n1987 that an aggressive effort be made to test the law was never \nadopted as the result of opposition by other agencies within the \nDepartment.''\n  At the nomination hearing, I asked Professor Cassell to explain his \ncriticism of Attorney General Reno regarding section 3501 in light of \nhis earlier acknowledgment that prior Attorneys General had taken a \nsimilar position. At first he distanced himself from his comments \nregarding Attorneys General Mitchell and Meese by implying that the \nmagazine in which they appeared had somehow misrepresented his words. \nHe then suggested that because the quote appeared in a popular \nmagazine, the National Journal, it should be given less credence than, \nsay, a law review article.\n  Recall that I am not referring to a situation in which Professor \nCassell was quoted out of context. I am referring to an article that \nProfessor Cassell co-wrote with a colleague. That is why his responses \nto my oral questions in the hearing seemed so slippery. I gave him \nanother chance to explain his comment in answers to written questions. \nFinally, Professor Cassell grudgingly acknowledged, ``it does not \nappear that any Administration made aggressive efforts to invoke \n3501.'' In sum, Professor Cassell's record of ultra-zealous, partisan \nadvocacy regarding Miranda raises serious questions about his ability \nto serve as an unbiased decisionmaker.\n  Another cause to which Professor Cassell has dedicated himself is the \ndefense of the death penalty. Indeed, he has been called ``the academic \nworld's foremost defender of capital punishment.'' At the hearing on \nhis nomination, in response to questions from Senator Durbin, Professor \nCassell asserted, ``my experience with the death penalty is rather \nlimited.'' This statement confounds reason.\n  Relying on the list of publications and presentations that Professor \nCassell submitted to this committee, I count the following references \nto capital punishment, dating back to 1987: three substantial articles; \nfour appearances before committees of the U.S. Congress, and one each \nbefore the Utah House and Senate; three submissions to popular \npublications; and three debates. One of those debates took place just \n18 months ago: Professor Cassell squared off against Stephen Bright, \none of the nation's preeminent defenders of those accused of capital \ncrimes. These examples do not even include the large number of \ninterviews he has given to the press on the topic. He has written and \nspoken widely on this fundamental matter, but now terms his experience \nwith it ``limited.''\n  Despite mounting evidence that our death penalty system is riddled \nwith error and desperately in need of reform, Professor Cassell has \ndoggedly maintained that there is no more accurate sanction in the \nworld than capital punishment as it is practiced in the United States, \nand that the chance of an innocent being put to death is an ``urban \nlegend.'' He supports this position by asserting that there is no \ndefinitive proof that an innocent person has been executed in the past \n50 years despite the shameful fact that since 1973, 100 condemned \npersons have had their convictions vacated by exonerating evidence.\n  Professor Cassell has been highly critical of studies that show \nsignificant rates of error in the imposition of capital punishment.\n  More than once, he has attacked a study showing errors in capital \ncases by declaring that the author is an avowed opponent of the death \npenalty, thereby attempting to undermine the credibility of the study's \nfindings. He has also engaged in vitriolic and occasionally personal \nattacks against those with whom he disagrees on this issue, often \nskewing details in his own favor and publishing half-truths. His \nactions on this matter likewise call into question his ability to rule \nfairly on this most important legal issue.\n  Professor Cassell's views on habeas corpus tell a similar story. In \nApril 1993, Professor Cassell testified before the Judiciary Committee \nin opposition to a bill that would have allowed death row inmates to \nraise new claims of actual innocence. The bill was a response to the \nSupreme Court's decision in Herrera v. Collins, which upheld a Texas \nrule barring courts from considering new evidence of innocence that is \nuncovered more than 30 days after conviction. In his testimony, \nProfessor Cassell argued that an innocent defendant, ``will be fully \naware of the circumstances surrounding his innocence and can present \nthem at trial.'' He further asserted that evidence that becomes \navailable after conviction is, ``almost invariably unreliable.'' It is \ntroubling to imagine a district court judge with such biases, \nespecially given the strong likelihood that he would be called upon to \nreview claims of innocence based on newly discovered evidence.\n  Professor Cassell has also advocated limiting habeas review of \nclaimed violations of Batson v. Kentucky, which prohibits the exercise \nof peremptory challenges on the basis of race or gender. In a 1992 law \nreview article, he argued that Batson violations should be treated as \nharmless error, meaning that a new trial would never be an appropriate \nremedy for a Batson violation discovered for the first time on appeal. \nAs an alternative remedy, he proposed notifying excluded jurors that \nhad been unfairly excluded from the previous trial and inviting them to \njoin the panel from which jurors are selected in a subsequent case. But \nsuch a ``remedy'' would do little to cure the structural flaw in the \ndefendant's trial. Notably, although the Supreme Court has not ruled \nwhether Batson violations are subject to harmless error analysis, the \nconsensus among the Courts of Appeals is that they are not.\n  I am aware of Professor Cassell's work with regard to crime victims' \nrights. We still have more work to do to ensure that our criminal \njustice system is one that respects the rights and dignity of crime \nvictims, rather than one that presents additional ordeals for those \nalready victimized. Professor Cassell helped draft the Utah victims \nrights amendment in the mid-1990s. He also worked on, and testified in \nsupport of, some of the more than 60 versions of a Federal \nconstitutional amendment that has been proposed, in recent Congresses, \nby Senators Kyl and Feinstein.\n  It is no secret that, as a longtime advocate of victims' rights, I \nbelieve it is preferable to broaden these rights by statute than by \namending the Constitution. I do not, however, fault Professor Cassell, \nor anyone else, for supporting this approach. The treatment of crime \nvictims certainly is of central importance to a civilized society. The \nquestion is not whether we should help victims, but how. I continue to \nbelieve that crime victims legislation is the preferable course to \namending the Constitution.\n  That being said, Professor Cassell's work on behalf of this cause has \noccasionally exceeded the bounds of fair advocacy. For example, when \ntestifying before this Committee in support of the proposed \nconstitutional amendment, he has repeatedly cited the Victims Rights \nClarification Act of 1997--VRCA--as evidence that statutes are not \nadequate for protecting crime victims, and that nothing but a \nconstitutional amendment will do. While he has the right to favor an \namendment to the constitution, Professor Cassell grossly distorted the \nimpact of the VRCA.\n\n  Congress passed the VRCA in response to a pretrial order by the trial\n\n[[Page S4261]]\n\njudge in the Timothy McVeigh case--Judge Matsch. The order excluded \nfrom the trial any victim who wanted to testify at the sentencing \nhearing. The VRCA clarified that a court may not prohibit a victim from \ntestifying at a sentencing hearing solely because the victim has \nwitnessed the trial, although a judge may exclude a victim from \ntestifying at a sentencing hearing if the judge found--independent of \nthe fact that the victim witnessed the trial--that the testimony would \ncreate unfair prejudice.\n  One week after President Clinton signed the VRCA, Judge Matsch \nreversed his pretrial order and permitted victims to watch the trial, \neven if they were potential penalty phase witnesses. In other words, \nJudge Matsch did what the statute told him to do. Beth Wilkinson, one \nof the prosecutors in the case, testified before this Committee that in \nthe end, not one victim was prevented from testifying at the sentencing \nhearings for McVeigh on the ground that he or she had observed part of \nthe trial. Moreover--and perhaps more importantly--with all issues \nregarding the VRCA resolved during the McVeigh case, there were no \nproblems implementing the statute during the Terry Nichols case--\nvictims were free to watch the trial and testify at the penalty phase \nhearing. Ms. Wilkinson characterized the VRCA as a textbook example of \nhow statutes can and do work to protect victims.\n  When the Judiciary Committee considered the proposed constitutional \namendment two years ago, many of us had serious concerns about that \napproach. We believed it possible to give crime victims strong and \nenforceable rights, and assure them a greater voice in the criminal \njustice system, without cutting back on the fundamental rights of \ndefendants. Together with the Justice Department, we pushed for the \naddition of language that would expressly preserve existing rights of \nthe accused as guaranteed by the Constitution.\n  Professor Cassell steadfastly opposed the addition of such language, \nclaiming that it, ``would have perpetuated the very problem we were \ntrying to solve.'' This suggests that the ``problem'' as he saw it, was \nnot that the judicial system mistreats victims, but that it is unduly \ndeferential to the rights of defendants.\n  Professor Cassell now claims that the problem with ``adding specific \nlanguage about defendant's rights is that it creates . . . the \nmisimpression that victims' rights and defendants' rights actually \ncollide.'' This is a convenient ``spin'' on Professor Cassell's past \nstatements, coming at a time when those remarks have come under \nscrutiny, and is clearly inconsistent with ``the problem'' he was \n``trying to solve'' 2 years ago.\n  Once again, it raises the question whether Professor Cassell, if \nconfirmed, would exercise judgment fairly and impartially or would do \nso in a way that would seek to further his own personal views.\n  I have no doubts about Professor Cassell's intelligence and his \npassion and commitment to how he thinks the law should read. I am sure \nthat he is a fine professor of law. I suspect he may be an effective \nadvocate. But when viewed as a whole, his career has been one of a \nresults-oriented advocate, who has worked forcefully to push the law to \nthe far right. His one-man war on Miranda, his aggressive defense of \nour flawed system of capital punishment, and his work on other matters \nplace him outside the mainstream of modern American jurisprudence. Even \nmore troubling is his clear track record of manipulating sources and \ndata to promote his ideological agenda.\n  I have voted for 56 of the President's judicial nominees so far, and \nI will surely vote for many, many more, but on the basis of all I have \nseen in connection with the nomination of Paul Cassell, I cannot and \nwill not vote in favor of this nomination. My judgment is that he is \nnot likely to be the kind of fair and impartial judge that is essential \nto our Federal courts.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains for the Senator from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 6\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n2 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member.\n  Mr. President, I am very proud to rise in support of Professor Paul \nCassell who is nominated to be a judge for the district court in Utah.\n  I think one of the best ways to learn about a person is to work with \nthem on an issue. I have had the pleasure, along with Senator Kyl, of \nworking with Paul Cassell on a constitutional amendment to protect \nvictims of violent crime.\n  In the course of several meetings, I have found Professor Cassell to \nbe bright, sensitive, and evenhanded, with a very deep concern for \nthose victimized by crime.\n  I am not the only one. I would like to quickly read the opening \nparagraph from Doug Beloof of Northwestern School of Law at the Lewis & \nClark College:\n\n       I am an associate professor of law at Lewis & Clark law \n     school in Portland, Oregon. I am a registered Democrat. It \n     has been my pleasure to know Professor Paul Cassell \n     personally and professionally for several years. I am writing \n     to urge you to confirm him. As his resume reflects, he is \n     brilliant. He is one of the quickest conceptual thinkers and \n     writers I have ever met. There is no question that he is well \n     qualified for the district court position.\n\n  I find myself strongly in agreement. I have found in my course in \npublic life that very few care really to be identified with victims of \ncrime. In this sense, Paul Cassell is really a jewel. I have seen him \ncome forward time after time on behalf of victims of violent crimes. On \na pro bono basis, he represented the victims of the Oklahoma City \nbombing in their unsuccessful efforts to ensure they could observe the \ntrial and still testify at the sentencing proceedings.\n  He has worked on behalf of sexual assault victims. This month he is \nfiling briefs in the Utah Supreme Court on behalf of the Rape Recovery \nCenter to protect the confidentiality of rape crisis victims.\n  Because of his tireless work on behalf of crime victims, Professor \nCassell's nomination has earned the support of victim's groups around \nthe country including: the Klaas Kids Foundation; Crime Victims United \nof California; the National Victims Constitutional; Amendment Network; \nMemory of Victims Everywhere; National Organization for Victim \nAssistance; and Justice for Murder Victims.\n  Let me a read just a couple excerpts from his letters of support:\n  John Stein, Deputy Director of the National Organization for Victim \nAssistance describes him as\n\n       . . . a fair, ethical, and highly competent attorney and \n     colleague. [Professor Cassell] has demonstrated a balanced \n     commitment to the cause of justice for all Americans \n     including crime victims.\n\n  Douglas Beloof, a Professor of Law at Lewis and Clark school in \nPortland, Oregon wrote:\n\n       Professor Cassell's character and temperament . . . are \n     extremely well suited for the District Court position. The \n     citizens of Utah could not find a better legal mind or a more \n     decent human being.\n\n  Professor Cassell also comes before the Senate with impressive \nacademic credentials.\n  Professor Cassell graduated from Stanford University and from \nStanford Law School, where he was Order of the Coif and president of \nthe Stanford Law Review.\n  He clerked for then-Judge Antonin Scalia on the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the D.C. Circuit, and subsequently Chief Justice Warren Burger of \nthe U.S. Supreme Court.\n  After a successful career in the Department of Justice, Mr. Cassell \nentered academia and became a professor of law at the University of \nUtah. His scholarship includes over 25 published law review articles.\n  In sum, I thank Chairman Leahy for setting this nomination for a \nvote, and I urge my colleagues to vote to confirm Professor Cassell to \nthe Utah District Court.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a series of letters \nfrom national organizations supporting victims and also supporting Dr. \nPaul Cassell for appointment to the district court.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S4262]]\n\n\n                                             National Organization\n\n\n                                        for Victim Assistance,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 18, 2002.\n     Hon.

Cassell.\n\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of crime victims \n     everywhere, please support the confirmation of Paul G. \n     Cassell to the Federal District Court for the District of \n     Utah. Historically, Professor Cassell has long been one of \n     America's most active and vocal advocates of victim's rights.\n       As one who has been victimized by violent crime I \n     understand how difficult it can be to find articulate, \n     educated advocates for our position. Professor Cassell is one \n     such person: a leader whom goes to battle for the rights of \n     the innocent, especially crime victims. We need more, not \n     less individuals of Professor Cassell's caliber working on \n     behalf of all honest Americans.\n       Please support and vote `aye' to confirm Professor Cassell. \n     He will be a continuing asset to a federal court system that \n     too often prioritizes the rights of the wrong individual.\n       Thank you for your consideration on this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Marc Klaas.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Justice for Murder Victims,\n\n                                San Francisco, CA, March 14, 2002.\n     Re request for your support of Paul G. Cassell for \n         confirmation to the 10th Federal District Court.\n\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: In keeping with yours and our \n     tireless push for the ``U.S. Constitutional Amendment for the \n     rights of victims,'' we ask for your strong support of Paul \n     G. Cassell for confirmation to the 10th Federal District \n     Court for the District of Utah.\n       Mr. Cassell stands for everything that we are attempting to \n     accomplish. He is a man totally dedicated to public safety \n     and victims rights and will be an asset in making the justice \n     system fair and honest for the law-abiding citizens who just \n     happen to become a crime victim.\n       We thank you for continuing to be a strong crime victim's \n     advocate. We appreciate your great effort on behalf of \n     victims of crime.\n       Please feel free to call on us anytime we may be of \n     assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Harriet Salarno,\n     President/Chairperson.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Memory of Victims Everywhere,\n\n                          San Juan Capistrano, CA, March 14, 2002.\n     Re please give strong support to Paul G. Cassell for \n         confirmation to the 10th Federal District Court.\n\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: As one of the hardest hit crime \n     victims in the Nation, I extend my appreciation for your \n     great effort on behalf of the victims of violent crime. Thank \n     you for continuing to be a strong crime victim's advocate. We \n     value your hard work and continued loyalty to bring forth a \n     ``U.S. Constitutional Amendment'' for the rights of crime \n     victims. [You may have been advised that after fourteen years \n     an arrest has finally been made on one of the killers of my \n     brother and sister-in-law.]\n       Knowing of Paul Cassell's wonderful work in the justice \n     area, we would guess that you plan to support him for \n     confirmation to the 10th Federal District Court. We do \n     request your very strong support for him.\n       If you know of Mr. Cassell, you are aware he is a man \n     totally dedicated to making our justice system fair for the \n     honest, law-abiding citizen, who just happens to become a \n     victim of crime.\n       In April 1996, I had the privilege of meeting Paul as we \n     both testified before the U.S. Senate Judiciary in support of \n     your U.S. Constitutional Amendment. Paul Cassell is a leader, \n     doing battle for the rights of the honest people (especially \n     crime victims). Paul has great integrity, fairness and we \n     victims are proud to support him for the Federal District \n     Court of our great Nation.\n       Thank you again and again for your great effort on behalf \n     of victims of crime.\n           My kindest personal regards and with sincerity and \n     appreciation,\n                                       Collene (Thompson) Campbell\n     Former mayor, San Juan Capistrano.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 National Victims'\n\n\n                             Constitutional Amendment Network,\n\n                                       Denver, CO, March 13, 2002.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Senator for California, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the National Victims' \n     Constitutional Amendment Network (NVCAN), I wish to express \n     our strong support for Paul Cassell, Esquire, who has been \n     nominated to serve as a federal judge. Those of us who have \n     been privileged to know and work with Mr. Cassell have deep \n     respect and admiration for his leadership and service to the \n     criminal justice system and the society it serves.\n       Paul Cassell has a distinguished record of outstanding \n     service to others. He is currently a Professor of Law at the \n     University of Utah College of Law, where he teaches criminal \n     procedure. He has written and lectured extensively regarding \n     crime victims' rights, serving on the Utah Council on \n     Victims, where he was instrumental in obtaining the passage \n     of the Utah State Victims' Rights Amendment. He worked with \n     total commitment and dedication on behalf of 89 victims of \n     the Oklahoma City bombing in their efforts to obtain their \n     lawful rights to watch proceedings in that case.\n       His career includes a wealth of experiences that reflect \n     his exceptional ability to strive for balance and fairness in \n     the criminal justice system so that true justice is achieved. \n     Clearly, those qualities have been demonstrated in abundance \n     as NVCAN has worked for the passage of the U.S. \n     Constitutional amendment for crime victims' rights.\n       Paul Cassell is a man of honor and integrity who will bring \n     a keen intellect, ethical conduct and distinction to the \n     federal bench. We in NVCAN have witnessed him as one of our \n     most active contributors and a passionate advocate for equal \n     justice under the law. We hope you will carefully consider \n     our strong support for his confirmation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Roberta Roper,\n     Robert Preston,\n                                                  Co-Chairpersons.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will vote against the nomination of \nProfessor Paul G. Cassell to be a Federal district judge in Utah. Mr. \nCassell's nomination is the first of President\n\n[[Page S4263]]\n\nBush's judicial nominations that I have voted against on the Senate \nfloor. Although Professor Cassell is a highly intelligent and forceful \nadvocate of his views on criminal justice, he clearly lacks the \ntemperament and moderation required for a life-tenured Federal \njudgeship.\n  Professor Cassell is perhaps best known for his longstanding \ncriticism of and campaign to overturn the Supreme Court's decision in \nMiranda v. Arizona. Miranda held that police must provide certain \nwarnings to suspects held in custody if their statements are to be \nlater admitted into evidence. As the Supreme Court recently observed, \nMiranda ``has become embedded in routine police practice to the point \nwhere the warnings have become part of our national culture.'' Across \nthe Nation, law enforcement agencies have concluded that Miranda \ngenerally does not hinder their ability to investigate and prosecute \ncrime.\n  Professor Cassell believes otherwise. He has written numerous law \nreview articles arguing that Miranda was ``an undeniable tragedy''--\n``the most damaging blow inflicted on law enforcement in the last half-\ncentury.'' Cassell's scholarship, however, has received withering \ncriticism from his colleagues. For example, Professor Stephen \nSchulhofer has described Cassell's methodology as ``inconsistent and \nhighly partisan'' and ``junk science of the silliest sort.'' Professor \nCharles Weisselberg stated that his conclusions were based on \n``foolhardy assumptions'' and ``flawed methodologies.'' Professors \nRichard Leo and Richard Ofshe criticized Cassell for advancing \n``logically flawed and empirically erroneous propositions'' that \n``appear to stem from his ideological commitments.''\n  In addition to publishing law review articles, Professor Cassell \nfiled amicus curiae briefs around the country seeking to convince \ncourts that a Federal statute passed in 1968 effectively overruled \nMiranda and made voluntariness the sole test for the admissibility of \nconfessions in Federal criminal cases. At the time of this statute's \nenactment, I stated that it was ``so squarely in conflict with the \nrecent decision of the Supreme Court in Miranda that it will almost \ncertainly be declared unconstitutional as soon as it is tested in the \ncourts.''\n  Fully aware of this infirmity, the Justice Department, from the \nJohnson administration onward, Democratic and Republican \nadministrations alike, made no serious effort to test the statute's \nconstitutionality in court. Nevertheless, in the 1990's, Professor \nCassell singled out the Clinton Justice Department for vigorous attack, \nthe same Department that saw the overall crime rate in the United \nStates decline for 8 out of 8 years, and violent crime drop to its \nlowest point in two decades. Because the Clinton Justice Department \nfailed to endorse his flawed scholarship, Cassell accused it of ``a \nclear constitutional abdication.'' He declared that Attorney General \nJanet Reno had ``team[ed] up with defense lawyers to let armed felons \nand other criminals escape prosecution.'' Imagine that, stating that \nabout an Attorney General. At his nomination hearing before the \nJudiciary Committee, Cassell declined to express any regret for these \noutrageous and unfounded statements.\n  In June 2000, in Dickerson v. United States, the Supreme Court \nvindicated the Justice Department's longstanding position. In an \nopinion written by Chief Justice Rehnquist, seven justices of the \nSupreme Court held that Miranda was a ``constitutional rule'' that may \nnot be overruled by a statute. Professor Cassell described the Court's \nruling as a ``remarkable example of the imperial judiciary.'' He \nproceeded to argue, in both a law review article and a Federalist \nSociety newsletter, that the ruling lacked precedential value. He \ndescribed as ``a silver lining'' in the ``dark cloud of the decision'' \nthe extraordinary statement by Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas, in \ndissent, that they would continue to apply the unconstitutional statute \nin all future cases. Cassell wrote, ``Perhaps the view of the Dickerson \ndissenters will become a majority. Truth, after all, is hard to keep \nburied forever. . . .''\n  Thus, in his scholarship and in his public statements on Miranda, \nProfessor Cassell has shown himself to be intemperate and one-sided. He \nrefuses to admit that his opponents might have a case even after their \nposition has been vindicated by seven justices of the Supreme Court. \nFurthermore, his criticism of the Court calls into question his \ncommitment to the principle of stare decisis and his ability to \nseparate his view of the ``truth'' from settled law. Is this the kind \nof person we want to serve as a Federal judge?\n  I am equally troubled by Professor Cassell's views on the death \npenalty. Reasonable minds can disagree about the death penalty, and we \nhave confirmed and continue to confirm many nominees who believe that \ncapital punishment is an appropriate response to crime. My opposition \nto Professor Cassell's nomination is based not on his support for the \ndeath penalty, but instead on his refusal to even acknowledge the \nevidence showing that serious problems exist in its implementation.\n  Since 1973, 100 people have been released from death row in the \nUnited States because of innocence. In many cases, fatal mistakes were \navoided only because of discoveries made by students or journalists, \nnot the courts. This high number of exonerations has led many \nobservers, both liberal and conservative, to express concern about the \nfairness of the death penalty's administration. For example, Justice \nO'Connor has observed that ``if statistics are any indication, the \nsystem may well be allowing some innocent defendants to be executed.'' \nThere are now death penalty moratoriums in two States, Illinois and \nMaryland, imposed after leaders in each state recognized serious \nconcerns about racial disparities and the possibility that an innocent \nperson might be executed.\n  Professor Cassell has spent his academic career minimizing and \ndismissing such concerns. In spite of the 100 death-row exonerations, \nCassell has described the chance that an innocent might be put to death \nas an ``urban legend.'' He has asserted again and again that there is \nno definitive evidence that any innocent person has been executed in \nthe last 30 years: ``Thus,'' he has argued, ``the most important error \nrate--the rate of mistaken executions--is zero.'' Elsewhere, Cassell \nhas trivialized the danger of fatal error in the Government's \nadministration of the death penalty by comparing it to the risk \ninvolved in driving on a highway, stating that even though innocents \nmay die in traffic accidents, ``we all agree that our highways should \nremain open because of the social benefits they produce.''\n  In 1993, Professor Cassell testified in opposition to a bill that \nwould allow death-row inmates to raise new claims of actual innocence \nin habeas corpus proceedings, arguing that ``[i]f a defendant is truly \ninnocent, he will be fully aware of the circumstances surrounding his \ninnocence and can present them at trial.'' Evidence discovered after \ntrial, he stated, is ``almost invariably unreliable.'' As a district \njudge, Cassell will be charged with the duty of reviewing post-trial \npetitions by State and Federal prisoners, many of which raise claims of \ninnocence. His unorthodox view of the reliability of newly discovered \nevidence is inconsistent with that fundamental duty.\n  Regardless of how we feel about the death penalty generally, there is \none thing that we can all agree on. People on trial for their lives \nmust have effective assistance of counsel, not lawyers who sleep \nthrough the trial. Professor Cassell, however, has expressed a \ndifferent view. In October 2000, a divided panel of the Fifth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals upheld the death sentence in one such case, in which \nthe defense lawyer had repeatedly slept through the trial for \nsubstantial periods of time. Professor Cassell defended this decision \nin an interview on National Public Radio, emphasizing that there was \n``no real suggestion'' that the defendant was innocent. The en banc \nfifth circuit later reversed the panel's decision and reinstated the \ndistrict court's grant of habeas corpus relief. It held that ``when a \nstate court finds on the basis of credible evidence that defense \ncounsel repeatedly slept as evidence was being introduced against a \ndefendant, that defendant has been denied counsel at a critical stage \nof his trial.'' Cassell's willingness to affirm a death sentence in a \ncase where the defense lawyer slept through the trial raises \nfundamental questions about his suitability to serve as a Federal \njudge.\n  A number of lawyers from Utah have written letters to the Judiciary \nCommittee regarding Professor Cassell's\n\n[[Page S4264]]\n\nnomination. They have expressed concern about his lack of ties to Utah \nand limited courtroom experience. Ronald J. Yengich wrote that Cassell \nhas not been ``intellectually honest in his assessment of the problems \nof crime in our society and the response that the Courts should take to \nthem,'' and that he has shown ``an unwillingness to view both sides of \nany legal argument.'' L. Clark Donaldson wrote that Cassell's legal \nscholarship has elevated ``partisan considerations over careful and \ndeliberate analysis of data.'' Kristine M. Rogers stated that his \ncomments have led her ``to conclude that he views our justice system as \na mechanism with which he can manipulate our Government with an agenda \nfor ever increasing governmental power and ever decreasing individual \nrights.'' Stephen M. Enderton, a self-described Republican, believes \nthat Cassell ``would use his position to push his personal ultra \nconservative agenda to the detriment of all of those who appear before \nhis court.''\n  I hope that my concerns and the concerns of these Utah lawyers are \nmisplaced, and that as a judge Professor Cassell will be able to set \naside ideology and apply the law fairly and impartially. His record, \nhowever, indicates otherwise. I therefore oppose this nomination, and I \nurge my colleagues not to approve it.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to respond to remarks made by my \ncolleague from Massachusetts about criticism of Professor Cassell's \nscholarship.\n  Academic debate about such issues as Miranda and the death penalty is \nrobust and uninhibited. It is part of that debate that scholars will \ncriticize the work of other scholars. The validity of that criticism \ndepends, of course, on the merits of the particular claims.\n  Professor Schulhofer and Professor Cassell have engaged in a \nparticularly long-running debate about the merits of Miranda and its \npotential costs to law enforcement. Schulhofer has criticized Cassell's \nwork in various law review articles, and Cassell has responded in other \narticles. The full debate spans dozens of pages in various law reviews. \nSome of the relevant articles are as follows: Paul G. Cassell, \nMiranda's Costs; En Empirical Reassessment, 90 Nw. U.L. Rev. 387 (1996) \n(suggesting that confession rates fell after Miranda); Stephen J. \nSchulhofer, Miranda's Practical Effect: Substantial Benefits and \nVanishingly Small Social Costs, 90 Nw. U.L. Rev. 500 (1996) (agreeing \nthat rates may have fallen modestly, but arguing against significance \nof this fact); Paul G. Cassell, All Benefits, No Costs: The Grand \nIllusion of Miranda's Defenders, 90 Nw. U.L. Rev. 1084 (1996) \n(responding to Schulhofer's criticisms, noting decline in crime \nclearance rates after Miranda); Stephen J. Schulhofer, Bashing Miranda \nis Unjustified--and Harmful, 20 Harv. J. of Law and Public Policy 347 \n(1997) (arguing that post-Miranda clearance rate decline is explainable \nby other factors); Paul G. Cassell, Miranda's ``Negligible'' Effect on \nLaw Enforcement: Some Skeptical Observations, 20 Harv. J.L. & Pub. \nPolicy. 327 (1997) (responding to Schulhofer's criticisms); Paul G. \nCassell & Richard Fowles, Handcuffing the Cops? A Thirty-Year \nPerspective on Miranda's Harmful Effects on Law Enforcement, 50 Stan. \nL. Rev. 1055 (1998) (multiple regression analysis of crime clearance \nrates suggesting structural drop in clearance rate function after \nMiranda). As explained in greater detail in those articles, Cassell \nbelieves that it is important to attempt to calculate the costs of the \nMiranda decision, even though the data that may be available for such a \ncalculation is limited.\n  Professors Richard A. Leo and Richard J. Ofshe have criticized \nCassell's work on false confessions, often in particularly strong \nterms. Unlike the other academic exchanges in which Cassell has been \ninvolved, this dispute has been litigated in several court cases. \nCriminal defendants have offered the paid ``expert'' testimony of \nProfessors Leo and Ofshe in support of their defenses. Prosecutors have \npresented Cassell's writings in response, arguing that Leo and Ofshe \nare not sufficiently reliable to be allowed to testify. Several courts \nhave agreed with my critiques of their work. For example, in one fairly \nrecent case, a Federal district court concluded that proffered \ntestimony on false confessions by Professor Leo would not satisfy the \nreliability requirements for scientific evidence. The court held: \n``Therefore the motion to call Dr. Leo will be denied. I find there is \ninadequate showing that the reasoning or methodology underlying the \nproffered testimony is reliable nor has it gained acceptance in the \nrelevant scientific community.'' See United States v. Juan Carlos \nHiguera-Cruz No. 99CR 2975-TW (S.D. Cal. Feb. 8, 2000), tr. at 145. The \ncourt cited Cassell's research as one reason for reaching its \nconclusion. After reviewing Cassell's article in the Harvard Journal of \nLaw and Public Policy, the court explained: ``Professor Cassell . . . \nconcluded that all nine people were in fact, likely guilty. . . . That, \nat the very least, casts doubt on the methodology o[f] the study that \nDr. Leo conducted and whether or not it is substantially or \nscientifically reliable or valid.'' See id. at 142-43.\n\n  In a similar ruling handed down recently, a State district court \njudge in New Mexico also found Professor Leo to be unreliable. Tracking \narguments that Cassell made in his article, the court explained: \n``While the area of specialty of Dr. Leo is an important area of study, \nnevertheless, as recognized by Dr. Leo, there are considerable \nlimitations which presently exist for the analysis of interrogation \ntechniques and their bearing upon false confessions.'' State v. Lance \nFour Star, No. D-0101-CR-2000000276, op. at 1-2 (1st Jud. D.C. of New \nMex., Aug. 23, 2001). Moreover, the court explained: ``The conclusions \nof Dr. Leo are arrived at from an analysis of a small number of cases \n(sixty) which are not randomly selected. . . . Even if one were to \nconcede the methodology of determining whether a confession is false to \na high probability, the numbers used are extremely small.'' Id. at 2. \nThere are other cases to similar effect (both in the United States and \nCanada) finding either Professor Leo's or Professor Ofshe's work to be \ninsufficiently reliable to be admitted in court.\n  Professor George Thomas and Professor Cassell have enjoyed debating \nthe Miranda issue in various fora. Their most extensive debate appeared \nin the UCLA Law Review. See George C. Thomas III, Is Miranda A Real-\nWorld Failure? A Plea for More (and Better) Empirical Evidence, 43 UCLA \nL. Rev. 821 (1996) (calling for empirical research on Miranda); Paul G. \nCassell & Bret S. Hayman, Police Interrogation in the 1990s: An \nEmpirical Study of the Effects of Miranda, 43 UCLA L. Rev. 839 (1996) \n(providing empirical research on Miranda); George C. Thomas III, Plain \nTalk about the Miranda Empirical Debate: A ``Study-State'' Theory of \nConfession, 43 UCLA L. Rev. 933 (1996) (noting that ``Cassell and \nHayman have performed a great service to the criminal justice community \nby gathering, categorizing, and presenting the Salt Lake County data. \nThough I interpret some of the data differently than Cassell and Hayman \ndo, the debate is richer because of their data;'' offering critique of \nthe study). Professor Thomas has sent a letter to the Judiciary \nCommittee strongly endorsing Cassell's nomination.\n\n  Professor Charles D. Weisselberg has also critiqued Cassell's work. \nHis critique, however, is really more of a summary of the critiques of \nother scholars. He also said that he was analyzing Cassell's work \n``because it represents the most detailed and determined empirical \neffort to measure Miranda's costs.'' He also notes that Cassell's \nregression analysis was replicated, for two crime categories, by \nProfessor John Donohue and that, after ``careful study, Donohue could \nneither substantiate nor reject Cassell's and Fowles's claims.'' \nBecause Weisselberg is summarizing the critique of Cassell's research, \nmore extensive responses are found in the law review articles \nresponding to those critiques.\n  Professor Welsh White has critiqued Cassell's use of an estimate of \nwrongful convictions from an Ohio judge. Professor White has found \nCassell's work sufficiently meritorious to devote significant parts of \na book to responding to his views. See Welsh S. White, Miranda's Waning \nProtections: Police Interrogation Practices After Dickerson 72 (2001) \n(noting that chapter 7 of the book will discuss my empirical arguments \nand chapter 8 will discuss my constitutional arguments). It may be \nrelevant to note that Professor White teachers at the University of\n\n[[Page S4265]]\n\nPittsburgh School of Law. In September 200, Cassell delivered the \nMellon Lecture at his school.\n  Finally, in considering criticisms of Cassell's work, it might also \nbe useful to consider praise of his work. Some of the published \nfavorable comments on Cassell's work include: Yale Kamisar, Can (Did) \nCongress ``Overrule'' Miranda, 85 Cornell L. Rev. 883 (200) (noting \n``the compelling presence on the scene of Professor Paul Cassell''); \nJudge Alex Kozinski, The Fourth Annual Frankel Lecture: The Relevance \nof Legal Scholarship to the Judiciary and Legal Community: Who Gives a \nHott About Legal Scholarship?, 37 Hous. L. Rev. 295 (2000) (reviewing \nCassell's academic research on Miranda, which lead to the Dickerson \ndecision; concluding ``this strikes me as a monumental academic \nachievement . . . Cassell, through his academic writings, has given \nthis issue legitimacy, and an argument that a mere five years ago would \nhave been received with a chuckle may now turn out to be the law of the \nland''); Michael Edmund O'Neill, Undoing Miranda, 2000 BYU L. Rev. 185 \n(noting doctrinal uncertainties about Miranda and concluding \n``Professor Cassell has offered perhaps the best answer to this \nperplexing question'').\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I cannot support the confirmation of this \nnominee for the Federal district court. To cite just one instance of \nhis intemperate remarks, Mr. Cassell wrote in a published article that \nthe U.S. Department of Justice ``team(ed) up with criminal defense \nlawyers to let armed felons and other criminals escape prosecution.'' \nStatements such as this, and there are others, show an absence of the \njudicial temperament necessary to warrant a lifetime appointment to the \nFederal court.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nPresident Bush's nomination of Paul G. Cassell for the U.S. District \nCourt for the District of Utah. The Judiciary Committee approved \nProfessor Cassell by voice vote on May 2, 2002, and I would urge my \ncolleagues to vote in favor of this nomination.\n  Paul Cassell has excellent academic credentials. He graduated from \nStanford University Law School, where he was president of the Stanford \nLaw Review. Following law school he served two clerkships, one for \nthen-Judge Antonin Scalia on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. \nCircuit, and one for Chief Justice Warren Burger of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. Cassell's professional experience includes service as an \nAssistant U.S. Attorney and also Associate Deputy Attorney General at \nthe U.S. Department of Justice. As a professor at the University of \nUtah College of Law, he distinguished himself as a popular and well-\nrespected teacher. His scholarship includes over 25 published law \nreview articles, as well as numerous articles in major newspapers and \nperiodicals.\n  Professor Cassell has become a national expert on criminal procedure \nand evidence and one of the Nation's leading experts on victims' \nrights. He has represented victims of crime across the country, always \non a pro bono basis. For instance, he represented victims of the \nOklahoma City bombing in their efforts to observe the trial and \nsentencing proceedings. His advocacy is the reason why those families \ndid not lose the right to observe the McVeigh trial. Recently, his pro \nbono efforts resulted in a significant victory for victims of crime in \nthe Utah Supreme Court. On March 12, 2002, in State v. Casey, the court \nagreed with Professor Cassell that crime victims have the right to be \nheard before any plea bargain is accepted by the court and the right to \nappeal issues relating to that right. As a result of Cassell's efforts, \nthis opinion recognized that victims have an important role to play in \nour criminal justice system and that their rights must be respected by \ncourts and prosecutors.\n  Professor Cassell has also been actively involved in fighting \ndomestic violence and sexual assault in Utah. In April 2002, Professor \nCassell filed briefs in the Utah Supreme Court on behalf of the Rape \nRecovery Center and the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence to \nprotect the confidentiality of rape crisis counseling records. \nAdditionally, Professor Cassell has been an active participant in legal \naffairs in Utah. For many years, he has served as the chair of the \nLegislative Committee of the Utah Council on Victims of Crime as well \nas a member on the Utah Supreme Court's Advisory Committee on Rules of \nCriminal Procedure.\n  In previous weeks many of my colleagues have highlighted the need to \naddress the vacancy crisis in the Federal courts. I am concerned that \nthere are some in the Senate who are perpetuating this vacancy. The \nSenate must do its part to act swiftly on the President's nominees. I \nhave voiced concern in the past that certain Senators have made it \nknown that they will require that a nominee be recommended by the \nAmerican Bar Association. While I believe that this is an unnecessary \nrequirement and an extra-constitutional test, Paul Cassell has, \nnonetheless, passed this test and a substantial majority of the \nAmerican Bar Association review committee rates him ``well qualified'' \nto be a Federal judge.\n  Paul Cassell's long list of credentials indicate his preparedness to \nserve as a Federal judge. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in \nfavor of the nomination of Paul G. Cassell for the U.S. District Court \nfor the District of Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 56 seconds. The \nSenator from Utah has 1 minute.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have told the Senator from Utah I will \nlet him go last.\n  I have no doubts about Professor Cassell's intelligence, his passion, \nand his commitment to how he thinks the law should read. I am sure he \nis a fine professor of law. I suspect he is an effective advocate. But \nviewed as a whole, his career has been one of a results-oriented \nadvocate where he has worked forcefully to push the law to the far \nright. His one-man war on Miranda, his aggressive defense of our flawed \nsystem of capital punishment, even though 100 people have been released \nbecause of mistakes, and his work on other matters place him outside \nthe mainstream of modern American jurisprudence. Even more troubling is \nhis clear track record of manipulating sources and data to promote his \nideological agenda.\n  I have voted for 56 of the last 57 of the President's judicial \nnominees so far, and I will surely vote for many, many more, but on the \nbasis of all I have seen in connection with the nomination of Paul \nCassell, I cannot and will not vote in favor of this nomination. My \njudgment is that he is not likely to be the kind of fair and impartial \njudge that is essential to our Federal courts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it seems ironic to me that my colleagues \nare attacking Paul Cassell for having used yeoman efforts to uphold a \nFederal statute that was passed by the Congress of the United States in \n29 U.S.C. 3501 which basically said that voluntary confessions will be \nadmitted into evidence if there is just a technical mistake. I have to \nsay I believe that is ridiculous. I think he had every right to try to \nuphold that statute. Personally, I think he was right in his arguments, \nbut the Supreme Court found otherwise. He made it very clear that that \nis the law now and he will abide by it.\n  I also disagree with my colleagues who characterize him again as \nmanipulating statistics and figures. There are people who disagree with \nPaul Cassell, as is the case in academia. He disagrees with them. But I \nhappen to know this is one of the most honorable, honest people who \nlives in our society today. I personally don't appreciate his being \ntreated this way.\n  It pains me to hear my colleagues attacking Paul Cassell, one of the \nmost stellar nominees this body has ever had the privilege of \nconsidering for confirmation to the district court bench.\n  I have to say that, even before those disparaging remarks were made, \nit was already an embarrassment to me that the Judiciary Committee and \nSenate leadership have taken nearly a year--328 days to be exact--to \nbring Professor Cassell's nomination to a floor vote. This is by far \nthe longest time that any district court nominee has had to wait for a \nvote during this Congress. In fact,\n\n[[Page S4266]]\n\nthis vote has been delayed so long that the Administrative Office of \nthe Courts declared the seat to which Professor Cassell was nominated a \njudicial emergency several months ago.\n  But rather than just register my disbelief and disappointment, I \nwould like to address the two issues that the critics and nay-sayers \nare bringing up: Professor Cassell's work in the areas of capital \npunishment and the so-called Miranda warning.\n  Mr. President, don't let anyone fool you: The fact is that Cassell's \nviews on these topics reflect thoughtful, responsible, mainstream legal \nideas. And Cassell's work in these areas has been driven by nothing \nother that a deeply felt desire to improve the justice system for the \nbenefit of all Americans. So, rather than let my colleagues misstate \nand mis-characterize those views, I would like to explain what \nProfessor Cassell really thinks on these topics.\n  First, capital punishment. Professor Cassell, like many scholars, \njurists, and a majority of the population of the United States, \nsupports capital punishment in appropriate cases. Cassell has argued \nthat Congress and the States have the power to impose capital \npunishment for those who have committed the most serious offenses \nrepresenting the wanton, willful, and reckless disregard for innocent \nhuman life. The fact that he has had the courage to say so in today's \nmonolithic academic culture should be taken as evidence of his ability \nto think independently in the face of peer pressure--a quality we want \nin judges. But that courage has led people who disagree with him to \nattempt to reduce his views to mere caricatures. His critics are trying \nto make-believe that he has a callous attitude toward anyone wrongly \nsentenced to death. But nothing could be further from the truth. \nCassell's support for capital punishment is tempered by his expressed \ncommitment to ensure that innocent persons are not executed. Professor \nCassell has said so in his writings and proven so by his actions. For \ninstance, Professor Cassell has helped his law school, the University \nof Utah College of Law, raise funds for its recently formed Rocky \nMountain Innocence Project, whose goal is to identify defendants who \nhave been wrongfully convicted of capital or other crimes. Cassell has \nalso offered the Project his legal services, pro bono, to help pursue \nthe first case that the Project identifies. Cassell has also supported \nUtah's recently enacted Post-Conviction Testing of DNA Act. The act, \none of the first in the country, provides for state-financed testing of \npotentially exculpatory DNA evidence when DNA testing was not available \nat trial. As you can see, Mr. President, Professor Cassell is a \nthoughtful and principled mainstream legal thinker whose views are \nentirely consistent with the majority of Americans.\n  The second area of Cassell's advocacy and scholarship that I would \nlike to address concerns the so-called Miranda warnings. But Mr. \nPresident, before I explain the underlying issues here, I think it is \neven more important to note that, even those who have disagreed with \nCassell on the specifics of Miranda recognize that he would fair-\nmindedly follow the law. Michigan Law Professor Yale Kamisar, the \nnation's leading academic defender of Miranda, has said: ``Cassell's a \nsmart guy, and even though he doesn't like Miranda, I think he'd apply \nit conscientiously as a judge.'' This observation--that Cassell is \ncommitted to following the law, is really all that any Senator should \nneed to know. But let me explain further.\n  Many people know that Professor Cassell argued in the Supreme Court \nlast year in support of a statute enacted by Congress that purported to \nmodify some of the complex rules that have grown up around the Miranda \nholding. The case was called Dickerson v. United States. In Dickerson, \nFBI agents questioned an armed bank robber and obtained incriminating \nstatements. It was undisputed that these statements were given \nvoluntarily. However, there was a dispute as to whether the Miranda \nwarnings had been given to the bank robber before or after the \nquestioning. After the district court ruled that these voluntary \nstatements could not be used as evidence against the defendants, \nCassell briefed and argued the matter in the fourth circuit as a friend \nof the court.\n  Cassell's position was that Congress, in enacting a law known as \nSec. 3501, had validly required these voluntary statements to be \nadmitted into evidence, even if there was a technical dispute over the \ntiming of the warnings. The Fourth Circuit agreed with Cassell. The \nSupreme Court later asked Cassell to argue that position on appeal, \nwhich he did. After considering the argument, a majority of the Supreme \nCourt disagreed with Cassell's position and ruled for the other side. \nAs Cassell told the Judiciary Committee, because of his personal \ninvolvement in that case, there's probably no one who understands the \nsettled law on Miranda better than Cassell.\n  Mr. President, any one who knows anything about law knows that a \nlawyer's arguments in court do not always necessarily reflect his or \nher own personal views on the topic. In fact, it is a very important \nprinciple in our legal system that clients on both sides of an issue \ndeserve forceful advocates for their position. So it is simply specious \nfor anyone to pretend that every argument in Dickerson reflects \nProfessor Cassell's personal opinion. In fact, it is worse than \nspecious--it is downright misrepresentation. That's because Professor \nCassell has written law review articles--not for a client, but on his \nown--in which he argues for a more modest public policy change than he \nadvocated in the Dickerson case. Cassell's own article urge that police \nofficers should continue to give most of the Miranda warnings, but \nsuggests that some of the warnings should be modified and replaced with \nthe requirement that police officers videotape interrogations as better \ninsurance that constitutional rights are respected. After all, a true \nrecord of police interrogations is much better evidence of \nvoluntariness than the simple fact that the policeman remembered to \nread the Miranda warning. This argument has been adopted by many civil \nlibertarians, who agree with Cassell that videotaping would more \neffectively protect against police abuses and suspects who are \nwrongfully persuaded to falsely confess.\n  In other words, Mr. President, Professor Cassell's position on the \nMiranda warnings could actually offer more, rather than less, \nprotection for Americans against possible abuse by police. So any \nattempt to pigeon-hole Professor Cassell as not supporting the rights \nof criminal defendants is a gross caricature of his reasoned and \nthoughtful analysis of how best to reform the criminal justice process \nin order to protect the very rights that some accuse him of \ndisregarding.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues not to be taken in by inaccurate \nor false representations of Cassell's record. It is one thing for \npeople to disagree--which I certainly respect. But it is quite another \nto carelessly or purposely mislead others into misunderstanding the \nreal arguments. In the case of Professor Cassell, his positions on \ncapital punishment and the Miranda warnings are thoughtful and \nreasonable views, held by many mainstream legal thinkers like himself. \nAnd the most important fact of all is that Professor Cassell knows the \ndifference between the roles of the advocate and the judge, and he has \ncommitted to follow the law. I again urge my colleagues to vote to \nconfirm Paul Cassell, who, I am convinced, will be a principled and \nfairminded judge who applies the law impartially as written and \ninterpreted.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Paul G. Cassell, of Utah, to be U.S. District Judge for the District \nof Utah? The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), the \nSenator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin), the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), \nthe Senator from Vermont (Mr. Jeffords), the Senator from Massachusetts \n(Mr. Kerry), the Senator from Louisiana (Ms. Landrieu), the Senator \nfrom Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman), the Senator from Maryland (Ms. \nMikulski), the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller), the Senator from \nNebraska (Mr. Nelson), and the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Torricelli) \nare necessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3405 To Amendment No. 3401\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask an amendment at the desk be called \nup relating to investor--State relationships with respect to chapter \n11.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus], for himself, Mr. \n     Grassley, and Mr. Wyden, proposes an amendment numbered 3405 \n     to amendment No. 3401.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To clarify the principal negotiating objectives of the United \n               States with respect to foreign investment)\n\n       On page 229, line 23, strike all through ``United States,'' \n     on line 25, and insert the following: ``foreign investors in \n     the United States are not accorded greater rights than United \n     States investors in the United States,''.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. This is an amendment I am offering on behalf of myself, \nSenator Grassley, and Senator Wyden. Our amendment concerns an \ninvestor-State dispute settlement. That is the ``chapter 11 question'' \nas it has come to be called. It is based on the placement of investor-\nState provisions in NAFTA.\n  This is not bankruptcy chapter 11. It has nothing to do with \nbankruptcy. When I say ``chapter 11,'' it sometimes causes confusion, \nbut this is chapter 11 in NAFTA.\n  Our amendment modifies the objective on investment in the trade bill \nto make clear that foreign investors in the United States should not be \naccorded a higher level of protection of their rights than U.S. \ncitizens in the United States.\n  There has been a lot of discussion of NAFTA chapter 11 in recent \ndays. In particular, a number of Senators have expressed legitimate \nconcerns about the impact that chapter 11, and other similar provisions \nin other agreements, may have on the ability of State and local \ngovernments to regulate--that is, to adopt and enforce laws that \nprotect the public health, safety, and welfare.\n  There is a growing consensus that we need to make sure that new trade \nand investment agreements don't give foreign investors in the United \nStates greater rights than we give our own citizens. International \nagreements must not become a back door for expanded protection of \nforeign investors at the expense of protection of our environment, \nhealth, and safety.\n  This view has been strongly and consistently expressed by various \nState and local government organizations, as well as environmental \norganizations, in recent weeks.\n  For example, a resolution adopted by the National Association of \nAttorneys General at their March meeting encourages Congress:\n\n     . . . to ensure that in any new legislation providing for \n     international trade agreements foreign investors shall \n     receive no greater rights to financial compensation than \n     those afforded to our citizens.\n\n  A letter last week from a large coalition of environmental groups, \nincluding Defenders of Wildlife, Friends of the Earth, the Sierra Club, \nand the National Wildlife Federation, urged the Senate to:\n\n     . . . require that trade and investment agreements do not \n     provide foreign corporations with greater rights than U.S. \n     citizens have under the Constitution.\n\n  Similarly, a recent letter from the president of the National \nWildlife Federation to Ambassador Zoellick states:\n\n       An important step to restore consensus would be to make \n     clear in fast track legislation and in investment agreements \n     that those brining expropriation challenges under investment \n     rules will not be granted rights greater than those provided \n     under the takings jurisprudence of the U.S. Constitution.\n\n  The United States Conference of Mayors has expressed its concern that \nthe bill as now drafted:\n\n     . . . would allow trade officials to include investor \n     protection standards in future trade agreements that go \n     beyond U.S. law and that effectively grant foreign investors \n     greater rights than U.S. citizens enjoy.\n\n  In another letter, the National Association of Counties expresses its \nconcern that under the trade bill:\n\n     . . . foreign investors operating in the U.S. would have \n     greater legal rights against our government than our own \n     citizens possess.\n\n  Each of these organizations makes an excellent point. We have heard \ntheir message, and that is why we have offered the present amendment. \nWe want to make sure that in protecting the rights of U.S. citizens \nabroad, our negotiators do not inadvertently encroach on the \nprerogatives of Government here at home. This amendment seeks to strike \nthe right balance between these different sets of interests.\n  The bill's objective on investment opens with a statement recognizing \nthat--on the whole--U.S. law provides a level of protection of \ninvestment that is:\n\n       . . . consistent with or greater than the level required by \n     international law.\n\n  It goes on to state that our negotiators should ensure that:\n\n       United States investors in the United States are not \n     accorded lesser rights than foreign investors in the United \n     States.\n\n  Some have read this language to imply that negotiators might seek to \ngive foreign investors more rights than U.S. citizens now enjoy, and \nthen seek to amend U.S. law to enhance the rights of U.S. citizens. In \nother words, they read this language as a mandate to expand individual \nproperty rights in the U.S. through the back door of international \nnegotiations.\n  Let me be very clear in stating that that was not what the language \nat issue was intended to accomplish. The committee report on the bill \nemphasizes that obligations the U.S. undertakes in investment \nagreements:\n\n       . . . should not result in foreign investors being entitled \n     to compensation for government measures where a similarly \n     situated U.S. investor would not be entitled to relief.\n\n  In other words, the rights of U.S. investors under U.S. law define \nthe ceiling. Negotiators must not enter into agreements that grant \nforeign investors rights that breach that ceiling.\n  The amendment we have laid down is intended to foreclose any doubt on \nthis question. It is our objective to negotiate agreements that protect \nthe\n\n[[Page S4268]]\n\nrights of U.S. persons abroad. But we are not willing to sacrifice the \nregulatory functions of our own Government in order to obtain that \nobjective.\n  As the letters I quoted attest, getting clarity on this point is the \nnumber one priority for many of the organizations that have written \nabout chapter 11. They make a fair point. Given the interests at stake, \nwe must be crystal clear about the ground rules. U.S. negotiators must \nnot conclude agreements that give foreign investors greater protection \nof their property rights than our own citizens already enjoy. Our well-\ndeveloped law should define the ceiling. The amendment that we offer \ntoday makes that unmistakable.\n  The chapter 11 issues are some of the most challenging to confront us \nin the fast track debate. Important questions about the needs of \nGovernment and the rights of individuals are at stake. I believe that \nthe Finance Committee bill struck a very good balance. I believe that \nthe amendment we have laid down makes that balance even better, and I \nurge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nMontana for offering this amendment. I think it helps improve what is \nalready an excellent bill.\n  First, I want to make it clear that the bipartisan trade promotion \nauthority bill currently pending in the Senate goes further than any \nprior bill to address concerns about potential abuse of the investor-\nState dispute process. At the same time, the bill recognizes that \nprotecting U.S. investors abroad is also an extremely important \nobjective. In short, the bill is balanced. Some people are attempting \nto undermine that balance. I think that is a mistake.\n  Foreign investment is closely interrelated to trade. Companies invest \nabroad to get closer to markets, acquire new technologies, form \nstrategic alliances, and enhance competitiveness by integrating \nproduction and distribution. When they invest abroad, U.S. companies \noften become consumers of U.S. exports--either from affiliated entities \nor other U.S. companies.\n  The importance of international investment to the U.S. economy is \nlarge and growing. The United States receives more than 30 percent of \nworldwide investment. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic \nAnalysis, foreign investment in the United States grew sevenfold \nbetween 1994 and 2000, reaching almost $317 billion last year. As of \n1998, foreign companies had invested over $3.5 trillion in the United \nStates. They employed 5.6 million people and paid average annual \nsalaries of over $46,000, well above the average salary for U.S. \nworkers as a whole.\n  The ability of U.S. companies to invest abroad is also vital to U.S. \neconomic growth and U.S. exports. Between 1994 and 2000, U.S. \ninvestment abroad doubled from $73 billion to $148 billion. U.S. \ninvestment abroad is critical to support a more dynamic and flexible \nU.S. economy, greater export flows and higher paying jobs for American \nworkers.\n  For the last 25 years, each successive administration has recognized \nthat it is critical to negotiate strong, objective and fair investment \nprotections in our international agreements to continue to promote such \ninvestment. These traditional investment protections are largely based \non U.S. law and policy and established international law rules of which \nthe U.S. has been the chief architect and advocate.\n  The Senate Finance Committee gave very careful consideration to \ninvestment issues and some concerns expressed about NAFTA chapter 11 \nwhen we discussed H.R. 3005, the bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority \nAct.\n  Both Republican and Democratic members of the committee agreed to \nseveral improvements to the U.S. negotiating position on investment, \nwhich include: providing a mechanism for the early dismissal of \nfrivolous claims, injecting greater transparency into arbitration \nproceedings, and establishing a review mechanism.\n  The bill and accompanying report also provide the committee's views \non ensuring that U.S. investors abroad enjoy protections comparable to \nthose available to foreign investors in the United States under \nexisting U.S. law, while at the same time not making our own \nregulations unduly subject to treaty challenge on grounds that have no \nfoundation in U.S. law and practice.\n  The degree of support for the final product is demonstrated by a \nstrong bipartisan committee vote of 18 to 3 in favor of the bill.\n  These provisions represent a very careful balance between the \npolitical concerns raised by particular cases under the NAFTA chapter \n11 process and the need to continue to provide U.S. citizens with \nstrong investment protections overseas.\n  Yet, some Members still have concerns that foreign investors in the \nUnited States will receive greater rights under these provisions than \nU.S. investors in the United States receive. The amendment we are \noffering today makes it clear that this is not the case. It is a good \nimprovement to an already excellent bill. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to speak just briefly about \nthe chairman's amendment. I understand what the Senator is trying to do \nwith this amendment, and I appreciate his efforts to seek common \nground. He has not had an easy job trying to steer this omnibus trade \npackage through very stormy seas.\n  I am grateful for the chairman's willingness to be responsive to some \nof the concerns that I--and others--have raised. However, on the issue \nof investor-State dispute settlement, I am afraid that substantial \ndisagreement remains. The Baucus-Grassley amendment makes a minor \nchange to the bill. It is certainly better than the current language, \nbut it just does not do a good enough job of protecting the ability of \nFederal, State and local governments to enact legitimate public health \nand safety legislation.\n  As my colleagues know by now, it is clear that NAFTA's investor-State \ndispute resolution process popularly known as ``Chapter 11''--will be \nthe model upon which future such agreements are predicated. Chapter 11 \nis a flawed model, not a failed model. I believe that having an \ninvestor-State dispute settlement process in a trade agreement is vital \nto ensuring that U.S. investors are able to invest abroad with \nconfidence--but it needs to be improved.\n  Regrettably, the Baucus-Grassley amendment does not despite what its \nproponents claim--effectively address the shortcomings in the chapter \n11 model. Adopting the Baucus-Grassley language without other needed \nchanges will still allow future chapter 11-like tribunals to rule \nagainst legitimate U.S. public health and safety laws using a standard \nof expropriation that goes well beyond the clear standard that the \nSupreme Court has established in all its expropriation cases.\n  The amendment before us does not give any assurances that the due \nprocess clause of the Constitution will be respected, nor does it \nprovide safe harbor for legitimate U.S. public health and safety laws.\n  Without all of these safeguards, future investor-State dispute \nsettlement bodies can run roughshod over the ability of State and local \ngovernments--or even the Federal Government--to make laws to protect \nthe public. I have an amendment that I believe will make those \nimprovements to the underlying bill, and I intend to offer that \namendment soon.\n  I will not oppose the pending amendment because it does not make the \nunderlying bill any worse. But let us be clear: the chapter 11 model is \nflawed. Any suggestions that the Baucus-Grassley amendment takes care \nof these problems are simply incorrect.\n  So I think we should adopt this amendment by unanimous consent, but I \ndo believe that the Senate should have a thorough debate on this \nissue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/13/senate-section/article/S4268-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to take a moment to recognize \nthe public service of John A. Moran, who resigned from the Federal \nMaritime\n\n[[Page S4269]]\n\nCommission on April 15 to return to private life. While I want to \ncongratulate John on his recent move, I also want to acknowledge and \nthank him for his service at the FMC.\n  John was born and raised in a port and shipbuilding community, \nsomething I consider a good start for any young man. I live in a port \nand shipbuilding community, and there is no better way to understand \nthe importance of the maritime industry to the Nation's economy that to \ngrow up in the presence of the businesses and people that daily bring \nthe goods of our trading partners to our door and carry America's \nproducts to the world. While John was born in Hampton Roads, Virginia, \nnot Mississippi, he is redeemed somewhat in my eyes by the fact that \nhis parents and family are good Mississippians.\n  John developed an interest in maritime law at Washington and Lee \nUniversity School of Law in Lexington, Virginia. This interest was \nencouraged during the year he clerked for the Honorable Richard B. \nKellam in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of \nVirginia. Judge Kellam shared with John his own love and enthusiasm for \nAdmiralty Law and encouraged John to continue to maritime studies at \nTulane University School of Law in New Orleans, Louisiana.\n  I first met John when he served as Republican Counsel to the Merchant \nMarine Subcommittee and the National Ocean Policy Study of the Senate's \nCommittee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. He came to this \nposition after serving in the House of Representatives as Republican \nCounsel to the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Counsel and as Legislative \nCounsel to Virginia's Senator John Warner. While working for the \nCommerce Committee, John worked on issues as varied as the Oil \nPollution Act of 1990, a review of the Shipping Act of 1984, cargo \npreference, the Jones Act, vessel safety and Coast Guard programs, the \nMagnuson Fisheries Conservation and Management Act, seafood safety and \ninspection, ocean driftnet legislation, the Coastal Zone Management \nAct, and the Marine Mammal Protection Act. John worked with Committee \nmembers from states as diverse as Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, \nAlaska, Washington, Oregon, and Virginia. I always was impressed with \nJohn's knowledge and experience, and with is effort to make sure that \nthe concerns of all of the Republican members of the Committee were \nunderstood and addressed.\n  John left the Commerce Committee in 1995, first working for the \ngovernment and public affairs firm of Alcalde & Fay, and then for the \nAmerican Waterways Operators, the trade association representing the \nUnited States tug, towboat, and barge industry. In 1998, Congress was \nnearing completion of the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998 (OSRA). As \nI described it at the time, OSRA truly was a paradigm shift in the \nconduct of the ocean liner business and its regulations by the Federal \nMaritime Commission (FMC). Along with other members of the Commerce \nCommittee who worked for over four years on OSRA, I wanted to ensure \nthat there were Commissioners at the FMC who understood that Congress \nwanted to foster a more competitive and efficient ocean transport \nsystem by placing greater reliance on the marketplace. I thought of \nJohn and his interest and experience in maritime matters. John's \nexperience and philosophy made him the right choice to help the FMC \nimplement OSRA.\n  Confirmed by the Senate in October, 1998, John's efforts during the \npast three and a half years, especially his contributions during the \nFMC's rulemaking, helped establish the foundation making the paradigm \nshift possible. John worked closely with Chairman Harold Creel and the \nother commissioners, the staff of the FMC, the carriers, shippers, and \ntransportation intermediaries to implement OSRA as Congress intended. I \nam pleased to report that, under the Commission's administration, the \nreforms are working much as Congress hoped. John should be proud of his \nwork and the contribution he made during his tenure as a Commissioner.\n  I congratulate John for his exemplary career at the FMC and salute \nhis contributions to the maritime industry. He is to be commended for \nthe productive use of his insights and talents and appreciated for his \nyears of public service. As he returns to private life, where he will \ncontinue working on the maritime issues he loves, I wish John, his wife \nMedina, and their two children fair winds and following seas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/13/senate-section/article/S4269-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REQUEST FOR SEQUENTIAL REFERRAL--S. 2506\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Police were ``baffled'' by the lastest in a series \nof eight inexplicable drowning deaths among mostly Native Americans \nalong Rapid Creek. Press reports indicate that local Native Americans \nbelieve an ``Indian-hater'' is waiting for the victims to become drunk \nand then dragging, rolling, or pushing them into the water. Those \nincidents came on the heels of a March 2000 report from the U.S. Civil \nRights Commission showing that racial tensions in the state are high.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/13/senate-section/article/S4270-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4270-S4273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         DEDICATION OF THE EISENHOWER EXECUTIVE OFFICE BUILDING\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, on Tuesday, May 7th, 2002, the Old \nExecutive Office Building was renamed in honor of President Dwight D. \nEisenhower. The dedication of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Executive Office \nBuilding was pursuant to legislation introduced by my late father, \nSenator John H. Chafee, on September 28, 1999 and signed into law by \nPresident Clinton on November 9, 1999. President George W. Bush, \nSecretary of State Colin L. Powell, General Service Administration \nAdministrator Stephen A. Perry, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul \nWolfowitz, and Eisenhower Institute President Susan Eisenhower were \npresent and delivered remarks at last Tuesday's ceremony. I ask that \ntheir remarks be printed in the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n   Remarks at Dedication Ceremony to Rename the Old Executive Office \n    Building in Honor of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, mAY 7, 2002\n\n\n    Remarks by Administrator Stephen A. Perry, U.S. General Service \n                             Administration\n\n       Mr. President, Secretary Powell, Deputy Secretary \n     Wolfowitz, Ms. Eisenhower and the Eisenhower Family, \n     Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen.\n       It is my privilege to welcome you today to the dedication \n     and renaming of this building--the Eisenhower Executive \n     Office Building. This magnificent structure is one of the \n     most distinctive of the 400 historic properties in the \n     inventory of the General Services Administration.\n       This building was commissioned by another renowned general \n     and president--Ulysses S. Grant. It was designed by architect \n     Alfred B. Mullett. The construction of this building was \n     completed in 1888, and it was known originally as the State, \n     War and Navy Building.\n       As might be expected of a building of this vintage and in \n     this location it is steeped in history. Among other things, \n     it has been the office for 16 Secretaries of the Navy, 21 \n     Secretaries of War and 24 Secretaries of State. Seven future \n     presidents had offices in the building before they eventually \n     became occupants of the Oval Office--including, of course, \n     Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n       This building's commanding presence in our Nation's capital \n     serves to remind us of the commanding presence that President \n     Eisenhower always had. He personified honor, dignity and \n     integrity. The many medals that decorated his Army uniform \n     signify that he was a great leader, a brilliant military \n     strategist, a builder of alliances and a peacemaker.\n       As General Eisenhower and as President Eisenhower, he was a \n     staunch defender of freedom--from the vast arena of world war \n     to the classrooms of a local public high school in Little \n     Rock, Arkansas. He was--and is--a genuine American hero and \n     statesman.\n       Ladies and gentlemen, it is fitting that we honor President \n     Eisenhower's life and legacy with the naming of this stately \n     building. The Dwight D. Eisenhower Executive Office Building \n     marks the spot of its namesake's rightful place in history \n     here in Washington, DC, our nation's capital, and on \n     Pennsylvania Avenue, America's Main Street.\n       Now I would like to introduce our next speaker. Dr. Paul \n     Wolfowitz is our country's 28th Deputy Secretary of Defense. \n     He was previously Dean and Professor of International \n     Relations at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced \n     International Studies of The Johns Hopkins University. His \n     distinguished government career includes service as the \n     Ambassador to Indonesia and Assistant Secretary of State for \n     East Asian and Pacific Affairs.\n       His current appointment marks his third tour of duty at the \n     Pentagon. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Deputy \n     Secretary of Defense, Paul Wolfowitz.\n\n\n         Remarks by Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz\n\n       President Bush; Secretary [of State] Powell; [GSA] \n     Administrator Perry; Susan Eisenhower and members of the \n     Eisenhower family; distinguished guests, ladies and \n     gentlemen.\n       It is an honor to be able to join you today in paying \n     tribute to Dwight David Eisenhower-a man whose courage, \n     dignity and character exemplified the spirit of that \n     ``Greatest Generation,'' which sacrificed so much to preserve \n     peace and freedom for our generation and generations to come.\n       The windows of the Pentagon, where I work, frame a view of \n     the Arlington hillsides where so many of those heroes sleep. \n     Images of that great leader known as ``Ike'' line the \n     Eisenhower Corridor just outside the Pentagon office of the \n     Secretary of Defense. His is the first face--the face of the \n     young cadet, the Supreme Allied Commander, the President of \n     the United States--that many of us see on the start of our \n     day and which sends us on our way each night.\n       Dwight Eisenhower's vision, determination and courage to \n     change continues to inspire and serve as a model for us, Mr. \n     President, as we carry out your instructions to transform \n     America's Armed Forces and prepare for the new and different \n     challenges of the 21st Century.\n       When Dwight David Eisenhower was still a young officer \n     between the world wars, he and another young officer by the \n     name of George Patton began writing about the future of \n     armored warfare. He was called in by his commander and told \n     if he published anything else contrary to ``solid infantry \n     doctrine,'' he would be court-martialed.\n       But Major Eisenhower persevered. Later, Supreme Allied \n     Commander Dwight David Eisenhower put George Patton and the \n     Third Army to work. The rest is history. The history of \n     victory in Europe-victory over Nazi oppression--the \n     foundation of a new and stable peace in Europe that has \n     lasted more than half a century and led to the peaceful \n     triumph in the Cold War.\n       Like all great leaders, Eisenhower had a sense of \n     proportion about himself and a deep humility. Addressing the \n     British Parliament, which honored him after the triumph of \n     the Allied Forces, he said that he was merely a symbol--a \n     symbol of the ``great human forces that have labored \n     arduously and successfully for a righteous cause.''\n       Today, under the leadership of President George W. Bush, we \n     are embarked on another righteous cause, and we remember the \n     example of Eisenhower. We know, as he often told us, that the \n     great fight for freedom did not end at the beaches named \n     Omaha and Utah. It continues today. It continues within the \n     walls of this building that we dedicated to him.\n       And for those who labor for freedom, let them find \n     inspiration in this building's namesake, a man of \n     responsibility and vision, one of freedom's greatest warriors \n     and a great champion of peace.\n       That inspiration is the realization that doing great things \n     requires more than detailed plans--though detailed plans \n     there must be--it requires a great cause and great ideals \n     and, above all, a sense of what is important in this world \n     and the next. No one knew that better than Dwight Eisenhower.\n       There is a story that Eisenhower once went to buy a piece \n     of land in Gettysburg and the local clerk said to him, \n     ``Well, President Eisenhower, you've done everything, you've \n     lived everywhere, why would you want this little piece of \n     land in Gettysburg?'' He answered saying, ``Sir, all my life \n     I have wanted one time to be able to take a small piece of \n     America and make it better.''\n       He made America--all of America--better. And today, we \n     dedicate a small piece of American to Dwight David \n     Eisenhower. May all who work here work to make America \n     better, as he did.\n       And may they remember, as he did, what matters in life. His \n     last words were these: ``I've always loved my wife, I've \n     always loved my children. I've always loved my grandchildren. \n     I've always loved my country.''\n       Now it is my privilege to introduce another leader who \n     loves his country deeply and has devoted his life to making \n     America better, Secretary of State Colin Powell. You do doubt \n     remember, Mr. President--when you announced the appointment \n     of your Secretary of State at a school in Crawford--it was \n     very moving for all of America to see another distinguished \n     soldier, General Colin Powell, come into that office which is \n     so important for the peace of the world.\n       I also remember when Colin said that he didn't ``yet do \n     ranch wear very well'' since he was from the South Bronx. And \n     many of us, especially those of us from back East, secretly \n     agreed with him when he declared, ``I don't care what you \n     say. Those cows look dangerous.''\n       Only a man of integrity and humility could admit that to \n     America.\n       Those are qualities, along with statesmanship and true \n     leadership, that he has brought to every position that he has \n     held. And today the enjoys the gratitude of all Americans and \n     so many others around the world--and I know your gratitude, \n     Mr. President--for his courageous and tireless efforts, not \n     only to make our country safer, but to make the world more \n     peaceful.\n       I am proud to present to you a man of whom Dwight \n     Eisenhower would be proud\n\n[[Page S4271]]\n\n     today--another soldier, statesman and leader--our Secretary \n     of State, Colin Powell.\n\n\n      Remarks by Susan Eisenhower, President, Eisenhower Institute\n\n       Mr. President and First Lady. Secretary Powell. Secretary \n     Wolfowitz. Honored guests, I was nervous about the weather \n     this morning and when I looked out the window I was reminded \n     of a similar day not long after my grandfather, Dwight \n     Eisenhower, became President. He agreed to speak at Penn \n     State where his brother was President of the University. When \n     Milton called him frantically and asked him if they should \n     move the outdoor proceedings inside, Ike brushed off his \n     concerns, ``It's up to you Milton,'' he said, ``I haven't \n     worried about the weather since June 6, 1944.''\n       We have our minds on bigger things today and I think it is \n     fitting that today we mark the renaming of the Old Executive \n     Office Building to the Dwight D. Eisenhower Executive Office \n     Building. Dwight Eisenhower spent more time in this building \n     than any other man who became President, and during his term \n     he saved it from the wrecking ball. But it is also fitting \n     that we mark this occasion today as we celebrate Victory in \n     Europe Day. Dwight Eisenhower and VE Day will be linked \n     forever in our consciousness.\n       Yet our contemporary minds can barely grasp the \n     significance of that day--57 years ago. Had the allies not \n     been successful or if victory had eluded us longer the world \n     would have turned out to be a very different place: one can \n     imagine what the consequences would have been if Nazis had \n     prevailed, but the world might have been radically different \n     even if an allied victory had taken longer to secure. A \n     nuclear bomb might have been used in Europe, for instance, or \n     the liberation of the death camps might have come too late . \n     . . .\n       June 12, 1945, a little more than one month after the end \n     of the hostilities, Dwight Eisenhower stood on the balcony of \n     London's Guildhall and accepted the freedom of the city and \n     the London Sword. The killing had stopped, but the cost of \n     the conflict had only begun to be measured.\n       Europe lay in utter ruins. Cities had been crushed, \n     economies had collapsed and the carnage was beyond our \n     comprehension. In the European theater, including Russia, \n     11\\1/2\\ million allied soldiers were killed in action and \n     more than 7 million Allied civilians perished from \n     starvation, bombing or butchery, and that is not counting \n     those who were victims of the Holocaust.\n       Eisenhower had led a great military crusade to defeat \n     Nazism and had decisively prevailed. Standing before the \n     teeming London crowd that day Eisenhower began his acceptance \n     speech solemnly, without a written text:\n       ``The high sense of distinction I feel in receiving this \n     great honor from the city of London is inescapably mingled \n     with feelings of profound sadness,'' he said. ``. . . \n     Humility must always be the portion of any man who receives \n     acclaim earned in blood of his followers and sacrifices of \n     his friends.''\n       In this speech--which he had written himself and memorized \n     for the occasion--he accepted the tribute, acknowledging that \n     he was but a symbol of great human forces that had ``labored \n     arduously and successfully for a righteous cause . . .''\n       He continued: ``If all Allied men and women that have \n     served with me in this war can only know that it is they whom \n     this august body is really honoring today, then indeed I will \n     be content.''\n       In thinking about that occasion, I can imagine that if \n     Dwight Eisenhower were with us today to accept this honor--he \n     would, again deflect our praise of him onto those with whom \n     he had served. He would have eloquent words for the team he'd \n     assembled during the war and for the fighting men and women, \n     and he would gratefully acknowledge the legions of dedicated \n     public servants--on both sides of the aisle--with whom he \n     worked closely during his presidency. He would acknowledge \n     not only his staff but Congress as well, for helping him: \n     shepherd America through the dangerous years of the Cold war; \n     modernize America's infrastructure, that laid the groundwork \n     for technological innovation; explore space through a \n     civilian agency, NASA, that would be the envy of the world; \n     and begin the long and arduous task of making Civil Rights \n     every American's right.\n       If Dwight Eisenhower were here he would be right about the \n     indispensable role played by the millions who answered their \n     nation's call in war and at peace.\n       But Eisenhower is not here today, and so while we \n     acknowledge those who served with him we focus, today, on \n     this modest man and remember him--for his leadership, and for \n     his steady, even, hand.\n       Though he did not believe in the Great Man theory of \n     history he was a leader of leaders; a common man with an \n     unwavering belief in putting the nation's welfare above \n     partisan politics . . . in seeking out the obligations and \n     responsibilities that go with good government . . .\n       It is a privilege for me to speak on behalf of the \n     Eisenhower family in thanking the nation for this honor. We \n     are indebted to Congress--to the late Senator Chafee and his \n     bipartisan cosponsors who initiated the legislation to rename \n     the building--to President Clinton for signing it into law, \n     and to President Bush--for this wonderful rededication and \n     for his presence here today.\n       Mr. President, today, you too, are facing a difficult \n     moment in American history. Though different in nature from \n     World War II, nonetheless, we recognize the enormity of the \n     task that confronts you in finding a just solution to the \n     complex domestic and international circumstances that have \n     emerged in the aftermath of the terrible events of September \n     11.\n       As you face these challenges, it gives me great pleasure to \n     know that you have Dwight Eisenhower right next door.\n       I hope that his name on this vital nerve center of White \n     House operations will help another generation of public \n     servants re-commit themselves to nothing less than self-\n     sacrifice, devotion to duty and the most profound sense of \n     humility. These are the qualities that are called for in \n     these dangerous and troubling times.\n       And now, it is my great honor to introduce the President of \n     the United States, George W. Bush.\n\n\n  remarks by the president of the united states of america, george w. \n                                  bush\n\n       Thank you very much. Please be seated. Well, thank you all \n     very much. And thank you, Susan, for those kind words, and \n     welcome.\n       On behalf of all Americans, I am proud to dedicate this \n     historic building to the lasting memory of a great man, \n     Dwight David Eisenhower.\n       I want to thank Secretary Powell and Deputy Secretary \n     Wolfowitz, Administrator Perry, General Hicks, for their kind \n     words. I'm also pleased to have so many special guests who \n     are here. I don't see--I do see Senator Stevens. I'm so \n     honored that Senator Ted Stevens, who actually worked in the \n     Eisenhower administration, is here. And I want to welcome all \n     the others who worked in this--in the Eisenhower \n     administration to this dedication ceremony. Welcome.\n       I also want to welcome General Andrew Goodpaster, Senator \n     Bob Dole, and all the other veterans of World War II. We're \n     please to have you here. It's a pleasure to welcome back \n     former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. I want to thank \n     members of the United States Congress--Senator Inouye, \n     Congressman Amo Houghton, Jerry Moran, Jim Ryun, Congressman \n     Steven Horn.\n       And I, too, want to say how much we appreciate the work of \n     former Senator John Chafee, who introduced the legislation \n     necessary to rename this bill--this building in honor of \n     Dwight Eisenhower.\n       And above all, we welcome the Eisenhower family, and send \n     our good wishes to John Eisenhower, who could not be with us \n     today. As the son of a President, myself, I know how proud \n     John must feel, knowing that our country's respect for his \n     father has only increased with the years.\n       The city of Washington is accustomed to change. But this \n     neighborhood looks much as it did in 1929. If you'd walked \n     down Pennsylvania Avenue 73 years ago, you would have seen \n     the Renwick Building on the corner of 17th Street, looking \n     just as it does now. A few doors down were the Blair and Lee \n     Houses, with gas lamps still out front.\n       In 1929, Lafayette Square was dominated by a great bronze \n     horse, as it is today, proudly carrying Andrew Jackson. And \n     standing outside this building on a spring morning 73 years \n     ago, you might have seen Dwight Eisenhower pull up in a 1927 \n     Buick and walk up the stairs to his office.\n       The '20s and '30s were quiet times for our Army and Navy, \n     quiet times when he worked here. But it was in this building \n     that Dwight Eisenhower's reputation began to grown. His \n     immediate supervisor said of him this--said this of him: \n     ``This is the best officer in the Army. When the next war \n     comes, he should go right to the top.'' These words carried a \n     lot of weight; after all, the man who said them was Douglas \n     MacArthur.\n       He also worked here for many years in Room 252. There was a \n     time when a visitor to this building might pass in the \n     hallway not only Eisenhower and MacArthur, but the first man \n     commissioned General of the Armies of the United States, John \n     J. Pershing. General Pershing occupied Room 274, a space now \n     used by Vice president Dick Cheney.\n       Two doors down is an office that Theodore Roosevelt would \n     still recognize as his own from his time as Assistant \n     Secretary of the Navy. So would Franklin Roosevelt, who, a \n     generation later, occupied the same office and walked these \n     very same halls. And in between, from 1904 to 1908, William \n     Howard Taft reported to work here as the Secretary of the \n     War. In all, as has been mentioned, seven future Presidents \n     have worked in this building; 25 Presidents have known it.\n       Harry S. Truman held press conferences in an ornate room \n     two stories high, called the Indian Treaty Room--although, no \n     Indian treaty has ever been signed there. And it was Truman, \n     himself, who paid a distinctive tribute to this building when \n     a committee suggested it be torn down. He believed we ought \n     to leave it right here. He said, ``It's the greatest \n     monstrosity in America.''\n       But it was Eisenhower who decided its fate. He said he \n     rather liked it. And over time, a lot of us have come to like \n     it. The architectural grace of this building will remain a \n     matter of opinion, but its place in history and its place on \n     the skyline of Washington is as safe as can be.\n       It seems odd that with all the history it contains, this \n     great building went more than a century without a name \n     befitting its dignity. We've solved that problem today, and \n     we've solved it once and for all. This building now bears the \n     name of Dwight D. Eisenhower, not because it was spared from \n     the wrecking ball in his time; not even because he was the \n     first President born in Texas.\n\n[[Page S4272]]\n\n     (Laughter.) His name fits this building because, as a great \n     soldier, a great President, and a good man, Dwight D. \n     Eisenhower served his country with distinction.\n       People over a certain age will always associate Dwight \n     Eisenhower with a time of strength and a time of stability in \n     America. We think of the '50s, and in the mind's eye we see \n     the President and his fine wife, Mamie. They had lived a \n     military life, moving more than 30 times. And just as GIs in \n     the '50s across America were settling back home, so were the \n     Eisenhowers. As a matter of fact, they would live longer in \n     the White House here than at any other address.\n       We don't need to idolize the era they represented to see \n     all the good things that were there: millions of growing \n     families and industries and new cities, and the beginnings of \n     the life that we know today.\n       Had he never become President, Eisenhower would still be \n     known to all as the leader of the forces that liberated a \n     continent from a terrible evil. The turning point of the war \n     was the decision to invade the coast of France. The decision \n     was made by Roosevelt and Churchill; the day and hour were \n     left to General Eisenhower. And a lot of people felt a lot \n     better knowing that it was his call to make.\n       General Eisenhower understood exactly what risks lay ahead. \n     Had his troops failed to take the beaches, he was going to \n     point a finger straight at himself. Here's what he wrote, in \n     advance: ``If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt, it \n     is mine alone.'' Fifty-seven years ago this very day, General \n     Eisenhower reported that the mission of the Allied Force was \n     fulfilled, and the war in Europe was over.\n       In victory, he was the first to share credit. It was not \n     within his character to do otherwise. As Vice President, \n     Richard Nixon said this about General Eisenhower, President \n     Eisenhower: ``He always retained a saving humility.'' ``It \n     was the humility,'' Nixon said, ``not of fear, but of \n     confidence. He walked with the greats of the world, and he \n     knew that the greats are human. His was the humility of man \n     before God, and before the truth. His was the humility of a \n     man too proud to be arrogant.''\n       In his career, Dwight Eisenhower faced two great crises of \n     the 20th century: a World War that came upon America with a \n     sudden attack, requiring a global response, and a Cold War \n     that tested our patience and resolve to wage a struggle of \n     decades.\n       In our time, we face elements of both: an enemy that \n     strikes suddenly, and must be pursued across the years. And \n     in this struggle, we know how victory will be gained, because \n     President Eisenhower--and General Eisenhower--showed us the \n     way. We will be calm, and confident, and relentless. With the \n     best of America's character, we will defeat America's \n     enemies.\n       We are proceeding with patience and resolve to overcome \n     this growing danger to the civilized world. NATO, the grand \n     alliance first commanded by General Eisenhower, is part of a \n     new coalition that is making steady progress on every front. \n     Our mission in Afghanistan continues even after we have \n     liberated that country from a brutal regime. We continue to \n     fight al Qaeda terrorists, and we will prevent them from \n     regrouping elsewhere.\n       We'll deny terrorists the safe havens they need to operate, \n     and choke off their sources of money and supplies. We'll \n     confront dangerous regimes that seek weapons of mass \n     destruction. In this war, we will depend on the alertness of \n     our law enforcement, the diligence of our intelligence \n     operations, and on the skill and valor of the American Armed \n     Forces.\n       Our military has performed with great daring and courage, \n     and more will be asked of them. I have full confidence, \n     complete confidence, in the men and women who wear our \n     uniform. They've responded in the finest tradition of the \n     American military. Their sense of honor, their devotion to \n     duty, their loyal service to America would all be recognized \n     by the five-star general and President we remember today. The \n     skill and determination and optimism of Dwight Eisenhower are \n     alive in the American Armed Forces, and that spirit will \n     bring us to victory.\n       The General was one of six sons raised by Ida and David \n     Eisenhower in the prairie town of Abilene, Kansas. They \n     raised good men, but destiny chose this one. His whole life \n     shows the power of one man's goodness and integrity to shape \n     great events. He brought permanent honor to his family name, \n     and that name now brings honor to this grand building. It's \n     one more mark of this country's respect, and we offer it \n     today with great affection, and lasting gratitude.\n       God bless.\n\n\n             Remarks by Colin L. Powell, Secretary of State\n\n       Well, thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. Paul, I \n     thank you for that most kind of generous introduction. And I \n     was down at Crawford, Texas, just week before last. The cows \n     still look bad to me. I'm not ready to do it. (Laughter.)\n       Mr. President, Administrator Perry, Mr. Eisenhower, the \n     members of the Eisenhower family, distinguished guests, it's \n     a great pleasure to be here today and join you in celebrating \n     the naming of this wonderful, marvelous old building after \n     one of America's greatest heroes, Dwight David Eisenhower--\n     liberator of Europe, first steward of NATO, builder of peace. \n     Rare in history has there been an individual of higher \n     accomplishment and greater humility.\n       President Eisenhower used to say praise is like perfume; \n     it's fine if you don't swallow it. What he did was never for \n     himself. It was for his country. It was always for us.\n       President Eisenhower has always had a special place in my \n     heart. In June of 1958, he signed the document that \n     commissioned me as a Second Lieutenant of Infantry in the \n     United States Army and started me on my career of service to \n     the nation.\n       Paul made mention of the corridor that exists outside of \n     Secretary Rumsfeld's office which has all these wonderful \n     displays of Eisenhower's life, from the early days through \n     his last days. I'll never forget that last display where he \n     talked about his love of family, love of wife, love of \n     grandchildren and love of country. It always has a special \n     place in my heart because I designed that corridor. I helped \n     build it some 15-odd years ago. But I never go to that \n     corridor and I never walk through this building without \n     having a new sense of service, a renewed inspiration that \n     comes into my heart as a result of my knowledge of Dwight \n     David Eisenhower and his contribution to our nation.\n       More important than all of these things, more important \n     than his signature on my commission or the naming of a \n     building after him, is the example that he gives to us of \n     commitment to duty, of commitment to country. It was his \n     model of devoted service that persuaded me and so many others \n     of my generation in the military to remain in the military \n     after Vietnam, when things were at their darkest. We knew how \n     vitally important it would be for the future security of the \n     nation to rebuild, to transform our armed forces in the early \n     '70s.\n       And Eisenhower labored without fame, without fortune or \n     fanfare, in similar circumstances in an under-supported and \n     under-valued army in the isolationist decades before World \n     War II. He spent a good many of those years working in this \n     very structure, when it was called the State, War and Navy \n     Building. All three departments had been housed here from the \n     1870's. The State Department thrived in this building between \n     1875 and 1947, when we moved to our present location. Twenty-\n     five Secretaries of State had their offices here. We have a \n     historical difference between Mr. Perry and I as to whether \n     there is 24 or 25, but we'll make that count accurate in the \n     next hour or so.\n       Hamilton Fish, Ulysses S. Grant's Secretary of State, was \n     the first. Secretary Fish helped create a professional \n     diplomatic corps. And the last Secretary of State here was \n     the legendary George Catlett Marshall, for whom the plan for \n     Europe's recovery is named. During World War II, he also \n     served in this building as Chief of Staff of the United \n     States Army.\n       General Marshall was so impressed by Eisenhower's skills as \n     a strategist and statesman that he selflessly agreed with \n     President Roosevelt that Eisenhower should lead the Allied \n     invasion of Europe. Fighting Nazi Germany was only a part of \n     General Eisenhower's job as Supreme Commander. Eisenhower was \n     a brilliant forger of alliances. He was a master at using the \n     full range of diplomatic, political and economic tools to win \n     the war, and also to win the peace.\n       He once wrote to his devoted and loving wife Mamie that to \n     run the coalition meant that he had to be a bit of \n     a diplomatic, a lawyer, a salesman, a socialite, and \n     incidentally a soldier. His words rang true for me during \n     the Gulf War, and they are true for all of us who are \n     today involved in sustaining, under President Bush's \n     leadership, the global coalition against terrorism.\n       President Eisenhower's name on this building will inspire \n     all who serve under its massive roof now, and all those who \n     will follow. Despite his well known modesty, I think it would \n     please Dwight Eisenhower that this fine old edifice, which \n     has seen so much history, has been named in his honor.\n       Dwight Eisenhower was a great student of history long \n     before he helped make it, and he passed down his love of \n     history and his commitment to public service to new \n     generations of his family. They have given so much to our \n     country as historians, military officers, diplomats and \n     philanthropists. Indeed, to be an Eisenhower is to have a \n     sense of history and a sense of duty to your country and to \n     our world.\n       It is with great pleasure, then, that I introduce our next \n     guest speaker, a person who would make Eisenhower very \n     proud--not just because of who she is as a granddaughter, but \n     also because of what she contributed to our country and the \n     world. Susan Eisenhower not only has her grandfather's \n     winning smile, but his extraordinary gift of insight, that \n     remarkable ability to see what others do not.\n       She understood more quickly than most just how much the \n     world changed with the end of the Soviet Union and the \n     emergence of Russia and the other Newly Independent States. \n     With her characteristic energy and drive, she has repeatedly \n     pulled together the best experts from around the globe to \n     open our eyes to what is happening in that vast region, and \n     to think about it in fresh, exciting, new ways.\n       And Susan has not been content just to describe change. She \n     has been a force for change. Among her many activities, one \n     that means a great deal to me is to help bring new \n     generations of Russian leaders here on visits so they can \n     learn from us and we can learn from them.\n       The understanding and friendships that come out of these \n     exchanges are laying the enduring foundation for a mutually \n     beneficial US-Russian relationship. Susan is helping build a \n     powerful legacy that Dwight\n\n[[Page S4273]]\n\n     Eisenhower would recognize, appreciate and welcome.\n       So laides and gentleman, it is now my honor and privilege \n     to present to you a friend a person of enormous gifts and \n     endless dedication, Susan Eisenhower.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/13/senate-section/article/S4273-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THE HONORABLE ALVIN BROOKS, KANSAS CITY, MO, MAYOR PRO TEM AND CITY \n                   COUNCILMAN AT-LARGE, 6TH DISTRICT\n\n Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity \nto honor and recognize an outstanding gentleman, Mr. Alvin Brooks, on \nhis 70th birthday. Mr. Brooks, Kansas City, MO, Mayor Pro Tem and 6th \nDistrict at-large City Councilman, is truly extraordinary. His fifty \nyears of tireless commitment to public service in Kansas City, devotion \nto community activism, civic participation, and youth advocacy are an \ninspiration to us all.\n  Mr. Brooks was elected to serve as the 6th District at-large \nCouncilman in 1999. After his election, Mayor Kay Barnes appointed \nBrooks as Mayor Pro Tem. In addition to serving as Mayor Pro Tem, he is \nvice chair of the Legislative, Rules and Ethics Committee, a member of \nthe Finance and Audit Committee, and chair of the Public Facilities and \nSafety Committee.\n  In 1991, Brooks was selected as President of the Ad Hoc Group Against \nCrime, a grassroots community organization he founded in 1977. Former \nPresident George Bush honored Brooks in November 1989 for his work with \nthe Ad Hoc Group Against Crime and named him one of America's 1,000 \nPoints of Light. President Bush also appointed him to a three-year term \non the President's National Drug Advisory Council. Former Drug Czar \nWilliam Bennett recognized Brooks as being one of the nation's ``front-\nline soldiers in our war against drugs.''\n  Prior to serving as President of the Ad Hoc Group Against Crime, \nAlvin Brooks already had a distinguished career in public service. He \nwas a Kansas City, MO police officer for 10 years, where he held the \nrank of detective. During that time, Alvin worked extensively with \nrunaways and gang members, demonstrating his commitment to improving \nsocial conditions for young people, especially inner-city youth. He \nalso served as assistant city manager for seven years and was the first \nAfrican American to serve as a department head for the city of Kansas \nCity, MO.\n  Though it is possible to list Alvin Brooks' professional \naccomplishments, it is impossible to measure the immense impact this \nman has had, and continues to have, in Kansas City. He has touched and \nimproved the lives of countless Kansas Citians. His voice can still be \nheard on the radio urging community action, not as Mayor Pro Tem, but \nas the respected community elder whose commitment to others is \nunquestioned. He is truly the voice of moral authority in Kansas City.\n  I commend Mr. Alvin Brooks for his selfless dedication to the \nimprovement of Kansas City and wish him all the best on his 70th \nBirthday. Kansas City is certainly fortunate to have such a dedicated \npublic servant. On behalf of all those you have served, Alvin, I thank \nyou.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/13/senate-section/article/S4273-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             COMMEMORATING THE CHERRY BLOSSOM TEN MILE RUN\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \nrunning of the Credit Union Cherry Blossom Ten Mile Run on April 7, \n2002. Fifty-eight credit unions, credit union associations, and credit \nunion leagues sponsored this Washington, DC institution, which \ncoincides with the annual spring rites of the tidal basin cherry \nblossoms. This is the first year that Credit Unions have sponsored the \nrace.\n  I want to commend the over 7,032 finishers, and especially the over \n3,500 registered runners who were member of credit unions. A special \ncongratulations to Public Health Service Federal Credit Union for \nwinning the credit union team competition. Additionally, I am proud of \n350 plus credit union employees who arrived at the race in the chilly, \npre-dawn hours to serve as volunteers helping administer the race. It \nwas also great to see Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy \nThompson participate.\n  The Cherry Blossom Run has taken place during the spring blooming of \nWashington's historic cherry trees for 30 years. Starting out as a \nsmall family event with 141 finishers it is now a world-class event \nthat includes some of the world's foremost long distance runners.

Mr. President, I rise today to call the attention of \nmy colleagues in the Senate to an article that appeared in the Wall \nStreet Journal on May 2 which provides an important perspective on the \nchallenging and vital process of developing new medicines. It is no \ncoincidence that the article features Pfizer Inc., a world leader in \npharmaceuticals and a company that made its home in my home State of \nConnecticut. Pfizer's contribution to changing the quality of health \ncare by developing new therapies for conditions such as epilepsy, \ndepression, arthritis, high blood pressure and more has been \ninvaluable. This sort of innovation has increased the quality of care \nwe deliver as well as changed the nature of it, with new medicines \nresulting in fewer trips to hospitals, doctor's offices, and better \noverall care for so many patients.\n  The article details the company's efforts, ultimately unsuccessful, \nto discover, develop and test a new medicine to strengthen muscle, \nthereby helping to prevent injury and possibly osteoporosis in the \nelderly. In the process, Pfizer committed a team of scientists, $71 \nmillion, and 10 years of effort, and this was before the development \nprocess even progressed to advanced clinical trials, underscoring the \ntremendous investment required in developing each new therapy. Despite \nthis infusion of resources and time, the project ultimately failed to \nproduce the desired therapy. But the accounting of this process in an \nexcellent example of the risks, costs and efforts involved in \ninnovation.\n  We must continue to recognize and support these research and \ndevelopment efforts because we know the value they can provide. As we \nwork in this Congress, and we must, to expand coverage and increase \naccess to new medicines, we should strive to craft policy that \ncontinues to encourage the development of innovative products that can \nchange and even save lives while helping to ensure that all our \ncitizens benefit from such innovation.\n  I ask that this article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows.\n\nDrug Prices--Why They Keep Soaring--Bleeding Cash: Pfizer `Youth Pill' \n                                 . . .\n\n\n                 the wall street journal via dow jones\n\n       About a sixth of Pfizer's portfolio of drugs in development \n     were approved by Dr. Clark and his colleagues, including the \n     frailty drugs, which got the green light in December 1995. He \n     was confident the frailty compound would succeed, ranking it \n     among the top third of candidates at the time.\n       But even among the fortunate drugs that pass muster \n     initially with Dr. Clark's committee, the odds remain stacked \n     against their ever making it to market. Dr. Clark's group \n     also guides the researchers, funds interim studies and \n     establishes milestones for judgment. And at any point Dr. \n     Clark's committee can kill the very projects it has approved. \n     Last year, the committee terminated research on five of seven \n     promising medicines it had previously ``canned.''\n       The growth-hormone project quickly surpassed all the \n     researchers' expectations. From the time the project was \n     canned, it took only nine months to develop a drug that was \n     safe enough to test in humans--a speed record for the \n     research center in Groton, Conn., across the river from \n     administrative headquarters in New London. The drug ``had no \n     bumps or warts,'' marveled Gordon Gruetzmacher, project \n     manager for the frailty drug.\n       Though increasingly optimistic, Pfizer scientists and \n     managers were sober about the challenges the potential new \n     medicine faced--especially the elusive nature of the \n     condition it was intended to treat. Frailty, which they came \n     to define as an ``age-related decline in physical \n     performance,'' wasn't a recognized disease, like osteoporosis \n     or Alzheimer's.\n\n[[Page S4274]]\n\n       A drug to treat the chronic condition, like many the \n     industry is now tackling, would require lengthy and \n     especially expensive clinical studies because its effects \n     might be subtle and take months or years to understand. To \n     make sure that an experimental drug deserves such a sizable \n     investment. Pfizer blends marketing with R early on. A \n     marketing specialist works with each drug team to ascertain \n     commercial merit. In particular, will the drug meet a \n     compelling unmet medical need and will Pfizer be able to \n     differentiate its medicines from those of its competitors?\n       For the frailty drug, researchers believed they would have \n     to show that it could do more than boost hormone levels or \n     even muscle growth. Early talks with the Food and Drug \n     Administration confirmed the higher standard. Insurers, too, \n     would need evidence that the frailty drug would be worth \n     their expense.\n       to persuade regulators and insurers to embrace the drug, \n     the Pfizer team aimed to prove beyond a doubt that elderly \n     people who took it could walk faster and longer and avoid the \n     kinds of falls that force many of them into nursing homes.\n       Such a drug also could appeal to a younger, healthier but \n     worried market, people who might use the medicine as a \n     lifestyle enhancer, like Viagra, decades before they faced a \n     real danger of frailty. For Pfizer, a medicine to stave off \n     the ravages of old age, unlike an antibiotic taken for a \n     week, could provide a long-term revenue stream: ``People will \n     take it for 20 or 30 years--it'll be like a vitamin,'' \n     predicted John LaMattina, a senior research executive, early \n     last year.\n       In late 1996, the frailty drug hit its first setback when \n     an otherwise healthy man participating in a small safety \n     study in the Netherlands developed a mysterious, mild rash. \n     The test was halted while the team investigated. The cause \n     was never found, though the leading theory remains that he \n     had a reaction to laundry detergent or hand soap. After a few \n     months, the team concluded that the drug was safe enough to \n     continue.\n       Pfizer recognized the growth-hormone workers as the best \n     research team of 1996 for their trail-blazing \n     accomplishments. And they continued on the fast track, \n     initiating in late 1997 a larger clinical test of the drug, \n     involving 114 people who randomly received one of four \n     different doses or a placebo for a month. At this stage, the \n     researchers sought to substantiate the safety of the drug and \n     to pinpoint the best dose to use in subsequent tests of \n     effectiveness.\n       To their happy surprise, the scientists found that even a \n     one-month regimen with the experimental drug produced \n     measurable growth of muscle. ``it was great,'' Dr. \n     Gruetzmacher recalls, ``We didn't expect an increase in less \n     than six months.''\n       Though encouraging, the results didn't prove the drug was \n     working. The test could have been a fluke. Besides, increases \n     in muscle mass, even if they were real, wouldn't convince \n     regulators to approve the drug, everyone had previously \n     agreed. After lengthy discussion, the team decided to \n     propose a six-month trial of the drug to Dr. Clark and his \n     committee for approval and funding.\n       But the scientists realized that showing that the drug \n     halted or reversed aging would take months or even years. Dr. \n     Clark pushed the research team to reconsider its time frame \n     and ``go for the home run'' by pursuing a longer and much \n     more expensive test that could detect subtle improvements in \n     patients' ability to function.\n       The team took six months to design a trial that would \n     provide a definitive answer on whether the drug worked. They \n     eventually proposed a two-year study in elderly patients that \n     would measure muscle and some biochemical markers in the \n     bloodstream. They also would test the subjects' walking speed \n     and endurance and their ability to get in and out of a chair.\n       Dr. Clark's management committee agreed to fund the study \n     in about 350 patients, much larger than usual for such an \n     early stage. To hedge the outsize bet and ensure that the \n     project was on track, the study included interim analyses at \n     six and 12 months.\n       Last summer, three senior managers unconnected to the \n     project, including a statistician, were chosen to review the \n     data after six months. As outsiders, they were expected to be \n     unbiased, and they would share their findings with only a few \n     senior managers.\n       In less than a week, they had reached their conclusion and \n     called Dr. Clark. He decided to break the secrecy and inform \n     the research team of the news.\n       The patients taking the frailty drug had gained some muscle \n     mass--but less than 3% more than the placebo group, which had \n     also experienced muscle increases. There were no safety \n     problems with the drug. But the study was stopped within a \n     month because the drug appeared ineffective.\n       Nobody is quite sure why. One theory is that the patients \n     selected for the study may have been too healthy, so there \n     was less room for improvement in the treated group. Another \n     idea is that the drug caused the pituitary gland to release \n     growth hormone in a way that was out of tune with the body's \n     system for using it.\n       In the end, Dr. Clark's committee ``took pity on us,'' Dr. \n     Landshulz says, and allowed the team one last chance to \n     salvage the medicine. They were permitted to collect and \n     analyze data on the group of early patients in the study who \n     had taken the drug for a year--just in case its effectiveness \n     emerged later than six months.\n       That was a long shot, everyone agreed, but worth the modest \n     incremental expense. The final analysis was completed this \n     spring, and the results were the same.\n       Later this month, Dr. Clark's committee will review the \n     file one last time and officially lay to rest the frailty \n     drug, which Pfizer says cost the company $71 million to \n     research and develop.\n\n\n                          The Clock Is Ticking\n\n       Half of Pfizer's top-earning drugs face patent-expiration \n     pressure.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   Expiration     2001\n                                                    of basic    revenue,\n                Drug and Purpose                      U.S.         in\n                                                    patents     billions\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLipitor: Cholesterol............................         2010      $6.45\nNorvasc: Blood Pressure.........................         2006       3.58\nZoloft: Depression..............................         2006       2.37\nNeurontin:\\1\\ Epilepsy..........................   1994, 2000       1.75\nViagra: Impotence...............................         2011       1.52\nZithromax: Antibiotic...........................         2005       1.51\nCelebrex:\\2\\ Arthritis..........................         2013   \\3\\ 1.16\nDiflucan: Antifungal............................         2004       1.07\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Pfizer claims a separate patent concerning chemical stability of\n  Neurontin protects drug until 2017\n\\2\\ Pfizer co-promotes Celebrex for Pharmacia Corp.\n\\3\\ Estimate.\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/13/senate-section/article/S4274-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n       APPRECIATION FOR THE SONG, ``WE UNITE,'' BY MS.

The strength and patriotism of Americans \nfollowing the September 11 attacks inspired her to write and record \nthis song. It captures our citizens' love for their country, its \nideals, and its liberties. For me, this song is a reminder of those who \nare working to rebuild the buildings that were destroyed and reverse \nthe economic consequences of that terrible day.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and \nhonor Maurice (Maury) LaRue on the occasion of his retirement as a \nteacher in the Meade County School District in South Dakota.\n  By the end of May, Maury LaRue will have completed 33 years in the \nteaching profession, all at Sturgis High School. Upon graduation with a \nbachelor of science degree in education from the University of North \nDakota, LaRue accepted a position as teacher and debate coach at \nSturgis in 1969.\n  His teaching career has ranged from social studies and literature to \nvocational broadcasting and forensics. There has always been a strong \nemphasis on communication skills for LaRue. For 20 years, he was one of \nSouth Dakota's most respected and successful debate coaches. His \ndebaters won numerous local, state, regional and national forensic \nhonors. And while his students performed well in competition, the true \nmeasure of Maury's ability to build and improve the communication \nskills of his students, came in the number who went on to become \nsuccessful community leaders, business leaders, attorneys, senior \npolitical staff as well as students who were able to think and \ncommunicate in their daily lives as adults, thanks to Maury's dedicated \nteaching style.\n  In addition to his many years as teacher and debate coach, Maury also \ncoached cross-country and track for\n\n[[Page S4275]]\n\nseveral years and is retiring as the director of the social studies \ndepartment at Brown High School in Sturgis. He has served as a city \ncouncil member for the City of Sturgis and has maintained a strong \ninterest in community affairs and city, county and state government. He \nhas performed technical direction for the South Dakota State Junior \nMiss program since 1970, and currently serves as the technical advisor \nfor the Sturgis Community Center Theater. He is a member of the Sturgis \nChamber of Commerce, serving on several committees, and is a member of \nthe Fort Meade Museum Board, the Sturgis Area Arts Council and is very \nactive as an elder, choir member and leader with the Presbyterian \nChurch. For the past dozen years, he has also owned and operated a \nsuccessful photographic studio and gallery in Sturgis and most \nrecently, he has become a volunteer fireman and earned the credentials \nas information officer. If there were any time left in the day, he \nwould find time to fill it and provide counsel to his students or \nprovide service to his community.\n  I have met Maury several times during my visits to Sturgis High \nSchool and the community of Sturgis. He is definitely a mover and \nshaker in the community of Sturgis and is very well-respected by both \ncurrent students and alumni for his skills and abilities as an \ninstructor and for the way he has shaped the lives and futures of those \nhe has tutored over three decades. He is very focused and knowledgeable \nof local, state and federal politics and issues.\n  On the occasion of his retirement as a public school educator, I want \nto congratulate Maurice LaRue for his tireless dedication to his \nstudents, his commitment to finding the best in his students and for \nhelping his students to `communicate' with the world. I also want to \ncommend him for his valuable service to his community over the years. \nInstead of hiding behind a textbook or staying at the chalkboard, \nMaurice LaRue has provided his many students over the years with his \nown example of being active in school and community. He has motivated \nthe lives of many students and many of them would point to Maury as \nplaying a pivotal role in their lives. Can there be any better reward \nfor 33 years of dedicated teaching and community service!\n  I wish Maurice LaRue the best on his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/13/senate-section/article/S4275-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         IN HONOR OF ENTERTAINER AND COMMUNITY LEADER PAT BOONE\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the name Pat Boone rings synonymous \nwith musical success. Pat has registered 60 songs on the musical charts \nwith eighteen reaching the Top Ten and six reaching Number One. His \nrecording career has spanned five decades--from the 1950s to the \n1990s--and compilation albums are reaching a new generation of fans in \nthe 21st century. Indeed, few entertainers can claim a more sustained \ncareer of success than Pat Boone.\n  Pat's success has even extended beyond music. He starred in fifteen \nfilms for 20th Century Fox. He hosted two weekly television variety \nshows--the Pat Boone Chevy Showroom and the Pat Boone Show. He has been \na constant presence on radio both as a musician and as a show host. He \nhas also found time to write several books about teenage life and, more \nrecently, religion and family.\n  Pat donated all proceeds from his first book--Twixt Twelve and \nTwenty--to the Northeastern Institute of Christian Education. This was \na sign of good things to come. Throughout his career, Pat Boone has \ngenerously given his support to countless charitable organizations. \nPerhaps most notably, he has served as spokesman, national chairman, \nand host of the Easter Seal Society Telethon for almost two decades.\n  Though Pat has attained worldwide fame, he has never forgotten his \nTennessee roots. This is especially true for his charity work on behalf \nof Bethel Bible Village. For the last 25 years, Pat has been the \ncelebrity host of the Bethel Bible Village Spectacular Golf Tournament. \nHe has helped raise more than $1.3 billion for Bethel and bring it \nnational recognition as a premier facility for the care of troubled and \nat-risk children.\n  Pat Boone is one of the most successful entertainers of our time; \nhe's also one of the most caring and compassionate community leaders in \nAmerica today. Pat has always put community first--whether it's the \nclose-knit community of his family or the broader community of \ncharitable organizations. I offer this statement to Pat Boone in \nrecognition of a career of success and gratitude for a life of \ngiving.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/13/senate-section/article/S4275-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4275-S4276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RECOGNIZING ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of Asian \nPacific American Heritage Month. In recent years, Americans have \nexperienced an energizing infusion of Asian-based culture, which \nresonates in diverse folkways, cuisine, art forms, and religious \nbeliefs and practices. In all these areas, I believe Minnesota is \nespecially privileged, thanks to Asian American citizens who present a \nunique, vigorous dimension, both established and emerging. Therefore, I \nwould like to highlight the ways that Asian Pacific Americans in \nparticular have enriched our state.\n  We who make Minnesota our home truly comprise an international \ncommunity. The Asian Pacific American presence in my state dates from \nthe late nineteenth century, when Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino \nsettlers first arrived. Today, many more groups, such as the Koreans, \nAsian Indians, Tibetans, Hmong, Vietnamese, and Cambodians, have \naugmented Minnesota's Asian Pacific community. This growth is ongoing, \nand I am pleased to say that in my state, the Asian Pacific American \npopulation increased over 100 percent in the last decade. Furthermore, \nthe City of Saint Paul is distinguished by the largest Hmong population \nin the nation.\n  The Asian Pacific population has significantly contributed to the \neconomic, social, and political fabric of Minnesota. In the Twin Cities \nof Saint Paul and Minneapolis, Asian entrepreneurs have succeeded in \nre-establishing key business districts in areas once dormant, leading \nto the revitalization of entire neighborhoods. These Americans have \nfurther invested in Minnesota through unprecedented rates of home \nownership. In greater Minnesota, Asian Pacific Americans are also being \nwelcomed. For example, Warroad, Minnesota, always a notable breeding \nground for great hockey players, is now also home to a small but \nvibrant Lao population. Moreover, I am very proud to say that Minnesota \nhas elected our nation's first Hmong legislator, State Senator Mee \nMoua.\n  The State Council on Asian-Pacific Minnesotans has chosen five \nindividuals or groups who have made especially worthy contributions, \nand I would like to acknowledge these remarkable award winners.\n  Joseph Hui, who has resided in Minnesota for 30 years, has built a \nsuccessful business career, but, more importantly, he has given back \ngenerously through community service and philanthropy. He was one of \nthe founders of the Asian Pacific Endowment for Community Development, \na fund directed and operated by Asian Americans. The fund encourages \ndifferent Asian Pacific communities to work together in providing \nsocial, health, educational, economic, and cultural services. Thus far, \nthe fund has given approximately $300,000 in grant money to more than \n60 organizations.\n  Rita Mitra Mustaphi, a renowned choreographer, dancer, and educator, \nintroduced the classical Indian dance form, Kathak, to Minnesota. She \nuses this 2000-year-old form of storytelling, essentially dance-poems, \nto explore bold, contemporary themes. She is the founder and Artistic \nDirector of the Kathak Dance Theatre, which is the only professional \ndance theater of its kind in the Midwest. The theater received a grant \nfrom the National Endowment for the Arts to create and perform a new \ndance theater piece.\n  Another artistic innovator, Rick Shiomi, is a leading Asian American \nartist. He is the founder of Mu Daiko, a taiko drumming troop, and the \nArtistic Director of Theater Mu, a group primarily cultivating new \nMinnesota playwrights and Asian American actors. Blending ancient \nartistic forms, traditions, and stories with contemporary ones, these \nperformers are dedicated to the ideal of theater as a total sensory \nexperience. Their unique work reaches new audiences through Theater\n\n[[Page S4276]]\n\nMu's annual festival and outreach performances at schools, corporate \nsites, and community organizations.\n  The radio station KFAI, Fresh Air Radio, serving the Twin Cities \nsince 1973, provides training opportunities in broadcasting to those \nwho might lack the resources for formal training. Many of the station's \nvolunteer programmers have recently arrived in the United States and, \ntherefore, have the opportunity to broadcast in their native languages. \nCultivating listeners not often served by traditional media, KFAI \nincludes in its programming broadcasts which cater to the Indian, \nKhmer, Hmong, Vietnamese, and Filipino communities.\n  Finally, I would like to make special mention of a courageous woman, \nDarina Siv. Until her death in March at the early age of 44, Ms. Siv \nwas dedicated to helping low-income Cambodians, whom she served first \nas a social worker, then as executive director of the United Cambodian \nAssociation of Minnesota. Her book, Never Come Back: A Cambodian \nWoman's Journey, described her personal hardships after the Khmer Rouge \ntook control in her native Cambodia. In America, she became a tireless \nadvocate and was instrumental in securing state legislation that helps \nforeign-born social workers overcome license barriers.\n  During Asian Pacific American month, I am happy to recognize the many \nways--exciting, dynamic, complex, and subtle in which Asian Pacific \nAmericans are making Minnesota a better, stronger, and richer place to \nlive and work. It is important today and throughout the year, to \ncelebrate these contributions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/13/senate-section/article/S4276-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO MR.

I ask to print in the Record an \narticle about him and his family printed in the April 28, 2002, edition \nof the Honolulu Star-Bulletin in Hawaii.\n  The article follows.\n\n                Loving Persistence Pays Off for Otagakis\n\n                          (By Treena Shapiro)\n\n       Members of the Otagaki family say that their patriarch has \n     never let obstacles defeat him.\n       And as his children note, Kenneth Otagaki has faced \n     challenges that would have discouraged a lesser man--from \n     supporting himself while still a child, to wooing a reluctant \n     bride, to learning to cope with a disability after World War \n     II, to raising five children--eventually earning his Ph.D. \n     and becoming a member of Gov. John Burns' cabinet.\n       Even at 84, ``He's full of energy for someone who could \n     have just sat around and said, `I can't do this, I can't do \n     that,''' said his daughter, Joy Miyashiro, 55.\n       Consequently, while growing up, the Otagaki children never \n     wanted for anything, but had a lot to live up to.\n       Ken Otagaki took control of his life at the age of 12, his \n     son Robin Otagaki said.\n       He was the second son of a Big Island field laborer and his \n     picture bride wife. Because Japanese tradition at the time \n     dictated that the first-born son inherit everything, Ken ran \n     away to Honolulu at age 12 and worked as a houseboy, then put \n     himself through college.\n       At the University of Hawaii in 1936, Ken met Janet, his \n     bride-to-be. He was majoring in agriculture, she was majoring \n     in home economics.\n       When Ken first asked Janet on a date, she tried to fix him \n     up with a friend instead. ``And the next time he asked me, I \n     gave him the brush off because I'm not interested in him \n     since I had a boyfriend,'' Janet said.\n       Eventually she consented to a date, ``but I wasn't very \n     much interested.''\n       But Ken was more fun that her boyfriend, and more \n     persistent, she said. ``I tried to brush him off, but he just \n     wouldn't. This is what he said: `If I see a good one, why \n     should I stop? I'm going to keep chasing you,' '' she \n     remembered.\n       After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Ken enlisted and \n     joined the famed 100th Infantry Division. He proposed to \n     Janet before being sent overseas and they decided to wait \n     until he returned to get married.\n       Ken became a litter bearer, once helping an injured Spark \n     Matsunaga down from the mountains.\n       In January 1944, near the hills of Cassino, Italy, Ken and \n     six other litter bearers were called upon to help soldiers in \n     front of them.\n       It was about 10 p.m. and snowing, Ken recalled.\n       ``The Germans saw us coming, I suppose, so they threw a \n     barrage of mortar shells. Unfortunately, one landed about \n     three feet away from where we were, backed up against a big \n     rock,'' he said.\n       Of the eight American soldiers in the group, one escaped \n     injury. Three were killed and four, including Ken, were \n     wounded seriously.\n       It was 20 hours before Ken was evacuated. The battle cost \n     him his right leg, two fingers on his right hand and the \n     sight in his right eye.\n       He wrote to Janet, telling her about his injuries and \n     absolving her of her commitment to marry him, Joy said.\n       However, ``She figured that he wasn't going to sit around \n     and feel sorry for himself,'' Joy said. They were married \n     later that year.\n       Robin said Ken's injuries interfered with his plans to \n     become a medical doctor, then he was told he could not \n     practice veterinary medicine, either. He ended up using his \n     G.I. Bill to attend graduate school in Iowa and California, \n     earning a doctorate in animal science.\n       Joy, who was born in Iowa, said her father's career took \n     the family to Berkely and Davis, Calif., while her mother \n     stayed home and raised five children that all came within one \n     or two years of each other.\n       When Joy was 8, the family moved back to Hawaii, where her \n     father taught at the University of Hawaii and later led the \n     state Department of Agriculture during the Burns \n     administration.\n       Joy said her father was always a good example for the kids.\n       ``Even though he was physically challenged, he taught us \n     how to ride bicycles, he taught us how to swim. If there was \n     ripe mango up on the tree he would go up and get it,'' she \n     said, adding that he kept his tree-climbing a secret from her \n     mother.\n       ``My mom really never worked, she did some substitute \n     teaching, but she never really had to go out (and work),'' \n     Miyashiro said. ``She always had Sunday dinners cooked for \n     us, she sewed, she entertained, she was den mother, brownie \n     leader.''\n       She was also the family peacekeeper, according to Robin.\n       ``My mother always had to be the one who was the mediator. \n     She had to buffer the father from the children and the \n     children from the father,'' he said.\n       His father had high expectations of his children, \n     particularly in school, he said.\n       But Robin, who now teaches secondary science at Punahou, \n     said the children were never academically inclined. In fact, \n     he graduated last in his class from the University Lab \n     School.\n       He and his late brother were the only Otagaki children who \n     finished college.\n       These days, however, Robin, 52, and his wife live in the \n     Manoa home he was raised in, while Ken and Janet live in a \n     cottage on the same property and they all get on \n     ``tremendously,'' Robin said, describing how he and his \n     father putter around the garden together.\n       ``Little by little we meet in the middle,'' he said. ``He \n     has seen what I have become, and I realize where he has come \n     from.''\n       Both Joy and Robin noted how their father dotes on his \n     eight grandchildren.\n       Ken said the key to raising his family has been respect: \n     ``Like any family, all-in-all, it requires a lot of \n     understanding, a lot of give and take.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/13/senate-section/article/S4276-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/13/senate-section/article/S4276-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/13/senate-section/article/S4276-4", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4276-S4277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          enrolled bill signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 3, 2001, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on May 10, 2002, during the recess of the \nSenate, received a message from the House of Representatives announcing \nthat the Speaker has signed the following bill:\n\n       H.R. 2646.

A bill to preserve the effectiveness of medically important \nantibiotics by restricting their use as additives to animal feed; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I join my \ndistinguished colleagues, Senator Jack Reed and Senator Jeff Bingaman, \nin introducing ``The Preservation of Antibiotics for Human Treatment \nAct of 2002.'' This important legislation will protect the health of \nmillions of Americans by preserving the effectiveness of antibiotics.\n  We rely on antibiotics to protect our health from deadly infections \nand to help safeguard the nation's security from the threat of \nbioterrorism. Yet we are squandering the effectiveness of these \nprecious medications by using them indiscriminately as additives to \nanimal feed.\n  Study after study has shown that the practice of using antibiotics to \npromote growth and fatten livestock erodes the effectiveness of these \nimportant pharmaceuticals. Mounting scientific evidence shows that this \nnontherapeutic use of antibiotics in agricultural animals can lead to \ndevelopment of antibiotic-resistant bacteria that can be transferred to \npeople, making it harder to treat dangerous infections.\n  In July 1998, the National Academy of Sciences, in a report prepared \nat the request of the United States Department of Agriculture and the \nFood and Drug Administration, concluded ``there is a link between the \nuse of antibiotics in food animals, the development of bacterial \nresistance to these drugs, and human disease.'' In 1997 and again in \n2000, the World Health Organization recommended that antibiotics used \nto treat humans should not also be used to promote animal growth, \nalthough such antibiotics could still be used to treat sick animals.\n  In January 2001, a Federal interagency task force on antibiotic \nresistance concluded that ``drug-resistant pathogens are a growing \nmenace to all people, regardless of age, gender, or socio-economic \nbackground. If we do not act to address the problem . . . [d]rug \nchoices for the treatment of common infections will become increasingly \nlimited and expensive--and, in some cases, nonexistent.''\n  Major medical associations have taken a stand against antibiotic use \nin animal agriculture. In June 2001, the American Medical Association \nadopted a resolution opposing nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in \nanimal agriculture. Medical professional organizations that have taken \na similar position include the American College of Preventive Medicine, \nthe American Public Health Association, and the Council of State and \nTerritorial Epidemiologists. I ask for unanimous consent to include a \nletter of endorsement for our legislation from the American Public \nHealth Association in the Record.\n  Most developed countries in the world, with the exception of the \nUnited States and Canada, restrict the use of antibiotics for growth \npromotion in raising livestock. In July 1999, the European Union banned \nthe use for animal growth promotion of remaining human-use antibiotics \nstill in use to promote animal growth. Prior to that action, individual \nEuropean countries, including the United Kingdom, Denmark, Finland, and \nSweden, had banned the use in animal feed of specific antibiotics.\n  The Preservation of Antibiotics for Human Treatment Act of 2002 will \nprotect the health of Americans by phasing out the non-therapeutic use \nin livestock of medically important antibiotics, unless their \nmanufacturers can show that they pose no danger to the public health. \nThe Act requires this same tough standard of new applications for \napproval of animal antibiotics. The Act does not restrict use of \nantibiotics to treat sick animals or to treat pets and other animals \nnot used for food.\n  In October 2000, FDA found that one class of antibiotics posed such a \ngrave danger to the public health that they issued an order to withdraw \nthese drugs from animal use. Yet, over 18 months later, tons of these \ndrugs are still being used, because their manufacturer has refused to \ncomply with FDA's order. The Act takes immediate action to implement \nthe decision of FDA to withdraw these drugs from our food supply.\n  The National Academy of Sciences has found that eliminating the use \nof antibiotics as feed additives would cost each American consumer not \nmore than $5 to $10 per year. Nonetheless, the legislation recognizes \nthat there may be economic costs to farmers in making the transition to \nantibiotics-free farming practices. For this reason, the Act provides \nfor Federal payments to farmers to defray their costs in switching to \nantibiotic-free husbandry practices, with a preference given to family \nfarms.\n  Antibiotics are one of the crown jewels of modern medicine. If we \nsquander their effectiveness, the health of millions of Americans will \nbe put at risk. The most vulnerable among us, children, the elderly, \npersons with HIV/AIDS, are particularly endangered by resistant \ninfections. I urge my colleagues to support this needed legislation to \nprotect the health of all Americans and preserve the effectiveness of \nantibiotics.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support and an analysis of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   American Public\n\n\n                                           Health Association,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 1, 2002.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \n         Pensions, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mister Chairman: On behalf of the 50,000 members of \n     the American Public Health Association, I am writing to \n     express our strongest support for the Preservation of \n     Antibiotics for Human Treatment Act of 2002. The Act proposes \n     to withdraw certain antibiotics used in healthy food animals \n     to enhance their growth, as well as a class of antibiotics \n     related to the anthrax drug Cipro and used in poultry. These \n     withdrawals will help prevent transmission of antibiotic \n     resistant bacteria in food.\n       It is common to add antibiotics to the feed of cattle, \n     pigs, and poultry to speed their growth. But it also speeds \n     the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria on farms, \n     that can then contaminate the meat and cause food-borne \n     illnesses for which treatment options are then limited. The \n     evidence of harm to public health resulting from this \n     practice has only gown. It is time for Congress to make the \n     health of consumers a priority and put an end to this \n     practice.\n       According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, there are 1.4 million cases of Salmonella \n     infection in the U.S. each year. Most of these infections are \n     acquired from food, and many of them are resistant to five or \n     more antibiotics. The Salmonella found in commercial meat and \n     poultry products has already become resistant to a number of \n     the most commonly used antibiotics. Your bill would phase out \n     each of these drugs as a feed additive for healthy animals.\n       The bill also calls for withdrawal of a precious class of \n     antibiotics now used to treat pneumonia in poultry. Since the \n     approval of the fluoroquinolone antibiotics in 1995, \n     Campylobacter, the most common food-borne infection, has \n     developed resistance, and FDA has called for the drug's \n     withdrawal in poultry. APHA has gone on record supporting the \n     FDA's action.\n       We are pleased to support this important piece of \n     legislation, and will work with you to see that it is passed. \n     Please contact Natalie Raynor for further information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Mohammad N. Akhter,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n    The Preservation of Antibiotics for Human Treatment Act of 2002\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       The widespread use of antibiotics beginning in the 1940's \n     provided, for the first time in history, effective treatments \n     for infectious diseases. These miracle drugs have saved \n     countless lives, but they are losing their effectiveness. \n     Antibiotics that once had the power to cure dangerous \n     infections are now often useless, because microbes have \n     become resistant to all but the newest and most expensive \n     drugs, and some ``superbugs'' are impervious to any weapons \n     in the medical arsenal. Resistance to antibiotics takes a \n     heavy toll on patients across the Nation.\n\n[[Page S4284]]\n\n     The World Health Organization estimates that 14,000 Americans \n     die every year from drug-resistant infections. This means \n     that one American dies from a resistant infection every 38 \n     minutes.\n       It seems scarcely believable that these precious \n     medications could be fed by the ton to chickens and pigs, but \n     that's exactly what's happening in farms all over America. \n     Over 20 million pounds of antibiotics are fed to farm animals \n     every year. That's more than is used in all of medicine. \n     These precious drugs aren't even used to treat sick animals. \n     They are used to fatten pigs and speed the growth of \n     chickens. The result of this rampant overuse is clear: meat \n     contaminated with drug-resistant bacteria sits on supermarket \n     shelves all over America. Every family is potentially at \n     risk. The most vulnerable among us, children, the elderly, \n     persons with HIV/AIDS, are particularly endangered by \n     resistant infections.\n       At a time when the Nation is relying on antibiotics and \n     other medications to protect our homeland's security from the \n     grave threat of bioterrorism, we can no longer squander these \n     precious weapons in the fight against disease by feeding them \n     indiscriminately to livestock.\n\n\n                     Provisions of the Legislation\n\n       The Preservation of Antibiotics for Human Treatment Act of \n     2002 will protect the health of Americans by phasing out the \n     non-therapeutic use in livestock of medically important \n     antibiotics, unless their manufacturers can show that they \n     pose no danger to the public health. The Act requires this \n     same tough standard of new applications for approval of \n     animal antibiotics.\n       The Act does not restrict use of antibiotics to treat sick \n     animals or to treat pets and other animals not used for food.\n       In October 2000, FDA found that one class of antibiotics \n     posed such a grave danger to the public health that they \n     issued an order to withdraw these drugs from animal use. Yet, \n     over 18 months later, tons of these drugs are still being \n     used, because their manufacturer has refused to comply with \n     FDA's order. The Act takes immediate action to implement the \n     decision of FDA to withdraw these drugs from our food supply.\n       The Act provides for Federal payments to farmers to defray \n     their costs in switching to antibiotic-free husbandry \n     practices, with a preference given to family farms.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, Senator \nKennedy of Massachusetts and Senator Bingaman of New Mexico, in \nintroducing this timely and important legislation. The Preservation of \nAntibiotics for Human Treatment Act of 2002 will address a critical \npublic health concern facing our nation.\n  There has been mounting scientific evidence that the overuse in \nanimal husbandry of certain antibiotics is increasing the resistance to \nthose antibiotics of bacteria that cause human disease. In farming, the \ndrugs are often added to the feed of healthy animals to promote growth \nand productivity.\n  In 1997 and again in 2000, the World Health Organization recommended \nthat antibiotics used to treat humans should not be used to promote \nanimal growth, though the drugs could still be used to treat sick \nanimals. Most developed countries, other than the United States and \nCanada, restrict the use of antimicrobials in growth promotion.\n  In July 1998, the National Academy of Sciences concluded in a report \nthat there is a link among the use of antibiotics in food animals, the \ndevelopment of bacterial resistance to these drugs and human disease.\n  Our legislation will require that an animal drug in the \nfluoroquinolone class of antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin, and an \nother critical drug, such as penicillin and tetracycline, will be \nconsidered unsafe as an additive in animal feed unless the drug's \nmanufacturer can demonstrate that use in animal feed of the drug does \nnot pose a harm to human health. In addition, the legislation will \nrequire that the Food and Drug Administration refuse to approve a \nveterinary drug application for any antimicrobial drug critical to \nhuman health care. For drugs that are currently added to animal feed, \nthe legislation will require that the drug's use be phased out over the \nnext two years.\n  It should be noted that three large commercial poultry producers have \nrecently volunteered to significantly reduce or stop the use of \nantibiotics in their healthy chickens. In addition, the New York Times \nreported in February that the industry is stopping the use of a \nparticular drug that is related to Cipro, which is used to treat \nanthrax in humans. The Times reported as well that some corporate \nconsumers including McDonalds, Wendy's and Popeye's are refusing to buy \nchicken treated with that drug.\n  Some will be concerned that our legislation may impose a heavy burden \non family farmers. As a means to reduce any burden, the legislation \nwill also authorize payment to producers of livestock or poultry that \nsubstantially reduce there nontherapeutic use of antimicrobials in \nanimal feed. Family-owned and family-operated farms or ranches will get \npriority in the awarding of these payments. And while we understand the \nconcerns of those farmers, we anticipate that the legislation will be a \nsignificant step in helping the public health system maintain an \neffective arsenal against serious diseases, including anthrax, sepsis, \nstrep and salmonella, many of which result in serious illness or death \nin both children and adults.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Lott, Mr. \n        Stevens, Mr. Inouye, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Craig, \n        Ms. Collins, Mr. Shelby, and Mr. Smith of New Hampshire):\n  S. 2509. A bill to amend the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act \nof 1990 to specify additional selection criteria for the 2005 round of \ndefense base closures and realignments, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee of Armed Services.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation that \naddresses an issue of great concern to our Nation's current and future \nsecurity as well as to hundreds of communities across our country.\n  We have endeavored to reduce the excess infrastructure of our armed \nforces four times in the past 15 years through the appointment of a \nBRAC commission whose charter was to recommended the elimination or \nrealignment of unneeded bases. Four times these commissions have made \nrecommendations to the President resulting in the closure of 106 major \nbases. I would like to agree that in each instance, the best decision \nwas made and the military is now better off without these facilities; \nhowever, this is not the case. Mistakes have been made.\n  While most of these selections were proper, some have resulted in \nsignificant, unintended consequences. Staggering costs to clean up the \nenvironmental liabilities left behind is one such example. At the \nformer Navy Station Long Beach, CA, post-closure clean up costs have \nconsumed hundreds of millions of dollars more than had been \nanticipated. The final cost of closing that base remains unknown. How \ncan the savings of closing this base be cited when even seven years \nlater the costs continue to grow?\n  The lack of facilities now available to properly train our remaining \nforces is another. When justifying the closure of Reese Air Force Base \nin 1995, the commission's report stated that ``the Air Force has a \nsurplus of undergraduate pilot training facilities.'' However, only \nfive years later, this service had a shortage of over 1,200 pilots. To \nmake up for that shortfall, the Air Force was compelled to hastily \nestablish another training base, at tremendous cost to the taxpayer.\n  The severe economic impact that small, rural communities have endured \nis yet another unintended consequence. The '95 commission's decision to \nconvey Fort Chafee to the local community was scandalous. How was a \nsmall, rural community like Barling, AR supposed to turn a post like \nChaffee, pockmarked with over 700 World War II-era buildings, each \ncontaminated with lead paint and Asbestos, into an economic asset to \nthe community? They couldn't. While the closure of Chaffee may have \nsaved the Pentagon money, it saddled a small town with an expensive, \nenvironmentally hazardous burden.\n  I am convinced the root cause of these regrettable selections was \nvague and inefficient criteria which the commissions used in their \nefforts to select candidates for closure or realignment. To ensure we \ndo not repeat these mistakes, I have worked closely with a number of my \ncolleagues, particularly Senator Bingaman, to develop legislation that \nwould refine the minimum criteria the commission must consider. Among \nthe new criteria are: the impact on homeland security; the effects on \nco-located Federal agencies; and lessons learned in the previous rounds \nof closures. This measure also promotes greater transparency by \nrequiring the weighting of these criteria be published well before a \ncommission recommends any base for closure.\n\n[[Page S4285]]\n\n  I know the outcome of the 2005 BRAC is of utmost importance to both \nthe military and the communities outside the fence. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill to ensure that the proper decisions are \nmade, and that they are made for the proper reasons.\n  I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2509\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a concurrent \nresolution honoring flight attendants for the courage, dedication, and \nheroism they display on a daily basis as the first line of defense \nagainst trouble and terror in our skies.\n  From the events of September 11, we have all taken great pride in the \nheroism and courage displayed by rescue workers, firemen, and first \nresponders. These were the men and women running into the burning and \ncollapsing buildings to help those who were running out get to safety. \nWho knows what the death toll would have been that dreadful day without \nthe help of these brave heroes.\n  Since September 11, the United States has rallied behind the courage \nand dedication of our troops abroad who are rooting out terrorism. \nAmerican soldiers are protecting the United States from future \nterrorist attacks and as we all know, lives have been lost.\n  I cannot say enough about what the policemen, firemen, rescue \nworkers, and the men and women of our armed services have done to \nprotect all of us.\n  However, one group of American heroes that I also want to make sure \nreceive their proper recognition are the approximately 100,000 men and \nwomen who serve as flight attendants in the United States today.\n  Flight attendants dedicate themselves to serving and protecting their \npassengers.\n  Flight attendants react to dangerous situations on airplanes as the \nfirst line of defense of airline passengers and the pilots in the \ncockpit.\n  Flight attendants evacuate passengers from the airplane in emergency \nsituations.\n  Flight attendants have defended passengers against hijackers, \nterrorists, and abusive passengers.\n  Flight attendants handle in-flight medical emergencies.\n  And as we all know, many flight attendants lost their lives on \nSeptember 11 as they fought with terrorists.\n  Clearly flight attendants do more than serve food and drinks on the \nplane.\n  They are the police, the fire department, the paramedics, and the \nbomb squad at 30,000 feet above ground. Just one of these \nresponsibilities would overwhelm most people. Yet, flight attendants \nmanage to balance these roles day in and day out.\n  Flight attendants have enormous responsibilities and they face \ntremendous dangers in flight.\n  To honor the dedication, courage, and commitment flight attendants \nmade everyday, I am offering this resolution to: 1. Express the \ngratitude of Congress for the faithful service provided by flight \nattendants to make air travel safe; 2. Honor the courage and dedication \nof flight attendants; 3. Support flight attendants as they continue to \ndisplay heroism on a daily basis; and 4. Send a copy of this resolution \nto a family member of each of the flight attendants killed on September \n11, 2001.\n  In this resolution, we mention three specific instances where flight \nattendants have courageously intervened to save the lives of others.\n  We all know about the heroic passengers and crew of Flight 93 on \nSeptember 11, 2001. The flight from Newark, New Jersey to San Francisco \nwas hijacked that dreadful morning. Yet the terrorists were prevented \nfrom crashing the airplane into its intended target by brave passengers \nand crew. Among the crew that sacrificed their lives were five United \nAirlines flight attendants.\n  A few months later, terrorist Richard Reid tried to blow up American \nAirlines Flight 63. He too was stopped with the help of flight \nattendants as he tried to light explosives in his shoes.\n  Speaking of the flight attendants aboard flight 93, one passenger \nsaid, ``There's no question that all of us on board owe our lives to \nthem. [Reid] was fighting to the death.''\n  And in February of this year, flight attendants and pilots aboard \nUnited Airlines Flight 855 prevented a passenger from breaking into the \ncockpit while the plan was traveling from Miami to Buenos Aires.\n  There are only a few examples of times when flight attendants have \nstepped forward to risk their lives to protect others. And \nunfortunately there will always be a tremendous amount of risk for the \nmen and women who work aboard airplanes every day.\n  I want to point out that this resolution is the result of a letter by \na flight attendant in Sacramento, California who wrote to me. I would \nlike to insert the letter into the Record and read some of it aloud.\n  Heather Lauter-Clay, a United Airlines flight attendant, wrote,\n\n       From the deepest part of my heart, I am asking for your \n     support in carrying a resolution to honor Flight Attendants. \n     It would mean so much to Flight Attendants to be given the \n     respect and support that they so deserve.\n\n  Heather, I completely agree and I am proud to offer this resolution \nto honor our flight attendants.\n  I also want to enter this note into the Record. It was given to me by \nKristin Spivey, a United flight attendant, on my trip home over the \nweekend. I was especially touched by Ms. Spivey's note, which was \nwritten on an airplane cocktail napkin. The note reads:\n\n       ``Senator Feinstein: I am so pleased to have you on our \n     flight today. It has been an honor to serve you--just to meet \n     you. Thank you for sponsoring the bill to acknowledge flight \n     attendants's contributions on September 11th. It was very \n     difficult to lose so many flying partners to something so \n     senseless.\n       In the aftermath it was hard to go on, despite the fact \n     that I love my job and would not give it up, because so few \n     seemed to understand my sense of loss. It is also comforting \n     to believe that all those onboard flight 93 died for a \n     reason--to save many others in Washington.\n       You do then a great honor in remembering that. I know you \n     can help others understand all this. Thank you for speaking \n     for us. I know my fallen colleagues would be proud.\n       Kristin Spivey (D.C. based)\n\n  I think this note from Ms. Spivey makes it clear that this resolution \nis very important and I hope the Congress will pass this legislation \nsoon.\n  To the flight attendants serving today and every day: Thank You.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support for this resolution \nbe printed in the Record. \n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                        Davis, CA.\n       Dear Senator Dianne Feinstein: I am a United Airlines \n     Flight Attendant. On September 11th, our United Family was \n     forever changed. In the weeks and months following the \n     tragedy, we have been mourning the loss of our colleagues and \n     loss of ourselves. Our world as we knew it has been forever \n     changed.\n       On that fateful day, the grief was immense for us. We lost \n     16 or our crewmembers in one hour, on one day. We were \n     stricken with feelings of sadness, fear, confusion and panic. \n     Many of us were stranded, away from home. As the unknown \n     lingered, we still held onto the thoughts of what our \n     colleagues faced in their last moments. Meanwhile, knowing \n     that we too would soon be boarding an airplane.\n       As a flight attendant, we have taken an oath ``to provide \n     comfort, care and safety'' to our passengers. On September \n     1th, our flight attendants were doing their job. All of the \n     previous protocols that were in place for hijacking \n     situations failed them. They died protecting their passengers \n     in the best way that they knew how. As we know, in the last \n     moments of flight, they were unselfishly caring for others. \n     Flight Attendants assisted in bringing down UAL 93 by boiling \n     water to throw on the hijackers and others were on the phones \n     to supervisors detailing what was transpiring on the planes.\n       As we approach 4 months since Sept. 11th, our flight \n     attendants are still continuing to be faced with sadness, \n     grief, and mourning. The skies as we now know them, are a \n     host to uncertainty. Possible terrorist threats are \n     continually present. Airline safety is still compromised. \n     United has layed off thousands of flight attendants and job \n     security is wavering.\n       Over these past months, firefighters, policemen, postal \n     workers and others have\n\n[[Page S4287]]\n\n     been honored for their heroism and dedication to Sept 11th. \n     Flight Attendants have not and this hurts us. We too, go to \n     work each day, to serve and protect, knowing that we may not \n     come home to our loved ones. We too know the importance of \n     carrying on with our job, despite what we may encounter, even \n     the possibility of death. Our commitment, bravery and \n     dedication to the public have never ceased during and after \n     the events of September 11th. Our crews of UAL 93 and UAL 175 \n     died unsung heroes.\n       From the deepest part of my heart, I am asking for your \n     support in carrying a resolution to honor Flight Attendants. \n     It would mean so much to Flight Attendants to be given the \n     respect and support that they so deserve. The crews of UAL \n     93, UAL 175, AA 11, and AA 77 died unsung heroes. The \n     countless Flight Attendants who have been flying since Sept. \n     11th continually display valor, gallantry, courage, and \n     bravery in the midst of a world that is forever changed.\n       Senator Feinstein, thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Heather Lauter-Clay.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator Feinstein: I am so pleased to have you on our \n     flight today. It has been an honor to serve you--just to meet \n     you. Thank you for sponsoring the bill to acknowledge flight \n     attendants' contributions on September 11th.

On September 11, \n     2001, Flight Attendants were the first to sacrifice their \n     lives for the safety of the aircraft and passengers. Since \n     September 11, 2001, Flight Attendants have been first in \n     enabling airplanes and passengers to the skies. For many \n     Flight Attendants, their only reward since September 11, 2001 \n     has been a ``pink slip'' as they were also among the first to \n     lose their jobs in cutbacks related to the ``Attack on \n     America''.\n       Thank you for your leadership and for sponsoring a \n     resolution which will bring well-deserved recognition to the \n     over 100,000 Flight Attendants in America who make me proud \n     to wear my wings.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                    Thom McDaniel,\n                                          TWU Local 556 President.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Feinstein \nand 50 of my colleagues to submit a resolution to honor the service and \nprofessionalism of the men and women in the United States who serve as \nflight attendants.\n  A career as a flight attendant requires a deep commitment. Their \nschedules are unpredictable, their work hours are long and intense, and \nthe nature of the job causes long absences from the company of family \nand friends. Not too many years ago, a flight attendant, or \n``stewardess'', could be fired for getting married or becoming \npregnant. Happily, those dark ages are over, thanks to the sacrifices \nmade by generations of flight attendants who have served all of us.\n  Today's flight attendants are dedicated men and women who are charged \nwith many important responsibilities. Of course, they serve food and \nbeverages to passengers under cramped and difficult conditions. They \nalso assist children traveling alone, as well as elderly and disabled \npassengers. When requires, they administer first aid, including CPR and \nartificial respiration. Most of all, they are responsible for the \nsafety and security of the passengers from the time the aircraft pulls \naway from the gate, and they are on duty until the plane arrives at its \ndestination.\n  On September 11, terrorism struck the United States as hijacked \naircraft were used as massive weapons of destruction. Despite being \ntrained merely to comply with the hijackers' demands and to calm the \npassengers, many went above and beyond these limitations and displayed \ngreat courage. Using cell phones to relay information to ground crews, \ncrews aboard American Airlines Flights 11 and 77 and United Airlines \nFlights 93 and 175 assisted law enforcement officials in identifying \nthe hijackers and assessing the nature of the threats. Despite the \nultimate loss of their lives, the crews of these flights took heroic \nsteps trying to thwart the terrorists' intentions and prevented further \ndestruction. It is humbling to realize that many of our lives, as well \nas our beloved Capitol building, may have been saved by the sacrifices \nof the crew of flight 93.\n  On October 1, another potentially disastrous event was averted on \nAmerican Airlines Flight 1238 traveling from Los Angeles to Chicago, \nwhen a passenger attempted to break through the cockpit door to attack \nthe flight crew. The cabin crew helped stop the attempt and ingeniously \nplaced serving carts to secure the cockpit.\n  On December 28, 2001, quick thinking flight attendants made the \ndifference on American Airlines Flight 63 en route from Paris to Miami, \nwhen Richard Reid, an accused al Qaeda-trained terrorist, attempted to \nlight a powerful explosive concealed in his shoes. An alert flight \nattendant led the rest of the cabin crew in a successful struggle to \nprevent a devastating explosion.

These success \n     rates are dramatically higher than the success rates for \n     companies in the general economy.\n       (4) Incubator companies are also more likely to remain in \n     the same communities as they grow and to provide high paying \n     jobs and benefits to their employees.\n       (5) Business incubators help academic institutions \n     contribute to local goals of sustaining economic development \n     in their surrounding communities.\n       (6) Education in entrepreneurship and other business \n     formation skills is essential to business success and \n     sustainable economic development.\n       (7) Studies have shown that every 50 jobs created by a \n     business in an incubator generate another 25 jobs in that \n     incubator's community.\n       (8) Business incubators are of particular value in \n     communities that have seen significant job displacement due \n     to overwhelming competition from exports.\n\n     SEC. __02.
