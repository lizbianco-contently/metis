(By 40 yeas to 59 nays (Vote \n     No. 60), Senate earlier failed to table the amendment.)\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the\n\n[[Page S2426]]\n\ntime until 9:45 a.m. shall be equally divided and controlled in the \nusual form.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes from the time on \nthis side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the majority leader and the distinguished \nmajority whip have often mentioned the fact that we have not called up \nthe ANWR amendment yet. I am here to say we are almost ready to do \nthat. The reason we have not brought it forth so far, of course, is the \nstated objective of Members of the other side of the aisle to \nfilibuster this amendment and to require us to have 60 votes in order \nfor its adoption. We will lay it down right now if the leadership will \nagree we can have an up-or-down vote on the amendment.\n  This is not a normal procedure where the leader states categorically \nthat there is an intention of the majority to require 60 votes for an \namendment to pass.\n  I intend later today to distribute to every desk a copy of a letter \nof July 3, 1980 that was signed by Senator Henry M. Jackson, chairman \nof the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee, and Mark Hatfield, \nranking minority member, concerning the Alaska lands bill that was \nbefore the Senate at that time.\n  These two Senators were leaders of the Senate on the Alaska lands \nlegislation and it is important for the Senate to read this letter. I \nwill read a portion of it at this time. The portion I will read \nconcerns the amendment which gives us the right to proceed with \ndevelopment of the Arctic plain. They wrote:\n\n       While the bill is a gigantic environmental accomplishment, \n     it also is crucial to the nation's attempt to achieve energy \n     independence. One-third of our known petroleum reserves are \n     in Alaska, along with an even greater proportion of our \n     potential reserves. Actions such as preventing even the \n     exploration of Arctic Wildlife Range, a ban sought by one \n     amendment, is an ostrich-like approach that ill-serves our \n     nation in its time of energy crisis.\n  They went on to write:\n\n       Instability of certain nations abroad repeatedly emphasizes \n     our need for stronger domestic supply of strategic and \n     critical minerals. Each of the five proposed amendments would \n     either restrict mineral areas from development or block \n     access to those areas. Four of the seven world-class mineral \n     finds in Alaska would be effectively barred from development \n     by this amendments. That is simply too high a price for this \n     nation to pay.\n\n  Further from the letter:\n\n       We urge you to focus on the central fact that the Alaska \n     lands bill is not just an environmental issue. It is an \n     energy issue. It is a national defense issue. It is an \n     economic issue. It is not an easy vote for one constituency \n     that affects only a remote, far-away area. It is a compelling \n     national issue which demands the balanced solution crafted to \n     by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.\n\n  Seven years earlier my colleague, Senator Gravel, and I presented an \namendment to authorize the immediate construction of the Alaska \npipeline. That amendment first ended up in a vote of 49-48. We had won \nthat amendment. On a reconsideration, the vote was 49-49, and the then \nVice President cast a ``yea'' vote, and the amendment was finally \nagreed to on the second vote.\n  I yield myself 2 more minutes.\n  My point in raising this before the Senate this morning is that on \nthe Alaska pipeline there was no threat of a filibuster. Despite the \nfact that the then majority leader, Senator Mansfield, and the chairman \nof the committee, Senator Jackson, opposed our amendment for the \nimmediate construction of the pipeline, there was no filibuster.\n  We should not have a filibuster on the amendment that is going to be \noffered by my colleague Senator Murkowski and myself on this bill to \nproceed now to the exploration and development of the 1.5 million acres \non the Arctic plain. It is still a national defense issue. I hope to \nraise that again and again. In times of national security crisis, there \nshould not be a filibuster against a proposal to make available to this \nNation additional oil and gas resources.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter I cited of July 3, 1980 and \nthe Congressional Record showing the affairs of the Senate on July 17, \n1973 on those two votes, 295 and 296, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                    Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 3, 1980.\n       Dear Colleague: In this year of sharply heightened national \n     concern over the economy, energy and national defense, the \n     Senate is about to consider Alaska lands legislation--an \n     issue which would have a profound effect on each of these \n     vital subjects.\n       We write to ask for your full support of the Alaska lands \n     bill approved by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. \n     After extensive hearings, study and mark-up, the Committee \n     approved this bill by an overwhelming and bi-partisan vote of \n     17-1.\n       The Committee bill is a balanced, carefully crafted measure \n     which is both a landmark environmental achievement and a \n     means of protecting the national interest in the future \n     development of Alaska and its vital resources. The bill more \n     than doubles the land area designated by Congress as part of \n     the National Park and National Wildlife Refuge systems; it \n     triples the size of the National Wilderness Preservation \n     system. It protects the so-called Crown Jewels of Alaska. At \n     the same time, it preserves the capability of that mammoth \n     state to contribute far beyond its share to our national \n     energy and defense needs.\n       A series of five major amendments to the bill and an entire \n     substitute for it will be offered on the Senate floor. The \n     amendments in total would make the bill virtually an \n     equivalent of the measure approved last year by the House. \n     Each amendment in its own way would destroy the balance of \n     the bill.\n       While the bill is a gigantic environmental accomplishment, \n     it also is crucial to the nation's attempt to achieve energy \n     independence. One-third of our known petroleum reserves are \n     in Alaska, along with an even greater proportion of our \n     potential reserves. Actions such as preventing even the \n     exploration of the Arctic Wildlife Range, a ban sought by one \n     amendment, is an ostrich-like approach that ill-serves our \n     nation in this time of energy crisis.\n       Instability of certain nations abroad repeatedly emphasizes \n     our need for a stronger domestic supply of strategic and \n     critical minerals. Each of the five proposed amendments would \n     either restrict mineral areas from development or block \n     effective access to those areas. Four of the seven world-\n     class mineral finds in Alaska would be effectively barred \n     from development by the amendments. That simply is too high a \n     price for this nation to pay.\n       Present and potential employment both in Alaska and in the \n     other states would be significantly damaged if the committee \n     bill is amended. Cutting off development of the four mineral \n     finds discussed above would alone cost thousands of potential \n     jobs, many of them in the Lower 48 states. The amendment on \n     national forests would eliminate up to 2,000 jobs in the \n     southeast Alaska timber-related economy.\n       We urge you to focus on the central fact that the Alaska \n     lands bill is not just an environmental issue. It is an \n     energy issue. It is a national defense issue. It is an \n     economic issue. It is not an easy vote for one constituency \n     that affects only a remote, far-away area. It is a compelling \n     national issue which demands the balanced solution crafted by \n     the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.\n       We look forward to your support.\n           Cordially,\n                                                 Mark O.

Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, there is not a Senator \nin the Senate I have more respect for than the senior Senator from \nAlaska. I consider him a friend and certainly always a worthy advocate. \nOn this issue relating to the energy bill now before the Senate, \nhowever, to have my friend and his colleague, the junior Senator from \nAlaska, say that they are interested in going forward, that they would \nhave had a vote on this immediately if, in fact, we didn't use the \nrules of the Senate, of course, the rules of the Senate are what have \nguided this institution for so many years. I really don't know how many \nvotes there are. Each side has around 50 votes. That is the way this \nwill turn out, if there is a vote on the ANWR issue.\n  Regarding his logic that there should be, in a time of national \ncrisis, nothing done to prevent the Congress from thwarting anything \nthat would bring us more oil, the way to do that would have been to \nsupport the CAFE standards legislation we debated on this legislation. \nThat would have brought certainly millions of barrels of new supply to \nthis country by not having us use this oil.\n  As we have discussed many times, the United States cannot produce its \nway out of the crisis we are in. We should do everything we can to \nincrease the natural gas and other drilling oil supplies. There is no \nquestion about that. But there is a real debate taking place in this \ncountry as to whether or not we should drill in the Alaskan wilderness. \nAlthough I am from Nevada a State that is very sparsely populated, I \nthink the Senator from Alaska raised some interesting points about \ncertain promises that were made to the Senator from Alaska and the \nAlaskan delegation many years ago. It is something we all need to take \na look at.\n\n  But we have a debate that has been ongoing for many years. This isn't \nsomething that just came up during this bill. I look forward to the \ndebate on ANWR. I think there are people who honestly have not made up \ntheir minds yet. It is a handful of people, but some have not made up \ntheir minds yet. So I hope that the Alaskan delegation will offer this \namendment as quickly as possible. I think that is the main thing \nholding up the final movement of this legislation.\n  I spoke to the junior Senator from Alaska yesterday, and I don't \nthink it would be appropriate for someone else to offer the ANWR \namendment--for example, a House version, or some other comparable \nversion. I think it should be done by the Senators from Alaska or \nSenators with whom they want to join.\n  So I hope that in the next little bit--whether it is tonight or \ntomorrow, but in the immediate future--this amendment will be offered. \nOtherwise, it is my understanding that others who may not be advocates \nfor ANWR will offer it just to move the debate along.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that the vote will occur at \n9:45. That will be on the Feinstein amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I see the Senator from California is here.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2989\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the cloture motion on the amendment that is now pending. This \namendment essentially would close what I call the Enron loophole, which \nallows certain areas of trading to go without any oversight or \nregulation. The amendment has been out there for 5 weeks now. \nHopefully, that was more than enough time for Senators to give it due \nconsideration. There has been lobbying for the amendment on both sides.\n  This is what the amendment does. It essentially provides antifraud \nand antimanipulation authority to the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission for all energy trades online, when there is no physical \ndelivery. The amendment subjects all energy platforms--trading \nplatforms--to the same levels of oversight they had before the 2000 \nCommodity Futures Modernization Act, which was changed at the final \nhour by Enron to include an exemption for energy trading. This means \nthese trades exchanges would, once again, have to file with the CFTC. \nThey would have to provide price transparency, maintain capital \ncommensurate with risk, as decided by the CFTC. All the things that \nEnron did online essentially provided this giant loophole.\n  Mr. President, if I trade natural gas to you and deliver it to you, \nwe are\n\n[[Page S2428]]\n\ncovered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. But if I don't \ndeliver the gas to you but a number of trades take place in the \ninterim, none of these trades are covered by anybody. There is no \nantifraud; there is no antimanipulation oversight; I don't have to keep \nany record; there is no audit trail; and I don't have to have \nsufficient capital based on the risk I am taking. All of these things \nare covered by this amendment.\n  This amendment essentially closes a loophole, and that loophole is \nthat if you trade online, there is no oversight, or there is no \nantifraud or antimanipulation authority. So it is my hope that the \nSenate will provide cloture. It is my hope that we will be able to \nclose this loophole.\n  The amendment is supported by a number of groups. It is fair to say \nthere is intense lobbying on both sides. I view this amendment as being \non the side of the angels. It is very hard for me to understand why \nbecause you trade derivatives on an electronic platform--meaning \nonline--that you are able to escape any form of oversight. I think this \nkind of situation does not breed security in the marketplace, does not \ngive confidence to investors. So I hope there are 60 votes present for \nthis amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I have limited time and I am not going to \nget into a dispute about facts, or about what is and what isn't a \nloophole, or whether these instruments have ever been regulated because \nthey have not. But the reason that debate should not be brought to an \nend here is about as simple as any argument could be for continuing to \ntry to find a compromise. The entire financial sector of the American \neconomy--every bank, every securities company, every insurance company \nin America--is opposed to this amendment. The Federal Reserve Board and \nChairman Alan Greenspan are opposed to this amendment; not to what the \nSenator is trying to do, but to what the amendment does.\n  The Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman has spoken out \nadamantly in opposition to this amendment. The Chairman of the \nCommodities Futures Trading Commission--the very agency that would be \nempowered with new authority under this amendment--has spoken out and \nwritten letters and argued that these areas represent very complicated \nfinancial transactions, and that we need to take a look at unintended \nconsequences.\n  What I hope will happen today is that we will deny cloture. There has \nbeen no filibuster on this amendment. We have continued to process \nother amendments. There have been two good-faith efforts to reach a \ncompromise. Alan Greenspan has sent a letter to every Member of the \nSenate saying that he believes the ability to hedge risk through \nderivatives has been a major factor in preventing our downturn from \nbecoming a recession. He said that this market is a major factor in the \nunderlying strength of the economy, and he believes it could be \njeopardized by this amendment.\n  So I believe we should sit down and try to work out an amendment that \nAlan Greenspan believes is safe for the American economy. I don't know \nwho we are putting under the heading of angels, in the words of the \nSenator from California, but when we are talking about jobs, growth, \nopportunity and responsibility in America, if Alan Greenspan doesn't \nfall under the heading of angel, I don't know who does. The point is, \nthis amendment needs more work.\n  Let me tell you what everybody involved in the debate agrees on: \nNumber one, they agree that the CFTC should have access to data, that \ndata should be maintained to allow the reconstruction of individual \ntransactions for up to five years. That is what is required under the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission jurisdiction under current law. \nEverybody agrees that the Commission ought to be able to intervene if \nthere is evidence of fraud or price manipulation. Where the \ndisagreement and differences occur--and these three points represent 95 \npercent of the things that the proponents of this amendment say they \nare for--are in other areas that are generally unintended. I understand \nthat this is a very complicated issue. There is one member of this \nchamber who claims to know what a derivative is. I do not claim to know \nwhat a derivative is. I have tried, as former chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, to understand these transactions. But when you have a $75 \ntrillion market out there for very complicated financial instruments, \nyou don't want to tamper with it unless you know what you are doing.\n  You do not want unintended consequences when you are dealing with $75 \ntrillion of economic underpinning that holds up the very structure of \nthe American economy. That is what this amendment is putting at risk.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against forcing a vote on this amendment \nand give us an opportunity to try to write something that Alan \nGreenspan, the Chairman of the SEC, and the Chairman of the CFTC--the \npeople we have entrusted to make these decisions--are comfortable with \nand can support.\n  I believe we can achieve 95 percent of the objectives of the Senator \nfrom California without endangering the very financial underpinnings of \nthe American economy. But I believe they are endangered--as Alan \nGreenspan says, as the Secretary of the Treasury says, as banks, \nsecurity companies and insurance companies across the land say--by the \namendment as it is now written.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no. It would be my full intention if a \n``no'' vote prevails to again sit down with the Senator from California \nand work out a compromise that will solve her problem without creating \nothers.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to \nthe pending Feinstein amendment concerning modifications to the \nCommodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000.\n  The passage of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act only a year \nand a half ago has provided legal certainties that I believe have \nresulted in increased market participation, greater transparency and \nheightened market liquidity.\n  I agree there are lessons we can learn from Enron's collapse, \nparticularly with respect to accountability issues. I share in my \ncolleagues' outrage over these events, and truly feel for the workers \nand innocent investors who lost their jobs and life savings.\n  There are legislative actions that we in Congress can take to ensure \nthat similar corporate failures aren't allowed to fester elsewhere, In \nfact, as the ranking member on the Senate Finance Committee, I've taken \nsteps to do something about a number of tax and pension related \nproblems that have been exposed by the Enron collapse.\n  However, as regulatory agencies continue to investigate Enron's over-\nthe-counter derivatives activities, Congress must exercise caution when \nconsidering a legislative fix to a problem that has yet to be clearly \nidentified. Without the benefit of the results and recommendations of \nthese investigations, any legislative action will surely be premature.\n  The Secretary of the Treasury, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, \nthe Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the \nChairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission oppose adoption of \nthis amendment because of the lack of opportunity for a full review, as \nwell as the absence of any determination that energy derivatives played \na role in the collapse of Enron.\n  I also have concerns that this amendment has not been thoroughly and \nthoughtfully reviewed by the appropriate committees of jurisdiction. \nThe Senate Agriculture Committee, which I served on when the Commodity \nFutures Modernization Act was considered, addressed the issue of the \nuncertainties with respect to over-the-counter derivatives. The lack of \nhearings and analysis by the Senate Agriculture Committee prior to the \nconsideration of this amendment is unfortunate.\n  I therefore oppose this hastily drafted amendment, and will formally \nrequest that the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee \nthoroughly analyze, and if necessary, conduct hearings on the results \nand recommendations of the numerous agency investigations concerning \nthe regulation of over-the-counter derivatives.\n\n[[Page S2429]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Three minutes 50 seconds remain.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nNew Jersey.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I will split the time with the Senator \nfrom Illinois if that is OK with the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I wish to make a couple of simple points. \nFirst, this amendment brings forward fairly simple, straightforward \noversight functions that are typical in every financial market in which \nI have ever participated and in which I spent 30 years of my life \nworking, and that is antifraud, price manipulation and transparency \nrules that are fundamental to making the depth and breadth of the \nfinancial markets work. We have great financial markets in America. \nThis amendment accomplishes bringing that to bear in this energy \nmarket.\n  In fact, since this amendment was originally offered, there has been \nan enormous number of attempts to make sure it does not impact that $75 \ntrillion market about which the Senator from Texas talked. It exempts \nfinancial futures, equities, currencies, and debt instruments from any \nof the legal constraints. I think it has been adjusted to address most \nof the concerns I certainly have heard from my friends with whom I used \nto work in the financial sector.\n  It is very clear in small, confined markets where there is not the \ndepth and breadth that price manipulation is a very real possibility. \nAs a matter of fact, it was cited in the 1999 President's Working Group \non Financial Instruments, including Alan Greenspan, that at that point \nenergy markets were narrow enough so as to cause problems. We ought to \nmove forward in response to the kinds of problems we have seen at \nEnron. I hope Members will vote for cloture.\n\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. May I inquire how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. One minute 20 seconds.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I think I can sum up in that short period of time. I \nurge all my colleagues to support this amendment. It is a very good \namendment, and most of the arguments I have heard about it on the other \nside, in my judgment, are not true. The bill will have no chilling \neffect on the financial derivatives market.\n  It does not apply to purely financial derivatives, and there is an \nimportant public policy reason for this. We are trying to comport our \ncommodity futures laws in this country to comply with the principles \nlaid down by the President's working group in the last couple of years. \nSomehow when we passed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act last \nyear, at the end, a mysterious rifleshot exemption that applied to a \nhandful of commodity trading firms that trade online. It is not quite \nclear where it came from, but it creates an uneven regulatory playing \nfield where certain firms have a narrow exemption, there is no \ntransparency in their markets, and they are not reporting volume or \nopen interest. In my judgment, it is important to consumers of these \nonline exchanges to have that information available to them.\n  It is possible that a client can be ripped off on an online exchange, \nand the transparency created by this amendment will solve that problem.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I thank the Chair. I urge my colleagues to vote with \nSenator Feinstein, Senator Corzine, and myself in favor of cloture.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. By unanimous consent, pursuant to \nrule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion \nwhich the clerk will state.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the Feinstein \n     amendment No. 2989 to the substitute amendment for Calendar \n     No. 65, S. 517, the energy bill.\n         Dianne Feinstein, Byron L.

I suggest sometime this afternoon or early \nevening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Please give the \nSenator your attention. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. REID. I have spoken with Senator Bingaman. He agrees that would \nbe a good idea. I hope those on the other side also agree it is a good \nidea. No one cares how many amendments at this stage, but we should \nhave a specific time for filing these amendments. We hope we can offer \na unanimous consent agreement in the near future to set that time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n  The Senator from Idaho [Mr. CRAIG] proposes an amendment numbered \n3047.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record of March 21, \n2002, under ``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise after a great deal of consideration \nas to the amount of work that has been done on this energy bill by the \nchairman of the full committee and by a good number of interests. My \ncolleague from Wyoming is on the floor. He spearheaded a group dealing \nspecifically with title II, the electricity title, of this very large \nand important bill. He labored mightily over that. I was involved, and \nmy staff was involved, in some of those discussions.\n\n  But the reality became clear to me and others that the electrical \ntitle of this bill is such a very complicated, extended title--\nattempting to rework and amend years and years of law and public policy \nthat has built up, that has driven the capitalization of the largest \nelectricity industry in the world and, frankly, one of the best--that \nwithout the kinds of detailed hearings that must come before a full \ncommittee of energy, we could not effectively and responsibly write \nthis title in this Chamber.\n  I have opined on many occasions here that this bill did not get the \ntreatment of the committee, it did not get the treatment of the \nsubcommittees, it did not get the treatment of the professional staff \nand all of those who are interested as stakeholders in dealing with \nthis very critical title.\n  As a result of that, after several weeks of consideration, I decided \nit was appropriate that we have a vote on the reality that we cannot \nget as far as we would want to get. So this amendment today strikes the \nelectricity title and replaces it with consumer protection that is \nexactly the language currently in the bill, and the reliability \nprovisions of that bill that did have full committee treatment, that \nhas been voted on, on the floor of the Senate, and has been treated and \naccepted by the Senate as should these kinds of issues.\n  A good many interest groups recognize the complexity of this problem. \nThe House tried to deal with an electric title and couldn't--after \nmonths of consideration with the committee effort. It said: No, it is \ntoo complicated and we ought to step back from it. So their energy \nbill, passed in August, was silent on the issue of electricity.\n  Whether or not we speak to it going into conference, if this bill \nultimately gets to conference, there is a reality that we might not \ndeal with it then. And there are provisions within this title that I \nstrike to which many of us are strongly opposed.\n  The electric title does need the full attention of the experts--\na clear, precise explanation of what the jurisdictional committee \nintends, and, my guess is, therefore could craft the appropriate \nlanguage. I think the Senate owes the electric utility industry and the \nratepayers nothing less than a full, open, and transparent process to \nget us there.\n\n  We want to reform the electric industry. We need a national \ninterstate transmission system. All of those are realities.\n  We saw the problems in California when a State failed to deal with \nrestructuring or deregulation in an appropriate fashion and created the \ndisincentives that did not allow the investment in the marketplace.\n  If we were to create those kinds of disincentives to send a \nmultibillion-dollar industry scurrying trying to understand, but, most \nimportantly, allowing the recentralization of authority and a Federal \nregulator, then my guess is we will have made a major mistake. I think \nthat question is clearly on the table.\n  Senator Murkowski, I, and others who work on that Energy Committee, \nand the chairman who is here in the Chamber--in discussing energy and \nelectric restructuring over the last several years, and the phenomenal \namount of hearings that were held on it before any language was \nattempted--laid down criteria we believed were important if we were \ngoing to do no harm to the ratepayer and do no harm to the billions of \ndollars of investments that are out there already in this industry. \nThose standards work: Deregulate where possible, streamline when \nderegulation is not possible, and respect the prerogatives of the \nStates. I have added in the last several weeks of debate a fourth, an \nelementary principle: Know what we are doing when we legislate. And \nwhen we grant new authority, or change our delegation of authority to a \nregulatory agency, know the consequences.\n  It is my guess at this time that you could not effectively do a side-\nby-side comparative of old law and new law in this title and begin to \nunderstand what its impact would be on the utilities of Georgia and \ntheir investments, their values, and their abilities to compete in a \nregional or a national market.\n  That is what we ought to know. We know the importance of sustained, \nhigh-quality, reliable power to industry, to the consumer, and to the \nwell-being of the economy of this country.\n  Last month, we received a landmark Supreme Court decision on the \nauthority of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to order \ntransmission restructuring which has significant implications on the \nremainder of Federal-State responsibility and authority for regulation \nof public utilities. The Supreme Court's opinion in New York v. FERC \ndemands our thoughtful attention.\n  What we have not done here, because we have not been allowed to do \nit, is take this Court decision, lay it before the committee, bring the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission to the Hill, and begin to engage \nthem in questions as to what they might be willing to do and what they \nsense their new authority is under this Court decision. Was that the \nintent of the public policy of our country, or do we allow the judicial \nbranch to legislate in a way that grants substantial new Federal \nauthority? It is not clear at this time.\n  I think it is very understandable to most of us who deal in this \nphenomenally complicated area that we do not comprehend the reach of \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as was and is now extended by \nthe Court's decision. How far can the Commission push its authority now \nthat the Court has said it has it? Those are the kinds of questions we \nought to ask of ourselves for our ratepayers and for the utility \ncommissions of our respective States and that which was once the \nresponsible authority that created reliability and the stability of the \nindustry historically.\n\n  There are several other important questions which have been gnawing \nat me, and I think probably several of us, since the Court issued its \nopinion.\n  For example, should the Senate now examine the need for legislation \nto protect native load customers? There are many who say: Yes, we \nshould because we have a responsibility to the initial intent of the \nlaw and what it has done for the strength of our States' systems. We \nneed to understand. Is FERC going to aggressively start restructuring \nin\n\n[[Page S2431]]\n\nwhat appears to be a real, lively, unbridled authority granted by the \nCourt? We have not asked the question. FERC has not been before the \ncommittee. The committee hasn't functioned. Of course, that decision \ncame just as we were engaging here on the floor, which I believe \ndramatically shifts the pendulum and the equation as it relates to this \nissue.\n  We all know that FERC has pursued an aggressive restructuring program \nand to establish regional transmission authority--a vital, stand-alone \ntransmission business, as the Commission called it in 1999. Before we \nenact new law, we need to act to take into account that reality.\n  How does FERC, through the Supreme Court decision, affect RTO, the \nregional transmission authority? We have already heard their expression \npre-Court decision. Now we need to understand their intent post-Court \ndecision. Why would you, in an effort to restructure the electrical \nindustry of this country, shift all of the power that once rested in \nmany instances in the 50 States' commissions to a central Federal \nauthority with phenomenal power over the ability of an industry to \noperate and to capitalize and, therefore, provide service to the \nconsuming public? Not one word in the energy bill addresses the issue \nof the regional transmission organization. How can we enact an electric \ntitle without taking RTOs into account? That authority appears at this \nmoment to be sweeping, and with substantial impact on the very title \nthat is currently by amendment and by process here on the floor in this \nenergy bill.\n  Even if we choose to remain silent on this issue, our choice should \nbe a conscious one clearly expressed and based on a complete record, \nand at a minimum after hearings in the committee with full \njurisdiction. That is what we ought to be doing. That is what we are \nnot doing.\n  I say it is time we step back and stand down and pass the energy bill \nabsent this--there is a lot of good stuff in it, and I hope there is \nmore to come--and do as we ought to do before committee.\n  In my March 14 floor statement, I discussed why provisions covering \nelectricity mergers and market-based rates and a refund effective date \ngive me concern.\n  Are those important issues? You bet your life they are important.\n  I would like to now address briefly a couple of the provisions that \nare also of great concern to me--the market transparency rule and civil \npenalties.\n  Oh, my goodness, Larry. What are you talking about here? I am talking \nabout new authority, new power, and real questions being asked that I \nbelieve this title moves. We ought to know about it.\n  Market transparency rules: I find the title of this section a great \nmisnomer. In a nutshell, I consider this section potentially \nanticompetitive as any piece of legislation we could pass. Yet we are \ntalking about competitive markets. We may be creating a phenomenally \nanticompetitive incentive within the legislation.\n  The provision says that as soon as practicable, competitors must \nrelease information about price and quality or quantity of sales in \ninterstate commerce.\n  As far back as 1921, in the American Column and Lumber case, the \nSupreme Court deemed their practice of contemporaneous release of \nindividual prices and sale volumes by competitors a violation of \nantitrust law.\n  That is the law. That is the ruling. That is the understanding; \ntherefore, that is the practice. Have we changed it? It appears we \nhave. Is that anticompetitive? It darn well may be. We ought to know \nit, and we ought to know how it impacts the capitalization of the \neconomic base of this industry.\n  Economists say this practice allows a cartel to enforce its rules. \nSome of my colleagues cry market manipulation at the first sign of \nprice increases. Malefactors in the industry could not think up a \nbetter scheme of market manipulation than this one, at least that is my \nbelief.\n  This section allows the Commission to exempt commercially sensitive \ninformation. If we really mean that, we should ask the Commission to \nrepeal the requirements of contemporaneous individual price and volume \ninformation. And if not, what do we mean by commercially sensitive? Are \nwe simply going to allow that to be interpreted by the FERC? Some of \ntheir interpretations took them well beyond the law or the intent of \npublic policy over the last several years.\n  The Edwards Dam case: Never did we say in the law they had the right \nto take down a dam, but they chose to do it--or to at least establish \nthe precedent to do so.\n  I only cite that as an example because it does show the extreme power \nand authority of the FERC.\n  The civil penalties section gives the Commission authority to impose \npenalties in electric cases beyond what it has now in hydro cases. \nUnlike refunds, civil penalties have no necessary relationship to \neconomic damage. We need to rest assured that we give this kind of \nauthority to agencies that exercise good judgment. Here, I fear, we \nhave not.\n  I recall the Commission's use of its civil penalty authority in the \nhydroelectric arena, and in particular a noteworthy case 10 years ago \nknown as the Wolverine hydro. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia told of a case in which the Commission extracted a \npenalty of $2 million for a project that operated without a license for \na few days a year. I will say that again: a penalty of $2 million for \noperating for a couple of days a year out of license.\n  Is that reasonable? Is that right? It does not sound right, but they \nhad that authority, and they did it. Worse, the DC Circuit never \nreached the issue of whether the $2 million constituted an excessive \nfine. The court held that the Commission overreached in the first \nplace, so the concept of operating excessively in the area of civil \npenalties has never been judged. The law said that the Commission's \ncivil penalties authority extended to violators of existing license \nconditions, not those operating without licenses.\n  We do not need heavyhanded enforcement in the electricity area lest \nwe scare off investment. Maybe the Commission has changed, but we need \nto inquire of the Commission's intent and its desire to use this \nprovision in the law. The only way you get that done is for the \nchairman of the committee to convene a hearing, bring the Commission, \nand build the public record: What is your intent, Chairman of the FERC? \nHow do you plan to use this title? And what do you think your \nparameters are in your authority? Is it sweeping? I would suggest that \nit is. And I would suggest that if that authority is real, as I have \ninterpreted it, and as I think the courts have been silent to it, then \ndo you scare off investment? I think there is a strong possibility you \ndo. All these points collectively explain my grave reservations about \nmoving toward the electrical title.\n  The Senate's intent, usually expressed in jurisdictional committee \nreports, is missing. We do not have the Senate's intent, unless you can \npick it up haphazardly and piece by piece through the Congressional \nRecord. It is missing. And I fear this omission can only be adverse to \nmany States, including my own, that will be affected by this very \ncomplex piece of legislation.\n  FERC, most assuredly, interpreted these provisions in ways that would \nexpand its authority. Few bureaucracies ever attempt to limit their \nauthority. And FERC has shown very recently that it is loathe to limit \nits authority.\n  My suggestion is, title II of this bill just hands to the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission new authority, expanded authority. And \nwithout our effective interpretation and/or committee reports, and the \nexpression of the intent of this Senate as it relates to the Supreme \nCourt decision, we have set them free, in many instances, to do as they \nwould judge is in the best interest.\n  I need only to reference, as I did earlier, the Edwards Dam case. \nThat is the one where we gave them no authority in the law to take down \na dam, but they did. For almost 80 years, the Commission never saw fit \nto interpret part 1 of FPA as giving the authority to order a licensee \nof a hydro project to take down a dam at the end of its original \nlicense term, and for good reason.\n  As I have already stated, there is no authority in the statute for \nthe Commission to do that. Indeed, Congress addressed, in 1968, the \nvery issue of FERC, with attempting to address, in 1999, in the Edwards \ncase, what happens\n\n[[Page S2432]]\n\nto dams at the end of the original license term.\n  Congress amended part 1 of the Federal Power Act, added sections 14 \nand 15, to allow for the issuance of nonpower licenses in the event a \nlicensee was no longer able to continue operating a power project. In \naddition, those sections required payment to the licensee for \nsurrendering its right to operate the project.\n  So it was a bit of a shock to me when the FERC ordered the main \nlicensee in the Edwards Dam proceeding to stop operating its project \nand pay the huge cost associated with removing the dam. That is what \nthey did. FERC was even shrewd enough to procedurally block an appeal \nto the Federal court.\n  So they worked their will outside the law. And here we are giving \nthem vast new authority, without defining, without prescribing, without \nsideboards, in any way, in my opinion, limiting them, at least in the \nbackwash or the shadow of a court, saying: Regional transmission, FERC, \nhave at it.\n  How can we ignore these kinds of actions? We should not. And if we \nare responsible in writing this kind of detailed bill, we will not. But \nwe have.\n  That is why I am here. That is why the amendment is before us to \nstrike these provisions and allow the chairman to convene the \ncommittee, deal with this separately, and deal with it responsibly.\n  With that knowledge, how can Senators be comfortable with what is \navailable and what may become law in this pending legislation? Does \nanyone here today seriously doubt that the recent Supreme Court ruling \nin favor of FERC, in its quest to create a national grid, will not \nresult in serious disagreements between FERC's desire to control \nrestructuring of our electrical system and the individual desire of \nStates to protect the important ratepayer policies within their \nborders?\n  This is a major concern of mine. I am not sanguine about all that we \nhave done and the way it has been drafted. That is why I believe that \nclearly all of us deserve the option, deserve the choice, to make the \ndecision here with this amendment. Do you want it or do you believe \nthat some of what I have said is valid enough that we ought to ask the \nauthorizing committee, the committee of responsibility, and its \nprofessional staffs, to openly engage the FERC, and all of those other \nissues, to allow us to deal with this in an important way?\n\n  There are ample reasons for us to deal with other issues, but let me \ngive you a couple of those reasons. I have a list of the organizations \nthat, on examination of my amendment, and over frustration with this \ntitle, have agreed that they believe it is important to support my \namendment to strike: the American Public Power Association, Consumer \nFederation of America, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, \nthe Electricity Consumers Resource Council, U.S. Conference of Mayors, \nConsumers for Fair Competition, National Electrical Contractors \nAssociation, Plumbing-Heating-Cooling Contractors Association, Air \nConditioning Contractors of America, National Association of State \nUtility Consumer Advocates, Transmission Access Policy Study Group, \nAARP, Public Citizen, Consumers Union, Citizens for State Power, \nConservatives for Balanced Electricity Reform, Americans for Tax \nReform, and the Small Business Survival Committee.\n  Those are ones that have just come to us in the last few weeks, as \nthey had the opportunity to examine the title, what is in it, and the \namendment.\n  There is a good deal more to be said. I see colleagues in the Chamber \nwho are opposed to the amendment. Let me wrap this up with a concluding \nstatement.\n  My colleague from Wyoming and I are very committed to building an \nenergy policy that allows greater production. My colleague was asked if \nhe would help the administration facilitate trying to bring about an \nelectrical title on which we could agree. He has worked mightily to do \nso. In some areas, he has succeeded. But in the areas I spoke to, I \nbelieved these were areas that he could not go, nor could any of us, \nbecause we simply don't know the impact.\n  It is important that we look at the big picture, as we are trying to \ndefine all of the players within that big picture, enter the Supreme \nCourt, extending greater authority or at least clarifying to FERC what \nFERC thought it already had. Is it not right, most importantly, is it \nnot responsible of us, as public policy crafters, to make sure that \nwhich we craft works?\n  There are billions of dollars riding on this amendment and this bill \nand this title. The reality that if we do it right, when every consumer \nthrows the light switch, the light will come on; when every consumer \ntouches the on button on their computer, the computer will come on; \nthat moms and dads working will know that their security systems are on \nand that their children are safe.\n  The reason I mentioned those things was because when you do it wrong, \nas they did it in California, all of those things become questioned. \nWhen the lights go down or the lights go out, the economy of this \ncountry shudders.\n  Let us not be so irresponsible as to craft a title without the \neffective vetting of it, without the responsible hearings, knowing \nwhere we are going, taking authority away from commissions at the State \nlevel and resting it in a central all-powerful Federal agency without \nclearly understanding its consequences.\n\n  What my amendment does is causes us all to take a deep breath, step \nback, not rush to judgment, leave in the reliability, because we have \ndone that. We have vetted it. We have been heard on it. The committee \nhas operated. The Senate has passed it. Deal with the consumer \nprotection. But on all of this that is so very critical to the long-\nterm stability of the electrical industry and the electric system of \nour country that we have all created phenomenal reliability on, let us \nstep back for a moment and take a look at what we are doing and make \nsure we are doing it right. I fear we are not; I fear that we lay a \ngreat deal of a very fine industry in jeopardy to central all-powerful \nauthority. Bad mistake, wrong choice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me speak for a few minutes in \nopposition to this amendment by the Senator from Idaho.\n  He stated at the beginning of his comments that there is a lot of \nuncertainty, a lot of question as to how various markets will evolve. I \nagree with that. There is uncertainty as we go forward. We are trying \nto craft legislation that will allow for that uncertainty but will move \nus in the direction we know we need to move.\n  Why is it important that we retain this section, this title in the \nbill related to electricity? That is what the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Idaho purports to do; it purports to strip out of the bill \nthe guts of that section, that title II of our energy bill. That would \nbe a profound mistake for the Senate to go along with. It would be a \nprofound mistake for the Congress. I hope very much his amendment will \nbe defeated.\n  Let me start by saying that the reason we believe--the reason I \nstrongly believe and I believe many of us believe--that electricity \nneeds to be addressed as part of a comprehensive energy bill is the \nsame reason that the President gave us, and the Vice President when the \nVice President issued the report, the energy plan for the country over \na year ago now. That is, that our future supply of energy, the \nreliability of energy supplies in the future, the adequacy of energy \nsupplies in the future, electricity supplies, are legitimately in \nquestion unless we do some things to change our basic laws in this \nregard.\n  We need to recognize that this command and control approach to \nelectricity generation, which we have relied upon for a century or \nmore, is not going to meet our needs in the future. We need to \nrecognize that a market-based approach makes more sense. We are moving \nin the direction of permitting that where appropriate.\n\n  We did have the lights going out in California. That was over a year \nago now. Some people have forgotten about it. Of course, our economy \nhas been in a slow period. Folks are once again assuming we have plenty \nof electricity and our electricity transmission system is adequate to \nour needs, and there is no reason for us to be concerned with this \nissue. It would be a profound mistake to reach that conclusion.\n  Nobody knows how hot it is going to get this summer. Nobody knows how\n\n[[Page S2433]]\n\nmuch of a demand there will be for electricity, for air-conditioners in \nmajor cities. Nobody knows whether the transmission system we have \ntoday is adequate to those needs.\n  What we are trying to do with this legislation is put in place some \nsafeguards so that the transmission system is adequate, so that the \nadditional generation of electricity that is going to be required for \nthis country's economy in the years ahead will be there.\n  One of the points the Senator from Idaho made is that we haven't had \nenough hearings on this issue. Let me say, I have been on the Energy \nCommittee for some time, nearly 20 years. I can't think of anything on \nwhich we have had more hearings. Let me recount for the Senate the \nextent of the hearings we have had.\n  Beginning in 1997, we had a hearing, a subcommittee hearing on \ncompetitive change in the electric power industry. That was on August \n21, 1997.\n  In 1998, we had an oversight hearing on the recent Midwest \nelectricity price spikes. In 1999, we had a whole series of hearings, \nfull committee hearings. First, we had one on electricity competition \ngenerally. Then we had hearings in June of 1999 on the Electric Utility \nRestructuring Empowerment and Competitiveness Act of 1999, which was \nlegislation we had introduced at that point. We had hearings on the \nFederal Power Act amendments of 1999. We had hearings on the \nComprehensive Electricity Competition Act of 1999. We had six full \ncommittee hearings, according to the records I have, on that set of \nissues in 1999.\n  In the year 2000, we had an enormous number of hearings. My \ncolleague, Senator Murkowski, was chairing those hearings. I attended \nas many of them as I could, but quite frankly, there were more than any \nSenator could plan to attend. We had hearings on all aspects of this \nissue.\n  The Senator from Alaska referred to those as workshops so it wouldn't \nlook as though we were having that many hearings on one subject, but we \nhad well over 15 of these so-called workshops which took testimony, \nwhich gave Senators a chance to ask questions.\n  In 2001, we had again a series of hearings, a great many hearings, \nquite frankly, at the full committee on this set of issues. In 2002, we \nhave also had hearings related to the effect of Enron's collapse on \nenergy markets, electric infrastructure, and investment needs. That was \nin August of 2001. We had a hearing, just as recently as February of \nthis year, on the amendments to the Public Utility Holding Company Act.\n\n  So we have had hearings. There is no lack of committee attention to \nthis set of issues. That doesn't mean the issues have gotten simple; \nthey have not. But I think we have a good framework here in this \nlegislation for moving the country in the right direction.\n  Let me just describe, generally, what the legislation now contains as \nwe have amended it on the Senate floor. I believe there are some pro-\nconsumer provisions in this legislation. I believe there are some pro-\nenvironment provisions. I believe there are provisions in here that \nwill tend to ensure that we have a greater generation of electricity in \nthe future.\n  We have a renewable portfolio standard, which many of my colleagues \nhave not favored. But that is in the bill. We have had three or four \nvotes on that issue. The majority of the Senate clearly favors \nretaining that.\n  We have strengthened Federal Energy Regulatory Commission authority \nfor market-based rates, including a stronger requirement that FERC act \nif rates are unjust or unreasonable.\n  We have strengthened Federal Energy Regulatory Commission authority \nto scrutinize mergers and acquisitions in the electric utility \nindustry, including expanding that authority to encompass electric \nutility-gas utility mergers, mergers of holding companies that own \nutilities, mergers of generation-only companies. FERC currently does \nnot have authority over any of these consolidations. We strengthen the \nstandards by which mergers must be approved to require that FERC \ndetermine that mergers are consistent with the public interest, that \nthey do not adversely affect captive customers of utilities. That is a \nvery important provision. We are putting into law a requirement that \nFERC make a finding that if a merger occurs, it will not adversely \naffect a captive customer of a utility. We believe that is an important \nnew safeguard. We also require that FERC determine that the merger not \nimpair the ability of regulators to regulate and not lead to any cross-\nsubsidy between the utility and any other business.\n  The latter three conditions are goals of regulation under the Public \nUtility Holding Company Act, which is current law. But here in this \nlegislation we give those authorities to FERC, which we believe has a \nbetter track record, by far, of being a watchdog over the utility \nindustry. The Public Utility Holding Company Act, which is the current \nlaw, is supposed to be administered by the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, and they have taken the position for the last 20 years that \nthey did not want that authority, they did not believe they were the \nproper agency to have that authority. So we are transferring, \nessentially, that same responsibility over to FERC, and we are giving \nFERC the additional power it needs to actually enforce the provisions \nof that law--the pro-consumer provisions--to look out for ratepayers in \na way that they really never have been in a practical way under the \nPublic Utilities Holding Company Act.\n  In addition to the renewable portfolio standard, there are a number \nof other provisions to give renewable energy a stronger role in the \nmarket. There is a Federal purchase requirement for renewable \nelectricity, new standards for net metering and real-time pricing, and \naccess to transmission by renewable resources.\n\n  I believe very strongly that this bill moves in the right direction. \nThere are a lot of things that this bill is accused of doing--this \ntitle to the energy bill--which in fact it does not do. It does not \nprovide any vast new authority to the Federal Government. It does shift \nauthority from the Securities and Exchange Commission to FERC, where we \nbelieve it can be much more effectively enforced. The market-based rate \nsection doesn't grant new authority to FERC to order divestiture of \nfacilities. That is a charge that has been made.\n  On transmission, the provision makes sure that all transmitting \nutilities are under the same rules. We believe there ought to be a \nuniform set of rules for utilities that are transmitting energy from \none part of the country to the other. This is a national economy we are \nin today, and we need a national transmission system if we are going to \nprosper in this national economy.\n  The reliability section gives FERC some new authority. I am pleased \nto see that my friend from Idaho does agree that that should be \nincluded. The exact provisions of the reliability section--my friend \nfrom Wyoming, Senator Thomas, and I disagreed on that earlier, and he \nwon that argument. The Senate agreed to his provisions relating to \nreliability. That is in the bill. But it is very important that those \nprovisions stay in the bill and that we not strip out this section of \nthe bill.\n  I believe very strongly that Senator Craig's amendment would be a \nvery major blow to our energy legislation. This is an issue that has \nbeen discussed, debated, and talked about at hearings in the Congress \nfor about three Congresses now--three separate 2-year Congresses. The \ntruth is that it is not an easy set of issues to get your arms around. \nThe Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Thomas, and his staff, I, and my staff \nhave worked hard to come up with a set of provisions that we believe \ndoes what should be done and moves the country in the right direction. \nWe had strong support and assistance from the administration.\n  Everybody likes to highlight the differences between Democrats and \nRepublicans on energy issues. There are some legitimate, valid, and \nimportant differences on which we are going to have votes later this \nweek, but this is not one of them. This is an area where we have had a \nvery conscientious effort, on a bipartisan level, to work with the \nadministration to come up with what we thought was good policy. I \nbelieve we have done that.\n  I compliment the Senator from Wyoming for his leadership in this \nregard, in pulling together provisions that he could support and that \nothers could support. So I believe very strongly that those provisions \nought to remain in the bill. Senator Craig's amendment would delete \nthose provisions, so it is an amendment I strongly oppose.\n\n[[Page S2434]]\n\n  I yield the floor, and I know my colleague from Wyoming is here to \nspeak on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the chairman \nof our committee. I rise also to talk about this part of our energy \nbill, which I think is very important. In many ways, the energy portion \nof it touches more people than any other part. Of course, everybody \nrelies on electricity. That is what we are talking about here.\n  I appreciate the comments of my friend from Idaho, who expressed his \nconcern. Many of the concerns he expressed, however, are the same \nconcerns we worked together to try to remedy, and indeed we have made \nsome changes that reflect the things about which the Senator from Idaho \ntalked. I agree that the process is not quite the way I would have had \nit. I wish we would have had more time in committee. Nevertheless, we \ntook a bill, and I think we have made it better and we have had it on \nthe floor, and by no means is it perfect, nor does it complete all the \nwork that needs to be done in the electrical area. But there is no way \nyou are going to complete that now.\n  We need to get started and to be moving. Further improvements can be \nmade. I oppose the motion to strike, and even though the reliability--\nwhich is important--would remain, I think it is very important that we \ncontinue to move forward with making some changes in our electric \npolicy.\n  It seems to me some of the things that have been talked about here \nare the very things we have sought to change. For example, in one of \nthe sections there was originally major expansion of FERC's authority \nover State matters, no time limit on FERC review and action. In our \nbill, in the solutions we made, we reduced the expansion of FERC \nauthority, raised the threshold of FERC authority from the review of \nasset sales from $1 million to $10 million, and moved more of the \ndecisionmaking closer to the people.\n  As to market-based rates, the concern in the original bill is it gave \nFERC broad authority to take any action to remedy ``unjust'' rates.\n  We changed that. We said FERC can only fix those rates if it is found \nto be unjust, and there are six specific criteria and three general \ncriteria. Again, it puts a bridle on FERC.\n  There were many points the Senator from Idaho talked about that we \nindeed have moved toward doing, and that is moving more power and \nbeginning to get ready for regional transmission organizations, RTOs, \nbeginning to make the initial move toward having the necessary \ntransmission.\n  One of the things that has happened, and there have been great \nchanges, is we basically deregulated generation. In the past, if a \nutility served an area around western Virginia, for example, that \nutility did the power generation and distribution. The State took care \nof that. We have changed it so there are many market generators who do \nnot distribute but make it available to distributors, and it has helped \nreduce the price to consumers. That is a different situation, and we \nhave to deal with it.\n  Since 1978, Congress has been pursuing Federal electric policies that \npromote greater competition in wholesale power markets, provide open \naccess to transmission grids, and encourage development of independent \npower producers that now build most of our powerplants.\n  These policies were developed in a bipartisan manner and embraced by \nboth Republican and Democratic Presidents. These policies have \nbenefited consumers. Wholesale power prices have fallen 25 percent over \nthe last 10 years. Nothing that happened over the past year changes \nthat. We had problems, of course. We have gotten by those problems. \nNothing has changed that.\n\n  The electric industry faces tremendous uncertainty. Investment in new \ntransmission is lagging, and powerplant cancellations in recent months \nraise serious concerns about the adequacy of future electricity \nsupplies.\n  This uncertainty is due largely to a prolonged transition to \ncompetitive electricity markets. This transition will not be complete \nuntil the Congress modernizes electricity laws to reflect changes in \nelectricity markets since 1935. This is not a total remedy, of course, \nbut this is a movement toward doing what has to be done.\n  The time has come to modernize our electricity laws to recognize \nchange in the electricity markets, in much the same way Congress passed \nlegislation to modernize financial services 2 years ago. Congress has \nbeen grappling with this legislation for 6 years. We have held more \nthan 100 hearings, as the Senator from New Mexico has pointed out. Six \nyears is long enough. It is time for the Congress to act.\n  The electricity provisions of S. 517 represent consensus. They are \nthe product of many hours of negotiations between Senators and \nstakeholders. The Craig amendment would destroy this consensus and \ndelay congressional action on this electricity legislation for years. \nIt will take years to put it back together.\n  I suggest the Craig amendment is a step backwards. The amendment \neliminates consensus transmission open access provisions that represent \na bipartisan compromise that will prevent discrimination, promote \neffective competition, protect small transmission owners such as \nmunicipal utilities and cooperatives, and respect States rights.\n  The amendment preserves PUHCA, a law that is outdated and should be \nrepealed. Every President since 1984 has supported PUHCA repeal. PUHCA \nrepeal will provide FERC with ample authority to protect consumers \nagainst inappropriate mergers. State laws would also protect consumers \nof electricity.\n  The amendment preserves PURPA, a law that has imposed billions of \ndollars of above-market costs to consumers. Repealing PURPA has been \nthe consensus for years. We must not continue to mandate that utilities \nagree to high-cost power contracts. Keeping PURPA is contrary to \nprotecting the consumers.\n  The amendment limits FERC authority to review mergers.\n  The amendment will make it harder to increase electricity supply by \nlimiting authority to order interconnections.\n  The amendment eliminates reforms that will accelerate refunds to \nconsumers.\n  I think it is true the electricity industry is facing more regulatory \nuncertainty now than ever before. Investment in new transmission is \nalmost nonexistent, and investment in new electric power supplies has \nfallen sharply. For the first time last year, powerplant cancellations \noutpaced new starts. No one wants to invest in new transmission of \npowerplants until they know what the rules are going to be.\n  The electricity industry is at an important crossroads. A lot of \ncritical decisions must be made.\n  Some of these decisions can be made by FERC; many can only be made by \nCongress.\n  If the Craig amendment is adopted and Congress does not act on the \nelectricity legislation, the transition to competitive markets will be \nprolonged, investment in new transmission and electricity supplies will \nfall sharply, electricity prices will be higher, and reliability will \nbe lower. The electricity crisis in California and the West will \nprobably recur.\n\n  The President has called for Senate passage of electricity \nmodernization to protect consumers and ensure reliability. The \nPresident's plan to produce more reliable, affordable, and \nenvironmentally clean energy is built on three core principles:\n  The plan is comprehensive and forward looking.\n  It utilizes 21st century technology to allow us to promote \nconservation and diversify our energy supplies.\n  The plan will increase the quality of life of Americans by providing \nreliable energy and protecting the environment.\n  We have before us an opportunity to start to move in that direction. \nIs it the total effort? Of course not, we will have to continue to work \non it. We need to do that.\n  We have made some forward movements. Of course, one of the major \nparts has been reliability. The other parts contribute a great deal to \nmaking it possible and urging people to invest in the infrastructure \nthat has to be there, whether it be transmission or generation. I look \nforward to a time when we have RTOs, regional transmission \norganizations, that can come\n\n[[Page S2435]]\n\noff an interstate highway movement of generated electricity so that we \ncan indeed have a marketplace.\n  I suggest we move forward with the bill as it is and not accept the \nCraig amendment. Now is not the time to retreat from the advances we \nhave made in serving the American people with electric energy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Wyoming for \nhis comments. Let me raise for the Senate's attention one other voice \nthat has spoken out strongly in behalf of what we are trying to do in \nour electricity title to the bill and in opposition to the Craig \namendment. It is something I seldom quote because I seldom agree with \nit, but this is the Wall Street Journal editorial page of March 7, \n2002. It has an editorial entitled, ``Keep the Lights On.'' It starts \nout by saying:\n\n       It is a $225 billion industry, and it's a horrid mess. We \n     refer to the electric power industry, but the U.S. Supreme \n     Court just took a helpful step toward fixing the messiest \n     part of it--transmission--and keeping your lights on.\n\n  They go on to talk about how they believe FERC needs this authority \nto do what it is trying to do. The Supreme Court has indicated they \nbelieve they have that authority. Our legislation, as worked out \nbetween myself and Senator Thomas, does incorporate those provisions.\n  The last paragraph of that editorial says:\n\n       The Bush Administration agrees with FERC, and now the \n     Supreme Court says the agency is acting legally. Congress \n     could also lend a hand here and, as part of its energy bill, \n     give FERC clear jurisdiction over the transmission grid. We \n     believe in federalism as much as anyone, but a national \n     economy needs a better national grid.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this editorial be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Keep the Lights On\n\n       It is a $225 billion industry, and it's a horrid mess. We \n     refer to the electric power industry, but the U.S. Supreme \n     Court just took a helpful step toward fixing the messiest \n     part of it--transmission--and keeping your lights on.\n       The High Court ruled unanimously this week that the Federal \n     Energy Regulatory Commission, aka FERC, has the power to \n     force investor-owned utilities to open up their power lines \n     to competitors. Now maybe FERC can go ahead with building a \n     more sensible national power grid.\n       The problem starts with a system of wires carrying juice \n     that is outdated, inadequate and under increasing stress. The \n     national delivery grid consists of three major systems--one \n     each in the East, the West and Texas (which is another story \n     entirely). But these grids aren't an integrated network. They \n     connect only through tie lines where power must be converted \n     from alternating current to direct current and back again. \n     Until recently the grid handled 20,000 transactions a year; \n     now it's more like 20,000 transfers in a single day during \n     peak periods.\n       The result is chronic hot spots of congestion that can \n     result in price spikes or even rolling blackouts. FERC \n     estimates the cost of these hot spots the past two summers at \n     $1 billion, and things will only get worse: Transmission use \n     this decade is expected to grow 20% to 25%, but new \n     capability will increase by only 4%.\n       Why not build more transmission lines? Well, people don't \n     want hideous lines running through their back yards, and the \n     50 states, which have jurisdiction over siting, aren't eager \n     to force lines on communities if the power those lines carry \n     is going elsewhere. Second, new lines are expensive and firms \n     don't want to make huge investments because of the political \n     uncertainty of electricity deregulation. Third, utilities say \n     the rate of return allowed on transmission lines is too low.\n       The current mess has also generated all sorts of anti-\n     competitive behavior. Since local utilities have control over \n     their transmission lines, they can favor their own generation \n     over cheaper power coming from the outside. Plus, the very \n     possibility of cheaper power makes it less likely that \n     utilities will build more lines if those newer lines can be \n     used by outsiders.\n       The good news is that FERC has proposed a sensible step \n     toward straightening out this bird's nest. FERC's idea is to \n     collect all this transmission into four big, regional areas--\n     in the Northeast, Southeast, Midwest and West--make these \n     regional grids independent of local utilities and give them \n     the authority to manage electricity flow across these larger \n     areas. Some conservatives are afraid this will result in a \n     fiendish ``federalization'' of transmission. Nonsense. FERC's \n     plan will make it possible to rationalize service and permit \n     greater competition.\n       The Bush Administration agrees with FERC, and now the \n     Supreme Court says the agency is acting legally. Congress \n     could also lend a hand here and, as part of its energy bill, \n     give FERC clear jurisdiction over the transmission grid. We \n     believe in federalism as much as anyone, but a national \n     economy needs a better national grid.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I will give my colleagues a little \nhistory and background because I do not think there has been an awful \nlot of identification as to the credit and penalty costs associated \nwith the renewable portfolio standard.\n  I commend the majority leader for his work, our staff, and the \nSenator from Wyoming as well. What I think we have done is, first of \nall, we have made some progress. We have debated an amendment that \nwould have mandated a 20 percent renewable. I believe that was by \nSenator Jeffords. We have, I think, by amendment, strengthened the \nenergy bill, and I think it is time, in view of the amendment offered \nby Senator Craig, to again highlight some of the specifics so each \nMember's office and each Member understands the significance of what \nthis renewable portfolio means to them or their own individual \nconstituents.\n  Oftentimes we get enamored with the reality that the renewable is \nfree; it is a renewable. Therefore, it really does not cost us \nanything, and as a consequence we ought to get aboard and support it.\n  Senator Craig's amendment proposes striking the electricity title of \nthe Daschle-Bingaman amendment, as modified by the bipartisan \namendment, and replacing it with the Senate-adopted reliability \nprovision and the consumer protections of the underlying Daschle \namendment. I think a couple of comments are in order relative to the \ntitle that Senator Craig proposes to delete.\n  When the original Daschle amendment was introduced, I was concerned, \nas I indicated, about its electricity provisions. They were seriously \nflawed. We gave some examples of those concerns. As originally written, \nthe Daschle amendment would have empowered the Federal regulators to \nmicromanage the marketplace. I think most Members were fearful that was \nnot in the best order of the marketplace nor appropriate for the \nFederal regulators to dwell in that area.\n  As originally written, the Daschle amendment would have allowed the \nFERC, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, to order electric \nutilities to divest assets. Further, as originally written, the Daschle \namendment would have preempted the States, giving FERC the authority to \nregulate the many aspects of retail matters instead of State public \nutility commissions. So again, it would have given FERC broad authority \non many aspects of retail matters, instead of the State public utility \ncommissions. For those of us who believe local control and regulation \nis more responsive than one size fits all, that was troublesome.\n  Further, as originally written, the Daschle amendment did not \nderegulate and allow the market to work. Instead, it had government \npick winners and government pick losers and decide what is in the \nconsumers' best interest.\n  In short, as originally written, the Daschle amendment was a return \nto the old-fashioned Federal command and control of the market. But we \nhave come some way since the introduction of the Daschle amendment, and \nwhat we have now is the reality that the Senate has agreed to a series \nof amendments authored by my good friend Senator Thomas, most of which \nwas done by unanimous consent. I appreciate working with the majority \non that.\n  Senator Thomas's amendments address many of the key problems with the \nDaschle bill, including reliability. So I think we have made progress. \nHad those not been adopted, I very possibly would have found it \nnecessary to offer a motion to strike the electric title. With these \namendments, we now have a\n\n[[Page S2436]]\n\nbill which, No. 1, protects consumers; No. 2, it streamlines \nregulation; and, No. 3, it enhances competition while preserving State \nauthority. It ensures reliability of the grid, allows regional \nflexibility, and promotes renewable energy and other types of \ngeneration.\n\n  One might ask, with the adoption of these amendments: Are the \nelectricity provisions perfect? Well, the answer is no. They are \nbetter, but there is a lot of work that needs to be done. Where is it \ngoing to be done? In conference or other places, or perhaps on the \nSenate floor. I think that is one of the reasons we should take a look \nat this matter one more time.\n  For example, the reliability still contains, in my opinion, an \nunrealistic renewable portfolio mandate that is going to cost consumers \nmore than $12 billion per year and which undercuts the ability of \nStates to craft a renewable portfolio program that protects their \nconsumers and recognizes local needs and concerns.\n  With regard to the cost to consumers of the renewable portfolio \nstandard of 10 percent, if we take one area of the country, Connecticut \nLight and Power, the customers of that particular utility are going to \nhave to pay another $9.5 million per year. That is going to be split \nup.\n  Florida Power and Light, of interest to the present Presiding \nOfficer: That is going to cost the consumers of Florida $264 million \nper year. That is going to be spread out.\n  To suggest this renewable mandate is free is not only misleading but \ntotally inaccurate.\n  Georgia Power: It is going to cost the consumers of that utility $223 \nmillion per year.\n  Out West, Hawaiian Power, far West: $22 million more a year.\n  Commonwealth Edison in Chicago: $232 million more a year.\n  Now, that is what the mandate covers. I could go on into each utility \nand break it down because we have that information. So if we recognize, \nas each Member and as each office should, the cost to the consumer and \nthe realism that the consumer is not going to be motivated to respond \nto the Members until such time as they see it on their utility bill, \nthey are going to say: Hey, what happened? Is this a surcharge? What is \nthis? This is going to be the cost associated with the renewable \nmandate.\n  Again, I think it undercuts the ability of the States to craft their \nown renewable portfolio programs and protect their consumers and \nrecognize local needs and concerns, because this is a one-size-fits-\nall.\n  I would have preferred to have seen the States have the ability to \naddress their responsibility on renewables, but the majority prevailed \nand that amendment did not carry.\n  In addition, the electric title still does not address the need for \nnew electric generation and transmission. We saw the California \nblackout situation. We saw the price spikes that occurred because there \nwas not enough power, not because there are not enough windmills in \nCalifornia. So as it currently stands, the electric title is greatly \nimproved from where it started. However, it still needs considerable \nwork.\n  I have a chart behind me, and hopefully we have a pointer, but I want \nto explain a little bit about this cost because I think it is paramount \nto the discussion. What we have over a period of time from the year \n2005 is the escalating costs per year of renewables. It basically runs, \nstarting in the year 2005, roughly $12 billion a year. So if we go from \n2005 to 2017 or 2018, the overall cost accumulated over 13 years is \nabout $88 billion. That is what it will cost. It is $12 billion, \nroughly, per year.\n\n  The red on the chart indicates the penalty payments which will cost \nan additional $12 billion. So we are looking somewhere in the area of \nroughly a $100 billion cost to the consumers as a consequence of the \nmandate of a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard being dictated by \nthe Congress of the United States.\n  Maybe many Members believe it is worth that. I don't think we should \nhave mandated this from the standpoint of one size fits all. Many \nStates have addressed the renewable matter with their own proposals. \nThat would have been much better. However, this is what the consumer \nfaces.\n  Make no mistake, when the calls start coming in, each Member's office \nhad better be prepared for an explanation of why the rates are higher \nto counter the presumption that somehow renewables are basically \navailable at no cost to the consumer.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, some remarks were made by the majority \nleader last night that I think need to be countered. I will take a \nmoment to respond to some of the statements he made last evening.\n  Last night, some members of the majority accused the Republican side \nof the aisle of attempting to filibuster the energy bill. Nothing could \nbe further from the truth. Since the debate on this issue began, we \nhave disposed of 49 amendments, 21 offered by Republicans and 27 \noffered by the Democratic side. Countless other amendments have been \nworked out off the floor with the majority, and I compliment the \nmajority leader and the chairman, Senator Bingaman, as well as the \nstaffs who have been working on these amendments.\n  Prior to the recess, the cloakroom asked for a potential list of \namendments from each side of the aisle. There were fewer than 50 \namendments on the Republican side and over double that amount on the \nDemocratic side. Republican amendments were all energy related; \nDemocratic amendments included Medicaid and voting rights.\n  Over the recess, this side of the aisle worked to pare down its list \nof amendments and is reducing it dramatically to a realistic number of \nonly a handful which should require votes. As I understand, there are \nnearly 85 to 95 amendments on the Democratic side of the aisle. The \nonly filibuster I know of is on the other side of the aisle, being \npledged by Senator Lieberman and Senator Kerry.\n  I want my colleagues to know, and the majority leader specifically, \nthat I am willing to enter into a time agreement with the majority \nleader this morning or any other time, to secure an up-down vote on the \nANWR amendment which I intend to offer later this week. Again, so my \ncolleagues understand, I am willing to enter into a time agreement with \nthe majority this morning to secure an up-down vote on the ANWR \namendment which I intend to offer later this week. I am inclined, \nunfortunately, to assume that the majority leader would not agree, but \nI offer it anyway.\n  This legislation is certainly a priority from our side of the aisle. \nIt is a priority for the administration. I am willing to stay night and \nday to get the bill done, get it to conference, and on to the President \nas soon as possible. With the issues emanating from the Middle East, \nclearly there is justification for moving as rapidly as possible. I \ndon't want anyone to be fooled by any musing that we are filibustering \nthis bill. The facts simply do not support this.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will propound a unanimous consent \nrequest in a minute, but before I do, let me indicate I think this is \nthe 15th day we have been on this bill. Frankly, we are not able to \nmove to conclude debate on this bill because we have so many Senators \nwith amendments that they are not willing to bring to the Senate floor \nto file as amendments and to call those amendments up and offer them. \nWe are not trying to keep anyone from offering an amendment, but we \nclearly need to begin to narrow down the number of amendments that are \npotentially going to be offered on this bill.\n  Let me make my unanimous consent request and see if we can get \nagreement.\n  I ask unanimous consent the list that I will send to the desk be the \nonly first-degree amendments remaining in order\n\n[[Page S2437]]\n\nto S. 517, except for any first-degree amendments which have been \noffered and laid aside; that these first-degree amendments be subject \nto relevant second-degree amendments; that upon the disposition of all \namendments, the bill be read the third time and the Senate proceed to \nthe consideration of Calendar No. 145, H.R. 4, the House-passed energy \nbill, and all after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. \n517, as amended, be inserted in lieu thereof; that the bill be advanced \nto third reading and the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill; \nthat upon passage, the Senate insist on its amendments, request a \nconference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, \nand the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the \nSenate; providing further that S. 517 be returned to the calendar, with \nthis action occurring with no further intervening action or debate.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, on behalf of the floor leader, I object at \nthis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I indicate for all Senators we will undoubtedly have to \nrenew this request later today or perhaps tomorrow.\n  We are fast approaching that point where the majority leader is going \nto have to move to other legislation. We cannot devote the entire year \non the Senate floor to consideration of an energy bill where Senators \nrefuse to offer their amendments.\n  I do not accuse anyone of filibustering, but I certainly do believe \nSenators have been slow to define precisely what they want to offer by \nthe way of amendments to bring them to the floor and to let us vote.\n  Senator Craig from Idaho has offered an amendment with which I \nstrongly disagree, with which my colleague from Wyoming strongly \ndisagrees. We are going to have a vote on that. I compliment the \nSenator from Idaho for offering an amendment and letting the Senate \nexpress its will on this important issue.\n  We will renew this unanimous consent request later today or tomorrow, \nso we put all Senators on notice that we are anxious to see their \namendments and we are anxious to conclude work on this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise to say I agree with my friend. We \ndo need to move forward. We have someone currently who is in the \nprocess. Hopefully, we can do it in a little later time.\n  I observe also there are a whole list of amendments on both sides. \nThis is not a partisan issue. We need to move forward.\n  Further, let me comment a little on the remarks of the Senator from \nAlaska. I certainly agree with him. I am delighted he is in support of \nmaintaining this electricity title. He does mention he thinks there \nneeds to be some change in this renewable aspect which is in this \ntitle. I do not argue with that, but I certainly do not think that \nought to keep us moving forward with our general approach in \nelectricity. If there were to be an amendment--there are amendments \nfiled that would deal with that specifically. We should do that. But \nthat ought not be the criterion for us eliminating the things that will \nhelp us move forward with the electric title.\n  I have had occasion in past years to work quite closely on \nelectricity and energy. I am very anxious that we do move towards \nmodernizing the system. For example, we need to move towards more \ntransmission in a State such as Wyoming where we have the highest \nproduction of coal of any State in the country. Coal is one of our best \nsources, of course. However, if you have mine-mouth generation, which \nis the most efficient, then you have to have a way to get it to market.\n  Clearly, there are things we need to do. But, clearly, we cannot \nwait. We have to get going and move on and begin to really deal with an \nissue that is difficult. I have been around here a while. I talked a \nlot about electricity. I have been on the committee. Also, as I said, I \nworked on this in the private sector. It is very complicated and for \neverything you seek to do, there are different views, and I understand \nthat.\n\n  But as the President said and the administration said, it is time to \nmove forward and make some progress. There will be other ideas. There \nwill be other bills. There will be other hearings. There will be other \nconsiderations. But we have the basis here for moving more of the \nauthority to the States. We have the basis here for making it less \ncomplicated. We have the basis for moving forward toward making it a \nmore modern system. By trying to do away with that title, we remove the \nprogress we are making. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to speak on the amendment, but I \nask unanimous consent to first devote 5 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Wellstone are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, Brian Baenig works for me. He does \ngreat work for me. He is on the floor. I might not get a chance to \nspeak again. Brian is working up some great talking points for me. I \ncould be more specific. I apologize. I wish to spell out my position on \nthis amendment.\n  First of all, I said to the Senator from New Mexico before that I \nwould try not to get into too much of the sort of flowery oratory where \nit seems as if it is insincere. I think he is probably one of the best \nMembers of the Senate and is very substantive. He rarely speaks without \na whole lot of knowledge. But I don't agree with him about an amendment \nthat was agreed to by a quick unanimous consent basically repealing \nPUHCA. I think it was a big mistake. I would like to see at least FERC \nbeef it up so we make sure we have some protection against more \nmergers, vis-a-vis more acquisitions, and more monopoly power. I don't \nwish to see just a few companies dominating these markets. I think it \nis very much to the detriment of ordinary citizens and consumers.\n  The problem with the Craig amendment is--and the reason I am not \ngoing to support it, and I will come back with an amendment to try to \ndeal with where I think we still have some gap. I know that there are \nsome provisions in the bill that try to maintain the consumer \nprotection. But with the PUHCA repeal, I think we have some big gaps. I \nwould like to come back with an amendment to fill some of those.\n  But I can't support this amendment. This amendment basically repeals \nthe whole section of the bill. Albeit, I would rather have 20 percent, \nbut somewhere around 10 percent or 8.5 percent on a renewable portfolio \nfor electricity is really important. That is very important for my \nState of Minnesota.\n  I was in East Grand Forks the other day. You should never do these \ncafe visits--I am being facetious--because there is no control. People \nshow up. There might be television. You never know what people are \ngoing to say to you. You might not like what they say. That is probably \nwhy it is the best place to be. It is certainly not controllable.\n  This one farmer wanted to debate me about ANWR: We should be drilling \nfor oil. I said: We are in Minnesota. What are you talking about oil \nfor? We are not oil rich. We don't produce any oil. As a matter of \nfact, we are a cold-weather State. When we import oil and natural gas, \nwe export our dollars. We export over $10 billion a year. But we are \nrich in wind.\n  I was at Dan Jewels' Woodstock wind farm. It is incredible. There is \nso much excitement in farm country and rural Minnesota about wind, \nabout biomass, about electricity, about renewable fuels, that portfolio \nabout saving energy, efficient energy use, clean technology, small \nbusinesses, more jobs; keep capital in communities and be respectful of \nthe environment; don't keep barreling down the same old fossil fuel \npath; we don't need more global warming.\n  I come from a State where we love the outdoors. We don't need more \nwarnings, if you are a woman expecting a child, about being very \ncareful when eating walleye--a great eating fish, by the way--from our \nlakes; or, if you have small children, you should be careful. It is \noutrageous--air toxins, mercury poisons, acid rain. We don't need more \nof it.\n  There is a baby step in the bill. Senator Bingaman has done a \nmasterful\n\n[[Page S2438]]\n\njob of trying to deal with lots of different viewpoints and politics. \nOne person's solution is another person's horror. People just have \ndifferent views.\n  But for my part, I don't want to completely eliminate this renewable \nportfolio for electricity. It is too important for my State.\n\n  I can't vote for this amendment. I think it would be a mistake. I \nhope it will be defeated. I hope we can do something about figuring out \nperhaps just some stronger consumer provision in relation to the PUHCA \nrepeal.\n  I will finish by saying we will come back to this. We will come back \nto this again if there is an amendment out here for oil drilling in \nANWR. It will be the same issue. I don't even think the debate is \nwhether or not it is only 6 months of oil or whether or not it is not \nrecoverable for 10 years. I know all of those statistics. I think it is \nsimply a matter of another issue, which is, what path we want to go \ndown. I think we have a different path now before us, a different \nfuture. Renewables is part of it. I don't want to repeal this whole \nsection because it is too darned important to my State of Minnesota. I \nam not just being Mr. Politician. I also happen to think it is too \nimportant for our country.\n  Every time somebody comes to the floor and says, my God, the Middle \nEast; now we should drill for oil in ANWR, or do this or that, it is as \nif we have no other alternative. We have a lot of alternatives. \nProbably about 80 percent of the people in the country agree. I think \nthe big problem is some of the oil producer interests still have lots \nof power.\n  I do not think we should eliminate the whole section. I think the \nCraig amendment is mistaken for that reason. I think my colleague from \nIdaho is right to address the problems with PUHCA but wrong to also \neliminate some very good work, albeit a small start that Senator \nBingaman and others have done, and of which I am very proud.\n  There are two things which are important for me: Renewable portfolio \nelectricity, and also the renewable fuels part, which I think for all \nof us is a win-win.\n  I will support the chairman of the Energy Committee in opposition to \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Craig \namendment No. 3047 be set aside, to recur at 1:45 p.m.; that the time \nbetween 1:45 and 2 p.m. be for debate with respect to that amendment \nprior to a vote in relation to the amendment, and that no second-degree \namendment be in order to the amendment prior to a vote in relation to \nthe amendment, with the time equally divided and controlled in the \nusual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I call attention this afternoon to an \narticle that appeared in the New York Times. It is entitled ``The \nMissing Energy Strategy.'' I want to quote it. The paper details what \nthey describe as: Washington's sorry failure to devise a balanced \nstrategy to reduce America's reliance on gulf imports and give itself \ngreater maneuvering room in the war on terrorism and other foreign \npolicy issues as well.\n  I think the paper is correct. We desperately need to reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil and free ourselves from the dangerous \ninfluence that leaders such as Saddam Hussein have over the future of \nAmerican families.\n  Let me refer to the New York Times specifically because they have a \nmixed message on relief. They are criticizing Washington's sorry \nfailure to devise a balanced strategy to reduce America's reliance on \ngulf imports.\n  This chart shows a chronology of the editorial position of the New \nYork Times over time. In 1987, they said:\n\n       Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge . . . the most \n     promising untapped source of oil in North America.\n\n  They further state:\n\n       A decade ago, precautions in the design and construction of \n     the 1,000-mile-long Alaska pipeline saved the land from \n     serious damage. They are quite specific. They say that \n     ``precautions in the design saved the land from serious \n     damage.''\n\n  They further state:\n\n       If oil companies, government agencies and environmentalists \n     approach the development of the refuge with comparable care, \n     disaster should be avoidable.\n\n  They acknowledge, if you will, that we completed an 800-mile pipeline \nfrom the Arctic Ocean to Valdez. They say 1,000 miles, but it is \nobviously less than that. The significance of that is the \nacknowledgment that it was done safely. It is now about 28 years old. \nIt continues to be one of the construction wonders of the world and \ncontinues to supply this Nation with about 20 percent of the total \ncrude oil produced by the United States. The New York Times, obviously, \nsupported that.\n  Then in an editorial in June of 1988, they said:\n\n       . . . the potential is enormous and the environmental risks \n     are modest . . . the likely value of the oil far exceeds \n     plausible estimates of the environmental cost.\n       . . . the total acreage affected by development represents \n     only a fraction of 1 percent of the North Slope wilderness.\n\n  Then they further state:\n\n       . . . But it is hard to see why absolutely pristine \n     preservation of this remote wilderness should take precedence \n     over the nation's energy needs.\n  Let me repeat that. They say:\n\n       . . . But it is hard to see why absolutely pristine \n     preservation of this remote wilderness should take precedence \n     over the nation's energy needs.\n\n  Then March 30, 1989, they say:\n\n       . . . Alaskan oil is too valuable to leave in the ground\n       . . . The single most promising source of oil in America \n     lies on the north coast of Alaska, a few hundred miles east \n     of the big fields at Prudhoe Bay.\n\n  They are talking about ANWR:\n\n       . . . The single most promising source of oil in America \n     lies on the north coast of Alaska, a few hundred miles east \n     of the big fields at Prudhoe Bay.\n  Furthermore:\n\n       . . . Washington can't afford to treat the [Exxon Valdez] \n     accident as a reason for fencing off what may be the last \n     great oilfield in the nation.\n\n   Here they are in 1987, in 1988, and again in 1989. One would assume \nthe New York Times would be consistent. As I indicated in their \neditorial of yesterday, they said:\n\n       Washington's sorry failure to devise a balanced strategy to \n     reduce America's reliance on Gulf imports and give itself \n     greater maneuvering room in the war on terrorism and other \n     foreign policy issues as well.\n  Madam President, as we look at where we are today and recognize the \ntremendous vulnerability this Nation has undertaken as a consequence of \nincreasing our dependence on imported oil, and we realize that within \nthe last few days with the announcement by Saddam Hussein that he will \nterminate for 30 days oil production from Iraq and then with the \nfollowup activity in Venezuela by PDVSA, which is a government-owned \noil company, that has gone on strike, this Nation is now devoid of 30 \npercent of its total oil imports.\n\n[[Page S2439]]\n\n  If we add up what we get from Saddam Hussein, Iraq, nearly 1 million \nbarrels a day, plus the production from Venezuela, that constitutes 30 \npercent--Madam President, 30 percent--of this country's imported oil.\n  Where are we going to pick up the difference? It is interesting \nbecause the Saudis have indicated they have unused capacity. So the \nSaudis are preparing, at least we understand, to make up the \ndifference. I wonder how that is going to set with the Arab world. I \nwonder how that is going to set with Iran, Libya, and clearly Saddam \nHussein.\n  Furthermore, isn't it rather ironic that on the one hand we find \nourselves dealing with a nation such as Iraq, a nation where we have \nbeen, for all practical purposes, in a standoff enforcing a no-fly zone \nsince 1992. We have maintained almost what would be compared to an \naerial blockade. We have put the lives of our men and women at risk \nsince 1992. We have bombed Iraq three times already this year. He has \nattempted to take our aircraft down. We have put the lives of our men \nand women at risk.\n  The quid pro quo for that is an inconsistency in foreign policy. On \nthe one hand, we import his oil, we put it in our planes and bomb him, \nand he takes our money and keeps his Republican Guard alive and \ndevelops weapons of mass destruction and aims them at our ally Israel. \nHe may have biological weapons. He clearly has a delivery system.\n  Then where are we with our relationship with the United Nations? We \nhad an understanding in the U.N. Oil for Food Program that we would \nhave inspectors in Iraq and we would be able to observe just what \nSaddam Hussein was up to. We have not had any inspectors there for over \n2 \\1/2\\ years. As a consequence, we are left with the reality that we \nreally do not know what he has.\n  Let's take this chronology a little further. We had reason to believe \nthat terrorism was a threat to the United States. We had some reason to \nbelieve that al-Qaida, Afghanistan, and bin Laden were potential \nthreats to our Nation, but we do not have any solid evidence that they \nwere about to undertake those events on September 11, events which \nutilized for the first time an aircraft as a weapon.\n  We see this pattern unfolding where clearly had we had the \nintelligence, we might have been able to intervene in preventing that \ndisaster that changed America.\n  Do we have the same exposure, the same potential with Saddam Hussein? \nIf he is developing weapons of mass destruction, as we have every \nreason to believe he is, the question is, When is he going to use them \nand who is he going to use them on?\n  Let's take this a little further as we advance the realities of just \nwhat Saddam Hussein is up to. He has announced he is going to increase \nfrom $10,000 to $25,000 the payment to survivors of anyone who, as a \ntarget of terrorism, gives up their lives to take out other lives \nassociated with the activities in Israel. He will pay that family \n$25,000.\n  That is certainly an incentive for those willing to give up their \nlives and make a sacrifice in their religious belief associated with \nconsideration or payment for taking the lives of other individuals.\n  What is funding that? Where does Saddam Hussein get the money to pay \nsurvivors of those who initiate an action taking their own lives and \ntaking the lives of many others? It is obvious. It comes from oil. That \nis the cashflow that Saddam Hussein has, and every time we go to the \npump, we are adding to Saddam Hussein's cashflow indirectly because \nwhile Saddam Hussein is initiating the export from Iraq of about 1.1 \nmillion barrels a day, it is the fastest growing source of United \nStates oil imports. So American families are counting on Saddam Hussein \nfor energy, and in so counting on Saddam Hussein, we are basically \nfurthering the incentive for those who want to sacrifice their lives to \ninitiate a terrorist attack such as using themselves as a human bomb.\n  Maybe I am missing something, but I do not know what it is, and \nnobody has pointed it out to me specifically.\n  Going back to the New York Times, there was a recommendation back in \n1987, 1988, and 1989, and today we have a criticism from the New York \nTimes that Washington is a sorry failure because we have not devised a \nbalanced strategy.\n  The current position of the New York Times is contrary to that as \nexpressed in editorials of March of 2001 and January of 2001, and it is \nrather ironic. I will share the current position as late as March of \nlast year and in January of last year. I quote from the January 1 New \nYork Times: The country needs a rational energy strategy but the first \nstep in that strategy should not be to start punching holes in the \nArctic Refuge.\n  Finally, as this page has noted many times before, the relative \ntrivial amounts of recoverable oil in the refuge cannot possibly \njustify the potential corruption of a unique and irreplaceable natural \narea.\n  They say the ``relative trivial amounts.'' What are we talking about? \nDoes anybody know how much oil is in ANWR? If we look at this large \nchart, we can get somewhat of a picture and get an understanding \nbecause over in the black there is this 800-mile pipeline. That \ninfrastructure is already in place. It was built in the 1970s. That \nparticular pipeline, when Prudhoe Bay was operating at full capacity, \nwas about 2 million barrels a day. Today it is a little over a million \nbarrels a day. So the capacity for increased oil development is clearly \nthere.\n  This is the ANWR area. It is 19 million acres. It is the size of the \nState of South Carolina. It is a very large piece of real estate. This \nis the area that is in question because out of this 19 million acres, \nthis is the only area that Congress has the authority to open because \nthe rest of the area is in two classes. One is a wilderness and the \nother is a wildlife refuge. There is 8.5 million acres in a wilderness \nset aside in perpetuity, and that is this light color. The darker buff \ncolor is a refuge, and that is about 9 million acres. This 1.5 million \nacres is what is at risk, and the New York Times now says the \n``relative trivial amounts of recoverable oil.''\n  We may have some indication of what amount of oil there might be, but \nit is a guess because the geologists have never been allowed into this \narea and they have never been able to determine through the 3D seismic \nwhat this area might contain. They have estimates based upon 2D \ngeological advanced efforts prior to 1980, but we do know we have a new \ntechnology that makes the footprint smaller. I might add, this came out \nof the New York Times. This is their science. This gives an idea of the \nnew technology. When one used to drill, they drilled straight down and \neither hit or did not hit. With 3D seismic and directional drilling, \nthe footprint from one well can be many derivatives. One could poke out \nhere through directional drilling, down here, or down here, pick up all \nof these other areas, which makes the latest drilling technology \napplicable to reduce environmental damage.\n\n  The technology that is used is very different. We use ice drills, and \nI will show a picture of that in a minute, but before I do, I want to \ntake this chart down because I want to reflect a little bit on the \nissue of trivial amounts. All we know is that the estimate of reserves \nis between 3.5 and 16 billion barrels. That is what the USGS has \nindicated, somewhere in between. How do we relate to that? The only way \nwe can relate to it is in comparison to what we have produced in \nPrudhoe Bay.\n  Prudhoe Bay has been online 27 years. Its production was estimated to \nbe 10 billion barrels. That was all. Today it is producing its 13 \nbillionth barrel. It is still producing a million barrels a day. It is \nstill the largest producing field in the United States.\n  So if we say Prudhoe Bay was supposed to be 10 billion and it is now \n13 billion, the reason it is still producing at a high rate is the new \ntechnology that did not exist 27 years ago for oil recovery. So they \nare getting greater utilization out of the field.\n  Back to what this trivial amount might be, 3.5 to 16 billion. If it \nis in the middle, it is as big as Prudhoe Bay. That would be 10 billion \nbarrels. How big was Prudhoe Bay? Twenty-five percent of our total \ncrude oil production for the last 27 years.\n  So I did a little press report today on the so-called reserves. One \nof my friends from the State of Oregon indicated it was only a 6-month \nsupply. I\n\n[[Page S2440]]\n\nhad thought we had put that argument to rest. A 6-month supply is what \nsome of those on the other side have indicated is what this reserve is. \nWell, okay, let us look at it. If this reserve is somewhere between 3.5 \nand 16 billion barrels, and let us say it is 10, and they say it is a \n6-month supply, then what is Prudhoe Bay? It was supposed to be 10. Now \nit is 13. Was it a 6-month supply? No. It has been producing for 27 \nyears, producing 25 percent of the total crude oil produced in the \nUnited States.\n  This 6-month supply is only valid--and I wish my colleagues on the \nother side who want to debate this issue would debate it from a factual \nand not a misleading point of view that is promulgated by America's \nextreme environmental lobby. If there were no oil produced in the \nUnited States and no oil imported, why, then, it might be a 6-month \nsupply, but that is not a feasible or conceivable argument.\n  We have a response to the New York Times that it is a trivial amount, \ncompared to their former statement that ``it is the most promising \nuntapped source of oil.'' That was April 1987; 1988, ``the potential is \nenormous''; March 30, 1989, ``Alaskan oil is too valuable to leave in \nthe ground.''\n  What the editorial board of the New York Times does obviously is \ntheir business. I talked with them about it. It was a rather \ninteresting conversation, as a matter of fact. They said they have a \nnew editorial editor and the former one went to California. I suppose \nthat is a reasonable explanation.\n  My colleagues should know what they said in March of 2000:\n\n       Mr. Murkowski's stated purpose is to reduce the Nation's \n     use of foreign oil from 56 to 50 percent partly through tax \n     breaks.\n\n  Obviously, they think tax breaks is a motivation. They further say:\n\n       But mainly by opening up more tracts of land for \n     exploration, the centerpiece of that strategy in turn is to \n     open up the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife for \n     exploration. This page has addressed the folly of trespassing \n     on a wildlife preserve for what by official estimates is \n     likely to be a modest amount of recoverable oil.\n\n  Boy, isn't that the way things go. One minute they are with you and \nthe next minute they are against you.\n  What were they thinking in 1987 when they said it was a promising \nsource of untapped source of oil? Or where were they when they said \npotential is enormous or risks are modest? Or where were they when they \nsaid Alaskan oil is too valuable to leave in the ground?\n  Today, they say:\n\n       . . . Washington's sorry failure to devise a balanced \n     strategy to reduce America's reliance on gulf imports and \n     give itself greater maneuvering room in the war on terrorism \n     and other foreign policy issues as well.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the editorials of April 23, 1987, June 2, \n1988, and March 30, 1989, when they supported it, as well as today's \nnewspaper saying we are a sorry failure because we have not devised a \nstrategy to reduce our dependence, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 10, 2002]\n\n                      The Missing Energy Strategy\n\n       The events of the past year--prominently, a power crisis in \n     California and the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11--gave the \n     nation many reasons to re-examine its energy strategy. Now \n     comes another: Saddam Hussein's decision to halt oil imports \n     to the United States, at least temporarily, in retaliation \n     for Washington's support of Israel.\n       In an interview with The Wall Street Journal earlier this \n     week, President Bush warned that the recent 20 percent jump \n     in oil prices could threaten economic recovery. While Iraq \n     accounts for about 8 percent of America's imports, according \n     to Washington's estimates, there is spare oil capacity in the \n     system, and thus there should be no petroleum shortage if \n     other Middle Eastern producers refuse to follow Baghdad. Even \n     so, Mr. Hussein's action draws attention once again to \n     America's dependence on imported oil, including oil supplied \n     by the troubled countries of the Persian Gulf. It also points \n     to Washington's sorry failure to devise a balanced strategy \n     to reduce America's reliance on gulf imports and give itself \n     greater maneuvering room in the war on terrorism and other \n     foreign policy issues as well. The Senate, which has resumed \n     debate on the energy bill, is the last hope for such a \n     strategy. Admittedly, the prospects are dimmer than they were \n     a month ago, when the Senate took up an imperfect but \n     honorable measure cobbled together by Jeff Bingaman of New \n     Mexico and Tom Daschle, the majority leader. The bill \n     included a mix of incentives for new production of fossil \n     fuels, largely natural gas, along with provisions aimed at \n     increasing energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy \n     sources. As such it stood in stark contrast to a grievously \n     one-sided House bill that provided $27 billion in incentives \n     for the oil, gas and coal industries and less than one-\n     quarter that amount for efficiency. The House bill also \n     authorized the opening of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \n     to oil exploration and drilling.\n       On its first big test, however, the Senate collapsed under \n     industry and union pressure and rejected a provision \n     requiring the first increase in fuel economy standards since \n     1985. To Mr. Daschle's dismay, Democrats deserted the cause \n     of fuel conservation in droves; New York's senators, Charles \n     Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton, were among the honorable \n     exceptions. The only bright moment in a dismal two weeks of \n     debate and defeat was the approval of a ``renewable portfolio \n     standard'' that would require utilities to generate between 5 \n     and 10 percent of their power from wind, solar and other \n     forms of renewable energy.\n       There are several things the Democrats and their moderate \n     Republican allies can do to produce a respectable bill. \n     First, they must defeat any amendment aimed at opening the \n     Arctic refuge to drilling. Such an amendment is almost \n     certain to be offered by Frank Murkowski of Alaska, but the \n     facts are not on his side. Every available calculation--\n     including those that accept Mr. Murkowski's inflated \n     estimates of the amount of oil underneath the refuge--show \n     that much more oil can be saved by fuel efficiency than by \n     drilling.\n       Next, they must resist efforts to weaken the renewable \n     energy provision, while defending energy efficiency measures \n     that have yet to be voted on--chiefly a provision that would \n     increase efficiency standards for air-conditioners by 30 \n     percent. The Senate should also preserve a useful provision \n     that would require companies to give a public accounting of \n     their production of carbon dioxide and other so-called \n     greenhouse gases. On the supply side, it can take steps to \n     improve the reliability of the nationwide electricity grid, \n     while increasing incentives for smaller and potentially more \n     efficient producers of power.\n       These are modest measures, less ambitious than the Senate's \n     original agenda. But at least they point in the right \n     direction, toward a strategy that includes conservation as \n     well as production.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 23, 1987]\n\n                    In Alaska: Drill, But With Care\n\n       Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is an untouched \n     and fragile place that supports rare mammals and myriad \n     species of birds. It is also the most promising untapped \n     source of oil in North America. Should America drill for it?\n       What Congress decided, in 1980, was not to decide. It \n     ordered a long study. The assessment is now in, and for \n     Interior Secretary Hodel the decision isn't even close: \n     leasing drilling rights to oil companies is ``vital to our \n     national security'' because it ``would reduce America's \n     dependence on unstable sources of foreign oil.''\n       Mr. Hodel is guilt of oversell. A single discovery can't \n     save us from increasing dependence on Persian Gulf oil. But \n     the potential economic benefit of development--perhaps tens \n     of billions of dollars of oil--outweighs the risks. The \n     unanswered question is whether environmentalists and \n     developers can cooperate to minimize damage to the refuge.\n       The Interior Department estimates that between 600 million \n     and 9.2 billion barrels of oil are recoverable from a 20-by-\n     100-mile strip along the Arctic coast. But no matter how \n     carefully done, development of the coastal strip would \n     displace animals and scar land permanently. Tracks of \n     vehicles that crossed the tundra decades ago are still \n     visible. No one knows whether the caribou herd that bears its \n     young near the coast would stop reproducing or simply move \n     elsewhere.\n       Adversaries in this battle view development as ecological \n     catastrophe or energy salvation. Outsiders can wonder why \n     such apocalyptic fuss. An unusual environment would surely be \n     damaged, but the amount of land involved is modest and the \n     animals at risk are not endangered species. A lot of oil \n     might be pumped, but probably not enough to keep America's \n     motors running for an entire year. Ultimately, policy makers \n     must weigh the dollar value of the oil against the intangible \n     value of an unspoiled refuge.\n       The most likely net value of the oil, after accounting for \n     costs and assuming a future world price of $33 a barrel, is \n     about $15 billion.\n       How much an untouched refuge is worth is anyone's guess--\n     but it's hard to see how it could realistically be judged \n     worth such an enormous sum. If America had an extra $15 \n     billion to spend on wilderness protection, it wouldn't be \n     spent on this one sliver of land.\n       That doesn't mean, however, that developers should be \n     permitted to treat the refuge as another Bayonne. Elaborate, \n     necessarily expensive precautions are needed to contain the \n     disruption. Human and machine presence can and should be kept \n     to a bare minimum until test wells are completed. Dense \n     caribou calving grounds should be left alone until the \n     animals' response to change is gauged.\n       A decade ago, precautions in the design and construction of \n     the 1,000-mile-long Alaska pipeline saved the land from \n     serious damage. If oil companies, government agencies\n\n[[Page S2441]]\n\n     and environmentalists approach the development of the refuge \n     with comparable care, disaster should be avoidable.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 2, 1988]\n\n                       Risks Worth Taking for Oil\n\n       Can Big Oil and its Government regulators be trusted with \n     the fragile environment of Alaska's Arctic Wildlife Refuge? \n     Congress, pressed by the Reagan Administration to allow \n     exploratory drilling in what maybe North America's last great \n     oil reserve, has been wrestling with the question for years. \n     Then, last month, opponents' skepticism was heightened by a \n     leaked report from the Fish and Wildlife Service saying that \n     environmental disruption in the nearby North Slope oil fields \n     is far worse than originally believed.\n       The North Slope development has been America's biggest test \n     by far of the proposition that it is possible to balance \n     energy needs with sensitivity for the environment. The public \n     therefore deserves an independent assessment of the \n     ecological risks and an honest assessment of the energy \n     rewards.\n       No one wants to ruin a wilderness for small gain. But in \n     this case, the potential is enormous and the environmental \n     risks are modest. Even if the report's findings are \n     confirmed, the likely value of the oil far exceeds plausible \n     estimates of the environmental cost.\n       The amount of oil that could be recovered from the Wildlife \n     Refuge is not known. But it seems likely that the coastal \n     plain, representing a small part of the acreage in the \n     refuge, contains several billion barrels, worth tens of \n     billions of dollars. But drilling is certain to disrupt the \n     delicate ecology of the Arctic tundra.\n       Some members of Congress believe that no damage at all is \n     acceptable. But most are ready to accept a little \n     environmental degradation in return for a lot of oil. Hence \n     the relevance of the experience at Prudhoe Bay, which now \n     yields 20 percent of total U.S. oil production. Last year, \n     Representative George Miller, a California Democrat and \n     opponent of drilling within the refuge, asked the Fish and \n     Wildlife Service to compare the environmental impact \n     predicted in 1972 for Prudhoe Bay with the actual impact. The \n     report from the local field office, never released by the \n     Administration, offers a long list of effects, ranging from \n     birds displaced to tons of nitrous oxide released into the \n     air.\n       According to the authors, development used more land, \n     damaged more habitat acreage and generated more effluent than \n     originally predicted. The authors also argue that Government \n     monitoring efforts and assessment of long-term effects have \n     been inadequate.\n       It's important to find out whether these interpretations \n     are sensible and how environmental oversight could be \n     improved. The General Accounting Office, a creature of \n     Congress, is probably the most credible agency to do the job.\n       But even taken at face value, the report's findings hardly \n     justify putting oil exploration on hold.\n       No species is reported to be endangered. No dramatic \n     permanent changes in ecology are forecast. Much of the \n     unpredicted damage has arisen because more oil has been \n     produced than originally predicted. Even so, the total \n     acreage affected by development represents only a fraction of \n     1 percent of the North Slope wilderness.\n       The trade-off between energy and ecology seems unchanged. \n     If another oil field on the scale of Prudhoe Bay is \n     discovered, developing it will damage the environment. That \n     damage is worth minimizing. But it is hard to see why \n     absolutely pristine preservation of this remote wilderness \n     should take precedence over the nation's energy needs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 30, 1989]\n\n                  Oil on the Water, Oil in the Ground\n\n       Does the Exxon tanker spill show that Arctic oil shipping \n     is being mismanaged? Should the industry have been better \n     prepared to cope with the accident? Should the spill deflect \n     President Bush from his plan to open more of Alaska to oil \n     exploration?\n       Six days after the Exxon Valdez dumped 240,000 barrels of \n     crude into the frigid waters of Prince William Sound, \n     questions come more easily than answers. But it is not too \n     early to distinguish between the issue of regulation and the \n     broader question of exploiting energy resources in the \n     Arctic. The accident shouldn't change one truth: Alaskan oil \n     is too valuable to leave in the ground.\n       Exxon has much to explain. The tanker captain has a history \n     of alcohol abuse. The officer in charge of the vessel at the \n     time of the spill was not certified to navigate in the sound. \n     THe company's cleanup efforts have been woefully ineffective. \n     Local industries, notably fishing, face potentially \n     disastrous consequences, and the Government needs to hold the \n     company to its promise to pay. More important, Washington has \n     an obligation to impose and enforce rules strict enough to \n     reduce the risks of another spill.\n       That said, it's worth putting the event in perspective. \n     Before last Friday, tens of thousands of tanker runs from \n     Valdez has been completed without a serious mishap. Alaska \n     now pumps two million barrels through the pipeline each day. \n     And it would be almost unthinkable to restrict access to one-\n     fourth of the nation's total oil production.\n       The far tougher question is whether the accident is \n     sufficient reason to slow exploration for additional oil in \n     the Arctic. The single most promising source of oil in \n     America lies on the north coast of Alaska, a few hundred \n     miles east of the big fields at Prudhoe Bay. But this remote \n     tundra is part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and \n     since 1980 Congress has been trying to decide whether to \n     allow exploratory drilling.\n       Environmental organizations have long opposed such \n     exploration, arguing that the ecology of the refuge is both \n     unusual and fragile. This week they used the occasion of the \n     tanker spill to call for further delays while the damage from \n     the Exxon Valdez spill is assessed.\n       More information is always better than less. But long delay \n     would have a cost, too: Prudhoe Bay production will begin to \n     tail off in the mid-1990's. If exploration is permitted in \n     the refuge and little oil is found, development will never \n     take place and damage to the environment will be \n     insignificant. If development does prove worthwhile, the \n     process will undoubtedly degrade the environment. But the \n     compensation will be a lot of badly needed fuel.\n       Environmentalists counter that, at most, the refuge will \n     add one year's supply to America's reserves. They are right, \n     but one year of oil is a lot of oil. The 3.2 billion barrels, \n     if found, would be worth about $60 billion at today's prices, \n     enough to generate at least $10 billion in royalties for \n     Alaska and the Federal Government. By denying access to it, \n     Congress would be saying implicitly that the absolute purity \n     of the refuge was worth at least as much as the forgone $10 \n     billion.\n       Put it another way. Suppose the royalties were dedicated to \n     buying and maintaining parkland in the rest of the nation--a \n     not unthinkable legislative option. Would Americans really \n     want to pass by, say, $10 billion worth of land in order to \n     prevent oil companies from covering a few thousand acres of \n     the Arctic with roads, drilling pads and pipelines?\n       Washington can't afford to assume that the Exxon Valdez \n     accident was a freak that will never happen again. But \n     neither can it afford to treat the accident as a reason for \n     fencing off what may be the last great oilfield in the \n     nation.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would like to have an explanation from the New York \nTimes, as a consequence of where they were in 1987 and 1998 and 1999 \nand in 2001 being against it and now they are critical when we are \ntrying to do something about it. Yet they don't accept the \nresponsibility of proposing a way to reduce that dependence.\n  I believe we need to reduce our dependence, free ourselves from the \nSaddam Husseins.\n  We have talked about CAFE standards. Do you know what the debate on \nCAFE standards was all about? It was about safety. We could have \nincreased mileage, but we were concerned about the safety of our \nautomobiles in relationship to families moving our children. We were \nready to trade off. And we did, by majority vote, increase CAFE \nstandards with the belief that we would be stripped of some of the \nsafety features. The indication was we would lose hundreds, perhaps \nthousands of lives.\n  As we address where we are today, we ought to look at some of the \nfacts. We saw an article that appeared in the USGS about 10 days ago \nindicating if we opened up this area, somehow we would risk the \nPorcupine caribou. Another chart shows caribou relative to the \nrenewability of what amounts to a natural resource. This is the caribou \nfrolicking in Prudhoe Bay. The reason they are frolicking is nobody \nshoots them. They become very accustomed to a modest amount of activity \nas long as they are not threatened. If they hear the snow machines, \nthey bolt like cattle on a rampage.\n  This is the western herd. It is the herd that frequents the oilfields \nof Prudhoe Bay. The important thing to recognize with this herd is they \nhave grown dramatically from 3,000 animals to 26,000 animals. There are \nfew predators and very few wolves. As a consequence, the herd has grown \ndramatically.\n  The Porcupine herd is in a different part of the State. I will show \nthe migration pattern of this herd. It bears some semblance to reality. \nMy critics who say USGS indicated in its report that the caribou might \nbe affected by oil activity did not reflect on a knowledge of certain \nmigratory movements of this particular Porcupine herd.\n  This chart shows the boundary between the United States and Canada. \nWe can see the northwest territories. This happens to be a Canadian \nhighway called the Dempster Highway. This is the general path of the \nmigration of the Porcupine caribou herd in purple. It goes into the \n1002 area. The point is there is no fence between Canada and Alaska.\n  In their migratory path they cross the highway. The highest incidence \nof\n\n[[Page S2442]]\n\nthe mortality of this particular herd is crossing the Dempster Highway, \nnot getting hit by trucks and cars. That is where the people hunt. That \nis where they take them. They are very easy to get through. Drive the \nhighway.\n  This is the Arctic Highway. It is pretty rugged, but it is \naccessible. If you are concerned about the effect on the caribou, \nconsider the number of caribou taken for subsistence and other reasons \nin that area. They come in the summertime and calf. The question is, Do \nthey calf in the 1002 area, the area where we have at risk, the \npotential of caribou that might be lost as a result of calving?\n  We have a chart that shows, over a period from 1983 to 2000, the \ngeneral calving area. Green is the calving area. This chart was put \ntogether by the Department of Interior. This is the 1002 area. This is \nwhat is at risk. In 1999, there was some calving in the area; some \ncalving in the area in other years. The good news is there will not be \nany activity there during that time.\n  Let me show you what the area looks like for about 10\\1/2\\ months of \nthe year. It is a harsh environment of ice and snow with virtually no \nwildlife activity in this severe time. This is generally a fair picture \nof the Arctic Coastal Plain in the 1002 area in the wintertime. This \nhappens to be a clear day in the wintertime. To see what it looks like \nmost of the time in the winter with what is called whiteouts, where you \nhave absolutely no relationship between the snow and the clouds, it \nlooks just white. Pilots fly into it only on instruments because you \ncannot see the ground.\n  If you turn the picture back you can see what it looks like on a \nclear day, which is not most of the time. On a clear day, there is a \ndifference between the ground and the sky. When it is a whiteout \ncondition, cloudy and snowy, it is all white. There are a lot of flying \naccidents when people lose their horizon and are not proficient on \ninstruments.\n  As we consider the debate and recognize we have specialized \ntechnology now--development occurs only in the wintertime--we can put \naside some of the USGS estimate that somehow we are going to have a \nsignificant impact. This activity is only going to occur in the \nwintertime. When the short summer comes up--and it looks somewhat like \nthis photo. This is the tundra. This is a well that was drilled. As you \ncan see, there are no roads because we use ice roads. There will be no \nactivity during the time that the caribou calve in this area.\n\n  Then, of course, we have the continued debate as to the validity of \none report vis-a-vis another report. The USGS confirmed this week that \nthe caribou would not be affected by exploration because the House \nbill, which is what is before the Senate, only allows 2,000 acres out \nof 19 million acres to be developed.\n  As we debate this issue on the energy bill, even though we have not \noffered the amendment, I did want to reflect a little bit on the New \nYork Times' inconsistency. On the one hand, they supported it in 1978 \nand 1979, and then rejected it in 2001, and now are criticizing the \nCongress for not coming up with some methodology to reduce our \ndependence on imports.\n  If you are going to reduce it, you might as well go where you are \nmost likely to find a substantial reserve of oil and that happens to be \nthis area of Alaska. For those who say this is some kind of a pristine \narea, where there has been no development of any kind, let me remind \nyou there is a village there. It is the village of Kaktovik. Real \npeople live there. There are kids there. This is a little community \nhall. There are about 300 kids there. There are people who live there. \nThey are on the snow machine there. We have some other pictures of the \nvillage itself.\n  This will give you some idea. This is in the 1002. This is Kaktovik. \nThere are people who live there. There is an airstrip there, a radar \nstation, a school. Here are some kids going to school in the morning. \nNobody shovels their snow. These are happy kids, looking forward to a \nfuture.\n  What is that future? Does anybody around here know what a honey \nbucket is? A honey bucket is what you have when you don't have indoor \nplumbing and you need indoor plumbing because outdoor plumbing doesn't \nwork in the wintertime. You and I and everybody else, we are used to \nwater, sewer, the conveniences. These people have the same dreams and \naspirations. How do they achieve those dreams and aspirations? By a \nbetter lifestyle, by a tax base, by jobs, by opportunities. Do these \npeople support opening this area? I think we all know the answer to \nthat. The answer is a very affirmative yes.\n  Are they entitled to have development on their own land, over which \nthey have some control, the State of Alaska, or the Federal \nEnvironmental Protection Agency?\n  This may be a little stark. I am not commenting on the reality. But \nthis is what a honey bucket looks like. That is what they cost, about \n$20. You empty it yourself. It is not what we are used to. But when you \ndo not have sewer and water, that is what you get. I don't know how \nlong that has to stay up to make the impression, but that is real. If \nyou have not tried one, it is not the most gratifying experience. But \nif there is no other alternative, that is what you have.\n  I bring this to relate to those who are somewhat above that, a higher \nechelon, who somehow do not consider how real people out there live. \nThey assume we all live kind of alike and the dreams and aspirations of \nan aboriginal people should not be considered in this debate.\n  Why shouldn't they? They have rights. They have representation. They \nelected me to the Senate and I am representing their interests. They \nwant a better life and I think they are entitled to it. They should \nenjoy, at least to a degree of attainability, some of the things we \ntake for granted.\n\n  We will be having an extended debate on this ANWR issue. For the \npeople of my State, let's once and for all try to keep the arguments \naccurate. Let's not mislead people by saying it is a 6-month supply. \nThat is absolutely ludicrous, and I assume most of my colleagues have \nthe intelligence and fairness to recognize that argument doesn't hold \noil. Not only are we not talking about a 6-month supply, some say it \nwill take 10 years.\n  This is the other chart that shows the infrastructure that is already \nin suggests we can expedite permitting if the oil is, indeed, there, in \nthe volume it would have to be.\n  I might add, this little red thing is the footprint of what 2,000 \nacres would be out of this 1.5 million acres in green. This is the \nfootprint authorizing the 2,000 acres, and this whole area is 19 \nmillion acres.\n  Make no mistake about it, it is a very small footprint in an area \nthat already has the development of Kaktovik and the Eskimo people who \nsupport it.\n  As we look at the issue of a 6-month supply--we have countered that. \nCan it be open in a reasonable period of time? What we have here--it \ndoesn't show on this particular chart--we have a discovery here called \nBadame. It is a British Petroleum discovery. It has not proven out. But \nthere is a pipeline from the existing 800-mile pipeline over to Badame \nso we would only need about 45 miles of pipeline to get to ANWR. Once \nthe discoveries were made, and the discoveries would have to be \nsubstantive or we would never be able to afford the development, a \npipeline could be run over there in a very expeditious manner in my \nopinion--one winter construction season--and we could have ANWR online \nin 2.5 to 3 years.\n  Let's remember, in 1995 we passed ANWR. It was vetoed by our \nPresident in the omnibus package. So we would today at least have oil \nflowing. To suggest we cannot do it safely, to suggest it is going to \ntake 10 years is totally unrealistic. To suggest with the new \ntechnology it would have a detrimental effect on the wildlife is, \nagain, without any scientific foundation.\n  We have some other characters here. We call them bears. We have polar \nbears and we have brown bears. The significance of the polar bear--\nthese are not polar bears; these happen to be brown bears. Grizzles is \ntheir common denomination. These guys are walking the pipeline because \nit is easier than walking in the snow. You and I would do the same \nthing if we were out for a walk. The point is, these are not disturbing \nbecause there is no threat.\n  People say: What about the polar bears? We do not have many polar \nbears in this area, but we have a few. This is from the Washington \nPost. It is kind of an interesting, I guess, comparison, because this \nwas a new field found over at Alpine. It came in initially about 100,00 \nbarrels a day. That\n\n[[Page S2443]]\n\nis a lot of oil for one little field. The footprint is just that much, \nprobably 20 acres.\n  This particular picture down here shows some polar bears, but they do \nnot indicate where that picture was taken. This picture was not taken \nin ANWR. It was taken way over on the Arctic area known as Barrow, \nprobably 600 or 700 miles west. But the point I want to make with \nregard to the polar bear--and it is legitimate--is the greatest \ncontribution we made to the polar bear is the Marine Animal Act because \nyou can't take polar bear as a trophy. You can't hunt them. You can \nin Russia or Canada, but you cannot do it in the United States; so they \nare protected. To suggest somehow that a mild amount of activity \nassociated with development of ANWR is going to jeopardize the polar \nbear--the greatest jeopardy to the polar bear is somebody going out and \nshooting them. I hate to be so crass, but that is the factual reality.\n\n  What we have here, again, is America's extreme environmental \ncommunity using this, lobbying it very heavily. At a time when clearly \nwe have a lot of unrest in the Middle East, the New York Times is \nproposing Congress hasn't done anything to relieve our dependence, and \nthere is the recognition that now we are starting a debate, very soon, \non the issue of opening ANWR.\n  I encourage Members to try to sort out fact from fiction, as this \ndebate goes on; recognizing that America stands to gain an awful lot \nfrom opening this area up.\n  There would be significant job creation. It is in the interest of our \neconomy. It is estimated that somewhere in the area of 250,000 jobs \nwould be created. America's unions are virtually 100 percent behind \nopening up this area because they know it can be done safely. They know \nit is a jobs issue. Not only are they convinced it is in the interest \nof our economy, but America's veterans are virtually unanimous in \nsupport of opening it. The reason the veterans support it is quite \nobvious to all. It would forestall the possibility that American troops \nwould have to go overseas and fight a war over oil in a foreign land.\n  In conclusion, I hope Members really relate to doing what is right \nfor America, what is right for jobs, and what is right for the \nveterans. I might add that the Israeli lobbying group is virtually 100 \npercent supportive of developing the Coastal Plain and relieving our \ndependence on Mideast oil.\n  When you start looking down the list of supporters on the other side, \nit is the environmental groups. There is no sound science to support \ntheir contention because we can do it safely. It is an extraordinary \nresource available for this country. It can be developed in a \nrelatively short period of time. It can be done without jeopardizing \nanimal life. For those who claim to be experts, I suggest they go up \nthere, talk to the people, take a look at it, and recognize the \nsignificance of the dreams and aspirations of those people who have to \ndepend on this kind of living when there are alternatives that you and \nI take for granted. This is the hard reality of the lifestyle of some \nof my people who want a better lifestyle, and they expect that the \nSenate will protect their interests.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I have sought recognition to comment \nbriefly about a trip I made to the Mideast and to the efforts being \nmade at getting a cease-fire and a truce.\n  Two weeks ago yesterday, I arrived in Jerusalem and met with General \nZinni, and then with Israel's Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon, and then \nwith the Palestinian Authority's Chairman, Yasser Arafat.\n  On that day, I was told by all three of those men that they were very \nclose to finding agreement on security arrangements under the so-called \nTenet Plan put forward by CIA Director George Tenet.\n  Then the next day there was the massacre, the suicide bomber at the \nPassover Seder where 22 people were killed and several hundred were \nwounded. Then the whole situation in the Mideast exploded.\n  The Israelis then undertook a military operation to try to root out \nthe suicide bombers. And following the initiation of that military \noperation, the suicide bombers stopped for a few days. Then they \nstarted again yesterday.\n\n  I am glad to say that Secretary of State Colin Powell has gone to the \nMideast at the President's direction. I know the Secretary would have \npreferred to have gone after all of the arrangements had been worked \nout and it could be a triumphant tour, but I do believe it is necessary \nto make an effort even where success is not assured. Nobody hits a home \nrun, we can't expect someone to hit a home run every time they go to \nbat.\n  The risks for the United States of doing nothing are much greater \nthan the risks if we try, even if there is not immediate success.\n  On the wave of the suicide bombings, it is very difficult to ask the \nIsraelis to stop their efforts in self-defense to root out the \nterrorists and to stop the suicide bombers. It is very hard to do. We \ncannot allow, the world cannot allow suicide bombings to become an \nepidemic. What happened to the United States on 9-11 involved suicide \nbombers, just a little bit more sophisticated. They hijacked airplanes \nthat they crashed into the trade towers. One was headed to the White \nHouse which hit the Pentagon, and another was headed to the Capitol \nwhich went down in Somerset County, PA.\n  If suicide bombers are not stopped, they are going to become an \nepidemic and a way of life; no one is going to be safe. It is very \ndifficult to expect Israel not to act in its own self-defense in \nrooting out the suicide bombers.\n  The evidence came to light last week, or the purported evidence, that \ndocuments were found which bore the signature of Chairman Arafat on \npaying money to terrorists who were involved against the State of \nIsrael. It seemed to me that when that evidence came to light, we had \nto check it out thoroughly to see if in fact it was true. There has not \nbeen conclusive authentication, although from all appearances it seems \nto be accurate.\n  The Palestinian Authority did not directly deny the accuracy but \nsaid, somewhat tangentially, that Israel sometimes concocted the \ndocuments and said further that Israel was using this issue for \npropaganda purposes. Both of those responses are really beside the \npoint. The point is, are those documents authentic?\n  There yet ought to be a determination, perhaps made by a U.S. \nofficial, perhaps by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or perhaps by \nthe CIA or some impartial agency, to see for sure if that is in fact \nChairman Arafat's signature and his handwriting.\n  When I saw him 2 weeks ago yesterday, I asked him a great many \nquestions. One of the questions I asked him involved the Iranian \nshipment of arms to the Palestinian Authority which was documented. At \nthat time, there was not conclusive proof linking Arafat personally, \nbut there was conclusive proof that it went to the Palestinian \nAuthority. When I talked to Chairman Arafat and his advisers in the \nface of their denials that it ever happened, it seemed to me not \ncredible and not worthy of belief.\n  When I saw Chairman Arafat, I conveyed General Zinni's message that \nChairman Arafat ought to make an emphatic, unequivocal statement in \nArabic to stop the suicide bombings. Chairman Arafat refused to do \nthat.\n  If it turns out that these documents do in fact bear Arafat's \nhandwriting and if it is conclusive that Arafat has paid off \nterrorists, then it seems to me very difficult to deal with Arafat or \nto ask Israel to deal with Arafat.\n  I am not unmindful of the grave difficulty as to how we negotiate \nwith the Palestinian Authority if we do not negotiate with Arafat. But \nthe ultimate question is, what is an arrangement, what is an agreement \nwith Arafat,\n\n[[Page S2444]]\n\nworth if in fact he has been paying off terrorists? You have a sequence \nof events that would be most damning. The Iranian arms deal is very \nproblematic. His refusal to make an unequivocal statement in Arabic to \nstop the suicide bombings is also obviously very problematic.\n\n  I am glad to see Secretary of State Powell talking to moderate Arab \nleaders first. The reports were that when he met with Mohamed VI, the \nleader in Morocco, Mohamed VI challenged the Secretary on why he had \nwaited so long to come to the Mideast and why he had gone to Morocco \ninstead of going to Jerusalem where the war problem existed. I think \nSecretary of State Powell was correct in going to Morocco first and \nthen talking to the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia who happened to be in \nMorocco as well, then proceeding to Egypt, and then to talk to King \nAbdullah of Jordan--to go to the moderate Arabs first.\n  I frankly like King Mohamed VI's spunk in challenging the United \nStates. I think that kind of independence and that kind of directness \nis very refreshing, even though I believe Secretary of State Powell is \ncorrect and had a good answer for Mohamed VI. I have had a chance to \nmeet him on prior trips to the Mideast. He is a man in his late \nthirties. I think it shows great promise of leadership in the moderate \nArab world. He follows his father who had good relations with Israel \nand had an open mind. He has the real potential for leadership.\n  On the trip to the Mideast a week ago last Thursday, I had a chance \nto talk to King Abdullah of Jordan. There is another young moderate \nleader of the Arab world who has real potential.\n  I have been a little disappointed lately in what President Mubarak \nhas had to say and a little surprised to see in the morning's press \nthat it is the Egyptian Foreign Minister who had a press conference \nwith Secretary of State Powell as opposed to President Mubarak.\n  When President Mubarak was visiting here a few weeks ago and a number \nof Senators met with him in the Foreign Relations Room downstairs in \nthe Capitol, the question was raised about an editor of a newspaper \nreportedly very close to President Mubarak who had spread false rumors \nor printed a false report that the United States was engaged in \nproviding tainted food in Afghanistan which is totally untrue. The \nquestion arises as to why that is going on. It may be that it can't be \ncontrolled by President Mubarak. But when that question was posed, \nthere was not a satisfactory answer given to it.\n  President Mubarak has been a strong moderate leader for many years. \nThe United States has responded with $2 billion a year since the late \n1970s, or in the range of $50 billion in United States aid to Egypt in \nrecognition of their leadership.\n  It may be that what we will have to look for ultimately is some other \nrepresentative, if Chairman Arafat is disqualified because of what he \nhas done, it may be that the moderate leaders such as Mohamed, or \nAbdullah, or Mubarak, will have to step forward. It is very troublesome \nas to what may be accomplished. I am hopeful that Secretary of State \nPowell will be able to broker a truce. As I said, 2 weeks ago yesterday \nthey were very close to security arrangements and to an agreement among \nChairman Arafat, General Zinni, and Prime Minister Sharon. But beyond \nthe truce, I think Secretary of State Powell is correct. As he \ncommented yesterday, there has to be an immediate action toward a \npolitical settlement.\n\n  There has been agreement that there will be a Palestinian State. \nPrime Minister Sharon has acknowledged that, and that is understood in \nIsrael. Those are the terms of the Oslo agreement President Bush talked \nabout. I do think there are ways to move ahead to see to it that the \nissues of boundaries, the issues of settlements, and all the other \nissues in the political mixture can be worked out.\n  During our trip, we also had an opportunity to meet with President \nBashar al-Asad of Syria, another young man--a new generation--in his \nthirties. He is 36 years of age. I had occasion to get to know his \nfather, Hafez al-Asad. I have been traveling to Syria almost every year \nsince 1984 and had many meetings--more than a dozen--with President \nHafez al-Asad, and I had an opportunity to meet President Bashar al-\nAsad when I attended the funeral in June of 2000.\n  In a meeting I had with President Asad a week ago Saturday, we talked \nabout a great many subjects. It is my hope, as matters evolve, that \nPresident Bashar Asad will present a new image for Syria. I know in \ntoday's press it is reported that Vice President Cheney has contacted \nPresident Bashar Asad about not opening up a second front in Lebanon. \nIt is my hope that Syria will be cooperative in that respect.\n  When I talked to President Asad a week ago Saturday, I raised a \nnumber of issues with him. He had been quoted at the Arab summit, \nsaying it was acceptable to target civilians. I commented to him that I \nthought that was not appropriate, that you simply cannot target \ncivilians. Civilians might be injured and they might be casualties, as \ncivilians were injured when the United States bombed Yugoslavia, but to \ntarget civilians is unacceptable. We had a discussion about that. He \nresponded there were thousands of settlers in the Golan who were armed, \nand I replied that if that situation was unsatisfactory to Syria, \nPresident Asad should pick up what his father did and try to negotiate \na settlement on an arrangement brokered by President Clinton back in \nthe mid-1990s, when Syria and Israel were very close to agreement, with \nPrime Minister Rabin and President Hafez al-Asad.\n  I commented about President Asad's speech last summer where he \nequated Naziism with Zionism. I told him that that not only was \nunacceptable and problematic for the international Jewish community, \nbut for the international community generally. President Asad responded \nthat if you talked to the man in the street in Damascus, he or she \nwould not know very much about Naziism, but they would be very unhappy \nwith Israel. I said equating Zionism and Naziism is very repugnant, \nthat the principal reason for the Jewish nation in Israel was the \nHolocaust and the incineration of 6 million Jews, and that kind of \nequation is unacceptable.\n  In conclusion, I see colleagues coming to the floor, so I will not \ntake up any more floor time. I think we have to pursue new avenues. I \nthink we have to look to moderate Arabs such as Mohamed of Morocco, \nAbdullah of Jordan, and Mubarak of Egypt to lead the way. And if we \nfind this evidence as to Yasser Arafat's complicity in paying \nterrorists, we have to face up to that head on.\n  President Bush has been very emphatic that you can't deal with \nterrorists, you can't deal with anybody who harbors terrorists. In \nmoving forward with negotiations, before there is a truce, there is a \nreal problem there on the appearance of rewarding terrorism by having \nnegotiations before there is a truce. Prime Minister Sharon had \ninsisted on 7 days of quiet before he would negotiate, and in the \ninterest of trying to move the process forward, he has abandoned that \nprecondition. But we have to be very careful in our dealings here that \nwe do not reward terrorists, which will only encourage more terrorism.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my trip report be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSenator Arlen Specter, Report on Foreign Travel, England, Netherlands, \n  Greece, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Jordan, Syria, March 22-April 1, 2002\n\n\n                                england\n\n       We arrived in London on the evening of Friday, March 22, \n     2002. On Saturday morning, Glyn Davies, Deputy Chief of \n     Mission (Charge d' Affairs), and Mr. Ethan Goldrich, First \n     Secretary, of the U. S. Embassy staff provided a briefing. We \n     discussed the British reaction to a host of issues, including \n     Iraq, Iran, Russia, China, steel, anti-terrorism coalitions, \n     NATO, England's Jewish population, and embassy security.\n       The U.S. decision imposing tariffs on steel imports has \n     been of great concern to British officials. The issue appears \n     to be less of a bilateral one between the U.S. and the U.K., \n     and more of a concern about increased dumping of steel from \n     countries excluded from U.S. markets that could affect the \n     British steel industry.\n       Domestically, Mr. Davies noted that the political landscape \n     is dominated by Prime Minister Tony Blair. Tory power is low \n     currently. Domestic problems such as crime and health care \n     remain unsolved. England's bureaucratic structure is very \n     powerful, and is about equal to the political establishment. \n     Mr. Davies shared a story about the bureaucratic heads \n     preparing separate memos immediately before the election \n     outlining different initiatives depending on who won.\n\n[[Page S2445]]\n\n       I asked about the solidity of the U.S.-led coalition. The \n     embassy staff noted that five nations have troops on the \n     ground in support of the Afghanistan action and that fourteen \n     countries are members of the assistance force. There is a \n     general feeling that even Great Britain's support for the \n     U.S. has somewhat diminished. Immediately after the September \n     11, 2001 attacks, the British people showed an outpouring of \n     support through letters, telephone calls and acts of \n     kindness. Many people drove to Heathrow Airport to take home \n     stranded Americans. Further, over 50,000 people came to the \n     Embassy to sign condolence books in the rain. Despite this \n     overwhelming support, the British people and officials are \n     often concerned about the use of their troops. They fear an \n     ``overstretch problem'' with commitments around Europe and \n     elsewhere and are skeptical of further military actions, \n     including one against Iraq.\n       On the issue of Iran, there appears to be a real divergence \n     between the U.S. and U.K. positions. England opened an \n     Embassy in the hopes of improving communication between the \n     two nations. They are appealing to the moderates in Iran, who \n     are known to exist, but are not in positions of power yet. \n     President Bush's inclusion of Iran in the `` Axis of Evil'' \n     is reportedly viewed as inappropriate and the British are \n     treading lightly with regard to Iranian issues.\n       We discussed the security of the U.S. Embassy. Protective \n     actions have been taken, but more work is reportedly \n     warranted.\n       That evening, we had dinner with the Rt. Ron. Geoffrey \n     Johnson Smith, a former Member of Parliament who recently \n     retired. Geoffrey and I debated in November 1949 when he \n     represented Oxford and I was on the University of \n     Pennsylvania team. We discussed the wide range of U.S./\n     British relations, including our 1949 debate topic: \n     ``Resolved that the British Empire is Decadent.''\n\n\n                              netherlands\n\n       From London, we traveled to The Hague, Netherlands, and \n     met, dined and stayed with U.S. Ambassador Clifford M. Sobel \n     and his wife Barbara with whom we discussed a wide range of \n     issues.\n       On Monday, March 25th, we met at the headquarters of the \n     International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia \n     (ICTY). The attendees at the meeting were Carla Del Ponte, \n     Chief Prosecutor; Mark Ierace, Senior Trial Attorney; Gavin \n     Ruxton, Senior Legal Advisor; Mark B. Harmon, Senior Trial \n     Attorney; Michael Johnson, Chief of Prosecutions; Anton \n     Nikifozov, Special Advisor; Jean Jacques Joris, Diplomatic \n     Advisor; and Graham Blewitt, Deputy Prosecutor.\n       The Tribunal has six ongoing trials in two types of cases: \n     leadership and criminal. There are three courtrooms with \n     morning and afternoon sessions. The U.N. has provided a \n     budget of $200 million for two years, which forced the ICTY \n     to eliminate two full trial teams. The ICTY now has six trial \n     teams. Efficiency has been reportedly questions by the U.N., \n     but Ms. Del Ponte and her staff feel that these criticisms \n     are unfounded. The workload for the ICTY is immense, with one \n     case producing a quarter of a million documents, which \n     require translation into three languages. Overall, twenty-\n     five cases have been completed.\n       We had planned to view the Slobodan Milosevic trial; \n     however, it was postponed due to Milosevic' s having the flu. \n     That trial has attracted much international attention, and \n     the ICTY staff is concerned that the trial is an opportunity \n     for Milosevic to make political statements. The prosecutors \n     are confident that another view will be taken by the public \n     once the prosecution has a chance to expose Milosevic's \n     weaknesses.\n       Former Ambassador Holbrooke has been called to testify. We \n     were told that the U.S. Government has invoked Rule 70 for \n     any Americans testifying, which would require a closed \n     session. Ms. Del Ponte fears that this may provide Milosevic \n     an opportunity to announce through the media his version of \n     the closed sessions. Ms. Del Ponte said she discussed the \n     likelihood of the U.S. waiving the rule with Secretary of \n     State Colin Powell who said he would consider it.\n       I asked about the status of the Radovan Karadzic and Ratko \n     Mladic cases. Karadzic has been sought for six years with \n     reports that he travels with impunity. Two raids have been \n     made recently related to his case. Similarly, Mladic is not \n     the type of person who is able to hide in his country. There \n     are reports that Mladic has been seen in a Belgrade Park with \n     60 guards. The Tribunal's work is hampered by the fugitive \n     status of these two men.\n       I asked for an update on the Rwanda prosecutions. On the \n     cases, the Tribunal has 53 detainees, including 17 on trial \n     and 32 awaiting trial. Ms. Del Ponte frequently visits Rwanda \n     as a part of her oversight duties. Each Tribunal--for the \n     former Yugoslavia and Rwanda--has roughly the same staff of \n     70 attorneys each, although the vacancy rate is high in the \n     Rwanda office.\n\n\n                                 greece\n\n       En route to Saudi Arabia, we stopped briefly in Souda Bay, \n     Crete in Greece. We met with U.S. Ambassador Thomas Miller \n     and discussed many issues. First, we spoke about Greek \n     support of the U.S.-led war on terrorism, as well as threats \n     in Greece by a group known as November 17th. They have \n     reportedly killed twenty-two U.S. and other foreign personnel \n     in Greece since 1975. We also discussed trade, which balances \n     fairly heavily in favor of the U.S., primarily through \n     military equipment sales.\n       We touched on the Cypress issue, which the Ambassador \n     thinks is close to being resolved. On U.S. action in Iraq, \n     the Greeks urge diplomacy over military action. The \n     Ambassador recommends the U.N. as the best forum to discuss \n     Iraq with Greece and other hesitant nations. Moving onto the \n     Israeli-Palestinian crisis, the Greeks appear to be \n     supportive of the Saudi plan. Further, the Greeks see \n     potential in Iran as part of the solution to tensions in the \n     Middle East, as evidenced by the Greeks hosting Iranian \n     President Khatemi recently.\n\n\n                              saudi arabia\n\n       From Greece, we continued on to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. \n     Before leaving Washington, D.C., we were told we would meet \n     with Crown Prince Abdullah Monday night or Tuesday morning. \n     Upon arriving there, we were told to await a call setting the \n     meeting time on Monday evening. Shortly thereafter, we were \n     advised there would be no meeting because the Crown Prince \n     was preparing for the Beirut summit and would be departing \n     for Beirut early the next morning.\n\n\n                                 israel\n\n       We left Saudi Arabia on the morning of Tuesday, March 26th \n     and stopped briefly in Amman, Jordan, as required by Saudi \n     regulations, on our way to Tel Aviv, Israel.\n       That afternoon, we met with General Anthony Zinni, U.S. \n     envoy to the Middle East. General Zinni said the Israelis and \n     Palestinians were very close to an agreement on the Tenet \n     plan. He had been in negotiations with the leaders of both \n     sides and reported progress at every meeting. The plan \n     proposed by Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet in \n     June 2001 was Zinni's working draft. That plan is focused on \n     security issues. The process would then lead directly into \n     the George Mitchell plan on political matters and end with \n     resolving final status issues.\n       General Zinni stressed that a plan would have to be given \n     time to work on the ground. He believes Israelis will be \n     satisfied if they believe Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian \n     Authority are making a 100% effort to end the violence. He \n     suggests the use of outside monitors, including some U.S. \n     personnel, to evaluate the situation after an agreement is \n     reached. Under the Tenet plan, they would monitor arrests, \n     including the use of proper procedures; weapons confiscation, \n     including disposal; and actions of incitement of violence.\n       When I asked about his reaction to the Saudi proposal, the \n     General said it was a remarkable plan, because of the mere \n     fact that it was offered and that it appears to have strong \n     Arab support from around the region. He said the Saudi plan \n     could further political discussions.\n       There is a great deal of speculation as to whether Yasser \n     Arafat can control the violence. His forces have been \n     weakened by Israeli attacks. Upon learning of my meeting \n     later that evening with Arafat, General Zinni asked me to \n     make a few points. First, Arafat needs to sign and follow the \n     Tenet agreement. Second, Arafat must make a clear declaration \n     to end the violence in Arabic and English. Chairman Arafat \n     has been accused of saying one thing in Arabic and the \n     opposite in English.\n       General Zinni told me that the Israelis are very concerned \n     about the Syrian connection to Hezbollah in Southern Lebanon, \n     which reportedly has about 8,000 rockets that could be used \n     against Israel. We discussed the need for more pressure on \n     countries to stop funding terrorism. These countries allow \n     organizations to operate, exploit children as suicide \n     bombers, and funnel cash for arms. The General suggested that \n     an Arab non-governmental organization or cooperation with the \n     U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and other \n     humanitarian groups from around the world could help address \n     the poverty from which terrorist groups recruit young \n     terrorists.\n       Late that afternoon, I met with Prime Minister Sharon and \n     U.S. Ambassador Daniel Kurtzer. Prime Minister Sharon was \n     generally upbeat and in a good mood notwithstanding the \n     pressures and problems. He asked our Ambassador what had \n     happened on his (Sharon's) request to attend the Beirut Arab \n     summit. The Ambassador replied that the inquiry had, not \n     unexpectedly, been turned down. Prime Minister Sharon \n     expressed appreciation that an effort had been made.\n       There was then an extended discussion over the U.S. request \n     to let Chairman Arafat attend the Beirut summit. Sharon said \n     Arafat shall not be rewarded since he had done nothing to \n     stop the violence. At least, Sharon said, Arafat should have \n     made some statement about ending the violence.\n       Sharon then asked the U.S. Ambassador if the U.S. would \n     back up Israel in refusing to allow Arafat back in if \n     violence occurred in his absence. As events developed, Arafat \n     was not permitted to leave Ramallah and nothing came of the \n     issue.\n       I asked Sharon what would occur if the suicide bombings \n     continued after Arafat made an adequate statement for \n     terrorists to end the violence. Sharon replied that all \n     Arafat could do was give 100% of his best efforts. It was \n     apparent from Sharon's tone that he did not trust or expect \n     anything positive or productive to come from Arafat.\n       At 7:00 p.m., Joan and I had a pre-Passover Seder dinner \n     with my sister and brother-in-law Hilda and Arthur \n     Morgenstern who live in Jerusalem.\n       At 8:30 p.m., we embarked in an armored car for the 40-\n     minute drive to Ramallah. Our security officer advised that \n     many weapons\n\n[[Page S2446]]\n\n     commonly used by Palestinian terrorists could destroy our \n     vehicle. To say the least, it was an uneasy ride.\n       When we came to the line of demarcation between Israeli and \n     Palestinian territory, we noted a tall cement barrier to \n     shield Israeli soldiers from Palestinian snipers. We were \n     advised that there were Israeli snipers a block away in a \n     high-rise abandoned hotel.\n       Starting at 9:30 p.m., we spent about an hour and a half \n     with Chairman Arafat at his compound in Ramallah. Also \n     attending were Sa'eb Erekat, Minister of Local Government; \n     Nabil Abu Rudeinch, Chief de Cabinet; and Jeff Feltman from \n     the U.S. Consulate.\n       Chairman Arafat said he thought General Zinni was correct \n     that a deal was close. He said the most recent meeting was \n     very positive. Mr. Erekat stated that they are one-hundred \n     percent committed to the Tenet plan. Generally, we were told \n     that the deal is acceptable, with some specific items still \n     in negotiation.\n       I told Arafat that General Zinni is asking for his public \n     denouncement to end the violence to be in English and Arabic. \n     Arafat said he has made these statements in the past, \n     sometimes at the request of American officials like Secretary \n     of State Colin Powell, and that he will agree to do it again. \n     Arafat said, confirmed by Erekat, that he will follow the \n     precise script agreed to with Zinni and Israeli officials in \n     Arabic as well as English.\n       Regarding Arafat's control of terrorist groups, he said he \n     could control them if he has help to rebuild his forces, \n     buildings, and infrastructure. He said that with every \n     Israeli strike, his power to stop the violence is diminished.\n       I brought up the subject of the Iranian arms shipment \n     destined for Palestinian groups that was seized recently. \n     Chairman Arafat became very animated, denied that the \n     Palestinian Authority had received arms from Iran, claimed he \n     did not need weapons and said the Iranians have called for \n     his death, so he questions why anyone would think he would be \n     dealing with them. His denials of dealing for Iranian arms \n     were totally unpersuasive in view of the conclusive evidence \n     to the contrary.\n       I also asked his opinion on possible action against Iraq. \n     He urged extreme caution, arguing that it would greatly \n     strengthen Iran. He warns that the Shiite Muslim areas, \n     accounting for as much as half of Iraq' s total population, \n     would be taken over by Iran, and that Iran's borders would \n     expand. Further, he claimed that Iran and Turkey would argue \n     over control of the Kurds.\n       On Wednesday, March 27th, we met with Israeli Foreign \n     Minister Shimon Peres. He said the Tenet plan must be \n     expanded to deal with political issues. He is not convinced \n     that a solution is close. He stated there are a number of \n     items that he feels are necessary for a successful peace \n     proposal, including: recognition of a Palestinian state; \n     determining borders; no ``right of return'' for Palestinian \n     refugees; Jewish settlements; Jerusalem as a holy place \n     without sovereignty; and security.\n       He has urged General Zinni not to ask Arafat for things he \n     cannot do and recommends making private requests of Arafat, \n     instead of open demands. It is Peres' sense that Arafat feels \n     he is winning and wants to be seen as a moderate ruler to the \n     world and as a popular leader with his people. He reiterated \n     concerns that Arafat delivers different messages for \n     different audiences and is careful not to issue orders, so as \n     to protect himself. He thinks the Saudi plan is \n     psychologically significant, because it recognizes the \n     Israeli state and pulls the whole Arab world together.\n       On potential U.S. action against Saddam Hussein, it is \n     Peres' opinion that the Arab leaders would publicly condemn \n     the action, but be relieved privately.\n       We spoke of the future of the region and Mr. Peres believes \n     that Arab nations must realize that poverty does not create \n     terror; terror creates poverty. They must also realize that \n     nobody can help them transition into modern states but \n     themselves. Scientific and technological research and \n     advances provide the key to a stable, prosperous future. \n     However, a major impediment to these activities is a closed \n     society. He said there are no more excuses for backward \n     societies now that empires and foreign rule are over. Only an \n     open, free society will allow for this innovation.\n       Threatening the future of the region is the close \n     association with religion and terrorism. He said that so many \n     people in the Arab world consider attacks on civilians a \n     religious obligation to attain justice. This Machiavellian \n     idea that the end justifies the means, is very difficult to \n     reverse and leaves no room for compromise. Groups such as \n     Hezbollah threaten Israel, but they also threaten countries \n     like Lebanon, which has been a supporter of the group.\n\n\n                                 jordan\n\n       On the afternoon of Wednesday, March 27th, we traveled from \n     Tel Aviv, Israel, to Amman, Jordan. On Thursday morning, \n     March 28th, we met with U.S. Ambassador Edward ``Skip'' Gnehm \n     and his staff who briefed us on the regional issues.\n       The U.S. provides annual foreign aid to Jordan in the \n     amount of $150 million for water, health care, and economic \n     assistance, as well as $75 million in military assistance. \n     The Ambassador was pleased that the President's Fiscal Year \n     2002 supplemental appropriations request includes $100 \n     million for economic assistance and funds to help Jordan \n     purchase a $60.5 million radar system.\n       The Ambassador noted that Jordan has a ``warm peace'' \n     relationship with Israel. Many Jordanians visited Israel \n     regularly before the violence erupted 18 months ago. Many \n     businesses also participate in the Qualifying Industrial Zone \n     program, which provides exports to the U.S. of products \n     produced by Jordan with Israeli input. The U.S. is Jordan's \n     top importer.\n       Further, Jordanian intelligence is seen as a partner with \n     the Israelis and has helped foil many terrorist attacks. \n     There is a geographical interest for Jordan, because Israel \n     provides an outlet to the Mediterranean. However, there is an \n     internal Jordanian effort to end the relationship with \n     Israel.\n       We next met with Jordan's King Abdullah bin Hussein at his \n     residence. We talked about the ongoing Arab summit and he \n     confirmed that there were security concerns for himself and \n     President Mubarak. They have many enemies, including \n     Hezbollah and al-Qaeda. He stated that the Lebanese were \n     making things difficult at the summit. He expressed surprise \n     at Syrian President Asad's speech that called on Arab nations \n     to sever ties with Israel.\n       The King has been working closely with Saudi Crown Prince \n     Abdullah on the peace plan and emphasized the importance of a \n     general proposal that would offer peace from the Arabs to \n     Israel and send a message to Arab populations on the street \n     that it is time to change. He expected the peace plan to be \n     passed at the summit.\n       He expressed concern about Arafat's not attending the \n     summit. The King did express optimism that General Zinni will \n     get something accomplished, but did note that Arafat's \n     control on the ground has diminished.\n       With regard to Iraq, the King was much more hesitant and \n     argues that the timing is important. He feels the region is \n     too unstable to handle the Israeli-Palestinian crisis and a \n     move against Saddam Hussein in Iraq. However, he could not \n     give a timetable for such an action and questioned the \n     ability of the U.S. to form a coalition. He does believe that \n     Saddam is pursuing weapons of mass destruction.\n\n\n                                 syria\n\n       On Thursday, March 28th, we left Amman, Jordan, and arrived \n     in Damascus, Syria, where we were briefed by U.S. Ambassador \n     Theodore Kattouf, a native of Altoona, Pennsylvania, and his \n     staff.\n       We discussed Syrian President Asad's statement at the Arab \n     summit, in which he justified attacks against civilians. The \n     Ambassador said the Syrians charge the U.S. with using a \n     double standard on U.N. Resolutions by urging strict \n     enforcement on Arabs and being lax on Israelis. He also said \n     the Syrians feel they have no hope for leverage against \n     Israel and its military might without Arab cooperation. \n     Further, Syrian leaders do not see any U.S. action to resolve \n     the issue of most concern to them, the Golan Heights. Vice \n     President Cheney did not visit Syria, which was seen as a \n     slight.\n       On March 30th, we met with Syrian President Bashar al-Asad \n     and Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara. I \n     had previously met President Bashar al-Asad at his father's \n     funeral.\n       President Asad told me that dialogue with Americans is very \n     important to him. He said he met with the American media in \n     Beirut two days prior. I thanked him for condemning the \n     September 11th attacks by al-Qaeda.\n       He said the war in Afghanistan will not solve the problem, \n     rather a need for moderation is called for. Terrorism is \n     built on ideological extremism. He was sharply critical of \n     U.S. support for Israel and claimed that the terrorism \n     experienced by Israel is merely a reaction to terrorism \n     inflicted by Israel on the Palestinians.\n       After praising President Asad's support for the Saudi \n     proposal to normalize relations with Israel, I expressed \n     disagreement with his speech at the Beirut summit where he \n     condoned terrorist attacks against Israeli citizens. He \n     sought to justify that approach saying there are thousands of \n     armed settlers holding Syrian territory in the Golan.\n       I responded that he should resume negotiations with Israel \n     over the Golan Heights issue, which his father had pursued \n     and had come very close to resolving in negotiations brokered \n     by President Clinton. I said I thought President Bush might \n     well be willing to help on that matter.\n       I urged President Asad to come to visit the U.S. with his \n     wife who has received significant public acclaim. I noted \n     King Abdullah's successful visit to the U.S. where the King \n     and his wife had made a public impact with their views.\n       In the course of our one hour fifteen minute meeting, I \n     told President Asad that his 2001 speech at the Arab summit \n     equating Zionism with Nazism was offensive to a much larger \n     audience than the international Jewish community. I \n     emphasized that reference to Nazism was especially repugnant \n     since the Nazis had murdered six million Jews in crematoria \n     during World War II, which has been a major factor in world \n     Jewry's determination to establish Israel as a Jewish state \n     and homeland.\n       President Asad replied that if the average citizen in \n     Damascus was asked about ``Nazism'' he would not know much \n     about it, but if asked about Israel, he would be very \n     opposed.\n       Moving to Iraq, I told him of my concerns about Saddam's \n     weapons of mass destruction and his refusal to comply with UN \n     inspections. He said that it would be impossible for\n\n[[Page S2447]]\n\n     Iraq to obtain nuclear weapons. He said Arabs would strongly \n     oppose U.S. action against Iraq and believes the matter \n     should be handled by the UN.\n       He said that President Bush's inclusion of Iran in the \n     ``Axis of Evil'' was a mistake and was not acceptable to the \n     region.\n       I told President Asad that I would like to see Syria take \n     action to warrant removal from the U.S. terrorism list. He \n     defended Hezbollah and other terrorist groups in Damascus and \n     was clearly disinclined to take any action against them. He \n     expressed the hope that the U.S. would deal with Syria on \n     matters other than only Israel. I replied that I would \n     explore the possibility of more U.S. trade and Syrian \n     membership in the World Trade Organization to the extent that \n     was not precluded by Syria's being on the U.S. terrorist \n     list.\n       I brought to the President's attention the case of a U.S. \n     woman who had married a man from Lebanon who abducted their \n     two children to Syria after their divorce. President Asad \n     expressed his concern and advised that he would personally \n     look into the matter to try to determine the whereabouts of \n     the children.\n       Following our meeting with President Asad, we departed for \n     Rome, Italy on the afternoon of March 30th where we were \n     hosted and met by Ambassador Mel Sembler and his wife Betty. \n     At each stop, we were greeted, briefed, and taken care of by \n     very competent and hospitable Ambassadors and their staffs.\n       We remained in Rome on March 31st for an interview on \n     ``Face the Nation'' and departed Rome on April 1, 2002, for \n     the U.S.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania \nfor his usual erudition which spans many topics. I enjoyed listening to \nhim on this subject, and on Syria in particular, which remains quite an \nenigma to many of us. Bashar Assad, as he said, is untested at this \npoint.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague for his kind comments. He and I \nhave worked on many subjects together.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I want to speak for a brief time about \nthe Middle East as well. I guess I am addressing my speech, in a \ncertain sense, to the President and the Secretary of State because many \nof us--certainly I and many of my constituents in New York and many \ncolleagues in the Senate--are confused. I believe that in making this \nwar on terrorism the No. 1 goal America faces, our President has done a \ngreat job. I support not only his concept but the execution. He has \njust been fabulous in this regard.\n  My enthusiasm was not simply limited to the area of Afghanistan, \nsouthern Asia, and central Asia, but also to the Middle East because I \nhave spent time talking to the President on numerous occasions about \nthe Middle East. I have carefully followed his statements. What he has \nstated has been crystal clear, and that is that terrorism is terrorism \nis terrorism--whether it be in Afghanistan, or Iraq, or directed at \nIsrael.\n  The President has stated unequivocally that Yasser Arafat is engaged \nin terrorism and that until he is able to curb terrorism, we are not \ngoing to have peace in the Middle East. This administration even had \nthe courage to put the Al Aqsa Brigade, a part of Fatah controlled by \nYasser Arafat, on our Nation's terrorism list. Documents that were \nsubsequently made public showed that Al Aqsa was engaging in terrorism \nand Yasser Arafat was fully aware.\n  So the last few days have come as a shock, and so many of us are just \ntotally perplexed. So this is an open question to both Colin Powell and \nthe President because sending Colin Powell to the Middle East I don't \nhave a problem with, if someone can help make peace. I think it is \ndifficult, and I think the tone in the Palestinian territories is \ndecidedly against peace. I think the nihilism is enormous. I think the \nfailure to deal with truth throughout the Arab world, with no free \npress, is incredible when an American Ambassador is vilified for asking \nthat people stand up and remember it is not only Palestinian victims \nbut also Israelis. For Colin Powell to come into the area and to try to \nbring the sides together, I do not have a problem with that.\n\n  What is totally perplexing is this: Given the President's strong \nstands against terrorism wherever it rears its ugly head, given his \nview--and I say this as someone who, as you know, Madam President, has \nbeen pretty much up and down the line a supporter of the President's \npolicies thus far, in Afghanistan, in the war against terrorism, and in \nthe Middle East; I have said some very laudatory things--all of a \nsudden it seems the President's previous statements are being ignored.\n  For instance, we are doing two things at once: Yasser Arafat, whom we \nacknowledge as an aider and abettor of terrorism--I believe he \nperpetrates terrorism--is going to meet with Colin Powell. Despite the \nfact that both the President and the Secretary of State have said \nrepeatedly that they will not meet with Yasser Arafat until he \nrenounces terrorism and takes some steps to end the violence, now we \nare meeting with him without any preconditions and, at the same time, \nIsrael, which is acting defensively to prevent the kind of suicide \nbombings which no society can endure, is being restrained. Arafat, the \nterrorist, the perpetrator of terrorism, is given a pat on the back and \na green light--``We will meet with him''--which is a reversal of \nadministration policy because they were not going to meet with him \nuntil he did something--not just words but did something.\n  Secretary Powell himself asked him to say things in English and \nArabic which is a basic statement saying: You do not tell the truth; \nyou talk with forked tongue. At the same time, we are telling Israel, \nwhich is simply trying to defend herself: Pull back.\n  It seems as if the policy in the Middle East has had a 180-degree \nturn without any explanation, without understanding its inconsistency \nwith even the President's speech last week, which I thought was a tour \nde force, without letting us understand as Americans who support the \nwar on terrorism how we can sit down with someone who perpetrates \nterrorism, and at the same time chastise and put handcuffs around the \ncountry trying to defend itself against terrorism. It is very \nperplexing.\n  I would like the administration to explain itself. What has brought \nabout the 180-degree turn? Why is Colin Powell now meeting with Yasser \nArafat without any preconditions? Why isn't America giving Israel the \nchance to get these suicide bombers, to take their weapons away? We all \nknow we are not going to have peace if in a democracy its leaders can \ndo nothing when a bomb goes off every day in a hotel or a pizza parlor \nor on the street or in a bus.\n  The policy seems to be muddled, confused, and inconsistent with what \nseemed to be a crystal clear direction which I think the vast majority \nof Americans, whatever one's views are on other issues, supported.\n  I fail to understand how we can reverse policy so quickly and so \ndramatically without any change. Has Yasser Arafat renounced terrorism? \nHas he arrested any of the suicide bombers in the last few days? What \nhas changed? Is the word of what we say not to be believed, that we \nwill change our views on a dime?\n  This speech pains me because I was so enthusiastic about the \nPresident's policy in the Middle East until this past week. I would \nlike to be enthusiastic again. I would like to believe there is \nsomething that none of us knows that justifies this reversal, but so \nfar silence.\n\n  I urge the Secretary of State and I urge our President to reconsider \nwhat they are doing. Make Yasser Arafat come clean; make him renounce \nthe violence--the very same violence that we are fighting in \nAfghanistan and that we must fight in America has to be fought in \nIsrael as well--and give Israel a little bit of the space that it \nneeds--a week--to get after these engineers--terrorist if there ever \nwas one--who make these evil bombs filled with explosives, nails, and \nball bearings that are exploded amid innocent men, women, and \nchildren--civilians. Give them a chance to curb them. Then Colin Powell \nshould come into the area and cause the sides to sit down and create \npeace. Maybe we will have a chance to succeed.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/10/senate-section/article/S2447-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2447-S2451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NATIONAL LABORATORIES PARTNERSHIP IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2001--Continued\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3047\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time between now \nand 2 p.m. is to be equally divided and controlled before a vote in \nrelation to the Craig amendment No. 3047.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Idaho.\n\n[[Page S2448]]\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from \nthe State of Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise today in support of the Craig \namendment which would strike this bill's electricity title, with the \nexception of its reliability and the Federal Trade Commission related \nconsumer protection provisions. I thank the Senator for offering this \namendment.\n  Because of the truly unique nature of the Northwest energy system--\nand the historic Federal presence, predominance of public power and our \nhydroelectric base, to name a few distinguishing characteristics--I \nbelieve the electricity title of this legislation is possibly the \nsingle most important part of this bill to consumers in Washington \nState and, frankly, I believe the electricity title falls short of what \nis necessary to protect our Nation's consumers in this inevitable \nchallenge that we have had in Washington State.\n  What is at stake here, I believe--and I appreciate the chairman's \nefforts to try to craft a compromise electricity title. However, my \nposition on the importance of consumer protection provisions has me \nconcerned about the impact that this particular title will have on the \nState of Washington where the electricity market has gone awry.\n  Consumers in my State are suffering from rate increases of up to 88 \npercent on account of the market dysfunction that unfolded in the West \nlast year. I believe the western electricity crisis was really \nprecipitated by two factors: Obviously, California adopted a \nrestructuring plan without adequate thought and deliberation, and the \nfact that FERC, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, signed off on \nit. Then FERC allowed generators in the West to charge market-based \nrates without first ensuring that those markets were sufficient in \ntheir competition and that they were adequately monitoring those \nmarkets over time.\n  What that meant is that many industries in my State could not afford \nthose high electricity prices, but nothing was being done to determine \nwhether they were just and reasonable. Many people lost their jobs, and \nmany children were not allowed to go to college because their families \nwere without income. Many consumers paid very high electricity rates.\n  I believe the provisions contained in the electricity title will do \nnothing to prevent another western electricity crisis from occurring. \nWhat is more, and what my colleagues should be concerned about, is that \nthis is an electricity title that will do nothing to prevent FERC from \nmaking those same mistakes again in other regions.\n  The electricity title contained in this bill restructures the entire \nutility industry without giving the Senate ample opportunity to \nconsider the implications of this action. In fact, these very \namendments were brought up on the floor without anyone knowing they \nwere being brought up.\n  This bill does not direct FERC to establish clear rules for when \nmarket rates can be charged, nor does it establish effective measures \nto police the market and provide needed remedies for any abuses or \nmarket imperfections. Again, these are very important issues for \nconsumers.\n\n  This electricity title repeals PUCHA, the Public Utility Company \nHolding Act, and moves merger approval authority from the Securities \nand Exchange Commission to FERC. In doing so, it weakens the burden of \nproof standard that companies must meet before they are allowed to \nmerge.\n  In the aftermath of everything that has occurred in California, \neverything that has occurred with Enron, why would we take one policy \nin which we have a standard by which the merger of companies and prices \nare impacted and remove that standard and make it a lesser degree? I do \nnot believe that is in the interest of consumer protection.\n  I support the Craig amendment to strike the electricity title because \nI believe these provisions do push the Northwest closer to a regional \ntransmission organization. As some of my colleagues may know, FERC has \nrepeatedly said the Northwest ought to join a westwide RTO. So, again, \nto Northwest consumers who have lost jobs because of the electricity \ncrisis or are paying higher rates because of the electricity crisis who \nwere forced under emergency order to send our power down to California \nand consequently paid a higher price, the fact that we might be \nhitching our fortunes to California does not sound like a very good \nissue for Washingtonians.\n  I am very concerned because even FERC's own cost-benefit analysis \nsuggests that consumers in the Northwest might suffer from the \nestablishment of an RTO organization on a westwide basis.\n  It is very important, although there are some other things such as \nthe renewable portfolio standard which I think is really a subpar \nissue, and I think we need to improve on that, we think of the consumer \ninterests. I support the Craig amendment, and I hope we will be able to \nchange some of these issues and protect consumers in the future.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to lend my support for Senator \nCraig's amendment to strip the electricity title from the energy bill. \nI believe that addressing electricity in major legislation, at this \ntime, would not be good for the Nation.\n  The electricity title does not protect consumers the way it should. \nWe have not fully evaluated the effects of this bill on energy \nconsumers, particularly small consumers.\n  I am uncomfortable with the direction of the electricity title in \nmoving authority away from State regulators to the FERC.\n  Last year, the west went through a terrible electricity crisis which \nconsumers are still paying for and workers still remain out of work.\n  Also, in this past year we saw the collapse of Enron.\n  We are still trying to fully understand the causes and effects of \nthese two events. Hearings are occurring and legal proceedings are \nongoing. House and Senate committees as well as numerous Federal and \nlocal government agencies are still trying to find out what happened \nwith Enron and why. Many people lost their jobs and many more people \nlost their savings and retirement accounts.\n  I do not believe we should move forward on major electricity market \nrestructuring legislation before we completely understand what \nhappened. Enacting broad, far reaching electricity market restructuring \nlegislation before we understand what occurred would be a big mistake.\n  FERC has been forcing the development of Regional Transmission \nOrganizations around the country in recent years. I have spoken with \nChairman Wood and the other commissioners about my concern that their \nvision of RTOs may not fit with the structure of the Northwest \nelectricity operations and market.\n  As I have stated earlier FERC is already exercising its broad \nauthority and the national electricity market is rapidly changing. \nEnron, a major electricity market participant, collapsed late last \nyear. We are still trying to sort out what occurred.\n  In the Pacific Northwest, energy isn't just a commodity. It is a \nresource that affects everything from our economy to our air, our \nwater, agriculture, salmon recovery, and our quality of life.\n  We should not make the same mistake California made, by restructuring \nthe electricity markets, before all the issues have been thoroughly \nexplored and resolved.\n  Nearly everything I am hearing from people in my State is that they \ndo not like this electricity title. They do not feel it is in their \nbest interests. They are concerned about the direction FERC will take.\n  I am also concerned that all market participants have not had an \nopportunity to review this legislation and have not had an opportunity \nto provide meaningful input. We need to make sure the legislation is \nthoroughly reviewed and discussed before we enact major legislation.\n  This is a $200 billion industry. If bad legislation is passed, the \nconsequences will be significant.\n  The amendment is not perfect. I am unhappy to see the good provisions \nof the electricity title removed. I am particularly unhappy that the \namendment does not promote renewable and diverse electricity sources. \nHowever, Senator Craig's amendment is preferable to the existing \nprovisions in the electricity title.\n\n[[Page S2449]]\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, allow me to state briefly that I will be \nvoting against the amendment offered by Senator Craig. I do so not \nbecause I feel good about the existing provisions in the electricity \ntitle of this bill, but because I believe they are a starting point \nfrom which we ought to try to move forward.\n  It is no secret that I am a strong supporter of renewable energy and \na meaningful renewable energy production requirement. I admit to \ndisappointment in the provision currently contained in this \nlegislation. While it nominally contains a 10 percent renewable \nrequirement, the various exemptions and carve-outs bring it down \neffectively to a roughly five percent requirement by the year 2020.\n  This level of Federal commitment to renewable energy is painfully \ninadequate and I must express my concern and disappointment at this low \nnumber.\n  I will also point out that, despite the assertions of my colleague \nfrom Alaska earlier today, a 10 percent requirement by the year 2020 \nwould not raise consumer energy costs. According to the Department of \nEnergy, a 10 percent Federal renewable portfolio standard would reduce \noverall consumer energy costs by $3 billion per year by the year 2020.\n  The figures the Senator from Alaska was referring to were the gross \nprice of renewable energy, not the increased costs to consumers of \nusing renewable energy versus other forms of energy. The relevant \nfigure is not what the renewable energy itself will cost, but the \nincreased costs, if any, to consumers, from using renewable energy. As \nI have stated, the Department of Energy says under a 10 percent \nrenewable energy mandate, consumer costs will actually go down, \ncompared to energy costs with no renewable energy mandate.\n  So even a 10 percent renewable energy requirement will benefit \nconsumers, and I hope we can get to a point where this Congress can \nactually implement that required level. However, while I am \ndisappointed in the provision currently in the bill, I do believe it is \na starting point, and one upon which I hope we can improve. Senator \nCraig's amendment to strike it entirely is not moving forward, but \nbacksliding to where we are right now, which is nothing.\n  As to other portions of the bill, I have long held the position that \nwe should not move forward with repeal of PUHCA and PURPA without \nsubstantial consumer protections, and substantial new investments in \nrenewable energy, including net metering, strong interconnection \nstandards and substantial investments by Federal agencies in renewable \nenergy. Again, I am disappointed in the provisions currently in the \nbill, but would hope that we could improve these provisions as the bill \nmoves forward, rather that just dropping everything.\n  For that reason, I will not support Senator Craig's amendment, but \nurge my colleagues to make the needed improvements in this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I yield myself 3 minutes of the time \nthat is reserved in opposition to the amendment.\n  I understand the concerns that have been expressed by the Senator \nfrom Idaho. I understand the concerns expressed by the Senator from \nWashington. There is no question there is a lot of uncertainty about \nthe future of electricity markets, and we are doing our best in this \nlegislation on a bipartisan basis to point in a direction we know we \nneed to move, a direction away from command and control and toward more \nof a market based system. I think all experts who have looked at it \nagree that is the general direction in which we ought to go.\n  This legislation before us is the result of a lot of cooperation \nbetween myself, the Senator from Wyoming, other interested Members, \nand, of course, the administration as well since they have a vital \ninterest in seeing the comprehensive bill we are considering, the \nenergy bill, contain a title related to electricity that helps to \nensure we have adequate electricity for our needs in the future, helps \nto ensure that the proper authority is there at the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission to ensure that mergers occur when consolidations \noccur, as they inevitably will, and that ratepayers are not harmed.\n  We have a provision in the bill. We are taking the authority under \nthe Public Utility Holding Company Act and its requirements, the ones \nwe believe make good sense and protect consumers, and we are shifting \nthat responsibility to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. We are \nrequiring them to ensure four things in order to approve a merger or an \nacquisition. No. 1, that captive ratepayers are not harmed by the \nacquisition or the merger; that the capacity of regulators to regulate \nis not in any way interfered with. That is another requirement. They \nare required to find there is no cost subsidy between the utility that \nis the subject of the merger and any other company so ratepayers are \nnot being asked to subsidize any other business.\n  Of course, they are also required to find that it is in the best \ninterest to go ahead with this merger before they can approve a merger. \nWe believe this will be more effective regulation, more effective \noversight of this industry than we have had in the past. We believe \nthis language is a modernization.\n  Title II of the energy bill represents a modernizing of the law that \nis in the best interest of consumers and the best interest of our \neconomy long term. I believe it is strongly supported by most of those \nwho are interested in this issue and who have studied it.\n  I compliment my colleague from Wyoming for his hard work on this \nissue, which has led us to the language we now have in the bill, which \nmy friend from Idaho, Senator Craig, would have us strip out with his \namendment. I hope Senators will vote against the amendment of the \nSenator from Idaho.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, may I inquire how much time is remaining \non my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute twelve seconds.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I am going to be supporting this \namendment and I want to explain why. I am not happy with the part that \nstrips out the renewables. We can put that back in. What I like about \nthis amendment is that it really protects the States.\n  I have great respect for my friend from New Mexico, but I have to \ntell him that California's experience with FERC has been nothing less \nthan dismal. FERC is supposed to protect against unjust and \nunreasonable prices. They have done nothing to help us. They have been \nunfriendly to us, and the Senator is giving them more power. PUCHA, \nwhich is the Public Utility Holding Company Act, which the SEC is \nresponsible for enforcing, is being repealed.\n  I would rather keep the issue of mergers with the SEC any day of the \nweek than give it over to FERC which has not shown itself in any way \nthat I can tell to be particularly friendly to consumers.\n  So I thank the Senator. I know everyone comes at this a little bit \ndifferently, but the bottom line is, on the whole I think this is a \ngood amendment and I will be supporting it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom New Mexico controls the remainder of the time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield the remainder of our time to the Senator from \nWyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \n30 seconds to close.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I thank the Senator, and I appreciate \nthe chance we have had to work together. Certainly, it is interesting. \nI have a couple of things I want to say. First of all, regarding the \ncomments about FERC, that is exactly the way\n\n[[Page S2450]]\n\nwe are going, to remove some of the authority of FERC. This has nothing \nto do with California and Washington, which had their own problems, but \nit certainly reduces the authority of FERC and that is what we want to \ndo.\n  I have a letter from NARUC, the National Association of Regulatory \nUtility Commissioners. It came in when the bill was in its initial \nstage. They point out there is an admirable compromise between Federal \nand State jurisdictions, including the issues they can support, and \nthen they suggested some other changes which exist in the current bill \nbecause of this.\n  Utility mergers sections, they support that; electric reliability \nstandards, they support that. They support the PUCHA substitute and the \nPURPA substitute, and the net metering and consumer protection \nsubtitle. This is the National Association of Regulatory Utility \nCommissioners which is in favor of the changes that have been made and \nwould be opposed to the Craig amendment.\n  This is a letter from the Secretary of Energy and represents the \nposition of the administration. It says:\n\n       I am writing to express my support for the electricity \n     amendment package agreed to by the Senate last week following \n     bipartisan negotiations. . . . These negotiations, between \n     Senate Republicans and Senate Democrats, resulted in a fair, \n     balanced and bipartisan consensus regarding several \n     electricity provisions of the energy bill--a consensus that \n     the administration endorses. Those negotiations also set \n     forth a process to debate and vote on reliability and \n     renewable portfolio standard provisions where consensus could \n     not be reached. As we have discussed on several occasions, I \n     believe that an electricity title is a fundamental component \n     of comprehensive energy legislation. The administration has \n     repeatedly stressed that appropriate electricity legislation \n     is necessary to protect consumers, make wholesale power \n     markets more competitive, strengthen the transition grid, \n     increase electric supply and improve reliability. Any such \n     legislation must also balance these ends with consideration \n     to the role of States. These goals are reflected in the \n     electricity amendments agreed to by the Senate last week.\n\n  I think certainly this is something on which we have come together. \nThe fact is, we have not done anything in electricity for years. It is \ntime to get it. Is it a complete answer? Absolutely not. We will have \nto come back and do some more with it. It is responsible to pass this \nbill now. The energy industry needs stability. Now is not the time to \nretreat. I urge opposition to the amendment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, let me close by reminding my colleagues \nthat reliability and consumer protection remain in this bill. \nElectrical advocacy groups, consumer groups, and utilities, some 18 \nacross the country, strongly support the amendment to take down the \nmajority of this title. Why? Because it has not been reviewed. It has \nnot been vetted. It has not been brought up to the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission.\n  What is your authority? How do you plan to use it? We are extending \ntremendous new authority to a central, Federal, regulatory body. That \nshould not be where this Senate goes at this time. The House could not \ndeal with it. It was much too frustrating and much too complicated. We \ndid not deal with it in committee in an appropriate, comprehensive way.\n  Yes, there have been deals made. Yes, there has been discussion. \nLet's step back, take a deep breath, and review this, as we should. I \nask my colleagues to support me and the repeal of this title, leaving \nin place the reliability and the consumer protection.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 3047. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, there are a couple of amendments that I \nbelieve are now ready to be considered and can be approved by all \nSenators. As I understand it, the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. \nDorgan, has one.\n  I yield the floor to allow the Senator from North Dakota to talk \nabout his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, for the information of colleagues, I will \njust be a matter of 2, 3 minutes. I intend to offer an amendment on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Murkowski from Alaska. We have worked on \nthis amendment and have cleared it on both sides of the aisle.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3087 To Amendment No. 2917\n\n  Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself and \n     Mr. Murkowski, proposes an amendment numbered 3087.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 11, strike lines 9 through 14, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(1) identifying the areas with the greatest energy \n     resource potential, and assessing future supply availability \n     and demand requirements.\n       ``(2) planning, coordinating, and siting additional energy \n     infrastructure, including generating facilities, electric \n     transmission facilities, pipelines, refineries, and \n     distributed generation facilities to maximize the efficiency \n     of energy resources and infrastructure and meet regional \n     needs with the minimum adverse impacts on the environment.''.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the amendment I offer today is on behalf \nof myself and Senator Murkowski from Alaska. It deals with the issue of \nsiting future transmission infrastructure in areas that have the \ngreatest energy resource potential to maximize energy efficiency. This \namendment would have the Department of Energy provide technical \nassistance to the States and to regional organizations to help them \nidentify areas with the greatest energy resource potential, and then \ncoordinate the development of these energy resources and future \nfacilities so that we can transmit this energy to the greatest extent \npossible.\n  We have, in my State, for example, and in other areas of the country, \nthe potential to develop additional energy resources, but we lack the \nfacilities to transmit those resources.\n  Our transmission capabilities are not keeping up with the ability to \ncreate this energy. We can address that in a few basic ways: by \nimproving the planing, siting, and development of transmission \ninfrastructure and corridors. We can also develop new transmission \ntechnologies that can increase\n\n[[Page S2451]]\n\nthe efficiency and, in some cases, perhaps double or triple the \ncapacity of existing transmission lines. One example of this type of \ntechnology is the composite conductor wire, which offers great promise.\n  We would like the Department of Energy to provide the technical \nassistance to States and regional organizations that are interested in \nmoving in these directions. We think there needs to be some \nopportunities made available to States and regional organizations to \naccess technical assistance from the Department of Energy to help \nfacilitate and achieve these goals. Our amendment will simply do that.\n  I thank Senator Murkowski for working with me on the amendment. I \nthink it is an amendment that will add to this bill and help us address \nsome of the transmission issues as we plan for greater capabilities in \nthe future to produce and to transmit energy through a grid across the \ncountry where energy is needed.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on this amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3087.\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3087) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3088 To Amendment No. 2917\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send another amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Senator Conrad and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for Mr. Conrad, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3088.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To direct the Secretary of Energy to conduct an assessment of \n    wind energy resources and transmission capacity for wind energy)\n\n       On page 64, on line 7, strike ``resource,'' and insert \n     ``resource, together with an identification of any barriers \n     to providing adequate transmission for remote sources of \n     renewable energy resources to current and emerging markets, \n     recommendations for removing or addressing such barriers, and \n     ways to provide access to the grid that do not unfairly \n     disadvantage renewable or other energy producers.''\n\n  Mr. BINGMAN. Mr. President, this amendment relates to a renewable \nenergy assessment.\n  This amendment is to section 262 of amendment No. 2917. That section \nrequires an annual resource assessment by the Secretary of Energy that \nreviews available assessments of renewable energy resources within the \nU.S. The report must contain an inventory of available amount and \ncharacteristics of renewable resources and such information as the \nSecretary believes would be useful in developing such resources, \nincluding terrain, population and load centers, location of resources \nand estimates of cost.\n  The amendment adds to the report identification of barriers to \nproviding adequate transmission, and recommendations for removing such \nbarriers, and ways to provide access to the grid that do not unfairly \ndisadvantage renewable resources.\n  I think the amendment is agreeable to everyone. I urge the amendment \nbe agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the amendment is agreed to on this \nside.\n  I want to also speak relative to Senator Dorgan's amendment. \nObviously, we cosponsored that together. I am pleased it has been \naccepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3088.\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3088) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/10/senate-section/article/S2451-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2451-S2452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    J.C. PENNEY'S 100TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, since we are at a lull in the debate \non this very important bill, I take this opportunity to congratulate a \ncompany headquartered in Texas that is celebrating its 100th \nanniversary: the J.C. Penney Company.\n  I think it is incredible, when you think of a company that was \nstarted in 1902, that it is still going strong today. I think it is \nworthy of note.\n  The founder of J.C. Penney, James Cash Penney, was fond of saying to \nhis workers that they were not building a business but a community. \nThis is the kind of business philosophy I hope more businesses in \nAmerica will adopt because businesses supporting communities means \npeople are supporting communities, and that is what makes our country \nso strong.\n  J.C. Penney encourages its employees to volunteer in the community. \nThey contribute to the local United Way across the country, which is so \nhelpful in the quality of life for every community.\n  They are especially doing something that I want to point out because \nI know so many working parents worry about what happens with their \nchildren from the time school is out until they can get home. J.C. \nPenney has made a tremendous effort to ease their employees' fears and \nanxieties by providing more places and more opportunities for children \nin afterschool programs across our country. This is the kind of thing \nthat really makes a contribution to our way of life in America.\n  So I thank the employees of J.C. Penney for their commitment to \nbuilding America's communities and for making a place for Americans to \nwork to be a good place to work. I wish them the best and not only \ncongratulate them on the last 100 years but for another 100 years of \nmaking the quality of life better for families throughout America.\n\n  Mr. President, I will yield to my friend, the Senator from Wyoming, \nwhere J.C. Penney actually started until they had the good sense to \nmove to Texas to make their headquarters.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I get to bring you the \nrest of the story.\n  I have always said you can tell a lot about a country by learning \nabout the leaders of that country. One of the areas of leadership on \nwhich this country can pride itself, worldwide, is its leadership in \nsmall business and in retailing. And we have a Wyoming boy who has done \nwell. I want to share with you, for just a moment, his history and the \nhistory of the company he started.\n  I also have to tell you about a young man of 83 who has just taken up \na career in writing in Wyoming. Since his retirement, he has written a \nbook called ``Pride, Power, Progress.'' His name is John ``Ace'' Bonar. \nHe had a distinguished career and, as I say, has now taken up writing. \nHe has written a very short history of an important man that I want to \nshare with you.\n  To quote him:\n\n       The year was 1902. With the blessing of President Teddy \n     Roosevelt the Panama Canal was being built. Roosevelt, who \n     said, ``Speak softly and carry a big stick,'' was also \n     sending the United States Navy around the world to \n     demonstrate its effectiveness.\n       And back in the states an unheralded project had started. \n     In the tiny mining town of Kemmerer, Wyoming (population \n     1,000), a 27-year-old man had opened a dry goods store. James \n     Cash Penney was his name. Son of an unordained Baptist \n     minister father in Missouri, Penny, like his father was a \n     strict disciplinarian. He adhered to honesty, thriftiness and \n     hard work. ``Jim,'' his father admonished, ``you have no \n     right to make money if you take advantage of people!''\n       At the age of 8, the younger Penney ran errands for a \n     nickel. The $2.50 that he saved was invested in pigs. On \n     complaints of neighbors, he sold out. But he made $60. At 12 \n     years old he was horse trading and raising\n\n[[Page S2452]]\n\n     watermelons on the family farm. He soon joined Hale Brothers \n     Dry Goods Store in Hamilton at a $2.27-a-month salary. His \n     income increased to $300 a year. But he left on doctor's \n     orders. He had to go to a higher and dryer climate for his \n     bronchial trouble. Arriving in Colorado he tried the butcher \n     business in the town of Longmont. He soon sold out.\n       Against the advice of people Penney borrowed $1,500 from a \n     bank and used $500 of his own hard-earned money to start a \n     Golden Rule Store in Kemmerer. In Mr. Penney's words, ``It \n     was on April the 14th we opened our doors. I was assisted by \n     my wife, a local girl, and a Methodist minister. Our sales \n     that day were $466.59, of which $89.90 was shoes. I was \n     warned that a cash business such as our could not succeed. \n     The miners received pay once a month and most spent it before \n     the next day. And then business dropped as low as $25 a \n     day.''\n       ``I got new fight in my blood.'' James Cash Penney catered \n     to the needs of a rural and ``blue collar'' clientele. Trade \n     revived. He opened another store 75 miles away in Rock \n     Springs, Wyoming. In 1913 the Golden Rule Stores became the \n     J.C. Penney Company. By 1917 there were 175 stores in the \n     United States. Penney operated on a cash basis. The coal \n     company stores had offered only credit. He studied the market \n     and concentrated only on necessary items for his customers.\n       A plain and devout man, Mr. Penney, as the story goes, was \n     waiting on a man and his family in a Midwestern store. He \n     took great pains in getting the family a perfect fit. They \n     liked to buy at the friendly Penney stores. ``I'd sure like \n     to meet Mr. Penney someday!'' Whereupon the salesman smiled \n     and said quite simply while offering a handshake, ``I am Mr. \n     Penney!''\n       Mr. Penney at times would literally ``pop up'' unexpected \n     at one of his growing chain of stores which was the nation's \n     first chain store. There is an account of his encounters in a \n     Milwaukee store where strolling down an aisle he noticed a \n     display of men's corduroy pants marked $3.98. He called the \n     store manager on the carpet.\n       ``These pants,'' said Mr. Penney, ``sell at $2.98!.``\n       But Mr. Penney,'' pleaded the manager, ``they are an \n     excellent buy at this price!''\n       ``You violate company policy!'' the owner exploded. ``You \n     must give the customer the best value and make a reasonable \n     profit!''\n       Penney's memory was remarkable, according to all accounts.\n       At the opening of a new Penney store in Minneapolis in \n     1970, it is told that a man came up to Mr. Penney and asked, \n     ``Do you remember me?''\n       Penney regarded the man for a moment, and smiled.\n       ``Your name is Severt Tendall. I last saw you when you \n     worked in the Cumberland, Wyoming, store in 1902.''\n       About the only thing James Cash Penney didn't accomplish \n     during his lifetime was to live to be 100 years old. He came \n     very close to his wish. He was still a board member of his \n     company until his death in 1971. He was 95 years old.\n       Does the Golden Rule, ``Do unto others as you would have \n     other do unto you,'' work today? Ask any of the managers of \n     the 2,080 JCPenney outlets in Europe and across the nation.\n       Today the little Golden Rule Store in Kemmerer, Wyoming, \n     stands as a National Historic Landmark. A tribute to James \n     Cash Penney and his faith in his fellow man.\n\n  Back in Wyoming we have dedicated that historic location, the start \nof chain store retailing in the United States and the home of J.C. \nPenney.\n  The principles on which he built that store are important principles \nfor this country, ones that keep retailing going. I am pleased to say \nthat my dad worked as a shoe salesman for a while in the Golden Rule \nstore in Thermopolis, WY. My mom repeated some phrases to me that were \na part of that culture and are a part of my mission statement in the \nSenate; that is, do what is right; do your best; and treat others as \nyou want to be treated.\n  I want to mention in more detail the Penney idea. Here are some of \nthe statements that are made to all employees of the company, the \nchallenge, the mission of Penney: To serve the public as nearly as we \ncan to its complete satisfaction; to expect for the service we render a \nfair remuneration and not all the profit the traffic will bear; to do \nall in our power to pack the customer's dollar full of value, quality, \nand satisfaction; to continue to train ourselves and our associates so \nthat the service we give will be more and more intelligently performed; \nto improve constantly the human factor in our business; to reward men \nand women in our organization through participation in what the \nbusiness produces; to test our every policy, method, and act in this \nwise: ``Does it square with what is right and just?''\n  J.C. Penney was the pioneer of retailing, the pioneer of chain \nstores, and one of the pioneers of catalogs. Catalogs were the way the \nWest was served when distances were too great to get to stores. Some of \nit is still that way.\n  His principles are just as true for business today as they are for \nlife. Adhering to these great principles actually usually leads to \ngreat success. That is one of the lessons we learned from J.C. Penney \non this 100th anniversary of the effort he started that set him apart \nfrom his competitors and made him one of America's most famous and \nsuccessful businessmen, a person who gives us guidelines for ways we \nshould operate today, ways that will keep the United States in the \nforefront of free enterprise.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/10/senate-section/article/S2452-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2452-S2465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NATIONAL LABORATORIES PARTNERSHIP IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2001--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wonder if I could enter into a \ncolloquy with Senator Bingaman to try to move the energy bill along. I \nhave a list of the pending amendments. We have had our staffs working \ntogether to try to clear amendments. I think we have done a pretty good \njob, but there are a significant number remaining.\n  I know some Members have indicated their intent to bring them up, but \nwe would like to have them come up. We are certainly ready. Perhaps we \ncan identify some that we anticipate.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me say in response to my colleague \nfrom Alaska, I agree with him. We are trying very hard to persuade \nSenators to come to the floor and offer their amendments. Of all the \npotential amendments that might be offered by various Senators, we are \ntrying to determine which they actually feel obligated to offer.\n  We have not been able to do that as yet. Maybe at a time when the \nSenator was not on the floor earlier today, I propounded a unanimous \nconsent request that we specify a time or that we limit the amendments \nto those that are on our list. There was objection raised to that \nunanimous consent request.\n  I suggest again that perhaps we could work together over the next \nhour or so to get that list pared down and then once again propound \nthat unanimous consent request and see if we couldn't get it agreed to \nat that time. That would at least give us a finite list of amendments \nso that we could then know what is the potential universe of \namendments. But it is very important that we get some other amendments \nup and vote on them this afternoon. I think Senators are on notice that \nwe are anxious to do that. I look forward to working with my colleague \nto get the list pared down so we can complete this bill.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I certainly agree and am anxious to \nwork with Senator Bingaman in moving this matter along. My list \ncurrently shows 73 amendments pending on the other side, many of which, \nI am sure, can be addressed without a vote and simply dispatched--if \nMembers would come over and discuss them with the professional staff in \nan effort to try to respond to the interests of the individual \nSenators. We probably have 18 amendments that I have identified over \nhere on which Republican Senators have indicated they want to try to \nwork out something.\n  The generalization was made last night that we are filibustering the \nbill on this side. I want the record to reflect that clearly is not the \ncase. In response to my friend's proposal that we limit amendments, I \nhope we get that agreement and that I can address the concerns of some \nof our Members. If there are any Members who want to add amendments to \nit, this is the time to do it. Then we can close out the amendment list \nand proceed to wind up this bill.\n  I want to make sure everybody understands that we are not \nfilibustering this bill or attempting to hold it up. The only way to \nmove it along is by the amendment process. We want to move it along. It \nis my intention to work with our side to get an agreement on amendments \nand encourage Members to come over here. I understand we may be setting \nthis aside again this evening to go on election reform, when we can \nclearly continue to be on energy. But if that is the wish of the \nleadership, obviously, that is what we will do. I assure my friend from \nNew\n\n[[Page S2453]]\n\nMexico of my interest in moving along on the energy bill.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been advised that Senator Schumer is \non his way to offer an amendment. This amendment, I assume, should \nrequire a vote. This is an amendment he is offering along with Senator \nClinton, and he should be in the Chamber within the next few minutes.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3093 To Amendment No. 2917\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit oil and gas drilling activity in Finger Lakes \n                       National Forest, New York)\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3093 offered by \nmyself and Senator Clinton, which I believe is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer], for himself and \n     Mrs. Clinton, proposes an amendment numbered 3093:\n\n       At the end of title VI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 6.  . PROHIBITION OF OIL AND GAS DRILLING IN THE FINGER \n                   LAKES NATIONAL FOREST, NEW YORK.\n\n       No Federal permit or lease shall be issued for oil or gas \n     drilling in the Finger Lakes National Forest, New York.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise with my colleague, Senator \nClinton, to offer an amendment to permanently ban oil and gas drilling \nin the Finger Lakes National Forest in central New York. The Finger \nLakes National Forest is the only national forest in our State. It is \nthe smallest in the country. It is about 16,000 acres. It is the size \nof Manhattan. It is in the middle of one of the few uninhabited areas \nin one of most beautiful parts of our State--there are many beautiful \nparts of course--the Finger Lakes.\n  In 1998, two out-of-State firms offered a joint proposal to the U.S. \nForest Service to lease the land for drilling. Subsequently, the Forest \nService conducted an environmental impact study on the proposed \ndrilling plan and decided to reject the proposal in December of last \nyear.\n  Paul Brewster, the Forest Service supervisor, said the following \nabout the strong public input they received during the EIS process:\n\n       Many [citizens] stated that public lands, such as those on \n     the Finger Lakes National Forest, are scarce in the region. \n     They point to its uniqueness as New York's only national \n     forest and its small size. They also feel the need for oil \n     and gas should not outweigh other resource values such as \n     recreation, grazing, sustainable timber harvesting, and \n     wildlife. They believe that this development would disrupt \n     the balance of uses that had previously been struck on this \n     national forest.\n\n  There are a number of Members from the West, a number of my \ncolleagues who came over to me and said: We have national forests, and \nthey are drilling all the time. I point out to them the large \ndifference between our situation and theirs. We don't have hundreds and \nhundreds and hundreds of square miles of national forests. This one is \n16,000 acres. I don't know how many square miles that is, but it is \nprobably less than 100. Am I right on that? I see my colleague from New \nMexico shaking his head ``yes.''\n  It is the only national forest we have. It is one of the very few \nareas in a rather heavily populated part of our State. New York State \nhas the third largest rural population in the country. To allow \ndrilling there--and there is only a negligible, if any, amount of gas \nand oil there--wouldn't seem to make much sense.\n  This is not a partisan issue. Both our Governor, George Pataki, and \nthe area's Congress member, Amo Houghton, both members of the other \nparty, are in support of our proposal. They know the tremendous \nenvironmental risks posed by allowing 130-foot rigs to drill in the \nFinger Lakes National Forest outweigh the limited benefits of doing so.\n  As I said, this is not Alaska. This is not the Gulf of Mexico. This \nis not the great wilderness we have out West, beautiful wilderness that \nevery summer my family traverses. It is, rather, a postage-stamp size \npark. And we have such beauty in our State, but we are so crowded that \npreserving this area from drilling makes a great deal of sense. It is \none of central New York's main tourist attractions. It draws tens of \nthousands of visitors each year.\n  There is no question of oil here. It is an almost unnoticeable amount \nof gas that could despoil this precious little pocket of wilderness and \ndrive people away at a time when they are sorely needed to bolster the \narea's economy.\n  The Finger Lakes area is starting to grow. Upstate New York has been \none of the few areas in America that is shrinking in population. But \nwineries have developed on the shores of the Finger Lakes. Tourists are \ncoming to the Finger Lakes. This forest is an attraction. A day of \nhiking undisturbed by manmade developments is a wonderful thing. For \nthe small amount of natural gas that might be there, to allow rigs, to \nallow forest land to be despoiled, doesn't make much sense.\n\n  I visited this forest and I can tell you, if every one of my \ncolleagues would want to take a visit there--I know that won't happen; \nyou have many places to go in your own States. But if you were to visit \nthe region, you would agree. All you have to do is go there and take \none look and you know it is the wrong place.\n  With this amendment, we are not trying to comment in any way about \ndrilling in other places. We don't want to get embroiled in that. Our \nonly national forest, a tiny little 16,000-acre place, one of the few \nnot-built-upon parts of our State, please let us keep it for the people \nof the Finger Lakes region and the new tourism industry that has \nstarted to grow there. Let them breathe a little easier, which this \namendment would allow.\n  I ask that this amendment be supported. I had hoped maybe we could \nwork something out between the majority and minority. I don't think \nthere are many requests like this, one that we haven't made before. But \nwith the advent of somebody who is interested in trying to drill for \nwhatever gas is there, the amendment is called for.\n  I yield back my time. I believe my colleague from New York is here, \nwith that bright orange, lovely outfit. I usually see her as she comes. \nI missed her today. Let me now yield the floor to my colleague and \npartner in this and so many other issues as we work for the Empire \nState together, Senator Clinton.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague in offering \nthis amendment which is very important to our State and would \npermanently protect the only national forest in New York State and the \nsmallest national forest in our country from drilling. The Finger Lakes \nNational Forest is a part of New York that I wish everyone could see, \nas Senator Schumer so eloquently stated.\n  We would love to invite everyone in the Senate to come and see these \nlakes, which were named from an old Indian legend that says the Great \nSpirit had put his hand down on the land and when he lifted it up, he \nleft behind these Finger Lakes. These lakes are so beautiful and \nspecial that, in and of themselves, they provide not only a tremendous \namount of recreational visitation for the area, but they are beautiful \nplaces to live and to farm and to work.\n  The U.S. Forest Service sought public comment last year on a draft \nenvironmental impact statement on a proposal to lease 13,000 acres of \nthe 16,000-acre national forest. Among the consequences of the proposed \ndrilling action identified in the Forest Service's statement were soil \nerosion, contamination at or near well sites due to the construction of \naccess roads, well paths and pipelines, and the use of trucks and heavy \nequipment in drilling activity. The report predicted that such \nconstruction would require several acres for each particular drilling \nsite of vegetation clearing, including tree cutting.\n  In addition, the quality of local water rights would be put at risk.\n\n[[Page S2454]]\n\nThere is also concern about the loss of habitat for birds and animals \nthat call the forest home, and it would be a very difficult problem for \nus to figure out how to accommodate drilling at such a relatively small \narea.\n  That is why Senator Schumer and I believe, because of the potentially \ndire environmental consequences, the relatively small amount of energy \nthat would be secured, assuming such drilling was successful, it is not \na sufficient reason to take a chance on this very precious resource. We \nthink it is our responsibility to protect our State's precious natural \nresources, and that is why, once again, we offer this amendment to \npermanently prohibit such drilling.\n  We also have on our side the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which, \nas both Senator Schumer and I remind colleagues on a regular basis, has \na very prominent place in our State--certainly in the Finger Lakes \nregion--where not only dairy farms but increasingly wine vineyards and \nother products are grown, but in its final environmental impact \nstatement, the USDA recommended a no-action alternative. In other \nwords, the USDA does not support drilling in the Finger Lakes National \nForest. So that is why we are offering this amendment. We don't believe \ndrilling in the national forest, in the Finger Lakes, would be sensible \nenergy policy. It is certainly not sound environmental policy. It is \nnot good agricultural policy, and it would undermine a lot of the \nprogress we have made in bringing people to enjoy this very beautiful \narea.\n  So I am proud to join my colleague in asking for support in \nprohibiting drilling in this very small national forest that we are \nvery proud to have in our State. I yield back the time to Senator \nSchumer.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague for her fine words in support of \nthis amendment. I think we have said everything that has to be said. It \nis a very small national forest, so it requires only small speeches.\n  I yield back our time and hope we can move this amendment without any \nproblems. Maybe we can figure out something. I know there is some \nopposition, but I will yield to my colleague, the chairman of the \nEnergy Committee, the Senator from New Mexico, who is working real hard \non this bill, and we all appreciate that very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me make a couple of comments. I know \nwe would not, of course, try to go to a vote on this matter without \nproviding opportunity for Senator Murkowski and other Members to come \nto the floor and express their views.\n  This is an issue about which I have spoken to Senator Schumer and \nSenator Clinton. I know they feel very strongly about it. It is the \nkind of issue that we address, as they are well aware, in the Energy \nCommittee through specific legislation that is designed to provide a \nspecial level of protection for a particular area, a particular \nnational park, a particular section of national forest; and I think \nthat might be another alternative for them.\n  I am not trying to discourage them from going ahead now if they wish \nto do that. Certainly, I don't intend to state a position on the bill \non their amendment. I know some Members have expressed concern that we \nwould not have the opportunity to consider this as legislation \ndesignating a particular area for special protection. That is another \nway to get to the same end result that they have proposed to get to \nwith this amendment. So I mention that and I know that is something \nthey might consider as an alternative to their amendment.\n  The amendment is pending, and I understand other Members will come to \nthe Chamber if the amendment remains pending and speak to it. With \nthat, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken to Senator Bingaman. It is my \nunderstanding from the Senator from New Mexico--and I haven't spoken to \nthe Senator from Illinois--when this matter is resolved, Senator Durbin \nis going to offer an amendment relating to the Consumer Energy \nCommission; is that the Senator's understanding?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. It is my further understanding that the Senators from New \nYork, at a subsequent time, will offer an amendment--maybe this \nevening--dealing with air-conditioners. I say to my friend from New \nYork, is there sometime this evening the Senator might be in a position \nto offer his amendment on air-conditioners?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Yes. This is the amendment that would have the Federal \nGovernment augment a State program for people who would turn in their \nold air-conditioners and get some new ones. I think we would be willing \nto offer that sometime in the early evening, maybe at 5 o'clock or \n5:15.\n  Mr. REID. That would be very good. We don't know how long the \namendment of the Senator from Illinois will take. The minority will \nmake that determination. The Senator from Illinois will not speak too \nlong. He will offer his amendment very shortly.\n  For the information of Members, possibly there could be two votes \nwithin the near future on two amendments. The leader has indicated that \nsometime tonight he will move to a different piece of legislation. So \nwe are going to be working somewhat late tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, is it appropriate for me to send an \namendment to the desk?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It requires unanimous consent.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendments be \ntemporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3094 to Amendment No. 2917\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3094 to amendment No. 2917.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a Consumer Energy Commission to assess and \n    provide recommendations regarding energy price spikes from the \n                       perspective of consumers)\n\n       On page 523, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1704. CONSUMER ENERGY COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Commission.--There is established a \n     commission to be known as the ``Consumer Energy Commission''.\n       (b) Membership.--\n       (1) In General.-- The Commission shall be comprised of 11 \n     members.\n       (2) Appointments in the senate and the house.--The majority \n     leader and the minority leader of the Senate and the Speaker \n     and minority leader of the House of Representatives shall \n     each appoint 2 members--\n       (A) 1 of whom shall represent consumer groups focusing on \n     energy issues; and\n       (B) 1 of whom shall represent the energy industry.\n       (3) Appointments by the president.--The President shall \n     appoint 3 members\n       (A) 1 of whom shall represent consumer groups focusing on \n     energy issues;\n       (B) 1 of whom shall represent the energy industry; and\n       (C) 1 of whom shall represent the Department of Energy.\n       (4) Date of appointments.--The appointment of a member of \n     the Commission shall be made not later than 30 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Term.--A member shall be appointed for the life of the \n     Commission.\n       (d) Initial Meeting.--Not later than 20 days after the date \n     on which all members of the Commission have been appointed, \n     the Commission shall hold the initial meeting of the \n     Commission.\n       (e) Chairperson and Vice Chairperson.--The Commission shall \n     select a Chairperson and Vice Chairperson from among the \n     members of the Commission.\n       (f) Administrative Expenses.--The Department of Energy will \n     pay expenses as necessary to carry out this section, with the \n     expenses not to exceed $400,000.\n       (g) Duties.--\n       (1) Study.--\n       (A) In general.--The Commission shall conduct a nationwide \n     study of significant price spikes since 1990 in major United \n     States consumer energy products, including electricity, \n     gasoline, home heating oil natural gas and propane.\n       (B) Matters to be studied.--The study shall focus on the \n     causes of large fluctuations and sharp spikes in prices, \n     including insufficient inventories, supply disruptions, \n     refinery capacity limits, insufficient infrastructure, \n     regulatory failures, demand growth, reliance on imported \n     supplies, insufficient availability of alternative energy\n\n[[Page S2455]]\n\n     sources, abuse of market power, market concentration and any \n     other relevant market failures.\n       (2) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the \n     first meeting of the Commission, the Commission shall submit \n     to Congress a report that contains--\n       (A) a detailed statement of the findings and conclusions of \n     the Commission; and\n       (B) recommendations for legislation, administrative \n     actions, and voluntary actions by industry and consumers to \n     protect consumers (including individuals, families, and \n     businesses) from future price spikes in consumer energy \n     products.\n       (3) Consultation.--In conducting the study and preparing \n     the report under this section, the Commission shall consult \n     with the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission, the Department of Energy and other \n     Federal agencies as appropriate.\n       (h) Sunset.--The Commission shall terminate within 30 days \n     after the submission of the report to Congress.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to offer this amendment that will \nestablish a Consumer Energy Commission. It is a pretty simple \namendment; yet I think it has the potential to be of great benefit to \nfamilies and businesses across America.\n  I am pleased that the Senate is turning to this debate on the energy \nbill to address our Nation's energy challenges. This debate really \nmarks the first time that Congress has taken up the whole question of \nenergy since 1992. As we consider the elements of this important topic, \nlet us not forget what has happened to energy in our country during the \nlast decade. One word you will often hear to describe energy during the \npast decade--especially in the last few years--is the word ``crisis.'' \nThe California electricity experience has been cast in the terms of a \ncrisis. Many point to Enron as an indication of problems in our energy \npolicy.\n  While we may disagree with the extent of the energy crisis, as well \nas ways to address it, I think we can all appreciate the fact that one \nenergy challenge our Nation faces is the price spike that consumers \nface in so many of our energy sources.\n  Let's take an example of gasoline. We all know when you buy gasoline \nin America, prices fluctuate widely at the pump. We are seeing some of \nthe highest prices now in the Midwest that we have seen in a year. \nGasoline is reported at $1.60 a gallon in some areas, and it is even \nhigher in others. This has become what I characterize in my part of the \nworld as the ``Easter phenomenon.'' This is the third straight year \nwhen we have seen, at about Easter time, the price of gasoline spiking \nacross the Midwest, sometimes over $2 a gallon, and even higher from \nthose who are exploiting and ripping off consumers and businesses.\n  The administration's energy policy indeed cites the dramatic \nincreases in gasoline prices as one of the challenges we face. The \nConsumer Federation of America and Public Citizen have also called \nattention to energy price spikes, explaining American consumers spent \nroughly $40 billion more on gasoline in the year 2000 than the year \n1999. In the spring of 2000, the cost of gasoline in Chicago shot up to \n$2.13 a gallon, well above the unusually high national average of $1.67 \nper gallon at that time.\n  Gasoline is not the only energy product for which consumers have had \nto pay dramatically fluctuating costs in recent years. Residential \nheating oil, residential natural gas, commercial natural gas, \nindustrial natural gas, and motor gasoline have all had fluctuating \nprices, dramatically fluctuating over the last 15 years.\n  I can recall a year or so ago my wife called me at my apartment in \nWashington on Capitol Hill. She lives back in Springfield, IL. She \ncalled me and said: Senator? And I knew I was in trouble when she said \nthat.\n  I said: What is it?\n  She said: I just got the heating bill on our house. What is going on \nhere?\n  The natural gas prices had gone through the roof. Every home across \nthe Midwest saw it. Some people could afford to pay it--we could--and \nothers could not. We are seeing that more and more. Consumers are \nsaying: I can understand prices going up here and down there, but why \nthese wild price fluctuations?\n  If we break down the numbers on a month-to-month basis, we can see \nincredible price spikes. In the matter of 1 month, the national average \nprice of gasoline jumped by 20 cents a gallon, residential heating oil \nrose by 10 cents a gallon, and residential natural gas led with 50 \ncents per 1,000 cubic feet.\n  In some sectors of the economy, price spikes were greater and had a \nmore drastic impact. Home heating and cooling bills crippled family \nbudgets in the Midwest and Northeast.\n  It is not just a matter of residences, homes, and families. Farmers, \nsmall businesses, and industries dependent on natural gas for the \nproduction of fertilizer, chemical products, and other services and \nproducts suffered economically.\n  I can recall trucking businesses coming to me when the price of \ngasoline was fluctuating out of control in the Midwest and saying: We \nhave to lay off people; there is no way we can keep this business \ngoing.\n  For a month or two at a time while this was happening, people were on \nthe unemployment rolls, if they were lucky. Some of them were just out \nof work, trying to keep their families together, not because they were \nnot willing to work hard or have a business but because one of the \ncommodities of that business was fluctuating out of control.\n  There is a way to demonstrate these problems. Let me demonstrate on \nthis chart some of the fluctuation of prices. This chart shows motor \ngasoline retail prices from 1999 to the end of 2001. You will see the \ncost per gallon across America, U.S. city averages. Imagine starting \nback in January 1999, the cost per gallon was around 95 cents a gallon. \nLook at the spring of the year 2001. The price is up to $1.60. There is \na fluctuation in price from 95 cents a gallon to $1.60 per gallon.\n  To some it is a pinch on their pocketbook. To a business that has to \nmeet a bottom line, that kind of fluctuation means: I can't put as many \ntrucks on the road or hire as many people for our messenger service. We \nhave to cut back on employment. This shows the price spikes that \nconsumers have been faced with over that 2-year period.\n\n  Let me show another chart: heating oil prices by region, and we can \nsee the wild spikes. The cost per gallon in January 1996 was about $1 a \ngallon. Then we saw this price spike to about $1.50 a gallon in January \nof the year 2000, and then it dips and spikes again.\n  Is this the natural operation of a market economy or is it something \nelse? That is the question I have asked time and again. I understand \nsupply and demand. I passed that course in my sophomore year in \ncollege, not with a great grade but a good one. I understand what the \nmarket economy is all about, supply and demand, but it struck me as odd \nthat year after year with great repetition we would see gasoline prices \ngo skyrocketing for a matter of weeks and months during certain periods \nof the year.\n  That is why I brought this amendment to the floor. I think we can \naddress the chronic national problem of significant energy price \nfluctuations, and we ought to do it by putting together a commission \nthat is balanced.\n  Whenever we get into debates about these price fluctuations, people \nsay: We are going to get the captains of industry and Government heads \nof agencies and they are going to come together and talk this through. \nI thought to myself: Isn't it interesting these people talk about a \nproblem that does not touch them personally as families, individuals, \nsmall businesses, and farmers. Why are we not bringing consumers into \nthis discussion? Why shouldn't they be part of this analysis to make \nsure the market truly is working and nothing else is involved?\n  That is why I am offering an amendment to establish the Consumer \nEnergy Commission. This would be an 11-member Commission which would \nbring together bipartisan appointees and representatives from consumer \ngroups, energy industries, and the Department of Energy to study the \ncauses of energy price spikes and make recommendations on how to avert \nthem.\n  It is true the Federal Trade Commission took a look at the gasoline \nprice spikes in the Midwest recently. Indeed, a lot of studies have \ninvestigated potential abuses of market power in the energy industry. I \nsalute Carl Levin of Michigan who serves with me on the Governmental \nAffairs Committee. He is having a hearing very soon looking into the \nspecific problems that have hit the Midwest.\n  Other studies have looked at long-range supply and demand projections \nfor energy products, but previous studies have tended to focus on a \nsmall set\n\n[[Page S2456]]\n\nof issues and on the perspective of big industry or big Government. I \nthink the best approach is not to look at these issues narrowly but \nconsider the big picture and, in particular, from the consumer's point \nof view.\n  We need to give consumers a voice and opportunity to participate in \nthis process. When consumers pay their grocery bills or tuition bills \nfor their kids or even their residential utility bills in most States, \nand when businesses pay for raw materials and supplies, prices are \nusually rather predictable. But when they pay for heating and cooling, \nnatural gas, gasoline for trucks and autos, families and businesses \nface the frustrating reality of wild price swings.\n  We need to bring consumers to the table with representatives of the \nenergy industry and Government to study these price spikes. We need \nthese groups to work collectively to consider a range of possible \ncauses of energy price spikes. We need them to look at both the supply \nand the demand side, including such potential causes as maintenance of \ninventory, delivery of supply, consumption behavior, implementation of \nefficiency technologies, and export-import patterns.\n\n  After the Consumer Energy Commission studies energy price spikes \ncomprehensively, its charge will be to develop options for ways we can \navert and mitigate these terrible price spikes.\n  These recommendations can range from legislative and administrative \nactions to voluntary industry and consumer actions that can help \nprotect consumers from the fluctuating cost of energy products.\n  This Commission will be well balanced, not only to reflect all groups \nwith a stake in energy price spikes but also to reflect both political \nparties. No commission has ever before brought together such a diverse \ngroup to study such a complex problem in a comprehensive way. No \ncommission has ever promised to see things from the perspective of \nconsumers, families, and businesses that routinely face energy price \nspikes.\n  The Consumer Energy Commission is long overdue, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Illinois \non his amendment. I reviewed it. It deals with a very important set of \nissues about which we have all been concerned. His description of what \nthis Commission would look at as the causes of large fluctuations and \nsharp spikes in prices, including insufficient inventories, supply \ndisruptions, refinery capacity limits, insufficient infrastructure, \nregulatory failures, demand growth, reliance on imported supplies, \ninsufficient availability of alternative energy sources, abuse of \nmarket power, market concentration, and other relevant market failures, \nare the exact kinds of issues we are trying to deal with in this \ncomprehensive energy bill.\n  Obviously, we need as much wisdom as we can find on these issues and \nhow to address them. I believe this amendment would be a source of good \nadvice to us, and I support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I want to enter into a general \ndiscussion with my friend from Illinois relative to the substantive \neffect of his proposed Commission because while I certainly concur we \nare entitled to have this information, I am wondering why an inquiry by \nletter to the Department of Energy, the Federal Trade Commission, the \nGAO, or the Energy Information Agency would not suffice for the same \npurpose.\n  The Senator from Illinois indicates the Commission shall conduct a \nnationwide study of significant price spikes since 1990 in major \nconsumer energy products. I think we are all familiar with the \nsituation in California relative to what happened when California chose \nnot to pass on the full cost of energy to the retail customer. As a \nconsequence, the price hikes associated with that activity were \ncertainly evident when the wholesalers went out of business.\n  I wonder if my friend could indicate if indeed there is not a little \nduplicity in the availability of this information. I do not have a \nproblem with the amendment, but I do not want to build up a \nbureaucracy.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I might respond, I thank the Senator from Alaska \nbecause I think it is a good faith question and I think it is one that \ndeserves an answer. I say to my friend from Alaska, what we are trying \nto do in this effort is to perhaps bring new perspective to this issue. \nThe Senator's State of Alaska really prides itself on its individualism \nand its own special character. What we are trying to do is say we think \nit is not unreasonable, in fact it is valuable, to have consumers \nrepresented in this discussion. I know what I am going to get if I \nwrite a letter to the major Federal agencies in town. I know what I \nwill get if I write to most of the investigative branches of the \nGovernment. Would it not be refreshing to have a new perspective with a \nCommission that really at least includes some honest-to-goodness \nconsumers who take a look at this from the small business perspective, \nfrom the farmers' perspective, from the family's perspective? I do not \nthink we have anything to lose. We may have a lot to gain, and I hope \nin doing that maybe we will convince some of the larger industries and \nutilities and even Government agencies that they ought to every once in \nawhile take a fresh look at things.\n  I do not think this piles on to bureaucracy. It might open up a \nwindow and bring in some fresh air.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. My concern is whether or not the proposal would really \ncreate another study panel to study what has already been studied many \ntimes. Quite frankly, we already knew with what price hikes were \nassociated; namely, a shortage. I often find it makes us feel good to \nbring in consumers and participate in a townhall meeting, but we have \nto educate the consumers on the factual information because they are \nthe ones who are affected by the results oftentimes. A price hike \nobviously hits the consumers, and sometimes they are not knowledgeable.\n  I refer back to the first page of the amendment of the Senator from \nIllinois; (A)1, and I quote: Of whom shall represent consumer groups \nfocusing on energy issues.\n  I gather that would be four members from the congressional \nappointees. Is that correct?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The suggestion in this amendment is the majority leader \nand the minority leader of the Senate will each appoint two members, \none from the consumer side, one from the energy industry side. So there \nwould be two who would come from the Senate and the House, the majority \nand minority leaders. So there would be four altogether, and then a \nfifth would be appointed by the President. So 5 of the 11--not even a \nmajority--would be consumer voices.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The consumer voices come out of that appointment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes. Five of the eleven appointees to this Commission \nwould be from consumer groups focusing on energy issues.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Ordinarily, the problems we have relative to energy \nare not enough electricity, not enough electric transmission in some \nareas, not enough oil and gas production in other areas, not enough \nrefining capacity in other areas. Consumer protection obviously is \ninvolved in virtually every facet of our lifestyle. I do not have a \nparticular objection to the information the Senator from Illinois is \ntrying to generate. I am concerned we not duplicate this.\n  Would the Senator allow us to put this aside and get back to it \nperhaps tomorrow after we have had a chance to look at it? We had not \nseen the amendment previously to have a chance to make a determination \nwhether or not indeed there is another agency that has a responsibility \nthat can provide the information the Senator believes is in the \nnational interest.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to accommodate my colleague from Alaska. I \nhope when he takes a look at it, he will support it. I certainly want \nto give him a chance to review it.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If we expand this to consumer groups, would we not \nwant to have some consideration or environmental input, too? Oftentimes \nif you have one and do not have the other, then the other wants to be \nheard. And if we are talking about more electricity or more \ntransmission, this also\n\n[[Page S2457]]\n\ncould have some environmental concerns.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is hard for me to quarrel with the Senator's \nsuggestion, but I think the focus of this Commission is to really talk \nabout the pocketbook impact of these energy price spikes. There are \ncritical and important environmental issues, the Senator knows well \nbecause he studied it as much if not more than any other Senator. But \nreally what I am trying to focus on is what the Senator has heard at \nhome and what I have heard at home, that when the price of one of these \nenergy suppliers goes out of control, we get calls from consumers and \ntheir families, as well as small businesses, who say: Senator, what is \ngoing on? Why does this happen every spring in the Midwest?\n  So I ask the Senator from Alaska to take a look at it and join me in \nfocusing on these price spikes and the consumer side of it, and I will \ngladly join him on any environmental aspect of another amendment. In \nthis amendment, if we could try to confine ourselves to the economics \nof this issue, I think that was the reason I offered the amendment, and \nI hope the Senator will support it.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. What I would encourage is that the professional staff \ntake a good look at this and see if indeed there is not some other \nagency that would have this information. I think it is important for \nthe Senator from Illinois to recognize on renewability, which we \npassed, the 10 percent, that is going to cost roughly $100 billion to \nthe consumers of this country by the year 2020. That is pretty much the \nagreed-upon, recognized cost of achieving a 10 percent reliability.\n  I am sure the Senator from Illinois is also aware that within the \nlast couple of days this Nation has lost about 25 percent, almost 30 \npercent, of the capacity to import oil with the determination by Iraq \nto initiate a moratorium for 30 days, coupled with the strike in \nVenezuela. Clearly, that shortage has resulted in at least a $3-per-\nbarrel increase in the price of oil.\n  These things seem to have a world application. If we look at Saudi \nArabia and the OPEC nations which operate their cartel, by reducing the \nsupply of oil they can clearly motivate and initiate the price. I think \nthey advised us perhaps a year ago they were going to, as an objective, \nhold the cartel within a $22 to $28 framework, and they have done a \npretty good job of it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I respond to the Senator?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Surely.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator, he has made the point because he \nunderstands, as I do, how beholden we are to foreign interest sources. \nIf there is a problem in Venezuela or a decision by gulf state oil \nproducers that they are going to withhold supply from the United \nStates, it has a direct impact on the price and certainly on consumers. \nThat is one of the elements we raised and studied, the reliance on \nimported supplies. As we become less dependent and more energy secure, \nwe are less susceptible to price fluctuations, which I would like to \nhave studied as part of this Consumer Energy Commission.\n  The Senator has made the point, and made it well, as to why we should \nlook at this more closely. There are a dozen ways to go after this, as \nSenator Murkowski and Senator Bingaman know so well, having spent so \nmuch time on this bill. I hope we never lose sight of the ultimate \nconsumer who ends up paying the bill. It is the mom and pop back home \nwho end up with the natural gas bill to heat their home--or gasoline or \nheating oil. They are the ones who ought to be in on this discussion. \nThat is what we tried to do with this Commission.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in responding, the examples I cited are \nbeyond the control of the Senate, beyond the control of the consumer \ngroups. It is just a world market that dictates, when somebody chooses \nto reduce the supply. As we increase our dependence on the Middle East, \non OPEC, we increase our vulnerability. The other example I cited, our \ninterest in stimulating renewables, does not come without a cost.\n  I suggest to the majority as we look at the creation of this \nCommission--which as I understand would have an authorization of about \n$400,000, with no staff and no specific definition of powers--see if we \ncan jointly work together and perhaps with the Comptroller General or \nothers undertake this study. If it is not feasible, I will not reject \nthe amendment necessarily. I am just a little sensitive to expanding \nbureaucracies.\n  If the Senator allows us to work together, maybe we can work out \nsomething.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to share this with the Senator's staff. I want \nto give them ample time to look at it. I thank Senator Murkowski and \nSenator Bingaman. I don't know if I need to withdraw the amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest we set the amendment aside to \nconsider other amendments as Senators offer amendments.\n  Before yielding the floor, the study called for in this amendment by \nthe Senator from Illinois is very time limited. It is 180 days. The \nreport has to be concluded within 180 days after the Commission is \nappointed. Then the Commission goes out of existence. As my colleague \nfrom Alaska pointed out, the maximum amount this could cost is $400,000 \nin expense funds that the Department of Energy would cover. There may \nbe some way to improve the language, but I think it is a meritorious \namendment and I hope we can adopt it. I thank the Senator from Illinois \nfor offering it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3093\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, unfortunately, I was absent when the \ntwo Senators from New York proposed an amendment authorizing funding \nfor prohibition on oil and gas drilling in the Finger Lakes National \nForest in New York.\n  My first reaction was that it was precisely in the wrong direction. \nAt a time when we are increasing our dependence on imported sources of \nenergy, oil and gas, this amendment prohibits oil and gas drilling in \nthe Finger Lakes National Forest of New York.\n  I am not knowledgeable as to the extent of interest to drill in this \narea. However, I am sensitive to Senator Schumer and Senator Clinton \nwith regard to what they believe is best for their State. We have an \namendment to put additional Federal lands off limits to oil and gas \ndevelopment. That is clearly what we are doing.\n  The irony in this as far as my State is concerned is we happen to \nsupport opening ANWR, opening the area for oil and gas exploration, and \nwe find a reluctance of some Senators to recognize that while I am \ncertainly not going to take issue with the attitude prevailing of the \ntwo New York Senators who want this area put off limits, I find it a \nbit inconsistent that other Senators will not respect our views in \nAlaska relative to our support, which is nearly 70 percent of the \npopulation. Clearly, virtually the entire population of the North \nSlope, with the exception of the Gwich' in people, support opening \nANWR.\n\n  I take the opportunity to point out we have an amendment to put \nadditional Federal lands off limits to oil and gas development at a \ntime when we are increasing our dependence on imported oil, at a time \nwhen we have an opportunity to open domestic sources, specifically ANWR \nand Alaska.\n  I respect the views of the Senators from New York. They have \nintroduced this legislation. The legislation itself should be \nconsidered in the committee of jurisdiction. I am speaking for myself \nnow, but I believe it should be brought to the committee before it \ncomes directly to the floor for action. Otherwise, obviously, we bypass \nthe committee process and the rules--which is the rule rather than the \nexception.\n  I tell the Senators from New York I may very well support their \nlegislation. I voted with and supported other colleagues on wilderness \ndesignation, from time to time, that put oil and gas development off \nlimits. So this is not the first for me, in spite of the fact some may \nquestion that. But it is fact. I have supported and voted for wild and \nscenic rivers designations that foreclosed future FERC licensing.\n  That is why we have a committee process, to understand the \nsignificance of the legislation's applicability. I do not think we \nshould come to the floor on a bill that ostensibly is designed to \nincrease our energy security and put more Federal lands off limits \nwithout the benefit of the committee review.\n  I certainly have great respect for the views of the State delegation, \nand I\n\n[[Page S2458]]\n\nhave regularly deferred to their views through the committee process. \nThis is not a large area. It is a very small area of Federal land, with \nno existing leases, as far as I know. I am not aware of any pending \nproposal to create an emergency. I encourage the Senators from New York \nto allow us to let this go through the committee process and not send \nthe legislation further down the road with increased Federal \ndependence. I encourage that consideration. Again, I have indicated I \nvery likely would accept it in the traditional process.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Democrat \nfloor leader will be coming to the floor in a moment to ask unanimous \nconsent that we bar further first-degree amendments; that is, further \nas compared to a list already assembled.\n  I see he has arrived, and so I will be brief, but I believe we have \nput together a bill that is an energy bill largely in name only. It \nwill have a series of tax incentives, many of which are expensive and \ntargeted to things which can never be reliable, significant energy \nsources for America. We will impose additional regulation and \ninefficiency in the market.\n  As you have in any bill, you end up with a balance between good and \nbad from each individual point of view. But the key ingredient that is \nmissing in this so-called energy bill is a commitment to open the one \nresource that can be developed on an environmentally sound basis and \nthat can give us energy to turn the wheels of industry and agriculture \nhere at home: the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  I have been frustrated throughout this debate in that we haven't had \nan opportunity to vote on ANWR. It is my understanding that there is a \nmovement afoot in the body to deny us an up-or-down vote on ANWR.\n  I hope it doesn't inconvenience my colleagues, but I wish to reserve \nmy right to offer additional amendments until we have had an \nopportunity to vote on ANWR. When we have had an opportunity to vote on \nANWR, I think at that point I would be prepared to lock in a list of \namendments.\n  It is my understanding that we could reach that point maybe by next \nWednesday, but I would have to object now to limiting my ability or \nanybody else's ability to offer additional amendments until we know \nwhat is going to happen in the part of the bill that will most directly \nimpact on energy production here in the United States--and that is the \nopening of ANWR.\n\n  I also believe it is important that we preserve our ability to offer \nadditional amendments in case there is an effort to deny us at least a \nchance to vote yes or no on ANWR. I think I will be unhappy if we can't \nget 51 Members to vote for ANWR, but at least if we have an up-or-down \nvote, the Senate has basically had its say on the issue. I have been on \nthe losing side on many issues in my career in the Senate, and I have \nlearned to live with each one of them, but I would like to have an \nopportunity to have that vote.\n  I was going to say this before the distinguished Democrat leader came \nto the floor. But until we have this chance to deal with ANWR, I wish \nto preserve my right and every other Member's right to offer \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this unanimous consent agreement would not \nprevent my friend from Texas from offering amendments. But we have been \non this bill now for 16 days. My friend from Texas says that he wants \nto vote on ANWR. We have been waiting for 16 days to have them offer \nthe ANWR amendment. For my friend and others to say they want an up-or-\ndown vote on this issue is somewhat interesting because, for example, \non the Feinstein amendment, which was under consideration for about 2 \nweeks, we couldn't get an up-or-down vote as a result of a number of \npeople, not the least of whom was the very astute Senator from Texas, \nMr. Gramm.\n  We are proceeding through this bill by the rules of the Senate. \nSometimes the rules of the Senate are not convenient for some. But they \nare very consistent. That is why the Senate works so well for the \nAmerican people.\n  We have done everything but beg the proponents of drilling in ANWR to \noffer that amendment. We are coming to a point--and the majority leader \nwill have to make that decision--where if they do not offer the \namendment we are going to take the ANWR provision out of the House bill \nand offer it. Then that will be before us.\n  We believe that energy legislation is important, and at this stage, \nof course, it is imperfect. But there are things in the bill which I \npersonally like. I like renewables. It is not as much as I wanted. \nThere are things in this bill that are good. The Senator from New \nMexico has worked very hard on this bill as has the Senator from \nAlaska.\n  I understand but disagree very much with my friend from Texas.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the list that I will send to \nthe desk be the only first-degree amendments remaining in order to S. \n517, except for any first-degree amendments which have been offered and \nlaid aside; that these first-degree amendments be subject to relevant \nsecond-degree amendments; that upon the disposition of all amendments \nthe bill be read the third time and the Senate then proceed to Calendar \nNo. 145, H.R. 4, which is the House-passed energy bill; that all after \nthe enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 517, as amended, be \ninserted in lieu thereof; that the bill be advanced to third reading, \nand the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill; that upon \npassage the Senate insist on its amendments and request a conference \nwith the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, and the \nPresiding Officer be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the \nSenate; provided further that S. 517 be returned to the calendar, with \nthis action occurring with no further intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that the unanimous consent request \nthat I have propound stand on the Record. Before my friend reserves his \nright to object--and he probably will object--I also say to my friend \nthat one of the things I have trouble understanding is if this bill \ngoes out of here to the House--the Republicans control the House and we \nhave a Republican President--I can't understand why people are afraid \nto go to conference on this bill. Senator Bingaman, of course, would be \nthe person we would look to for leadership in that conference. We have \ngreat confidence in him. But he is up against the President and the \nRepublican majority of the House.\n  I don't understand why people are afraid to let us vote up or down on \nANWR. It is not in the bill. There is certainly a procedure in \nconference for it to be in the final bill coming before the Senate.\n  I think this is fair. We need to move this along. It is not as if \nthere are no amendments. There are lots of amendments that people could \noffer.\n  I hope my friend from Texas will reconsider his objection because I \nthink from all I have been able to determine the Senator from Texas is \nthe only individual Senator stopping us from going forward with having \na finite list of amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, first of \nall, I thank our colleague for his kindness to me. I think the \ncriticism about the delay in offering an ANWR amendment is valid. I \nwanted to offer ANWR as the first amendment on the bill. That was not \nthe collective decision on our side of the aisle. I respect that.\n  The rules of the Senate are very clear. One of the things that makes \nthis the most important deliberative body in the world is the ability \nof Members at any point to offer an amendment. I wish to preserve that \nright.\n  I believe once we have had an up-or-down vote on ANWR I can take the \nposition at that point that I am willing to join others who are willing \nto lock in a list of amendments and no others as first-degree \namendments. But until we have had a chance to vote on ANWR, I feel \nconstrained to object.\n  I was a little bit confused as to whether the Senator was saying \nthere\n\n[[Page S2459]]\n\nwas a willingness on his side of the aisle to give us an up-or-down \nvote on ANWR. I think perhaps if we could have a commitment for that \nup-or-down vote perhaps we could work out an agreement on amendments \nbefore that vote occurs. But I would want to know that we have that \ncommitment.\n  In terms of the Feinstein amendment, 50 people voted against it \ntoday, and 48 voted for it. Senator Feinstein withdrew the amendment. I \nhad hoped that we could work out a compromise. I intend to approach her \nto try to work out a compromise. But given the absence of an agreement \nto an up-or-down vote on ANWR in this unanimous consent request, I \nwould feel constrained to object. And I do object.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I understand the objection has been made, \nand I appreciate the Senator from Texas having the right to do that.\n  I would say, I hope--well, I don't hope, because if the amendment is \nnot offered pretty soon, we are going to offer it--somebody over here. \nI will offer it. But I hope when that matter is resolved--and it may \nhave to be resolved the same way the Feinstein amendment was resolved, \nby filing cloture on that amendment--I say to my friend, if that in \nfact is the case, I hope the Senator then will allow us to have a \nfinite list of amendments after that matter is voted on through cloture \nor otherwise.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If the Senator will yield, I think once we have had a vote \non ANWR, then my reservations about limits on the ability to offer \nother amendments will largely be eliminated. I might want to file some \namendments, but I simply go back to the earlier vote on the Feinstein \namendment. No one required that Senator Feinstein pull her amendment \ndown. It was still the pending business of the Senate. I did not \nencourage her to do it. I had hoped we could work out a compromise. I \nstill hope we can.\n  I think there is a very big difference in voting on cloture on ANWR, \nwhere we are simply trying to bring debate to an end and having an \nopportunity to vote yes or no on ANWR. I think that is going to be a \nvery critical factor with me, perhaps with others.\n  But if next week we can move the process forward--and we can't offer \nthe amendment soon enough to suit me--if we can have a debate on it, \nhowever long that takes, I am for it. But once we have had an up-or-\ndown vote on ANWR, then I will be ready to lock down the amendments and \nmove toward passage and toward this conference. But I do believe it is \nimportant, on an issue that has profound national security \nimplications, for the Senate to take a position yes or no on ANWR. I \nthink that is very important.\n  I am just one Member. Other people can disagree. But that is what I \nthink. And I think the people of my State believe the same. So that is \nwhat I am trying to promote. I thank the Senator for his kindness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Feinstein withdrew her amendment \nbecause she had taken up enough of the Senate's time. We discussed \nthis, and she believed, in that she did not have enough votes to invoke \ncloture, it would be in the best interest of the Senate to move this \nlegislation down the road. That is the case.\n  I say, as I said to the senior Senator from Alaska this morning, I am \nconcerned about national security. We are all concerned about national \nsecurity. But if we start talking about energy, I think one of the ways \nwe can sustain national security very quickly is to increase the fuel \nefficiency of cars. That isn't something we have to drill under the \nground for to find out how much is there. You don't have to build \npipelines to move that oil around the country.\n  What we simply have to do is make our cars more efficient. We have \nnot done that in some 20 years. It would save millions of barrels of \nfuel a day. I think that is what we should do. So if we are talking \nabout national security, let's look at fuel-efficient vehicles.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have been involved in other matters, \nobviously, as all other Senators are. I understand that, once again, my \nfriend, the minority whip, has mentioned the problem of CAFE and the \nCAFE standards. We had a discussion on that this morning in \nrelationship to the ANWR problem that we seek to pursue.\n  The Senate has voted twice on the CAFE standards. The first vote was \non amendment 2997, and the vote was 62 to 38 to give the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration 2 years to establish standards. \nThat vote was not filibustered. It did not need 60 votes. It was an up-\nor-down vote. There was not a motion to table. Neither Senator \nMurkowski nor I filibustered or threatened to filibuster that issue.\n  The second vote on CAFE was on prohibiting an increase in the average \nfuel standard for pickup trucks. Amendment No. 2998 passed on a vote of \n56 to 44. Again, there was no filibuster on CAFE. It was an up-or-down \nvote requiring only 51 votes on what my friend, the majority whip, said \nshould be an issue of national security and is an issue of national \nsecurity.\n  During the debate on the Alaska pipeline, the then-leader, as I \npointed out this morning, Senator Mansfield, and Chairman Jackson did \nnot vote for the amendment that authorized the right of way but they \ndid realize it was an issue of national security and it should receive \nan up-or-down vote. They allowed an up-or-down vote on the Alaska \npipeline without filibuster. As a matter of fact, it became a part of \nthe right-of-way bill at that time only by the vote of the then-Vice \nPresident breaking a tie in the Senate.\n  In fact, Senator Jackson was so incensed at the thought of a \nfilibuster on an issue he opposed that concerned national security that \nhe threatened to have the Federal Government build the Alaska pipeline \nitself. At that time he said:\n\n       Mr. President, I have come to the regretful conclusion that \n     if we are stalled here, early next year I give my pledge that \n     I am going to push legislation for the Federal Government to \n     build this line. It does involve a national crisis. It is \n     urgent, and I shall do everything in my power to move that \n     oil.\n\n  We did not filibuster the CAFE votes, which the majority says are \nnational security issues. But the majority says the ANWR issue is not a \nnational security issue.\n  I hope the Senate will come to the position that my great, late \nfriend, Senator Mansfield, came to as leader--that there should be no \nfilibuster on an issue involving a matter of national security, \nsomething that is seriously involved in the national defense, \nparticularly at this time when the gas price in this city alone has \ngone up from $1.15 to $1.51 in 3 days.\n  We face a national crisis. It is not dissimilar from the one we faced \nin the 1970s. And I believe those who oppose getting us to the point \nwhere we can determine whether or not we can produce substantial \nquantities of oil and gas from that million and a half acres, set aside \nby Congress in 1980 for that exploration and development--we are not \ndrilling in the wildlife refuge. It was set aside and will not become a \npermanent part of the wildlife refuge until the drilling is over.\n\n  This chart depicts one of the things we found recently. I want people \nto see it. That is my commander, General Eisenhower, pictured on this \nchart. It is a poster that was put up by the Petroleum War Council \nduring World War II. It is a statement to workers in the oil fields. \nHere is the commanding general of our forces at the time of the \ninvasion of Europe saying to those people in the oil fields: Your work \nis vital to our victory . . . our ships . . . our planes . . . our \ntanks must have oil. Stick to your job--oil is ammunition.\n  Our generation knew that oil was related to national security. I \ndon't know how anybody today can say this is not a national security \nissue when we bring the ANWR issue before the Senate. We should have an \nup-or-down vote. We should not have to prove we have 60 votes. The \nreason the amendment is not here is we are trying our best to get 60 \nvotes. If I have anything to do with it, we will find a way to get \nthem, but it should not be required. The requirement should be only \nthat we come\n\n[[Page S2460]]\n\nto the Chamber and demonstrate it is a national security issue, and \nthat issue should not be subject to a filibuster.\n  I believe those who filibuster against this amendment will be \ncommitting a grave error. The American public should know that. Anybody \nout there who is interested should look at this. This is the National \nInterest Land Conservation Act of December 2, 1980, section 1002, the \nJackson-Tsongas amendment. It says:\n\n       The purpose of this section is to provide for a \n     comprehensive and continuing inventory and assessment of the \n     fish and wildlife resources of the coastal plain of the \n     Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; an analysis of the impact of \n     oil and gas exploration, development, and production, and to \n     authorize exploratory activity within the coastal plain in a \n     manner that avoids significant adverse effects on fish and \n     wildlife and other resources.\n\n  It has been 21 years since that bill was passed. I got this out of my \narchives, for anybody who is interested. That was one of my favorite \nphotos. That is Senator Scoop Jackson, this is Paul Tsongas, and that \nis a younger Ted Stevens. Senator Tsongas has in his hand, and I have a \ncopy, the final version that Senator Jackson and I agreed to with \nregard to that bill in 1980. That 1980 bill gives us the authority to \nproceed with the exploration in the Coastal Plain. It was the intention \nof these people--they made a commitment to us that we would be able to \nproceed with exploratory activity and development in the Arctic Plain, \nprovided there was an environmental impact statement made that showed \nthere would be no adverse impact on the fish and wildlife resources of \nthat Arctic Plain, the million and a half acres set aside for \nexploration activity by the Tsongas-Jackson amendment.\n  We have twice prepared these statements--twice. It was during the \nReagan-Bush administration, and the first Bush administration. The \nPresident asked the Congress to approve proceeding on the basis of the \nfinding of those environmental impact statements that there would be no \nadverse impact by gas exploration and development on the Coastal Plain. \nBut twice the Congress, then under the control of the current \nmajority party, refused to approve that request.\n\n  During the Clinton administration, twice the Congress sent to \nPresident Clinton a bill that would authorize the commencement of this \nexploration and development activity in the Arctic Plain, and the \nPresident vetoed it.\n  So there has been a stalemate now for 21 years. Had we started this \ndevelopment, we would not be under the threat of Iraq today; and had we \nstarted this development, we would not be importing from Iraq a million \nbarrels of oil a day.\n  We are sending to Iraq billions of dollars that they are using now to \npay stipends to suicide bombers' families. Our money that is buying oil \nfrom Iraq is paying the suicide bombers' families.\n  I cannot understand a Senate that would refuse to carry out the \nexisting law that was a commitment made to my State. We are not a very \nold State, Mr. President. As a matter of fact, I had been here then all \nbut 9 years that Alaska had been a State. This is a basic commitment to \nthe developmental area of Alaska. This was set aside--the first 9 \nmillion acres--during the period of time when I was at the Department \nof the Interior. At that time, it was the Arctic Wildlife Range. The \nwildlife range was subject to oil and gas development under \nstipulations to protect the fish and wildlife. It was never closed. It \nhas never been closed to oil and gas development. It is not closed now. \nThe 1980 act did not close this area to oil and gas development. On the \ncontrary, it set aside specifically 1\\1/2\\ million acres in that 1002 \narea, the amendment offered by Senators Tsongas and Jackson, as I \nindicated.\n  I have here a history of the dates of Federal land activities with \nregard to this area. I want to put them in the Record so that there is \na very clear statement that, from 1923 until now, this area has never \nbeen closed to oil and gas development. It has never been made part of \nthe Arctic Wildlife Refuge that was closed to such development. It has \nnever been wilderness. There is wilderness in the rest of the refuge, \nbut this is not wilderness.\n  I hear people saying we are proposing to drill in a wilderness area \nevery day. That is not true.\n  I ask unanimous consent this statement of select dates and Federal \npublic land history in Alaska be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Select Dates in Federal Public Lands History In Alaska\n\n       Feb. 27, 1923--Executive Order 3797-A (President Warren \n     Harding)--creates National Petroleum Reserve with six year \n     reservation for classification, examination and preparation \n     of plans for oil and gas development.\n       Jan. 22, 1943--Public Land Order 82 (Abe Fortas, Acting \n     Secretary of the Interior)--(1) All public lands in Alaska \n     withdrawn from sale, location, selection, and entry under the \n     public-land laws of the United States, including the mining \n     laws, and from leasing under the mineral-leasing laws; and \n     (2) the minerals in such lands reserved under the \n     jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior for use in \n     connection with the prosecution of the war.\n       Included public lands:\n       (1) Alaska Peninsula in South-Central Alaska.\n       (2) Katalla-Yaktaga region around the Copper River and \n     Chugach National Forest regions.\n       (3) All lands within the Chugach National Forest.\n       (4) 48 million acres of public and non-public lands in \n     Northern Alaska from Cape Lisburne to Canada (includes \n     today's ANWR).\n       The order did not affect or modify existing reservations of \n     any of the lands involved except to the extent necessary to \n     prevent the sale, location, selection, or entry of the \n     described lands under the public-land laws, including the \n     mining laws, and the leasing of lands under the mineral \n     leasing laws.\n       July 31, 1945--Public Land Order 289--(Abe Fortas, Acting \n     Secretary of the Interior) Amended Executive Order 3797-A by \n     deleting the six-year limit for classification, examination, \n     and preparation for oil and gas development of NPRA.\n       April 22, 1958--Public Land Order 1621--(Secretary of the \n     Interior Fred Seaton) Amended Public Land Order 82 by \n     allowing oil and gas exploration of approximately 16,000 \n     acres within the known geological structure of the Gubik gas \n     field.\n       Paragraph 3 of PLO 1621 established lands east of the \n     Canning River along the coast as the Arctic Wildlife Range \n     (approximately 5 million acres).\n       Paragraph 3 specifically states in regard to the Range: As \n     provided by the regulations in 43 CFR 295.11, the lands shall \n     remain segregated from leasing under the mineral leasing laws \n     and from location under the mining laws to the extent that \n     the withdrawals applied for, if effected would prevent such \n     leasing or locations, until action on the application for \n     withdrawal has been taken.\n       Paragraph 4 states: None of the released lands shall become \n     subject to oil and gas leasing until approved leasing maps \n     for such lands, or portions thereof, are from time to time \n     prepared, and notices of the time and place of filing thereof \n     and of the availability of lands for leasing have been \n     published in the Federal Register by the Bureau of Land \n     Management.

I am perfectly willing at any time to start the debate \non ANWR. I prefer to start it when we\n\n[[Page S2461]]\n\nknow we can have an up-or-down vote. We had one on CAFE. We opposed \nthat. I opposed that. I said at the time one of the reasons I did is I \ncome from a State where every person who has a car has an SUV. Until \nthey show me they are not going to outlaw them, we cannot support that. \nWe can support reasonable restrictions on the use of automobiles that \nwill lead us to have some savings, but savings doesn't produce oil.\n  Oil is a lot more than gasoline, by the way. As I have repeatedly \ntold people, everything from frisbees to panty hose comes out of the \nbarrel of oil, in addition to gasoline. It is time we got down to \ndiscussing this amendment. But it ought to be discussed in a manner in \nwhich the national security issue is considered. Oil is a national \nsecurity item for this country--more right now than at any other time \nexcept in the 1970s when we had an embargo. We are as near to an \nembargo as we have been since that time. As I said yesterday, I think \nwe are very close to embargo now.\n  Mr. President, the question of what happens to a barrel of oil has \nbeen very interesting. I showed this to the Senate some time ago. These \nare the items made from oil: Toothpaste, footballs, ink, lifejackets, \ntents, dyes, balloons, cameras, cranes, vitamin capsules, soft \ncontacts, panty hose, fertilizer, photographs, roofing material, \ncompact discs, shaving cream, perfumes, umbrellas, golf balls, \naspirins, house paint, lipstick, dentures, glue, clothing, deodorant. \nThousands of products come from oil.\n  People keep talking about CAFE standards being able to produce \nsavings and lead to somebody having oil--no, they are talking about \ngasoline. A barrel of oil is what we are talking about. We produce oil, \nthe gasoline is produced in refineries in the south 48.\n  Let me add this. One barrel of oil makes 44.2 gallons of economic \nessentials. Everyday products consume 56 percent, such as those I have \nmentioned. Gasoline takes 44 percent of the barrel. During the time of \nthe Persian Gulf war, at my request, as a matter of fact, the oil \nindustry increased the throughput to 2.1 million barrels a day. When I \nwas home last week, there were 950,000 barrels a day going through the \npipeline. Do you know why? The reserves are going down. It is \nuneconomic to produce at the rate we used to because reserves are going \ndown--our reserves over in the Arctic Plain. If we had that producing \nnow, we would not be buying a million barrels of oil a day from Iraq.\n  The only reason he can use oil as a weapon now is we have decreased \nthe throughput in the Alaskan pipeline. When it was running at full \ntilt, that pipeline carried, as I said, 2.1 million barrels a day. That \nwas 25 percent of the domestic oil produced in the United States. Today \nwe produce about 12 percent of the oil produced in the United States \nbecause we have been unable to get in there as was committed to us in \n1980, that we would be able to explore and develop the oil and gas in \nthat area, provided there would be no permanent harm to the fish and \nwildlife in the area.\n  The House bill--it is not before us now--set down a limit of 2,000 \nacres out of the 1.5 million acres. Only 2,000 acres on the surface can \nbe used for oil and gas development.\n  I hope we can get down to the point where we are discussing reality \nand we are discussing issues and not the issue of whether we have to \nhave 60 votes. The 60-vote requirement is only a requirement that comes \nfrom a leadership decision that a filibuster will be allowed.\n  I wish to God Senator Mansfield was still with us so he could come \nand say to us why he did what he did. He prohibited a filibuster on the \noil pipeline amendment. The same forces were opposed to it then that \nare opposed to ANWR now. In fact, the ads in the paper look almost the \nsame: caribou, mountains, D-8 Caterpillars.\n  One time I came to the floor after my good friend, Gaylord Nelson, \nleft the Senate and showed the Senate a brochure that came out of the \nWilderness Society. It had a picture of a D-8 Caterpillar over the top \nof a mountain out of a forest looking down with a beautiful lake with \ncaribou, bears, and everything standing around it, and that was \npurported to be the North Slope.\n  In the first place, there are no trees there. In the second place, \nall those animals are not there. In the third place, there is nothing \nthere except tundra. There is fish and wildlife, we agree to that. We \nhave had the studies made twice now that there will not be permanent \nharm to fish and wildlife, particularly the caribou.\n  I invite the majority--let's get a couple planes and fly up there and \nI will show you that place right now. Oil and gas activity only takes \nplace in the wintertime, not in the summertime. The caribou are there \nfor a maximum of 6 weeks and for 3 of the last 5 years they did not \ncome up there at all.\n  This idea that somehow we are going to ruin anything about my State \nby allowing this development of oil and gas to continue is absolutely \nwrong.\n  It is time we came down to the decision that there ought to be an up-\nor-down vote. I go right back to where we started. The Senate voted \ntwice on CAFE. It was not filibustered by this side. It was not \nfilibustered by this side because we agreed the whole issue of foreign \noil dependence and oil availability in this country is a national \nsecurity issue.\n  I hope the majority party will see fit to recognize that as such \nbefore we are through. If we live under the paradigm of getting 60 \nvotes, then I am willing to keep the Senate around until we get 60 \nvotes. It is time we really stood up for this. It is a national issue. \nIt is absolutely necessary, I believe, for the future of this country \nto have that oil produced. It can be produced and the gas can be \nproduced out of that area.\n  I might also say in passing that this is just a preliminary. We are \ngoing from this issue to the natural gas pipeline. The natural gas \npipeline will carry gas that has been produced in the process of the \nproduction of oil at Prudhoe Bay. Gas was produced with the oil and \nthen it was separated from the oil and reinjected into the ground. We \nknow there are trillions of cubic feet of gas down there because it has \nbeen produced and put back in the ground. There has been no \ntransportation mechanism.\n\n  We are very close to a decision now from the producers and the \npipeline companies to bring that gas down to markets in the Midwest. It \nwill be a 3,000-mile pipeline, maybe up to 1,500 miles of gathering \npipelines, buried gaslines running through Alaska, through Canada, all \nthe way down into Chicago. It will be the largest project in the \nhistory of man financed by private enterprise.\n  It will require over 400,000 workers to complete that project. It \nwill require new trucks, new backhoes, all kinds of new equipment to \nimprove the roads so trucks can run on the roads up in the north \ncountry. It is a massive project. The gas pipeline cannot be completed \nuntil about 2009. I hope to God I live to see it done. I thank the \nChair.\n\n\n   Amendments Nos. 3098 through 3102, En Bloc, to Amendment No. 2917\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Mr. President, I thank Senator Bingaman for offering an \namendment for me and Senator Landrieu to the energy bill regarding \nsmall business and energy efficiency. Quite simply, this amendment says \nthat as the Department of Energy and the Department of Environmental \nProtection work together to raise public awareness of the Energy Star \nProgram, they must make a special effort to reach out to small \nbusiness.\n  What is the Energy Star Program? It is an initiative that identifies \nand promotes energy-efficient products and buildings in order to reduce \nenergy consumption, improve energy security, and reduce pollution. \nBecause small businesses have little time and few resources to learn \nabout options for energy efficiency, within Energy Star there is a \nvoluntary and free program for small businesses that enables owners to \ncalculate the costs of energy efficiency upgrades, estimate payback \nperiods and explore providers of products, services, and financing.\n  It only makes sense to focus on small businesses. America's 25 \nmillion small businesses make up half the economy and, according to a \nreport by E SOURCE, entitled ``The Forgotten Majority: Small Business, \nHidden Opportunities,'' small businesses account for more than half of \nall the commercial energy used in North America. Small businesses \nrepresent significant buying power for energy efficient technologies, \nmany of which are developed and manufactured by small businesses. By \npromoting the development and use of energy efficient products and \npractices in our small businesses, we will not only help reduce energy \nuse and pollution, but we will also help small businesses cut costs, \nsaving billions of dollars, according to the Center for Small Business \nand the Environment. By reducing their bottom lines, small businesses \nincrease their competitiveness in the market.\n  In the last few years, I have held three hearings on small \nbusinesses, energy and the environment. Testimony after testimony from \npolicy experts to small business owners validated that investing in \nenergy-efficient and environmentally friendly technologies is a good \nbusiness, returning far more than compliance with environmental \nregulations.\n  While energy efficiency is a major cost-cutting option for small \nbusinesses, too few know about it or the Energy Star Program and \nendorsed Energy Star products. In addition to this amendment, there are \nother steps we can take to increase awareness. One, enlist the Small \nBusiness Administration to spread the word and coordinate efforts with \nthe EPA and DoE. Right now, in spite of a hearing we held last August \nregarding the business of environmental technology and the benefits of \nEnergy Star services to small businesses, SBA continues to bury Energy \nStar within its website. The three\n\n[[Page S2463]]\n\nagencies should coordinate their efforts, SBA has contact with \nthousands of small businesses daily, and is in a unique position to \nreach them compared to DoE and EPA.\n  Another step we should take is to have SBA's disaster loan program \nand Federal Emergency Management Agency promote Energy Star products \nwhen small businesses rebuild or replace equipment. Billions of dollars \neach year go to rebuilding businesses and homes, and it presents an \nexcellent opportunity to invest in products that are good for the \neconomy and the environment.\n  Last, for small businesses that do want to make upgrades, the upfront \ncost is often a deterrent, even with rebates from local utility \ncompanies. Small businesses typically don't have a lot of extra cash \nlying around to finance the purchases. SBA should find a way to work \nwith the DoE and EPA to facilitate upgrades by getting financing for \nqualified businesses through the SBA's loan programs. Because we know \nenergy efficient products increase profits, that should help lenders \napprove loans because there will be money for repayment.\n  I thank Senator Landrieu for joining me in offering this amendment. I \nthank Byron Kennard of the Center for Small Business and the \nEnvironment and his colleague Carol Werner for educating the public and \npolicy makers about the significance of small businesses to energy and \nenvironmental policy. And, lastly, I thank Senators Bingaman and \nMurkowski and their staff for making this amendment possible.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as a member of the Small Business \nCommittee, I just want to echo the remarks of my chairman and \ncolleague, Senator Kerry, concerning the amendment that we have \nproposed today. I also want to thank Chairman Bingaman for offering \nthis amendment for us. I know he has been exceptionally busy with the \nenergy bill the past few weeks, and I am grateful that he took the time \nto allow us to raise this issue.\n  I am proud to join Senator Kerry in support of this important \namendment. The Energy Star Program is an excellent program which can \nprovide a great deal of assistance to small businesses; but to \nparticipate in the program, these same businesses must be aware of the \nprogram. That is why coordinated outreach efforts by agencies like the \nSmall Business Administration, the Department of Energy, and the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency is so important.\n  Of particular importance, as Senator Kerry stated, is to get SBA \ninvolved in this effort. We need to provide for both the financial \nassistance and the information that our small businesses need to \nupgrade to more energy-efficient products. Because for every dollar \nthat these businesses spend on energy efficient products now, several \ndollars will be saved down the road. So this is something that makes \ngood economic sense.\n  As a member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I also \nbelieve that this amendment is important in the context of an overall \nenergy policy. After all, one of our priorities in the energy bill is \nto make our Nation more energy efficient, and less dependent on foreign \nsources of oil. If small businesses use more than half of all \ncommercial energy in North America, it makes a great deal of sense from \na national security perspective to help these businesses become more \nefficient.\n  So this is much more than a one-time purchase; this is a long-term \ninvestment. And the Federal Government, through the SBA in particular, \nhas a clear role in helping these small businesses make these \ninvestments, both through financing assistance and the dissemination of \nrelevant information. Again, I am happy to join Senator Kerry in \nsupport of this amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, these are five amendments that have been \ncleared on both sides: one by Senator Kennedy, one by Senator Kerry, \none by Senator Wellstone, one by Senator Conrad, and one by myself. I \nbelieve there is no objection to them. I urge the Senate to adopt them \nat this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendments? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendments.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3098 through 3102) were agreed to en bloc.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3097 To Amendment No. 2917\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. I send to the desk amendment No. 3097.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Dayton], for himself, Mr. \n     Wellstone, and Mr. Feingold, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3097 to amendment No 2917.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To require additional findings for FERC approval of an \n                        electric utility merger)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title II, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2____. ADDITIONAL ELECTRIC UTILITY MERGER PROVISIONS.\n\n       Section 203(a) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824b(a)) \n     (as amended by section 202) is amended by striking paragraph \n     (4) and inserting the following:\n       ``(4) Approval.--\n       ``(A) In general.--After notice and opportunity for \n     hearing, if the Commission finds that the proposed \n     transaction will advance the public interest, the Commission \n     shall approve the transaction.\n       ``(B) Minimum required findings.--In making the finding \n     under subparagraph (A) with respect to a proposed \n     transaction, the Commission shall, at a minimum, find that \n     the proposed transaction will--\n       ``(i)(I) enhance competition in wholesale electricity \n     markets; and\n       ``(II) if a State commission requests the Commission to \n     consider the effect of the proposed transaction on \n     competition in retail electricity markets, enhance \n     competition in retail electricity markets;\n       ``(ii) produce significant gains in operational and \n     economic efficiency; and\n       ``(iii) result in a corporate and capital structure that \n     facilitates effective regulatory oversight.''.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. I am pleased, along with Senator Wellstone, to present \nthis amendment. I certainly want to thank the chairman of the committee \nand the manager of the bill, Senator Bingaman, for his extraordinary \nefforts over the last weeks in regard to this regulation. It is \ndifficult because it reflects the varied interests of different parts \nof the country and, frankly, within my own State of Minnesota some very \ndifferent perspectives on how utility policies should be directed.\n  The electricity title is one that is of concern to the smaller \nutilities in Minnesota, particularly the municipal and cooperative \nelectric utilities because of its repeal of PUHCA and then because of \nthe lack of any regulatory oversight and control over the mergers of \nthese utilities. I remember when I was a youngster playing the game of \nmonopoly, the utility companies existed because they were monopolies \nand also that they were regulated because they were monopolies. I am \nconcerned and have been for some time--I saw this starting when I was \nCommissioner of Energy and Economic Development in Minnesota--as the \nregulations are taken off, they still, in many respects, have the same \nmonopoly control over markets and geographical regions they had before.\n  Because of the lessons of Enron, it seems to me we are going in the \nopposite direction if we are saying we are now going to remove any \nGovernment oversight before these mergers take place. We have seen in \nthe instance of telephone companies, the mergers of smaller companies \ninto larger local companies. I called my local telephone company in \nMinnesota and asked for a number in Bloomington, meaning Bloomington, \nMN, and they asked me: What State? I am asking for directory \nassistance. That is hardly your local telephone company.\n  We have seen in Minnesota a merger of our largest utility, formerly \nNorthern States Power, with another company, to make Xcel Energy. We \nsee these utilities having more and more control over the markets, and \nwe do not have a way, if we eliminate PUHCA, of looking out for the \npublic interest and the consumer interest. These mergers ought to go \nforward if they are going to benefit the public interest, but we have \nlearned over and over again that the lack of competition inevitably \nworks against the consumer\n\n[[Page S2464]]\n\ninterest, and that is where this amendment steps in.\n  If this bill were to pass in its present form, it would mean the \nrepeal of PUHCA. That is why this amendment, which I coauthored with my \ncolleague Senator Wellstone, would improve the language in the bill, in \nmy view, because it requires that these proposed utility mergers \nadvance the public interest. It spells out specific standards for the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission to consider in determining if a \nproposed merger advances the public interest.\n  It says FERC shall find at a minimum that, first, the merger enhances \ncompetition in wholesale electricity markets; second, that the merger \nproduces significant gains in operational and economic efficiency; and, \nthird, that the merger results in a corporate and capital structure \nthat facilitates effective regulatory oversight.\n  In the aftermath of Enron, I think it is particularly important that \nwe know this entity that is going to be coming out of this merger is \none which still exists in a way that can be overseen in a regulatory \nway, and that it is a genuine company; that it has a genuine financial \nunderpinning for the sake of investors, for the sake of consumers.\n  I think this amendment will fill a void which otherwise leaves this \ntitle decidedly neglectful of the protection of many of the residents \nin Minnesota, businesses, and particularly those in more rural parts of \nour State who still depend upon the smaller electricity and other \nenergy providers that, in this case, run the risk, if we are not \ncareful, of being swamped, driven out of business, and then underserved \nby those that come in as very large entities to take their place.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Dayton in \nthis effort. I think there are some other Senators who also want to \njoin in the debate. There are others who have some ideas about \nadditional consumer protection provisions, and we will see later on in \nthe debate whether or not we further modify the amendment.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer this amendment basically would \nstrengthen the underlying merger review standard that FERC would \nundertake, and I say with a smile to the Presiding Officer that \nbasically this is all about PUHCA. I mean, who the heck knows what \nPUHCA means? Public Utility Holding Company Act.\n  This is legislation that was actually in this bill and was basically \nrepealed, although the chair of the committee, Senator Bingaman has \ntried mightily to kind of work out a compromise arrangement to try to \nprovide some protection.\n  In Minnesota, the little people, the little interests, the smaller \nbusinesses, the smaller companies, they are really worried about this \nbecause we see the way in which we have had this wave of mergers.\n  In the last 3 years, there have been 30 major utility mergers and \nacquisitions. Everybody is really worried. It is a little bit like the \npackers and what we were trying to do to make sure our independent \nlivestock producers had some honest to goodness free enterprise, real \ncompetition. It is kind of analogous because a lot of the smaller \ncompanies and smaller businesses, much less a lot of rural citizens, \nare just real worried that without the protection we had with PUHCA on \nthese mergers, albeit it was not ever really enforced like it should \nhave been, that we are going to see a wave of more mergers, which are \nnot always bad. I want to get to that in a moment. That could very well \nbe to the detriment of consumers and some of the smaller companies that \nare driven out of existence.\n  I do not know whether or not we can win on this amendment. I have no \nidea, but I will say this, and I make this prediction tonight in this \nChamber: This decade there is going to be a lot of discussion and \ndebate and more focus on the whole problem of concentration of economic \npower in our economy. It is going to go in that direction. It is \neverywhere.\n  The Telecommunications Act in 1996 was supposed to be great for \neverybody. Cable rates were supposed to go down. They have not. It was \nsupposed to lead to all kinds of positive benefits.\n  One of the things that has happened is all of these local radio \nstations have been driven out of existence, and we have a few large \nconglomerates that are now controlling the flow of information in a \nrepresentative democracy. The same thing with banks, with the health \ninsurance industry, with the food industry and agriculture, and with \nenergy companies and utility companies. There comes a point in time \nwhere I think people in coffee shops in Minnesota are saying: Where is \nTeddy Roosevelt when we need him?\n  Let us talk about putting some free enterprise back into the free \nenterprise system. Let's have some protection for ordinary \ncitizens. That is what this amendment is about.\n\n  What this amendment does is simply apply the same merger review \nstandard under the Public Utility Holding Company Act to the FERC \nreview of electricity mergers. That is what we are worried about. That \nis why I think this bill is a step backwards. We have taken away this \nimportant review standard.\n  The electric utility industry is undergoing rapid consolidation. \nAgain, we are not speaking to a small issue. In the past 3 years, 30 \nmajor utility mergers and acquisitions have taken place. Not all of \nthese mergers are inherently bad. Some should not be prevented. Some of \nthe mergers can produce efficiencies, economies of scale, cost savings, \nand more. However, a merger can also reduce competition, increase \ncosts, and frustrate regulatory oversight.\n  Federal merger review policy should distinguish between those mergers \nthat promote the public interest and those mergers that do not. That is \nwhat we are saying. I think the ordinary people--which I don't mean in \na pejorative sense but in a positive way--ordinary citizens have a \nright to make sure their interests as consumers are protected.\n  This amendment improves the base language of the bill by doing a few \nthings:\n  One, requiring that proposed mergers promote the public interest in \norder to secure Federal regulatory approval. That is the threshold. If \nyou are going to do a merger, it could be it is good, but at least it \nought to be a standard that you are advancing the public interest.\n  Two, spelling out specific standards for assessing the impact on the \npublic interest. In other words, we spell that out in this amendment, \nincluding what will be the effect of this merger on competition, what \nis going to be its effect on operational efficiency, what is its effect \non regulatory oversight.\n  Three, expanding that all mergers between electric and gas utilities \nare reviewed. Given, by the way, the rather unpleasant experience we \nall had last year with natural gas prices, there is a real need to look \nat the natural gas utilities. That is part of what this amendment is \nabout.\n  Finally, preventing utilities from skirting Federal review by using \npartnerships or other corporate forms to avoid classification as a \nmerger.\n  Colleagues, this amendment does not impose new regulatory \nrequirements on the proposed utility mergers. Rather, the standards \ncontained in this amendment mirror those that have been in PUHCA, which \nthe bill would repeal. While the standards are comparable, the \namendment actually provides greater flexibility than under PUHCA. We \nare just trying to restore some consumer protection. PUHCA requires \nthat utilities be physically integrated in order to merge. The \namendment waives that requirement. PUHCA prevents the merger of \nmultistate electric and gas utilities. The amendment waives that \nrequirement. But we do provide for FERC review of such mergers.\n  Colleagues, I said on the Craig amendment, I think they were right in \ntheir concern about the repeal of PUHCA. The amendment was wrong \nbecause it basically also eliminated a section of the bill, which was \nthe renewable portfolio for electricity, which, as the Presiding \nOfficer knows, is important to our State--very important. From my point \nof view as a Senator from Minnesota, I did not vote for that amendment. \nHowever, I believe the part of the Craig amendment that was right on \ntarget was that we basically repeal PUHCA. Mr. Bingaman, the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, has put some good language in here and has taken some \npositive steps.\n\n[[Page S2465]]\n\n  But, again, the key point is we have a threshold which is the same \nthreshold we have had with PUHCA which goes back to the 1920s or 1930s. \nIf Senators think we do not need it anymore because there are no \nmergers or acquisitions, quite to the contrary; we ought not be giving \nup on the consumer protection. At the very minimum, we should have the \nlanguage that requires that the proposed mergers promote the public \ninterest. Then we get FERC approval. At the very minimum, we ought to \ndo that. Let's make sure they promote competition, make sure they are \ngood for consumers, make sure they add to economic efficiency.\n  Right now in this legislation, I am sad to say, we do not have that \nstandard. We are going to make a huge mistake if we do not have a \nstronger consumer protection standard and a stronger competition \nstandard. That is what this amendment is about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to \nproceed as in morning business for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, under the \nauthority granted to the majority leader on March 22, and with the \nconcurrence of the Republican leader, I now ask unanimous consent the \nSenate resume consideration of Calendar No. 239, S. 565, the election \nreform bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 565) to establish the Commission on Voting \n     Rights and Procedures to study and make recommendations \n     regarding election technology, voting, and election \n     administration, to establish a grant program under which the \n     Office of Justice Programs and the Civil Rights Division of \n     the Department of Justice shall provide assistance to States \n     and localities in improving election technology and the \n     administration of Federal elections, to require States to \n     meet uniform and nondiscriminatory election technology and \n     administration requirements for the 2004 Federal elections, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Clinton amendment No. 2906, to establish a residual ballot \n     performance benchmark.\n       Dodd (for Schumer) modified amendment No. 2914, to permit \n     the use of a signature or personal mark for the purpose of \n     verifying the identity of voters who register by mail.\n       Dodd (for Kennedy) amendment No. 2916, to clarify the \n     application of the safe harbor provisions.\n       Hatch amendment No. 2935, to establish the Advisor \n     Committee on Electronic Voting and the Electoral Process, and \n     to instruct the Attorney General to study the adequacy of \n     existing electoral fraud statutes and penalties.\n       Hatch amendment No. 2936, to make the provisions of the \n     Voting Rights Act of 1965 permanent.\n       Smith of New Hampshire amendment No. 2933, to prohibit the \n     broadcast of certain false and untimely information on \n     Federal elections.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the previous agreement with respect \nto S. 565 be modified to provide that all amendments remaining in order \nto the bill, first and any second-degree, must be offered and debated \nduring today's session; and that any votes ordered to occur with \nrespect to these amendments be stacked to occur at a time to be \ndetermined by the two leaders, in the sequence in which the amendments \nwere offered; that prior to each vote there be 2 minutes of closing \ndebate with the time equally divided and controlled in the usual form \nwithout further intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. On behalf of the majority leader, let me say, while the \nminority leader is here, the two managers of this bill, Senator Dodd \nand Senator McConnell, are to be applauded. What they have done is \nextraordinary. They should know that. This is tremendous for the \ncountry. It has been done on a bipartisan basis. These two Senators are \nto be congratulated.\n  There will be no more rollcall votes tonight. I have been advised by \nthe majority leader to announce that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator from Nevada will yield, just for a comment--\nand also to agree with him. I want to say to the Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Dodd, and Senator McConnell, they have been \npersistent. It would have been very easy to just let this reform effort \nslide off the end of the table, like so much else has, unfortunately, \nin the Senate. But they continued to work together. They continued to \ntry to find substantive agreements and also a procedural process to get \nthis done on sort of a second-track process. So I am pleased we have \nthis unanimous consent agreement, and I commend them both. I think we \nare going to wind up with a product that the Senate can be proud to \nsupport.\n  Let me just ask Senator Reid if he will yield to clarify how we \nproceed. Under the agreement, there were a number of amendments that \nwere identified with time limits. All those amendments will be \nconsidered tonight under this unanimous consent agreement, and then \ntomorrow, at a time we will agree to and announce later, all votes, if \nany--either on final passage or the amendments--would be stacked?\n  So that would occur in the morning and Senators need to know, if they \nare interested in these amendments, they will need to come to the \nChamber in the next couple of hours to deal with them. Is that correct? \nIs that your understanding?\n  Mr. REID. That is right, I say to the leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could be recognized before we begin, \nnow, under leader time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to talk a little bit about the energy \nbill, and then the managers of the election reform will be ready to go \nand we will take up that important legislation.\n  Mr. President, we need a national energy policy. I think the Congress \nknows that. I think the American people support that. I know the \nPresident of the United States supports that.\n  Right now we see the difficulties with which we are having to deal \naround the world: The instability in Venezuela with regard to oil \nsupply from that country, our concerns about the Middle East, the \nthreats from Saddam Hussein. We need our own national energy policy. We \nneed our own energy supplies. We need to encourage conservation, \nalternative fuels. We need the whole package. And we need to do it now.\n  This is a critical time. This is a matter of our economy, it is a \nmatter of the creation of more jobs, and it is national security. So we \nneed to do this.\n  I have not come to the Chamber and really pushed on this legislation. \nBecause of the way it was brought to the floor, which is not through \nthe Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I thought we were going to \nhave to do a lot of writing of the bill in the Senate. That is what has \nbeen happening. That is what has occurred. That is why it took so much \ntime. But we have spent 2 weeks on it now. This is the third week. It \nis obvious to me we are going over to next week. But I think it is time \nfor the leadership on both sides of the aisle to begin to press for \nthis legislation to be completed.\n  It would be a mistake for the leaders of either party to allow this \nlegislation to collapse after this amount of time, and on this \nimportant an issue. It is going to be very easy for Members on both \nsides of the aisle to say: I don't like it because of this reason; I \ndon't want it for that reason; I don't like this particular provision.\n  I don't care for the electricity section, but I just voted not to \nstrike it because I think we made some improvements. We ought to go to \nconference and see if we can improve it even more.\n  I think it is time that we bring up the ANWR amendment. Let's have a \ndebate. I am all for it. I think we need it. I think it is a source of \nsupply that\n\n[[Page S2466]]\n\nwe can get safely and in a reliable and affordable way that will help \nus with our future energy needs. But let's have the debate. Let's get \nit done. Let's have a vote.\n  Then we still have the tax provisiono. I think Senator Daschle and I \nare going to have to both be supportive of completing this legislation. \nI think we are going to have to come to the floor and encourage our \nmanagers to make progress and to make more progress than has occurred. \nIf we do not do it, we are not going to finish it next Tuesday or \nWednesday; it will be later, and then everything else is moved down the \nline--border security, the immigration reform known as the 245(i) \nissue, trade legislation, the cloning issue.\n  We have other work we need to do. So it is approaching that time when \nwe need to begin to be serious about amendments and be serious about \ngetting to final passage.\n  No formal unanimous consent agreement was exchanged or agreed to back \nwhen we went out for the Easter recess, but we did exchange some lists \nprior to that recess so we could get a look at about what number of \namendments we were talking. I understand there are about 160 amendments \nthat were indicated by the Democrats, and probably over 100 by the \nRepublicans--260 amendments? Nobody really believes that. We have \nnumerous Senators who have five or six or seven amendments that they \nwant. We are not going to have that. We are not going to leave that. A \nlot of these amendments are nonrelevant amendments. We could turn this \nenergy bill into a debate over tax policy or over agriculture policy or \nyou name it. But we need to keep it focused on energy.\n\n  The truth of matter is that I believe on our side of the aisle we are \ndown to 7 to 10 serious amendments. I don't know what the situation is \non the other side of the aisle. I know Senator Reid is doing his usual \ndue diligence, and he is working to try to get the list narrowed down. \nWe don't have locked in an agreement on the list. I am worried about \nwhat appears to be a slow rolling still going on. Look at what we have \ndone here today. We had a vote on one amendment. This afternoon, we had \na couple of quorum calls. We have an amendment pending, and I guess it \nis possibly going to be modified.\n  I understand we are going to have to have some debate about ethanol. \nDoes anybody think we are going to do that in 30 minutes? Does anybody \nthink we are really going to change what is in this bill on ethanol? \nNot really. You can debate about whether it is wrong or right, but the \nfact is the die is cast on that issue. We need to begin to deal with \nreality in this area.\n  I don't know where these amendments are. But I was very disturbed to \nhear it suggested yesterday that Republicans are slow rolling this bill \nwhen, as a matter of fact, we have been offering amendments. We have \nbeen getting votes. We have been working to narrow down our list.\n  We need a little help on the other side if we are going to complete \nthis legislation. I have been encouraging Senator Murkowski to go \nforward with the ANWR amendment. Let us have the amendment. Let us have \nthe debate. Let us get started. After we complete that, let us move to \nlock in the amendment list and begin to move toward finishing this \nbill. In order for that to occur, we will have to make a lot more \nprogress tomorrow, Friday, Monday, and Tuesday than we saw today.\n  Let us quit pointing fingers about who is not doing what. Let us quit \nthinking about what we might do if this bill doesn't work just to suit \nour particular desires. Let us get this legislation completed.\n  The Senate has a lot of work before it. We have over 50 bills that \nhave been sent over here from the House of Representatives with which \nwe haven't dealt. If we get to the middle of next week and we have not \ncompleted our work on this energy bill, or if we have this energy bill \npulled for whatever reason and we have another goose egg on our ledger, \nshame on us.\n  At this time in our history and what is going on in the world, if the \nSenate cannot pass an energy policy for our Nation, then I really just \nhave to wonder what we are going to be able to do together in a \nbipartisan way for our country.\n  I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. This is not \nintended to be partisan. I don't want it to be that way. I am saying to \neverybody it is time now that we begin to move to finish this bill and \nproduce a bill that can go to conference, which hopefully can be worked \nout, the President can sign it, and then in the future hopefully we \nwill have more national security and economic security than we will \nhave without it.\n  I thank my colleagues for allowing me to have this moment to \nencourage a result. Maybe we can follow the example of what we are \nabout to see on election reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n  The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] proposes an amendment \nnumbered 3107.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Amendments \nSubmitted''.)\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of my amendment to the \nbipartisan Equal Protection and Voting Rights Act of 2002. First let me \nthank my colleagues Senators Dodd, McConnell, Schumer, McCain, \nTorricelli, and Bond for all the hard work that they have put into this \nbill. I also want to thank Senator Leahy and Senator Cantwell for \ncosponsoring this amendment, which will lay the groundwork for \nintegrating new technology into the political process. Their expertise \non technological issues made their input invaluable.\n  Why is voter turnout so low? According to a recently released Census \nBureau report, of the 19 million people who registered but did not vote \nin the 200 election, more than one in five reported that they did not \nvote because they were too busy. Despite the close nature of the 2000 \nelection, the 55 percent voter turnout rate was just barely better than \nthe 1996 record low. Registration rates also dropped significantly \nbetween the 1996 and 200 Presidential elections. Can technological \nadvances, like the Internet, increase participation in the electoral \nprocess by making voter registration easier or by simplifying the \nmethod of voting itself? As the elected representatives of the people, \nwe should consider every option available that might help involve more \nof our country's citizens in America's democratic process. Federal, \nState, and local governments are duty bound to encourage all eligible \nAmericans to exercise their right to vote.\n  As many of us have seen in the recent past, more and more State are \nlooking at ways to utilize the Internet in the political process. \nProposals include online voter registration, online access to voter \ninformation, and online voting. State and local officials around the \ncountry are anxious to use the Internet to foster civic action. I think \nthat this is a positive step. Real questions remain, however, as to the \nfeasibility of securely using the Internet for these functions. How can \nwe be sure that the person who registers to vote online is whom he or \nshe claims to be? How can we ensure that an Internet voting process is \nfree from fraud? How much will this technology cost? There are also \nimportant sociological and political questions to consider. For \nexample, will options like online registration and voting increase \npolitical participation, or could the Internet be equitably used in the \npolitical process? These and other questions deserve our attention.\n\n  The Hatch-Leahy amendment neutrally addresses these issues in two \nways: one, it establishes a bipartisan advisory committee that will \nprovide a necessary framework for discussing the possible uses and \nabuses of the Internet in the voting process; and two, it directs the \nAttorney General to review existing criminal statutes and penalties and \nreport to the Senate and the advisory committee whether additional \npenalties for interfering with online registration and voting are \nneeded.\n  No American who has exercised his or her right to vote should ever \nhave to wonder if their properly cast vote will be counted. We must \npreserve the integrity of the voting process and I commend the efforts \nof those who have drafted this bill. The Hatch-Leahy amendment \ncomplements the bill and will help ensure the legitimacy of the voting \nprocess. As we continue to address the current problems with our voting \nprocess, we can and should take this opportunity to examine the impact \nof new technologies on our elections.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this amendment has been approved on \nboth sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3107) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Kansas is here and \nprepared to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \ncompletion of the remarks by the Senator from Kansas, the Senator from \nNew York, Mrs. Clinton, be recognized to debate her amendment, if that \nwould be appropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2907\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I have at the desk an amendment numbered \n2907, and I ask for its consideration at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Roberts] proposes anamendment \n     numbered 2907.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To eliminate the administrative procedures of requiring \n   election officials to notify voters by mail whether or not their \n                      individual vote was counted)\n\n       On page 12, beginning with line 20, strike through page 14, \n     line 2, and insert the following:\n       (5) At the time that an individual casts a provisional \n     ballot, the appropriate State or local election official \n     shall give the individual written information that states \n     that any individual who casts a provisional ballot will be \n     able to ascertain through a free access system (such as a \n     toll-free telephone number or an Internet website) whether \n     the vote was counted, and, if the vote was not counted, the \n     reason that the vote was not counted.\n       (6) The appropriate State or local election official shall \n     establish a free access system (such as a toll-free telephone \n     number or an Internet website) that any individual who casts \n     a provisional ballot may access to discover whether the vote \n     of that individual was counted, and, if the vote was not \n     counted, the reason that the vote was not counted.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, this amendment is offered by myself and \nthe distinguished Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, and the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky, Mr. McConnell, be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my friend from \nCalifornia to offer an amendment to the provisional voting section \nunder the election reform bill.\n  This amendment improves on the voting requirement found on Section \n102 (page 13.) Specifically, current language requires--emphasize the \nword ``requires''--election officials to notify voters in writing by \nmail, within 30 days after the election as to whether their provisional \nvote was counted.\n  Our amendment eliminates the 30 day mail notification requirement. \nInstead, it requires states to implement a free-access system so the \nvoter can find out quickly and efficiently whether his or her vote was \ncounted. This can be done through an Internet web site, a toll-free \nnumber, or by any means available, so long as voters have access to \nthis information.\n  We think the current language on provisional voting is restrictive. \nBy communicating through mail, we run the risk of voters never knowing \nwhether a vote was counted. Incorrect\n\n[[Page S2469]]\n\naddresses and lost mail are all factors to consider.\n  Let us also remember that the Senate's own mail system was in turmoil \n3 months after the anthrax attacks. So you really don't know what to \nexpect. As we painfully discovered, the mail is very vulnerable. It is \nnot unlikely that a similar scenario could take place during an \nelection year.\n  Secondly, the whole purpose of this debate is to improve the election \nprocess. Now, I have been told, with some very good advice by my good \nfriend, Secretary Ron Thornburg, the secretary of state in Kansas and \nthe president of the National Association of Secretaries of State, \nrepresenting all secretaries of state all throughout the country, that \nsending out mass mailings within 30 days of an election or primary is \nvery burdensome and costly. He writes:\n\n       I do not believe it is reasonable or expedient to require \n     the election officer to formally notify the voter by mail as \n     to the disposition of the ballot. If written into law, this \n     provision will cause unnecessary burden and expense to \n     election officers who are very busy after the election \n     finalizing vote tabulations and preparing for official \n     certification of election results.\n\n  What am I talking about?\n  Let's just examine the duties that are performed by election officers \nduring the 30-day period after an election all across the country. They \nmust--and I am going to itemize some things right now--conduct campaign \nfinance report deadlines. They must prepare a national/State election \nabstract for submission to the secretary of state. They must prepare \nballots, and the tabulation of results, and other election materials. \nThey must research the provisional ballots to determine whether or not \nthey are valid. They must conduct recounts of primaries if requested. \nThey must begin to prepare for the general election, including the \nfinalizing of the candidate lists and ballot forms and precinct \nelection board worker appointments. They also have to update the voter \nregistration rolls.\n  Now, that is a lot of work to do immediately after an election. And \nthose are just a few duties in a laundry list of obligations that all \nelection officers must complete after an election. Further, in the 2000 \ngeneral election, over 22,000 provisional votes were cast in the State \nof Kansas alone. Sending out a 30-day mass mailing is another burden \nadded for these election officials--22,000.\n  We do not advocate--we do not advocate--a prohibition on anyone from \nobtaining information as to whether a vote was counted or not--that is \nabsolutely essential--but let's not ignore what I call common sense. \nHaving a free access system is not burdensome on voters.\n  If this is a problem in small States, it is magnified a thousand \ntimes in the larger States. Take California. This is why the \ndistinguished Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, is a cosponsor \nof the bill. Bradley J. Clark, president of the California Association \nof Clerks and Election Officials, wrote a letter expressing concern \nwith these requirements. He wrote:\n  We specifically oppose the section that would establish rigid \nrequirements and time lines for notifying hundreds of thousands of \nprovisional voters whether or not their provisional ballots were \ncounted. The provisional voter notification provisions currently \nwritten in the bill would do nothing more than antagonize those voters \nwho were determined ineligible.\n\n  Election officials can make better use of their time in improving the \nelection process rather than exerting energy and resources on mass \nmailings. This amendment does not eliminate the use of mass mailings. \nLet me repeat this: We are not saying you can't use a mass mailing. \nStates can do this if they want. I would advise the distinguished \nSenator from Connecticut, who has a lot of concern about this, that \nStates can go ahead and use the mass mailing provision if they want. It \ndoes not eliminate it. Nor does it eliminate the 10-day notification \nrequirement. If a State wishes to contact voters by mail, they can \nretain that right. Our amendment simply gives the election officials \nthat option or the State that option.\n  Now, some might ask, What is wrong with requiring the 30-day mailing \nalong with the free access system? Why don't we retain both? The answer \nto that is very simple. It gives provisional voters a false sense of \nreliance that they will be notified by mail. In other words, if they \nbelieve they will receive a mailing, why would they then make an effort \nto check any other means of communication--either a toll-free number \nor, say, by simply using a Web site?\n  Again, change of address, loss in the mail, and the ever looming \nthreat of some kind of attack on our postal system make mail a less \nreliable means of communication.\n  A centralized calling system does not--does not--in any form \ndisenfranchise voters. We need to have faith in a voter's ability to \nmake a simple phone call or visit their local library to use their \ncomputer facilities. This does not create an undue burden. Rather, it \nis an undue burden if we give voters false reliance that they may or \nmay not receive any notification through the mail.\n  Here is something else I would really bring to the attention of the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut. It is important that we \nregister voters. Under this amendment, a voter will know within 10 days \nwhether their vote was counted or whether they need to register. Let me \nrepeat that. A voter is going to be informed within 10 days. With the \nmail, they may not know for 3 or even 4 weeks the status of their vote \ncast in a primary, giving them less time to register for a general \nelection.\n  If we adopt this amendment, we are going to have more people \nregistered, more people taking part in the election process.\n  Finally, the goal of this bill is to improve the election process. \nLet's give election officials more time to improve administration, \nrather than burden them with more mass mailings that may or may not be \nreceived by the voter. This is a simple, commonsense approach that \ngives voters a greater chance of knowing whether their vote was \ncounted. It has support from the other side of the aisle, from all \nelection officials, all secretaries of state. I ask for its adoption.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, This is a very simple amendment that \naddresses a serious concern raised by State and local election \nofficials.\n  The underlying bill provides a mechanism for voters to ascertain the \ndisposition of their ballot--through a free access system, such as a \ntelephone or internet site or another means which they can create.\n  The bill goes further to require State or local officials to notify \nin writing if a provisional ballot is not counted. This is the \nprovision which has caused a great deal of angst among those who \nadminister our elections.\n  The administrative task and cost involved with implementing this \nrequirement could be enormous in heavily populated States. It also will \nsubject the individual who signs the letter to a great deal of \ncriticism, scrutiny and potential legal action.\n  This amendment makes sense and does not undermine a voter's ability \nto determine whether their provisional ballot was counted. The free \naccess system will provide unfettered access to this information.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with the bipartisan cosponsors in \nsupport of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3108\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nthat it be called up for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to laying aside the pending \namendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mrs. Clinton] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3108.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To establish a residual ballot performance benchmark)\n\n       Beginning on page 8, line 19, strike through page 9, line \n     3, and insert the following:\n       (5) Error rates.--\n       (A) In general.--The error rate of the voting system in \n     counting ballots (determined by taking into account only \n     those errors\n\n[[Page S2470]]\n\n     which are attributable to the voting system and not \n     attributable to an act of the voter) shall not exceed the \n     error rate standards established under the voting systems \n     standards issued and maintained by the Director of the Office \n     of Election Administration of the Federal Election Commission \n     (as revised by the Director of such Office under subsection \n     (c)).\n       (B) Residual ballot performance benchmark.--In addition to \n     the error rate standards described in subparagraph (A), the \n     Director of the Office of Election Administration of the \n     Federal Election Commission shall issue and maintain a \n     uniform benchmark for the residual ballot error rate that \n     jurisdictions may not exceed. For purposes of the preceding \n     sentence, the residual vote error rate shall be equal to the \n     combination of overvotes, spoiled or uncountable votes, and \n     undervotes cast in the contest at the top of the ballot, but \n     excluding an estimate, based upon the best available \n     research, of intentional undervotes. The Director shall base \n     the benchmark issued and maintained under this subparagraph \n     on evidence of good practice in representative jurisdictions.\n       (C) Historically high intentional undervotes.--\n       (i) The Senate finds that there are certain distinct \n     communities in certain geographic areas that have \n     historically high rates of intentional undervoting in \n     elections for Federal office, relative to the rest of the \n     Nation.\n       (ii) In establishing the benchmark described in \n     subparagraph (B), the Director of the Office of Election \n     Administration of the Federal Election Commission shall--\n\n       (I) study and report to Congress on the occurrences of \n     distinct communities that have significantly higher than \n     average rates of historical intentional undervoting; and\n       (II) promulgate for local jurisdictions in which that \n     distinct community has a substantial presence either a \n     separate benchmark or an exclusion from the national \n     benchmark, as appropriate.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, the amendment I offer today is very \nsimilar to the amendment I offered a number of weeks ago at the \nbeginning of this important debate. I appreciate the great support and \ngood suggestions my colleagues have provided. And I particularly thank \na colleague who suggested that this amendment should be entitled--\nrather than the ``Residual Vote Error Rates'' amendment, which is a \nmouthful--the ``Leave No Vote Behind'' amendment.\n  So that is how I shall refer to it. Why? Because this amendment is \nabout ensuring that we do just that: Leave no vote behind, that we do \neverything we reasonably can to ensure that everyone's vote is counted.\n  This amendment is neither liberal nor conservative. It is neither \nDemocrat nor Republican. But it goes to the very heart of the \nreliability and accountability of our electoral system.\n  Every voter who goes to the polls or votes by absentee or votes in \nany other manner that is appropriate under our laws should know that \nthat effort was not in vain. It is truly American to ensure that we \ngive every one of our citizens the confidence to believe our Federal \nelection system is the best it can be. Therefore, this amendment is \ncritical to our deliberations because year after year--not just in 2000 \nbut in every year--in every State, ballots were not counted because of \nso-called residual votes. There are overvotes. There are undervotes. \nThere are spoiled votes. According to the Caltech/MIT Report:\n\n       Over the past four presidential elections [going back, \n     therefore, 16 years] the rate of residual votes in \n     presidential elections was slightly over two percent. This \n     means that in a typical presidential election over 2 million \n     voters did not have a presidential vote recorded for their \n     ballots.\n\n  The percentage of discarded ballots is even higher in a Senate \nelection, which, I suppose, should get us all thinking.\n  But it is imperative we recognize that some of these are legitimate \nerrors. Some of these are the problems that elderly people have in \npunching the little chad through the hole. Some of it is confusion with \nrespect to the appropriate place to make the mark which is made.\n  For all the reasons that lie behind these uncounted votes, the \nCommission, headed by former Presidents Ford and Carter, recommended, \nunanimously, that Congress needs to focus not just on the machine or \nmechanical errors in improving our election system, but on the \nunintentional human errors as well. The Commission did so because only \nby measuring the rate of these residual vote errors will we be able to \nassess effectively whether the voting process as a whole is giving all \nof our citizens the equal opportunity to have their votes counted.\n\n  That is why I have offered this amendment, which would require the \nnewly established Office of Election Administration to establish a \nresidual vote error rate, a standard or benchmark with which voting \nsystems will have to comply. It is a transfer of authority and \nexpertise to the body that we are setting up to make determinations \nabout our mechanical and machine errors.\n  Since I offered this amendment back in February, it has been \nimproved, thanks to the suggestions made by Senator Bingaman, who asked \nto be shown as an original cosponsor. He proposed and now included in \nthe leave no vote behind amendment language that would give the Office \nof Election Administration even greater flexibility in setting the \nresidual error rate standard.\n  Senator Bingaman pointed out there are certain distinct communities \nin some parts of our country that have a historically high rate of \nintentional undervoting in elections for Federal office compared to the \nrest of the country. Therefore, the language added by Senator Bingaman \nrequires the Office of Election Administration to report to Congress on \nthe extent to which this is happening and permits the office either to \nset a separate benchmark or exclude whole areas. This gives us the \nrequisite flexibility that the office requires, and I certainly hope \nour colleagues will support this amendment because, in the absence of \ntaking some action on this issue, we are not going to be responding to \nwhat were the most serious questions raised in the past election.\n  This is also in keeping with the other voting system standards in the \nbill. The mechanical rate standard, as important as that is, does not \naddress this human error rate.\n  Before I lose my voice and leave it behind, I would certainly urge my \ncolleagues' support of this important amendment that would leave no \nvote behind and give greater assurance to voters no matter where they \nlive that their votes truly will be counted.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \namendment offered by the Senator from New York. The bill currently \nprovides for benchmark error rates for voting systems used in Federal \nelections. This bill appropriately provides that, in determining the \nerror rate, only those errors which are attributable to voting machines \nare included. Errors attributable to an act of the voter, such as an \novervote, spoiled vote, or undervote, are not included in the \nbenchmark. This amendment would wrongly require a second benchmark \nerror rate for voter errors. In other words, ballots intentionally or \nunintentionally spoiled by a voter would be included in the error rate.\n  As long as there have been elections, there has been voter error. \nState and local officials will tell you that they see voter error in \nevery single election.\n  As the Ford-Carter commission acknowledged, some portion of the \nresidual vote number comes from intentional undervotes which can vary \nconsiderably from place to place, along with local cultures and \ntradition. I can say for myself, I frequently have not voted in every \nsingle race on the ballot, particularly for races where I felt I didn't \nknow enough about the candidates to cast a vote. It is an intentional \nact on my part.\n  A State can't force people to follow directions. A State can't force \npeople to vote as we would like them to or as we think they should. \nThis amendment will do just that.\n  Let's look at what the review of uncounted Florida ballots in the \n2000 election revealed about intentionally spoiled ballots. Nearly \n1,000 people voted for all 10 Presidential candidates in 2000. More \nthan 3,600 people voted for every Presidential candidate except Bush, \nand more than 700 people voted for every Presidential candidate except \nGore.\n  More recently, in Palm Beach, FL made infamous in the 2000 elections \ncounty election officials spent $14 million upgrading voting equipment \nto touch screen computers. In an election held last month, the \nundervote was 3 percent. No matter what you do, some people are simply \nnot going to participate or are going to participate in a way that we \nmight find somewhat odd.\n  Primaries held in Chicago last month showed that the undervote varies \nwidely. In Chicago, new ballot machines\n\n[[Page S2471]]\n\ngive voters the chance to fix a voting mistake. The machines inform \nvoters if they have undervoted or overvoted, and they are offered the \noption of correcting that ballot or casting a new one.\n  The Chicago Tribune reported that even with these new machines, in \nthe Democratic primary for Governor, 6.1 percent of the voters did not \nvote for the race at the top of the ticket. They just chose not to. The \nundervote in the Republican attorney general's race was a whopping 12.5 \npercent. They didn't like these guys. They chose not to vote in that \nrace.\n  This amendment proposes to set a number of so-called residual votes \nor voter errors that would be allowed. What would happen when the so-\ncalled benchmark is exceeded? The Department of Justice would sue \nStates and localities which have residual rates above those which are \npermitted by the Federal Government. The practical effect is that \nStates will calculate how many residual votes they are permitted in an \nelection, divide those by precinct, and notify those poll workers how \nmany residual votes they are allowed. In calculating this allowance, \nofficials will have to account for errors on absentee ballots as there \nis nothing that can be done to change those ballots.\n  Poll workers will monitor how many residual votes they have. And when \nthey approach their limit under threat of Department of Justice \nprosecution, they will force voters to vote, or change how they voted \nin an election. This is exactly the wrong approach.\n  This bill focuses our efforts on the right approach. It provides a \nbenchmark for measuring the reliability of voting machines. It provides \nfor increasing voter education and encouraging voter responsibility. If \na voter has a question, they should ask it. If they are unsure about \nthe voting process, they should seek assistance. We must preserve a \nsystem that values and respects the secrecy of the ballot.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote against the Clinton \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3109\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there is an amendment by Senator \nNickles that has been cleared on both sides. I send that amendment to \nthe desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for Mr. Nickles, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3109.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 18 between lines 7 and 8; insert: (4) technological \n     security of computerized list. The appropriate state or local \n     official shall provide adequate technological security \n     measures to prevent the unauthorized access to the \n     computerized list established under this section.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment Senator McConnell, Senator \nDodd, Senator Bond, and Senator Schumer on their hard work on this \nelection reform bill. I would also like to thank them for adding what I \nthink is a very important provision to this bill.\n  The bill mandates that States implement a computerized statewide \nvoter registration list, creating a central database that will allow \nState and local election officials continuous access to ensure that new \nregistered voters are added and that individuals whose names should be \nremoved from the list are removed. This computerized list will prove to \nbe an important tool in ensuring that only registered eligible voters \nbe allowed to vote. In creating this interactive computerized list, \nthough, it is important that only those officials who are authorized be \ngranted access to this list. In furtherance of this goal, my amendment \ndirects State and local election officials to establish and maintain \nreasonable procedures to protect the security and integrity of the \ncomputerized list.\n  As interactive computer programs become more prevalent and more \npersonal information is transmitted and stored via such programs, we \nmust constantly seek to protect personal information secure from theft. \nIn our effect to create a system that allows for easier maintenance of \nvoter rolls, we must make sure that we don't make available information \nthat will allow computer hackers to manipulate voter rolls as well as \naccess our bank accounts, charge accounts or other personal \ninformation.\n  This amendment seeks to strengthen the security and confidentiality \nof information displayed via the interactive computerized list. The \namendment's purpose is to keep the interactive list secure. It is not \nmeant to limit information to the public that is otherwise available. \nAgain, I thank Senators Dodd and McConnell for their hard work on this \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3109) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3110\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nSenator Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for Mr. Levin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3110.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To permit voter information contained in a written \n affirmation to be used to verify the eligibility of an individual to \n  vote in an election for Federal office, rather than the provisional \nballot, for the purpose of determining whether that provisional ballot \n             should be counted as a vote in that election)\n\n       On page 12, strike lines 9 through 19, and insert the \n     following:\n       (3) An election official at the polling place shall \n     transmit the ballot cast by the individual or voter \n     information contained in the written affirmation executed by \n     the individual under paragraph (2) to an appropriate State or \n     local election official for prompt verification under \n     paragraph (4).\n       (4) If the appropriate State or local election official to \n     whom the ballot or voter information is transmitted under \n     paragraph (3) determines that the individual is eligible \n     under State law to vote in the jurisdiction, the individual's \n     provisional ballot shall be counted as a vote in that \n     election.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, my amendment will ensure that the Michigan \nsystem of provisional voting, a highly progressive system, will not be \ndisturbed or disrupted by the language of this bill.\n  Michigan is often cited as an example of a ``best practices'' state \nin terms of elections. Provisional voting works like this in Michigan: \non election day, if a voter's name does not appear on the precinct \npolling list; the election workers verify whether the voter is actually \nregistered in the jurisdiction. This means that the election workers \ncheck with the computerized statewide voter file, in Michigan; this is \ncalled the Qualified Voter File, or QVF. The voter signs an affidavit \nasserting that a voter registration was submitted prior to the close of \nstate registration and identifies himself or herself. The voter than \ncompletes a new voter registration application and is issued a ballot. \nThe ballot is cast and counted on election day; however, the ballot is \ntagged in a manner that permits a court of law in a contested election \ncase to connect the voter to the specific ballot if it is later \ndetermined the voter was not qualified to cast the ballots.\n  This provisional voting system works well in Michigan and I would \nlike to ensure that Michigan is able to maintain its system under the \npending legislation. I have spoken with several county and statewide \nelection officials in Michigan, who have raised concerns that Michigan \nmight be inadvertently required under the pending bill to alter the way \nMichigan currently conducts provisional voting.\n  My amendment will ensure that will not happen and I greatly \nappreciate the managers accepting this amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this amendment has also been cleared on both \nsides. I urge its adoption.\n\n[[Page S2472]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3110) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2907\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if I may take a minute or so--I know Senator \nBond is here; we are waiting for a couple of other Senators who may \ncome over--for just a brief comment on Senator Roberts' amendment.\n  I don't know if there is anyone in this Chamber for whom the body has \nmore affection than Pat Roberts of Kansas, let me say very loudly and \nclearly, having described him as the Senator from Nebraska. I apologize \nto him and his State for that--not that Nebraska is not a fine State, I \nquickly add.\n  Let me say to my colleague and to others on the Roberts amendment--\nthere are a couple of other people who have joined with him on the \namendment--my concern about it. We worked on this bill with provisional \nballoting which is a very important and significant part of this bill.\n  People who go in to vote are going to cast a ballot even when there \nis a debate about whether or not they have a right to be there. Setting \naside that provisional ballot, if in fact there is that debate, if the \nvoter is correct, that ballot will be counted; if not, it will not be \ncounted. We will never again be faced with a system, once this \nprovision becomes part of the law in 2004, where a person will be \nthrown out of line without casting a provisional ballot. In a sense, \nall eligible voters will be able to exercise your franchise.\n  The issue is this. I understand my colleague's point. The question \nis, once that ballot has been cast, the State or the locality can then \ninform the voter whether or not the provisional ballot actually was \ncounted or not, and if it was not counted, why not, so the voter can \nthen correct that mistake. The point Senator Bond made--and we have \nconstantly quoted him on this--that ``this bill is designed to make it \neasier to vote and harder to cheat.''\n  The particular point I am trying to make goes to the first part of \nthat sentence--``easier to vote.'' When a person goes to the poll, \ncasts a ballot, and believe they are registered when it turns out, in \nfact the State or local election official has not registered the voter, \nthen there is a 1-800 number, or something else they might call in on. \nI think such access is essential. It may help alleviate the need for a \npiece of mail going out. It may help eliminate the responsibility to \nnotify the voter that there is a problem, that his or her vote did not \ncount because proper action was not taken and this is what needs to be \ndone. These kinds of mechanisms can help break the chain of continuous \ndisenfranchisement.\n  I think this goes to the heart of the purpose of provisional \nballoting. This means that the voter does not show up again at the next \nelection and say: I voted the last time. And they would say: That is \ntrue, but your vote didn't count. They might say: You could have called \nme. You could argue which side has the responsibility. However, I don't \nthink it is asking too much to let the voter know the circumstances. As \na result, the voter can correct his or her mistake and become a fully \nfranchised participant in the elections process. That is the heart of \nthis matter.\n  For those reasons, I will be urging our colleagues to vote against \nthe Roberts amendment when it comes up for consideration tomorrow. \nAgain, I have great respect for my colleague from Kansas. He makes a \npoint that is not without merit. I will not suggest this is totally \nwithout merit since because there is an attempt to try to at least stay \non track with ensuring the constitutionally guaranteed right to vote to \neach eligible voter and to make it easier to cast a provisional ballot. \nHowever, the amendment would not serve the goal of helping such \neligible voters overcome circumstances that preserve their status as a \nprovisional voters and would not permit such voters to easily correct \nmistakes. That is the reason I will, with some degree of reluctance, \nurge defeat of the amendment. Others want to be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I want to address, very briefly, the \namendment of the Senator from New York. We put too much time and effort \ninto this without taking just a moment to express my thanks to the \nSenator from Connecticut, the Senator from Kentucky, and their staffs \nfor a lot of work that has gone into this effort. It is with great \npride and much relief to be back on the floor today, we hope, \ncompleting work on election reform.\n  The 2000 election opened the eyes of many Americans to the flaws and \nfailures of the election machinery, our voting systems, and how we \ndetermine what a vote is. We learned of hanging chads and inactive \nlists. We discovered our military's votes were mishandled and lost and \nnot counted. We learned of legal voters who were turned away, while \ndead voters cast ballots. We discovered that many people voted twice, \nwhile too many people were not counted even once. Finally, that is why \nwe are here today.\n  This final compromise bill--and it is a compromise in the truest \nsense of the word. I have never seen any more effort to reach a \ncompromise, to try to accommodate the legitimate concerns on all sides, \nthan I have seen in this effort. I believe that, while nothing we do is \nperfect, we have gone a long way toward meeting those concerns.\n  The $3.5 billion in this bill provided in funding over the next 5 \nyears should make a significant improvement for States and localities \nto improve and update their voting systems. We also provide specific \nminimum requirements for the voting systems so that we can be assured \nthat the machinery meets minimum error rates and the voters are given \nthe opportunity to correct any errors they have made prior to their \nvotes being cast.\n  The bill also provides funding to help ensure that the disabled have \naccess to the polling place and the voting system is fully accessible \nto those with disabilities. Nobody has been a greater champion for \nassuring the ability of those with disabilities to vote than the \nSenator from Connecticut; his passion for this is unmatched. I believe \nand trust that we will see a significant improvement that will be a \ngreat benefit to all of our citizens with disabilities.\n  A new election administration commission is created to be a \nclearinghouse for the latest technologies and improvements. The Senator \nfrom Kentucky worked long and hard on that. We incorporate several \nrecommendations by the Carter-Ford commission, and particularly the \nrequirement that States set up a statewide voter registration system. \nThat is going to help solve a lot of problems, from confused \nregistration lists that lose voters' registrations to ineligible \nvoters. It should keep the registration lists more up to date, and it \nwill eliminate the duplicates and assist voters who move within a \nState.\n  Then the bill also goes on to address one of my key concerns, and \nthat is the issue of fraud. Much has been said about the issue. Much \nmore will be said, but as the Senator from Connecticut noted when we \nbegan this long journey 10 months ago, we agreed on the basic \nprinciple--we must make it easier to vote and tougher to cheat. That \nought to be everybody's goal in election reform. I think this bill \nmeets the test and the conference report will need to meet this simple \ntest, too.\n  I have heard some critics--and unfortunately, it has been out there \nso long we have generated a backlash. Some of the critics say it is \ngoing to require every voter in America to show a photo identification \nbefore they are allowed to vote each time.\n\n  Well, I have been involved in politics for a number of years, so I \nknow the art of the big deception, as in the belief that the bigger the \ndeception, the greater the chance you will get away with it. So to give \nthe public, or anybody who may be watching or listening, a fighting \nchance to get the facts--and I hope that somebody in the media is \nlistening today as well--let me just go through the compromise.\n  First, as most of you know, in my home State of Missouri, in St. \nLouis, we have seen a number of interesting figures registering to vote \nrecently. There was Albert ``Red'' Villa, Joline Joyce, the mother of \nthe prosecuting attorney, or circuit attorney in St. Louis, and, of \ncourse, the famous Ritzy Meckler. Each of these people, and dogs, \npulled off their remarkable feat because they were able to register by \nmail. Even in St. Louis it would have been hard to believe they would \nhave gotten on the voter rolls if they registered in person. Red Villa \ndied 10\n\n[[Page S2473]]\n\nyears ago, and Ms. Joyce died slightly more recently than that. Ritzy \nMeckler, of course, is a lovable spaniel, a dog, that is registered to \nvote. All three of them signed ``their names'' on the registration \nrolls.\n  So to some who say that all we need is a signature, I say that has \nbeen the source of a lot of fraud in St. Louis and, I believe, \nelsewhere.\n  All we say is, if you choose to register by mail, you will need to \nprovide some proof of identity to an election official at some point in \nthe process before you vote the first time. Dead people and dogs need \nnot apply. The proof of identity requirement only applies one time--the \nfirst time--to those who choose to register by mail. What does the \nindividual need to provide? A photo identification. This will obviously \nbe the simplest and easiest for many. Student identification, driver's \nlicenses, and government identification all qualify.\n  As we know, requiring an identification has become a norm for Amtrak, \nairline passengers, buying beer or cigarettes, or to write a check at \nthe grocery store, or to cash a check.\n  We recognize that everybody does not have photo identification. So we \ncreated an expansive list of alternatives: A bank statement, a \npaycheck, a government check, a transfer payment, a utility bill, or \nany other government document that is current and shows the name and \naddress of the voter.\n  We have made significant dollars available to States and localities \nto use their best efforts to find out, if there are some people who do \nnot have any of those documents, how they can get them registered. They \ncan go out and help people who need help who do not have the required \nphoto identification or an official document with their name and \naddress on it.\n  Money is also available to expunge from the list those who are dead, \nwho have moved, or who do not have any business voting in that State.\n  We simply do not want the names to be registered by mail and then \nvoted in an election with no one checking to see if they are a live \nhuman being qualified to vote in that State.\n  It has always been a simple proposition. We must recognize that vote \nfraud cheats all other voters. It is a denial of a basic civil right to \nlose your vote because somebody not qualified to vote has cast a vote \nthat wipes yours out. Those who took time to follow the rules, stand in \nline, wait their turn, and then cast their votes should not have to \nfear their vote will be diluted or canceled by an illegal vote.\n  There are those who do not believe vote fraud exists. There was a \npolitical science professor in New York who told us in that great \nwisdom that only academics have that vote fraud is a myth:\n\n       Stuffing the ballot box happens only in cartoons and old \n     movies.\n\n  Perhaps you would like to talk to three recently indicted individuals \nin St. Louis, indicted as a result of fraud prior to the mayoral \nprimary in St. Louis city. Three people were charged with a combined 17 \ncounts. They cheated by registering dead people and nonexistent people \nby mail. I will be happy to show it to my colleagues. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a news release from the Office of Attorney General \nJennifer M. Joyce be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   [From the Office of the St. Louis Circuit Attorney, Mar. 4, 2002]\n\n    Circuit Attorney Announces Charges Against Vote Fraud Offenders\n\n       St. Louis, Mar. 4.--St. Louis Circuit Attorney Jennifer M. \n     Joyce announced that her office has charged three individuals \n     with committing class one election offenses by completing \n     and, in most instances, signing Missouri Voter Registration \n     Application cards in the names of others. All of these \n     charges are related to false voter registration cards \n     submitted for the March 2001 mayoral primary.\n       Joyce said that the United States Attorney's Office for the \n     Eastern District of Missouri, the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation, the United States Postal Inspector's Office, \n     the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department and the Circuit \n     Attorney's Office all collaborated on this investigation that \n     has culminated in charging three different individuals with a \n     combined 17 counts.\n       ``As Circuit Attorney and a life-long resident of this \n     City, I am committed to upholding the integrity of the \n     election process. The people of this community deserve fair \n     and clean elections. We will do whatever we can to protect \n     the voting rights of all citizens of the City of St. Louis,'' \n     Joyce said.\n       The Circuit Attorney's Office has charged Eliza Julion, 29, \n     with seven felony counts of voter fraud. More specifically, \n     the complaint asserts that Eliza Julion completed and signed \n     voter registration cards in the names of two individuals who \n     she made-up or manufactured. Further, she also filled out a \n     voter registration card in the name of another fictitious \n     person and completed and signed a voter registration card \n     in the name of another individual, who was in prison at \n     the time, the complaint asserts. Also, the Circuit \n     Attorney charges that Eliza Julion completed and signed \n     two different voter application cards for the same \n     individual and signed the card belonging to another \n     individual.\n       The Circuit Attorney has also charged Michelle Robinson, \n     32, with nine felony counts of vote fraud. More specifically, \n     the complaint asserts that she completed and signed nine \n     voter registration cards in the names of mostly former \n     elected officials, including some of whom are deceased.\n       The Circuit Attorney has also charged Paul Julion, 26, with \n     one count of felony vote fraud. The complaint asserts that \n     Paul Julion completed and signed a voter registration card in \n     the name of a fictitious person, a name that he manufactured.\n       All 17 counts are class one election offenses, which are \n     felonies. The range of punishment for each offense is up to \n     five years in jail or a fine between $2,500 and $10,000. If \n     convicted, Eliza Julion could face a maximum punishment of up \n     to 35 years in jail or up to $70,000 in fines. If convicted, \n     Michelle Robinson could face up to 45 years in jail or up to \n     $90,000 in fines. If convicted, Paul Julion could face up to \n     5 years in jail or up to $10,000 in fines.\n       The charges as set forth in the complaints are merely \n     accusations and each defendant is presumed innocent until, \n     and unless, proven guilty.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this news release will give a small idea of \nsome of the work that has been done by law enforcement officials.\n  I also point out the Missouri secretary of state reviewed 1,300 \njudge-ordered registrations on election day in Missouri. Of those \n1,300, 97 percent of them were illegal.\n  We have set up a provisional voting system that allows the election \nauthorities, if somebody is not registered and believes they are \nregistered, to cast a provisional vote. This provisional voting system \nshould help those who are legitimate voters who registered where the \nelection authority messed up. It will help make sure their votes are \ncounted.\n  Those who try to vote without being properly registered will be \ndiscovered and their vote will not be counted; it will not be placed in \nthe ballot box.\n  For those who say vote fraud does not occur, the April 4, 2002, \nHouston Chronicle headline reads: ``2,000 Voted Illegally in City \nPolling'':\n\n       More than 2,000 people voted illegally in the local \n     November elections in the Houston mayoral runoff in December, \n     including 712 who cast ballots in city races and don't live \n     in the city. . . . There could be a major impact in close \n     elections.\n\n  That is my point. We want to make sure the system works for those who \nhave difficulty getting registered and those who have voted in the past \nhave an opportunity to vote and those who have voted once do not try to \nvote twice.\n  With the amendment presented by the Senator from New York, I am \nafraid it oversimplifies the issue and offers a remedy which will \ncreate far more problems than it solves. She has indicated that 2 \nmillion people in each of the last four Presidential elections did not \nhave their votes counted because of unintentional voter error. From \nthat, we are to conclude with this fix all those votes might be \ncounted. The problem is that this 2 million number cited is the \nresidual vote rate for those elections, meaning those ballots which are \nunmarked, spoiled, or where the intent of the voter could not be \ndetermined.\n  There are people, as I believe the Senator has mentioned, who choose \nnot to vote in races. The Carter-Ford commission estimates that is \nabout .77, or almost eight-tenths of 1 percent, who chose not to cast a \nvote in a Presidential race. An MIT study says it is about half a \npercent. Clearly, it fluctuates from election to election.\n  This underlying bill takes significant steps to address the problems \ncoming from machinery, the equipment, in voter errors, and sets a \nnational standard for error rates. The Commission will assist the \nStates in identifying the best equipment available.\n  Standards for notification and voter education, which is very \nimportant, are established, and there is $3.5 billion authorized to \npurchase machines that\n\n[[Page S2474]]\n\nwill comply with the standards and provide voter education.\n  The problem we have is that some people just plain make mistakes. If \nit is not a voting machine problem or a voting system problem, we know \nthere are people who just choose not to vote. They may not vote for a \nPresident or they may not vote for other races down the line. If we \nestablish some kind of standard that says if you do not meet this \nstandard, then the Justice Department is going to come in and sue you, \nyou have, unfortunately, created an incentive for election poll workers \nto look at every ballot. Ballot secrecy goes out the window because if \nyou know you are going to get sued and your election is going to be \ncalled off because there were too many errors, the pressure is going to \nbe on to make sure everybody voted right.\n\n  The voting officials may not be so bold as to walk into the polls and \nlook over the voters' shoulders as they are punching the punchcard or \nfilling out the ballot, but there is certainly a strong temptation for \nthem to look at the ballots when they come out and to say: Excuse me, \nyou made a mistake; you didn't vote here or you voted in too many \nplaces.\n  Once we do that, once we try to account for a voter error, a human \nerror, I am afraid we are going down the road of destroying the secrecy \nof the ballot and saying that people who are election judges and \nelection officials are going to have to look at the ballots of each \nvoter. We will have poll workers reviewing ballots.\n  Under no circumstances do we want poll workers reviewing ballots \nbefore they are cast, destroying the secrecy and the privacy of the \nballot. To make sure you do not violate the voter error standard, you \nwould be forced into that position.\n  We have dealt with bringing down the error rate the best way possible \nin this bill--new machines, voter education, which is extremely \nimportant. We are already seeing an increase in mail voting which does \noffer a compromise of a secret ballot. But with this amendment, we \ncould see the end of the secret ballot.\n  I am afraid it goes the wrong way. I urge my colleagues to agree to a \nstudy to determine how we can improve voter efficiency and \neffectiveness, but let us not set a standard that might force poll \nworkers to reach out and touch somebody's ballot before they put it in \nthe ballot box.\n  I thank the Chair, and I particularly thank my colleagues who worked \non this so long and so diligently. I urge all of our colleagues to \nsupport this measure, move it to conference, and get a bill back from \nconference that we can send to the President so that in the shortest \npossible time, we will have a measure in law that will make it easier \nto vote and tougher to cheat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, before the Senator from Missouri \nleaves, I wish to thank him for his absolutely indispensable \ncontribution to this whole process from beginning to end. The Senator \nfrom Missouri is not on the Rules Committee, but he developed an \ninterest in this issue. His interest and passion is a direct result of \nthe voter fraud issues in his home State, which he has skillfully \nsought to make much more difficult to happen in the future.\n  The parts of this bill related to fraud are entirely the result of \nthe tireless efforts of the Senator from Missouri, and I wanted to \nexpress my gratitude to him for his intelligence, tenacity, and \neffectiveness in turning this into a bill I can enthusiastically and \nwholeheartedly support. I wish to assure him that we are going to try \nvery hard at the conference to make sure this bill still has the \nimportant features he has worked to have included.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise in support of this bill. The \nbill we consider today on election reform, I believe, is the most \nimportant legislation we will consider all year. Congress has a \nresponsibility to ensure every registered American who goes to vote \ngets to vote and that every vote cast counts.\n  There are few concepts more fundamentally American than choosing our \nleaders, which means that even in our Nation's Capitol, in this very \nseat of democracy, this may truly be the great American bill.\n  Despite the strength of our democracy, if we do not do a good job \nmaintaining the actual mechanism that drives it, our voting systems, we \nfail the voters and undermine our values, the values our Founding \nFathers fought and died for, as did so many subsequent generations of \nAmericans. That is why it is so important we pass this legislation.\n  I thank our chairman, Senator Dodd, for his indefatigable leadership \nand his continuing fight for this bill. It can truly be said about \ncertain legislation that without a single person, it would not have \nhappened. In this case, Senator Dodd's leadership clearly puts him in \nthat category.\n  I also thank Senator McConnell from Kentucky who worked hard on this \nbill. Since he and I originally put in a proposal to deal with the core \nof the bill, which is funding these new voting systems, he has always \nbeen a pleasure to work with and he has been steadfast. I thank Senator \nBond for his contribution and Senator Wyden for his commitment to \nimproving the Nation's election system as well.\n  This bill will make voting easier and more accurate. It allows many \nmore people to participate in our democratic processes and that is what \nthis country is all about. As with most bipartisan legislation, which \nis the only way we really get anything passed, this bill is a \ncompromise. There are some things in this bill that, if it were up to \nme entirely, I would change, but that is not what the people in our \nStates sent us to do, to say it is my way or no way.\n\n  This bill is a good and fair compromise, and I am proud of it. The \nmost important result is that, after more than 200 years, we are \nfinally giving our democracy the resources it needs and the respect it \ndeserves.\n  I voted for the first time in 1969 and I used the same type of \nmachine when I voted in 2001, some 32 years later. Instead of being \nfaced with deciding between good candidates, voters are faced with a \nhost of problems ranging from out of date machines and inadequately \nmaintained registration lists, confusingly designed ballots, and phone \nlines that are so busy the voters cannot get through to confirm their \nregistration status.\n  In New York, we use these pretty clunky, old voting machines. They \nare cumbersome. They take a long time. As I have told my colleagues \nbefore, to see the painful look on the face of someone who is coming \nout of the factory, going to vote, waiting in line for an hour, finally \ndoing their duty and finding they are not on the right list or that the \nmachine does not work or that it was so confusing they missed an \nimportant part of the ballot, their disappointment has stayed with me \nthroughout my career, and I am glad we are able to do something about \nit.\n  The fact is, just because we are the oldest democracy in the world \ndoes not mean we have to use the oldest technology in the world. The \nproblem does not end with machines. In my home State of New York, \nNovember 2000, as I mentioned, people waited in line for hours to vote. \nMany voters, those who could not afford to be late for work, had to get \nhome to the children or go on to a second job and vote in between the \ntwo, ultimately left the polling place without being able to \nparticipate in one of the most critical and closest elections in our \ntime. Others waited and waited only to be confronted with the cruel \nreality that the machine in their precinct was broken or that the \npolling place had run out of emergency ballots.\n  Voting should be accessible, accurate, and speedy in all places, all \nof the time. This bill provides the funds and standards to make sure \nthat is exactly what happens. There are also provisions we have agreed \nto that address some of the concerns raised by my and Senator Wyden's \namendment. Most importantly, we have aligned the effective dates of the \nphoto identification, provisional voting, and computerized statewide \nvoter registration database requirements. This means that first-time \nvoters who do not have photo identification will be able to vote \nprovisionally, and that is really important.\n  This change also allows us to define first-time voters as people \nmoving\n\n[[Page S2475]]\n\nfrom State to State rather than jurisdiction to jurisdiction, which \nmeans that many fewer people will trigger the photo identification \nrequirement, and this was possible because States with databases will \nbe able to track voters across jurisdictions.\n  We have agreed also to allow voters to provide their drivers license \nnumber, at least the last four digits of their Social Security number, \nwhen they register. If these numbers match an existing State record \nthat confirms the voter's identity, then they are exempted from the \nphoto identification provisions.\n\n  Ultimately, these changes mean many of the people we were worried \nabout would have been adversely affected by the identification \nprovision, and they will be OK one way or the other. Is that 100 \npercent? No, but we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good, \nespecially not when the alternative is allowing our democracy to \nsputter along, disappointed voter after disappointed voter.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support the bill. We often have the \nopportunity to support legislation that makes things better, and that \nis why we are here, but today we have an opportunity to make a little \nbit of history, and that is something we will never forget.\n  I also thank my staff who worked so long and hard on this \nlegislation.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. We have a couple more amendments that may be agreed to. In \nthe meantime, I wish to make a point. While I did not get an \nopportunity to do so when he was in the Chamber, I would like to \ncommend our colleague from Missouri, Senator Bond. I have said this on \nnumerous occasions, and I will say it again, without Senator Bond's \nparticipation and contribution we would not be on the brink of passing \nthis bill. He brought a very important issue to the table, one that is \nnot a part of the House-passed bill, not because they opposed it, they \ndid not consider it. Had it not been for Senator Bond, I am not sure it \nwould be in this particular product. So we owe him a very deep sense of \ngratitude concerning a very legitimate issue that I think complements \nthe bill in a very fine way. I will later add further remarks about his \ncontribution, but I wanted to publicly thank him.\n  I also commend my dear friend and colleague from New York. Senator \nSchumer was, again, a very long and valiant participant in extensive \nnegotiations on this bill, bringing us to the point we are this \nevening. I wish to thank him publicly for his work.\n  Early on, he and Senator McConnell offered one of the very first \nmeasures to deal with election reform. He immediately saw the need to \ndo something, as the Senator from Kentucky did. His willingness to back \nup and to work with us on a slightly different version is something I \nwill always be very grateful to him for. His contribution has been \nsignificant.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator for his kind words. It has been a \npleasure to work with him. I mentioned while he was out of the room, it \nis rare to say on an important piece of legislation without a single \nperson this legislation would not have passed. In the case of the \nSenator from Connecticut, that is true. Everyone tips their hat to the \nSenator for the great job he has done.\n  I also mentioned the Senator from Kentucky has been steadfast and \nprincipled in this effort. We didn't always agree on exactly what was \nthe right thing to do, but he wanted to get this bill done and he \nplayed a valuable part.\n  I thank both the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from \nKentucky. They are in large part responsible for the fine improvement \nin voting we will have when this bill becomes law.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If I could speak briefly, one of the wonderful things \nthat happen in putting together legislation: You get to know people \nbetter. I had not known the Senator from New York very well. He came to \nthe Senate in the beginning of 1999. I enjoyed getting to know him in \nthe process. I enjoyed working with him.\n  This legislation is a classic example, with Senator Dodd's \nleadership, and Senator Torricelli was deeply involved; the five of us \nhad a bonding experience here. We managed to come together on a very \nworthwhile piece of legislation which I anticipate will pass tomorrow \nby a very large margin, if not unanimously.\n  I thank the Senator from New York for his friendship and on this \nbill.\n  Mr. DODD. I will have more kind comments about my friend from \nKentucky, but I will wait until tomorrow so we can clean up some of the \namendments.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3111\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I have an amendment by Senator Grassley which I send \nto the desk and ask for its immediate consideration. It is cleared on \nboth sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection the clerk will report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McCONNELL], for Mr. \n     Grassley, proposes an amendment numbered 3111.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To permit States to coordinate the computerized statewide \n  voter registration list with Federal records relating to death and \n                               identity)\n\n       On page 18, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n       (4) Interaction with federal information.--\n       (A) Access to federal information.--\n       (i) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the Commissioner of Social Security shall provide, upon \n     request from a State or locality maintaining a computerized \n     centralized list implemented under paragraph (1), only such \n     information as is necessary to determine the eligibility of \n     an individual to vote in such State or locality under the law \n     of the State. Any State or locality that receives information \n     under this clause may only share such information with \n     election officials.\n       (ii) Procedure.--The information under clause (i) shall be \n     provided in such place and such manner as the Commissioner \n     determines appropriate to protect and prevent the misuse of \n     information.\n       (B) Applicable information.--For purposes of this \n     subsection, the term ``applicable information'' means \n     information regarding whether--\n       (i) the name and social security number of an individual \n     provided to the Commissioner match the information contained \n     in the Commissioner's records; and\n       (ii) such individual is shown on the records of the \n     Commissioner as being deceased.\n       (C) Exception.--Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any \n     request for a record of an individual if the Commissioner \n     determines there are exceptional circumstances warranting an \n     exception (such as safety of the individual or interference \n     with an investigation).\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there is a very serious issue concerning \nthe proper functioning of elections--the integrity of voter lists.\n  All eligible voters should be given every opportunity to vote.\n  In fact, much of this bill is aimed at doing just that.\n  However, without integrity in our voting lists, the door is wide open \nto many kinds of voting irregularities.\n  Every ineligible vote denigrates the efforts of every eligible voter \nto cause participatory democracy to work.\n  When votes are cast by individuals who are not legally entitled to \nvote, whether it be because they are using a false identity or because \nthey are dead, the value of all properly cast votes is diminished.\n  We have all heard reports of people who are registered to vote and \nshould not be or who voted illegally.\n  Senator Bond has already mentioned during the debate on this bill an \ninvestigation by the Missouri secretary of state which determined that, \nin the 2000 election, votes were cast in the St. Louis area by 14 dead \npeople.\n  Senator Bond has also told us about troubling instances in St. Louis \nwhere large numbers of voter registration forms were submitted to \nelection officials using false identities.\n  In Georgia, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution conducted a study \ncomparing voting records and death records from the state Department of \nHuman Resources and the Social Security Administration.\n  The investigation revealed that 5,412 dead people voted over the past \n20 years and that the number of registered dead voters has increased \ndramatically in recent years.\n\n[[Page S2476]]\n\n  As of November 2000, 15,000 dead people remained on the active voting \nrolls in Georgia.\n  Sometimes we hear these anecdotes about instances of voter fraud and \nthey take on the character of a cynical joke, but I don't think it is \nvery funny.\n  Such cases erode public confidence in the electoral process and are \nan affront to all those who cast votes legally.\n  The bill before us already takes an important step in ensuring the \nintegrity of States' voter rolls by providing for interactive, \ncomputerized, statewide voter registration lists.\n  This will enable States to check for duplicates and coordinate with \nState agencies to verify that registered voters are legally able to \nvote under State law.\n  However, more can and should be done.\n  My amendment would give States a much needed tool to check the \naccuracy of their voter roles against information possessed by the \nSocial Security Administration.\n  Specifically, my amendment allows a State to coordinate its statewide \nvoter registration list with social security records to check identity, \nand to see if a voter has died.\n  The commissioner of Social Security would be required to provide, \nupon request from a State, applicable information for the purpose of \ndetermining the eligibility of an individual to vote.\n  This amendment would not require States to undertake any action nor \nwould it affect State laws governing eligibility of individuals to \nvote.\n  It simply gives the States a valuable tool in their efforts to \nmaintain clean and accurate lists of eligible voters.\n  The State decides when and whether to use this tool.\n  Over the last decade, it has become increasingly easy for people to \nregister and vote due in large part to the National Voter Registration \nAct of 1993, also called the motor voter law.\n  This trend has increased voter registration across the board, \nincluding registrations by individuals who are not eligible to vote.\n  Along with the relaxation of voter registration requirements comes \nthe responsibility to provide for safeguards to preserve the integrity \nof the voter rolls.\n  I can think of no reason why individuals who are not eligible to vote \nshould be allowed to remain untouched on State voter lists.\n  A State can decide to do that.\n  But, today, if States want to be extra careful in preserving the \nintegrity of their voter lists, they lack some very important \ninformation.\n  Give them the tools!\n  This amendment is just one more way that we can help the States \nmaintain the most accurate, reliable list possible of eligible voters.\n  This is a commonsense, good government reform and I would urge my \ncolleagues to join me in this effort.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. This amendment has been cleared on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3111) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3112\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I send an amendment, which has been \ncleared, by Senator Bob Smith to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McCONNELL], for Mr. SMITH of \n     New Hampshire, proposes an amendment numbered 3112.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To provide for a study into the broadcasting of false \n                         election information)\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SEC.  . BROADCASTING FALSE ELECTION INFORMATION.\n\n       In carrying out its duty under section 303(a)(1)(G), the \n     Commission, within 6 months after its establishment shall \n     provide a detailed report to the Congress on issues regarding \n     the broadcasting or transmitting by cable of federal election \n     results including broadcasting practices that may result in \n     the broadcast of false information concerning the location or \n     time of operation of a polling place.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3112) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3113\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I have another amendment that has \nbeen cleared by Senator Craig Thomas of Wyoming. I send it to the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McCONNELL], for Mr. Thomas, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3113.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding changes made to \n       the electoral process and how such changes impact States)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING CHANGES MADE TO THE \n                   ELECTORAL PROCESS AND HOW SUCH CHANGES IMPACT \n                   STATES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the provisions of this Act, shall not prohibit States \n     to use curbside voting as a last resort to satisfy the voter \n     accessibility requirements under section 101(a)(3);\n       (2) the provisions of this Act, permit States--\n       (A) to use Federal funds to purchase new voting machines; \n     and\n       (B) to elect to retrofit existing voting machines in lieu \n     of purchasing new machines to meet the voting machine \n     accessibility requirements under section 101(a)(3);\n       (3) nothing in this Act requires States to replace existing \n     voting machines;\n       (4) nothing under section 10(a) of this Act specifically \n     requires States to install wheelchair ramps or pave parking \n     lots at each polling location if the State otherwise provides \n     for the accessibility needs of individuals with disabilities; \n     and\n       (5) the Election Administration Commission, the Attorney \n     General, and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers \n     Compliance Board should the differences that exist between \n     urban and rural areas with respect to the administration of \n     Federal elections under this Act.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3113) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                            new technologies\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in support of this measure and to \nthank my colleagues for their hard work on this bill that will make \nvoting in many States easier and more accurate. Before we pass this \nlegislation, I would like to address one additional point. In drafting \nlegislation, it is often very difficult to look to the future and \nanticipate the impact that legislation will have on new technologies. \nTo truly reform the Federal election process, this legislation must \nremedy the infirmities of the present system. However, it also must be \nforward-looking in its approach. It should welcome the implementation \nof new election technologies. The flexibility of this legislation to \naccommodate innovation will be the ultimate strength of Federal \nelection reform.\n  I firmly believe that voting by computer, whether by internet or some \nother remote electronic system, is likely to happen in many states in \nthe near future. In fact, Arizona has already held a party caucus in \nwhich voters were permitted to vote over the\n\n[[Page S2477]]\n\ninternet. At the same time, I believe that the security concerns are \nsuch that most states, mine included, are not yet ready to provide this \noption to voters.\n  However, in the interests of looking to the future, I would like to \nseek clarification from the chairman of the Rules Committee about how \nthis legislation would affect internet or other forms of remote \nelectronic voting.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, is it the Chairman's understanding that \nthe bill as it is currently written would not prevent States from \noffering voters the option of voting on by the Internet, so long as the \nState could show that the internet voting system complied with the \nsecurity protocol standards written by the new Election Administration \nCommission, and that the voting system also complied with the \nrequirements of the legislation on accessibility for the disabled, \nproviding an audit trail of ballots, and by providing voters a means to \nmake certain they had not made a mistake?\n  Mr. DODD. Senator Cantwell, I agree with you that very serious \nconcerns remain about voting by internet. As you know, this legislation \nspecifically requests that the new organization, the Election \nAdministration Commission, study internet voting. I am looking forward \nto seeing what it learns. However, I hope very much that states will \nthink very carefully before moving to internet voting, and will make \nsure that the security concerns are fully addressed.\n  That said, the Senator is correct that nothing is this bill prohibits \nstates from implementing voting on a remote electronic system like the \ninternet, as long as the system is certified by the new Election \nAdministration Commission, and complies with the other standards in the \nlegislation.\n  I agree with the Senator that it is important to welcome the \ndevelopment of new election technologies and it was my intent, and my \ncosponsors' intent to provide the states as much flexibility as \npossible to accommodate innovation while still implementing necessary \nminimum standards that will ensure that all our citizens' right to vote \nis protected.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I agree that it is very important that any voting \nsystem, particularly an electronic voting system have very good \nsecurity. However, I believe that it is likely that in the near future \nwe will in fact have the necessary security, the necessary assurances \nof secrecy, and of voter authentication, to make internet voting \nworkable and I am pleased that this bill leaves the decision about \nmoving forward with internet voting up to the individual States.\n  I appreciate all the Chairman's efforts on this legislation, and I \nagree that this bill is drafted in a manner that will not limit the \ndevelopment and implementation of new election technologies so long as \nthe new technologies satisfy security protocols and meet the \nrequirements of the minimum standards. I also hope that this \nlegislation will in fact spur the development of new election \ntechnologies that are more voter friendly and more cost efficient.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Kentucky. I \nthank his staff.\n  As I understand it, we will frame this with the two leaders' consent. \nWe will have a period of maybe 20 or 30 minutes divided equally between \nmy friend from Kentucky and I to make any final comments on the bill, \nand then there would be three votes: The amendment by Senator Roberts \nof Kansas, Senator Clinton of New York, and final passage. All other \namendments have been dealt with. We have accepted all of them here with \nthe modifications that staffs have worked out this evening.\n  We can report to our leaders that we are down to two amendments and \nfinal passage, which is what we projected and promised would be the \ncase if we could get the job done.\n  With that, I am unclear whether there is going to be a unanimous \nconsent request on the time. In any event, we will take care of that.\n  I thank my friend from Kentucky and his staff. Of course, I thank my \nstaff as well for working very hard tonight and the staffs of the \nrespective Senators that worked out these agreements and made it \npossible to accept these remaining amendments. I look forward to final \npassage tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I echo the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Connecticut. We will save our pats on each other's backs for \ntomorrow. I thank him for his great work and we will see everyone in \nthe morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schumer). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

GORDON T. CHAPPELL\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, there are persons of great importance in \nthe lives of each of us. Outside our families, it is often teachers \nthat have played key roles in our lives. One teacher of mine, Dr. \nGordon T. Chappell was such a person. He awakened in his students a \ngreat love of history. He taught the importance of rigorous thought, \nand helped us understand our heritage. On February 6, 2002, Dr. \nChappell passed away.\n  His death was a cause for sadness for the thousands who were his \nstudents at our alma mater, Huntingdon College. Although he had lived a \nrich, active and happy life, the recent years had not been easy. A year \nago, Dr. Chappell was preceded in death by his beloved wife, Winn \nChappell. The two of them lived in a modest home on the campus, and \nfrequently invited students over for tea, discussion or work. Mrs. \nChappell was a magnificent teacher in her own right, and was loved by \nher students as much as any teacher who ever served at Huntingdon. I \ntook her British Literature course and it was a rich experience, \nindeed.\n  There can be little doubt that I would not be in the Senate today but \nfor the inspiration of Dr. Chappell. In those days, the mid '60s, all \nfreshman students were required to take Western Civilization. Dr. \nChappell, though head of the History Department, always taught one \nfreshman class and he hand picked his students. I was by chance, or \nperhaps as a result of having a historical sounding name, selected for \nthe challenge and adventure that was his class. It was taught in the \nbasement of the oldest building on campus, Flowers Hall. Ever since \nthat experience, I have deeply understood that a great teacher in a \npoor room is far to be preferred to a lesser teacher in a room with the \nbest of everything. With his small moustache, he was constantly thought \nto be the very image of Clark Gable playing Rhett Butler.\n\n  Dr. Chappell, first and foremost, knew his subject. Attaining his \ndoctorate in history at Vanderbilt during some of that department's \nglory days, he was exceedingly well trained. Without, I am sure, one \ncourse in ``how to teach'', Dr. Chappell dominated his class, commanded \nrespect, and imparted knowledge to students in an exceptional but not \nflamboyant way. This was primarily because he was prepared in subject \nmatter and because he had great wisdom. He lectured, asked questions \nperiodically, and insisted on attention and on timeliness. This was not \na class that endeavored to teach self-esteem by being easy. His \nstudents developed self-esteem as a result of mastery of difficult \nsubjects.\n  In addition to the substantial textbook, each student was required to \nread an additional five significant books each semester. The good news \nwas that book reports were not required. The bad news was that upon \ncompletion of the book, the student was required to get an appointment \nwith Dr. Chappell, in his basement office, laden with books and \nmemorabilia, to discuss the reading. Make no\n\n[[Page S2478]]\n\nmistake, everyone knew he could tell instantly whether the student had \nread the book. He was held in such respect that no one made the \nappointment without trepidation. Many could not sleep for days in \nadvance. It was a brilliant way for him to teach and to know his \nstudents.\n  As a result of this exceptional teaching, I became a history major. \nBeing a history major opened a broad world to me, a world that was \nexciting and inspiring. It allowed an already existing interest in \ngovernment and politics to grow.\n  Dr. Chappell's freshman class, his upper level courses, and his \nfriendship and advice over the years have played an important role in \nmy life and career. For thousands of his respectful students, his \nteaching was equally formative. Small liberal arts colleges, like \nHuntingdon, with an emphasis on classical learning, respect for faith \nand philosophy, liberal in concepts and disciplines, and with love of \ncountry and region, have shaped for the better the lives of millions. \nThe death of Dr. Chappell not long after the death of Mrs. Chappell, \ndrives that fact home to me in a forceful way. Their lives, committed \nto faith, humanity and learning bloomed like beautiful flowers and \nenriched the lives of many young people.\n\n  As United Methodist minister, Dr. Charles C. Hays, Jr., a Huntingdon \nhistory major who was also a student and long time friend of Dr. \nChappell, stated in his eulogy:\n\n       He was an architect of the psyche who, through the medium \n     of history, shaped and molded the lives of countless hundreds \n     of students.\n\n  Indeed he did. Though we have been sad, we should all remember that, \nat best, our lives are short--``like a vapor'', the scripture says. Dr. \nChappell's life, along with his beloved partner, Winn, was rich, full \nand long. He spent it doing what he loved and wonderfully enriched the \nlives of all he touched. What more can one ask.\n  He is survived by two exceptional children, Rick and Wendy. May God's \ncomfort and blessing be with them at this sad time. Let us, out of this \nsadness, lift our heads and celebrate Dr. Chappell's beautiful life so \nwell lived.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/10/senate-section/article/S2478-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2478-S2479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE 100TH DEATH ROW INMATE EXONERATION\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this Monday, Mr. Ray Krone walked out of \nan Arizona state prison a free man. In doing so, he became the 100th \ninnocent person to be released from death row in the modern death \npenalty--era that is, since the Supreme Court found the death penalty \nunconstitutional in 1972.\n  At about 5 pm on Monday, Krone ``traded his orange prison jumpsuit \nfor blue jeans and a T-shirt,'' then walked away from a prison in Yuma, \nAZ, according to the Arizona Republic. Krone had spent the last 10 \nyears of his life in prison for a crime it is now almost certain he did \nnot commit.\n  In 1992, Krone was sentenced to death for the gruesome sexual assault \nand murder of Kim Acona, a cocktail waitress at a Phoenix lounge. After \nhis conviction was overturned on a technicality, Krone received a re-\ntrial but was convicted again in 1996 and, this time, sentenced to life \nin prison.\n  The key to his release was DNA testing that pointed not to Krone, but \nto Kenneth Phillips. It just so happens that Phillips is serving time \nin another Arizona prison for an unrelated sex crime. Prosecutors are \nnow deciding whether to charge Phillips.\n  ``There's tears in my eyes,'' Krone said upon his release. ``Your \nheart's beating. You can't hardly talk.''\n  At a press conference announcing that the prosecutor and Phoenix \nPolice Chief would seek Krone's release, the prosecutor said, ``[Krone] \ndeserves an apology from us, that's for sure.'' He continued, ``A \nmistake was made here. . . . what do you say to him? An injustice was \ndone and we will try to do better. And we're sorry.''\n  But, there is more that the American people can say to Krone. We can \ndo more than just talk or apologize. An apology is the first step. But \nwe can also act. We can act to ensure that not another innocent person \nfaces execution. We can do so by conducting a thorough review of the \ndeath penalty system. And while this review is taking place, we can and \nshould suspend executions.\n  Congress has the opportunity to do just that. We can act by passing \nmy bill, the National Death Penalty Moratorium Act. Together we can say \nenough is enough. Together we can say that one mistake too many has \nbeen made. Together we can say let us pause and have an independent, \ntop-to-bottom review of the administration of the ultimate punishment \nour society can exact, the death penalty. This review should include \nthe death penalty systems of Arizona and all states that authorize the \nuse of the death penalty, as well as the use of the death penalty by \nour Federal Government.\n  An innocent man, who at one time faced certain death at the hands of \nhis government, today walks free. If we can call that luck, how many \nothers in Mr. Krone's shoes have not been and will not be so lucky?\n  How many innocent Americans today sit in their prison cells wrongly \naccused, counting down the days until there are no more?\n\n  There have now been 100 exonerations and 766 executions since the \nearly 1970s. In other words, for every seven to eight death row inmates \nexecuted by the States or Federal government, one has been found \ninnocent and released from death row. Now, this does not bode well for \nthe fairness and effectiveness of a government program.\n  Some have said that exonerations are proof that the system is \nworking. But how can they be proof that the system is working when, in \nat least some cases, it is not the lawyers or judges, but newspaper \nreporters and college students--people clearly outside the justice \nsystem--who have done the work of uncovering evidence of innocence? \nThat is not proof the system is working. Quite the opposite. When the \njustice system must rely on outside actors, it is further, disturbing \nevidence that the system is broken.\n  I also fear that 100 exonerations is probably a conservative \nestimate. How many innocent people were not freed before being \nexecuted? How many mistakes did we miss? How many times were we too \nlate to correct mistakes? I don't think anyone really has an answer to \nthese questions. And that is precisely why we should have a pause and \nreview. Before sending yet another person to the execution chamber, we \nshould be sure that the system is fair, just and error-free.\n  The risk of errors is troubling to an increasing number of Americans. \nFrom Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, to Republican Illinois \nGovernor George Ryan, to even Reverend Pat Robertson, a growing number \nof Americans are expressing grave concerns about the fairness of the \nadministration of the death penalty.\n  And it is not just a question of access to modern DNA testing. A \nnumber of factors have resulted in unfair or even wrongful convictions. \nIncompetent counsel. Too many times, sleeping lawyers, drunk lawyers, \nor lawyers who are later suspended or disbarred are the lawyers \nrepresenting people facing the death penalty. Sometimes there is \nprosecutorial or police misconduct--like failing to share evidence that \nmight be helpful to the defendant's case or coerced confessions. These \nproblems also plague the administration of the death penalty. We have \nalso seen that testimony from jailhouse informants produce a high risk \nof unreliable convictions.\n  Now, Governor Ryan took a very important first step in 2000 when he \nhad the courage to recognize these flaws, declared a moratorium on \nexecutions, and created a blue ribbon panel to review the fairness of \nthe Illinois death penalty system. The results of the Illinois \ncommission are set for release any day now.\n  If we are prepared to admit, as Illinois has, that there may be flaws \nwith the death penalty system, it is then really unconscionable that we \nshould continue with executions without a thorough, nationwide review.\n  Ray Krone's exoneration provides us all with another opportunity to \ntake a moment and ask ourselves ``what if?'' What if we hadn't caught \nthis mistake? What if an innocent man ate his final meal, took his last \nbreath, said goodbye to his family and was put to death, alone, \nsilenced by a failing system? The most important of these ``what ifs,'' \nhowever, is this: What if we don't ask ourselves these questions? What \nif we could have saved a life and we didn't? What if we acknowledged \nthat the system is unfair, and yet we didn't do anything about it at \nall?\n\n[[Page S2479]]\n\n  One risk, one error, one mistake, is one too many. But 100 mistakes, \nproven mistakes, qualifies as a crisis. And a crisis calls for action.\n  My distinguished colleague and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Leahy, has introduced the Innocence Protection Act. This bill \nwould reduce the risk of executing the innocent by allowing for post-\nconviction DNA testing and establishing certain minimum competency \nstandards for defense counsel. And I support this bill and hope the \nSenate acts on it without delay.\n  But I submit that Congress can and must do more. For, if we recognize \nthat the system is broken, that innocent people have been freed based \non DNA testing, then it is only logical and right that we suspend \nexecutions while these reforms can be implemented and while all steps \nare taken to conduct a top-to-bottom review of the death penalty \nsystem.\n  My bill would do just that. The National Death Penalty Moratorium Act \nwould create a National Commission on the Death Penalty to review the \nfairness of the administration of the death penalty at the State and \nFederal levels. The bill would also suspend executions of Federal \ninmates and urges the States to do the same, while the commission does \nits work.\n  I am pleased that Senators Levin, Wellstone, Corzine and Durbin have \njoined me as cosponsors of this important legislation.\n  The expansion of the death penalty and increase in death penalty \nprosecutions during the last two decades have had literally life-or-\ndeath consequences. The people of Illinois have learned a serious \nlesson that the administration of the death penalty is plagued with \nerrors. And as the events in Arizona just showed us, the people of \nIllinois are certainly not alone. But Illinois and Arizona account for \nonly 19 of the 100 exonerations nationwide. The remaining 81 mistakes \nhave occurred in other death penalty States. These 100 mistakes tell \nus, loudly and clearly, that it is past time for our Nation to have a \nthoughtful debate on capital punishment.\n  A commission, and pause in executions while the Commission does its \nwork, is the only right and just response.\n  And, so, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the National \nDeath Penalty Moratorium Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/10/senate-section/article/S2479-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SNOW MACHINES IN NATIONAL PARKS\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an issue that is very \nimportant to those of us in Wyoming and to all of us who have an \ninterest in national parks; that is, the winter use of snow machines in \nYellowstone Park and Grand Teton Park.\n  As some of my colleagues may know, for a number of years we have had \nan opportunity in the wintertime for people to go into the park, to \nengage in and tour the park in individual snow machines on a route that \nhas been set forth. Of course, there has been a good deal of talk about \nit over the last several years and contentious debate over how that \nshould be handled.\n  Some people believe we should not be in the park at all in the \nwintertime with snow machines. Others believe it ought to continue as \nit is.\n  We ended up about a year ago before the last administration moved out \nwith a rule put into place that in 2 years the individual use of snow \nmachines would be outlawed and eliminated.\n  That brought about a considerable response, particularly from people \nwho live close to the park and have occasion to use it from time to \ntime. The outcome was that we had an EIS underway. There was a suit \nbrought, and we also passed in the Congress an extension of 1 year so \nwe would have an opportunity for study. That has been underway, a \nsupplemental EIS, to see how that could be handled and what could be \ndone.\n  Of course, there are at least two primary missions of a national \npark; that is, to preserve the resource on the one hand, and then to \nlet the owners enjoy it on the other hand. So we have to find some \nbalance between protecting the resource and allowing people to enter \nthe park and use it.\n  For a number of years, snow machines have been used. I don't think \nanyone suggests that they continue as they have in the past because \nthere are some impacts both from noise and from exhaust.\n  One of the things that has changed and can change are improvements \nmade to the machines. Some of them now go to four-cycle engines which \nare quieter, less exhaust oriented, and have been proven that way. In \nJackson, WY, every year they have a contest to see who can improve the \nmachines more. That has been a successful endeavor. We are in the \nprocess now of doing that.\n  I don't think anyone who is realistic suggests that we continue to do \nit as we have in the past. Certainly, we could apply some rules and \nregulations: No. 1, manage it; separate the cross-country skiers from \nthe snow machines on the one hand. That can be done. I suspect if it \nwere necessary, you could limit the number of passes that were made \navailable. Sometimes the collection at Old Faithful gets pretty large. \nNevertheless, that could be handled.\n  There have been suggestions that we limit the use in the night when \nanimals are perhaps on the move. One of the arguments is that it \ndistresses and disturbs the buffalo and the elk. I have been through \nthe park with a machine and have ridden from here to the table from a \nbig buffalo who paid no attention to me and had his nose down in about \n3 feet of snow pushing along trying to find a little grass. So I \nsuppose there might be instances. But the fact is, they really don't \ndisturb the wildlife.\n  There has been now a regulation put into place, or an amendment that \ngives us another year to go through the supplemental EIS which is not \nyet completed. Then there would be, of course, probably about five \nalternatives that would be laid out in public. That is supposed to \nhappen in November. We will have an opportunity to make some choices.\n  I am just saying I hope we can make the changes that will protect the \nenvironment, can protect the environment. I am persuaded that can be \ndone. At the same time, I hope we can allow people to continue to enjoy \nthe park. Quite frankly, if you didn't have this opportunity with the \nsnow machine, there would be very little use of the park in wintertime \nbecause it is large. And, of course, you can't ski clear across the \nwhole area, or very few people can.\n  That is in the process. I wanted to say I hope we do keep a couple of \nthings in mind as we deal with our parks and our Federal lands.\n  One is that, of course, we should take care of the environment. No. \n2, people ought to have access to these lands. It is really too bad if \nwe set them aside so that people can't enjoy them and have access to \nthem. Another is to manage it so that it really doesn't have an impact. \nMuch of that is the result of management, and, quite frankly, we have \nnot done as much of that and some of the park officials would rather \nnot have any. So, therefore, they have not made an effort to manage \ntheir existence very well.\n  I hope we proceed on that and come out with a reasonable compromise \nthat still allows access, and we can at the same time take care of the \nenvironment, both in Yellowstone and in Grand Teton, as well as other \nplaces where snow machines are used.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/10/senate-section/article/S2479-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2479-S2480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE MIDDLE EAST\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, with a suicide bomber killing eight \ninnocent Israeli civilians and wounding more than a dozen in Haifa \ntoday, and Palestinian gunmen and Israeli soldiers locked in battle in \nthe Jenin refugee camp, the Middle East is under an intolerable siege \nof violence. The horrific practice of targeting innocent civilians must \nend. Even in this time of horrendous violence we cannot lose hope.\n  I spoke at Temple Israel back in Minnesota on Sunday. I was trying to \nfigure out what to say. I remembered the story of an Israeli man \nmurdered at a Seder meal. ``Murdered'' is the right word. An organ of \nhis was given to save the life of a Palestinian woman. His children \nsaid that he would have been proud.\n  There is hope. We cannot lose hope, for the sake of both the Israeli \nand the Palestinian children. We have to continue to seek a pathway to \npeace. President Bush said this in a number of statements.\n  Last week President Bush made the right decision to send Secretary \nPowell\n\n[[Page S2480]]\n\nto seek a cease-fire and progress toward a political settlement. Over \nand over again I was saying to Tony Zinni, for some time: We should be \nthere. I think this was the right decision. We can go back and forth \nabout whether it should have been done earlier, but I support the \nPresident. I think the President is pursuing a courageous approach \nwhich seeks both to meet the critical need of the Israeli people to be \nfree from terrorism and violence and acknowledges the legitimate \naspirations of the Palestinian people for their own state.\n  Even in this horrific time we must not lose sight of what is the \nultimate goal: Israel and a new Palestinian state living side by side, \nin peace, with secure borders.\n  Secretary Powell is now in Madrid and he will return to the region \nlater today. On Friday he will arrive in Jerusalem. He has the \nunenviable task of seeking to persuade leaders in the Middle East to \ntake very painful but very necessary steps.\n  He has been traveling to Arab capitals to persuade Arab leaders to \ncondemn Palestinian suicide bombings and other acts of violence. This \nwas a step they inexcusably refused to take last month in Beirut. \nPalestinian leaders will only be able to establish their credibility as \nlegitimate diplomatic partners by condemning violence and doing all in \ntheir power to combat it.\n  Secretary Powell is also simultaneously pressing Prime Minister \nSharon to immediately withdraw his military from cities in the West \nBank and to link a political solution to a cease-fire. This is all so \ncomplicated and hard.\n  Further, I also believe he will and should urge the Prime Minister to \nrespect the dignity and human rights of ordinary, innocent Palestinian \ncivilians, and to address the emerging humanitarian crisis in the West \nBank.\n  Secretary Powell's mission involves great risk, and he himself has \nsaid he is unsure he will return to Washington with a cease-fire in \nhand. This process is not going to be easy and it is not going to be \nfast. In fact, it will require enormous patience and work by all \nparties, including a sustained effort by the Bush administration for \nmany months, if not years.\n  I am grateful for Secretary Powell's efforts. I said to Dick \nArmitage, in a number of conversations last week, that I support this \neffort, and I pray for the success of his mission and for a prompt end \nto the violence which has wracked this region and threatens its future, \nand I am not at all sure that I am being melodramatic when I say \nperhaps the future of the world.\n  I apologize to my colleague from New Mexico. I now will speak to the \namendment, but I really believe--as a Senator, as a first-generation \nAmerican, as the son of a Jewish immigrant who fled persecution from \nUkraine--that it was important to speak on this matter.\n  I think when we speak, you are not going to hear any acrimonious \ndebate. There are different ideas about what needs to be done. It is \nnot as if we can take what is happening in the Middle East and put it \nin parentheses.\n  I also will tell you that I was impressed--I hope people do not mind \nmy saying this--at Israel Temple. I was relieved there was very little \nshrillness. People are feeling tremendous anguish and pain and are \nwanting to come together as a community.\n  Recently, I met with an Israeli man and a Palestinian father--two \nfathers, both of whom lost children. They came here, and I want them to \ncome back. Rabbi Sapperstein called the office and said: I would like \nfor you to meet with them. They have formed a parent organization--\nparents who have lost their loved ones and who are saying we have to \nsomehow figure out how to move from where we are to some kind of a \nframework for peace. How wide of a river of blood has to be spilled \nbefore we do that? I believe as long as there are ``leaders'' like \nthat, there is hope.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/10/senate-section/article/S2480-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2480-S2481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MINNESOTA NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP TEAMS\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I am here today with my distinguished \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Minnesota. It is a very special and \nexciting occasion for us to talk about three national championship \nteams in Minnesota: the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers hockey \nteam won the men's national championship for the first time in 23 years \nlast Saturday night. It was one in which over 19,000 fans in St. Paul's \nExcel Center were able to enjoy. I think about 19,002 of them were \nMinnesota fans. But the University of Maine put on a spirited contest.\n  We are very fortunate that the one North Dakotan on the team, a non-\nMinnesota man, scored the winning goal in overtime to lead Minnesota to \nthe national championship.\n  Also, we are delighted that the University of Minnesota Duluth \nwomen's hockey team was also in the national championship for the \nsecond consecutive year--the only winner of that tournament--which has \nnow been held for 2 years--in the history of this country. We are very \nproud of their accomplishment as well.\n  We are ideally constituted because I am a hockey player from high \nschool and college, and my distinguished colleague is a member of the \nWrestling Hall of Fame in the United States. So he is going to carry on \nthe honors for the next resolution. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will be very brief. Senator Dayton \ntalked about the men's hockey team, the University of Minnesota, the \nGophers winning the NCAA championship which, as my colleague said, I \nthink was the first time in 23 years; then the University of Minnesota \nDuluth, second straight year; and then the University of Minnesota \nwrestling team also won the NCAA championship for the second straight \nyear as well.\n  Senator Dayton and I will have a chance to send those resolutions \nback home. We want to congratulate everybody. I think everybody in \nMinnesota is very proud of these three teams. In one winter, there were \nthree NCAA championships: men's hockey, women's hockey, and wrestling.\n  I say to Senator Dayton, I actually do have a 5-hour speech I want to \ngive about the importance of wrestling, but I will not do it tonight.\n\n              REVIVAL OF THE ANCIENT LIBRARY OF ALEXANDRIA\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, on April 23, in Alexandria, Egypt, the \nLibrary of Alexandria (Bibliotheca Alexandrina) will be formally and \njoyfully inaugurated. This is a signal event in the history of world \nculture. The new library has been built on the site of the ancient \nLibrary of Alexandria, not in imitation of its renowned predecessor but \nrather, as its first Chief Librarian, Dr. Ismail Seragaldin, has \nobserved, to recapture the spirit and emulate the ideals, scholarship \nand research of the Ancient Library. It is also, significantly, the \nfirst major library to open anywhere in the world in the third \nmillennium.\n  From the time of its establishment in the 4th century B.C.E. until \nits destruction by fire some 1,600 years ago, the Ancient Library stood \nas a preeminent center of learning. It brought together the Pharaonic \nand Hellenistic cultures, reflecting and reinforcing Egypt's pivotal \nrole as a cradle of civilization. Alexandria was a magnificent city, a \ngreat center of both commerce and intellectual endeavor, and the \nlibrary was its anchor indeed, the library was emblematic of the city. \nWith its collection of some 700,000 manuscripts and its phalanx of \nscholars, Euclid and Archimedes among them, it was also, effectively, \nthe world's first university. And although the library was lost many \ncenturies ago, it has remained a lustrous symbol of scholarship and \nintellectual inquiry.\n   A clear and steady vision, intense dedication, and many years of \nplanning and hard work have brought the new library into being. In \n1990, under the leadership of Mrs. Suzanne Mubarak, a group of \ndistinguished men and women from many different countries came together \nto sign the Aswan Declaration for the Revival of the Ancient Library of \nAlexandria, which proclaimed the Library's mission to be, in part, to \n``bear witness to an original undertaking that, in embracing the \ntotality and diversity of human experience, became the matrix for a new \nspirit of critical inquiry, for a heightened perception of knowledge as \na collaborative process.'' Now, 12 years after the signing of the Aswan \nDeclaration, the modern Bibliotheca Alexandrina is a reality. It will \nprovide scholars and researchers with unique collections and facilities \nfocusing on the ancient civilizations of Egypt and Alexandria as well \nas on contemporary subjects. It will\n\n[[Page S2481]]\n\nhouse resource materials in science and technology to assist in studies \nof Egypt and the Mediterranean region, and it will sponsor studies of \nthe region's historical and cultural heritage. At the same time, it \nwill serve as a major depository library, and it will take its place \nalongside the world's major scholarly institutions, like the Library of \nCongress, in using technology to make available to scholars the whole \nrange of information resources, wherever they may be found.\n  The stunning architectural design of the building that houses the \nlibrary is congruent with the library's mission. It is, as Mrs. Mubarak \nhas put it, ``a great dazzling building,'' ``a fourth pyramid,'' its \n``inclined round shape similar to the sun rising at dawn.'' Yet it is \nsimple in concept: a circle sloping toward the Mediterranean Sea, \npartly submerged in water. A wall of Aswan granite, with calligraphy \nrepresenting inscriptions from the world's civilizations, surrounds the \nbuilding, which is connected to Alexandria's famous Corniche by an \nelevated passageway.\n  This magnificent project could not have been completed without the \ngenerous support and leadership of President Hosni Mubarak, Mrs. \nSuzanne Mubarak, and the Egyptian people, and it has benefited \nenormously from the support of UNESCO, of many governments and non-\ngovernmental organizations, and of committed men and women around the \nworld. I am especially pleased that the sister-city partnership joining \nBaltimore and Alexandria has contributed to the library through a \ncommittee called the Baltimore Friends of Bibliotheca Alexandrina; \nunder the chairmanship of Dr. Raouf Boules, who came to this country \nfrom Alexandria and who serves as Assistant Dean of the College of \nScience and Mathematics at Towson University in Maryland, the committee \nhas been very successful in collecting books and raising funds for the \nLibrary.\n  The Ancient Library of Alexandria ``was and is one of the greatest \nand most inspiring creations of the human intellect,'' as Mrs. Mubarak \nhas observed. The New Library of Alexandria will surely carry forward \nthat tradition. On the day of its inauguration we celebrate the New \nLibrary, we pay tribute to those who have made its establishment \npossible, and we express deep gratitude for the contributions it will \nsurely make to greater knowledge and understanding worldwide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/10/senate-section/article/S2481-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            IRAQ'S MISSILES\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the danger of \nIraq's development of medium range ballistic missiles in violation of \nUnited Nations Resolution 687. I recently chaired a hearing of the \nGovernmental Affairs Subcommittee on International Security, \nProliferation, and Federal Services on Iraq's weapons of mass \ndestruction programs. Two of our witnesses were weapon inspectors in \nIraq during the 1990s as part of United National Special Commission, \nUNSCOM, Inspection Teams. Their candid statements painted a dark \npicture and outlined some difficult decisions we have to make.\n  When the gulf war ended, and the United National Security Council \npassed Resolution 687, Iraq agreed to destroy, remove or render \nharmless all ballistic missiles, related parts, and repair and \nproduction facilities with a range greater than 150 kilometers. \nFurther, Iraq agreed to not develop or acquire them in the future. The \ndedicated men and women of UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy \nAgency ferreted out and destroyed a large share of Iraq's prohibited \nweapons and related infrastructure in the 1990s. Despite the remarkable \njob they did, significant disarmament tasks and compliance issues \ncontinued through UNSCOM's departure from Iraq in December 1998.\n  Before the gulf war, Iraq had a variety of missile programs. These \nprograms were more than missile components and hardware. Iraq had a \ntrained team of missile experts, capable of reverse engineering a \nSoviet SCUD missile and moving into indigenous production of an Iraqi \nversion 2 years after initial acquisition. Their indigenous production \ncapability depended upon low reliability, low technology, low safety, \nand a sophisticated foreign assistance and supplier network.\n  Iraq has retained a great deal of this knowledge. Its team remains \nlargely intact working on permitted U.N. missile programs, which \nprovide cover for proscribed missile development. The liquid-fueled Al-\nSamoud missile most likely is capable of exceeding the range threshold \nset by U.N. resolutions and is widely believed to be a precursor for \nlonger-range missiles. The short-range Abhabil-100 missile program is \nproviding Iraq with a solid-propellant infrastructure and other \nimportant technologies that could be applied to a longer-range missile \nin the future.\n  At what point do allowed programs fall under the heading of related \nparts or production capability for longer-range missiles? I think the \nanswer in Iraq's case is, now.\n  Likewise, Iraq maintains expertise in converting aircraft to unmanned \naerial vehicles, lately demonstrated in modifications to L-29 trainer \naircraft. These unmanned aerial vehicles could be used to attack Israel \nor American forces in the region.\n  Iraq has persistently deceived, evaded, and concealed its weapon \nprograms. In spite of this, UNSCOM believed that it had accounted for \nthe elimination of all but a handful of Iraq's SCUD missiles. So why \nare we faced with this on-going threat to American security? It is true \nthat Iraq was able to hide some assets. More importantly, though, Iraq \nwas able to maintain its technical expertise and industrial base under \nthe guise of U.N. permitted missile programs.\n  Iraq built its missile programs over a number of years with \nassistance from companies in many countries. We must work with our \nallies and international partners to contain the missile program. We \nmust get inspectors back into Iraq and re-establish the U.N. monitoring \nprogram, and we must keep Saddam Hussein bottled up and force him to \nconfront obstacles in every direction. An U.N. inspection team with \nfull international support and access can complicate, constrain, and \nslow Iraq's clandestine efforts and give us a better understanding of \nwhat Iraq can do. But an inspection team, at its best, can contain or \nmanage, not eliminate, the threat.\n  We are now faced with the possibility that Saddam Hussein could \ndeploy weapons of mass destruction against his neighbors. We also must \nconsider under what conditions would Hussein give a biological or \nchemical agent or short-range ballistic missile to a terrorist group? \nThis January marked the 11th anniversary since the start of the gulf \nwar. As the war on terrorism evolves, we cannot forget our past \nattempts, successes, and failures in Iraq.\n  President Bush is right to continue to make Iraq an issue for the \ninternational community. We will need international support if we are \ngoing to have an effective strategy for eliminating Saddam Hussein as a \nthreat to world peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/10/senate-section/article/S2481-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in November \n1997 in Asheville, NC. A gay man was assaulted with a deadly weapon. \nThe assailant, Jeremi Dwayne Milling, 16, was sentenced to five years \nin prison for conspiracy to commit armed robbery, assault with a deadly \nweapon inflicting serious injury, and attempted armed robbery. Mr. \nMilling said that he targeted the victim because he was gay.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/10/senate-section/article/S2481-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2481-S2482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    U.S. ARMY STRYKER COMBAT VEHICLE\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to \naddress the importance of the Army's Stryker\n\n[[Page S2482]]\n\ncombat vehicle, what used to be called the Interim Armored Vehicle, \nbeing developed at Anniston Army Depot.\n  The Stryker is a new generation family of highly transportable \nwheeled combat vehicles capable of rapidly deploying anywhere in the \nworld. The Stryker vehicles roll onto a C-130 aircraft and roll off \nready to fight anywhere and anytime including complex and urban warfare \ncontingencies. They are lethal, survivable and will be engaged in the \nWar on Terrorism in the months to come.\n  If they were available today, Stryker vehicles would be deployed in \nthe mountains of Afghanistan and ably assisting in the elimination of \nal-Qaida and other enemies of this country. They would be providing \nground-based firepower and protection for our soldiers on the \nfrontlines.\n  The Stryker family embodies Army Transformation. It is the foundation \nof the Army's Interim Brigade Combat Teams that will be the spearhead \nof most conflicts envisioned in the next decade. The Army intends on \nprocuring 2,131 Strykers and this Congress must do everything it can to \nensure the Army is able to deliver on its promise to our soldiers.\n  Let me tell you, we cannot get these vehicles in the soldiers' hands \nfast enough. As it is, the Army and the joint venture designing and \ndeveloping the Stryker family have done an incredible job delivering \nthe initial vehicles this past February less than a year after the \nstart of work. I believe such a rapid delivery may be unprecedented in \nmodern times for a military program of this scope. The Army and the \nJoint Venture are to be commended.\n  In the fiscal year 2003 defense budget, the President has requested \n$812 million in procurement and $124 million in research and \ndevelopment for the Stryker vehicle. I hope this Congress will fully \nsupport this request and throw its support behind a program critical to \nour national security today and tomorrow.\n  The Army recently named the vehicles Stryker in honor of two fallen \nenlisted soldiers who died 20 years apart but shared the same name. \nBoth won the Medal of Honor. Specialist 4th Class Robert Stryker died \nin Vietnam when he threw himself onto a claymore mine as it detonated \nthus saving the lives of his comrades nearby. Stuart Stryker died in \nWorld War II when he led a platoon into an assault on Nazi headquarters \nnear the end of the war. Though he was killed in the raid, three \nmembers of an American bombing crew were rescued from the building.\n  We should not let those who serve this great Nation down. We must \nsupport ably and strongly the Stryker combat vehicle program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/10/senate-section/article/S2482-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, students have fallen silent in schools \nall across the country today to bring attention to the discrimination \nand harassment of our gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender, GLBT, \nyouth.\n  The voices that won't be heard today belong to the participants of a \nnational project called the Day of Silence.\n  The Day of Silence was conceived more than 6 years ago by Maria \nPulzetti, then a student at the University of Virginia, after she wrote \na paper on nonviolent protest and grassroots organizing. It encourages \nstudents to take a nine-hour pledge of silence to represent the silence \nthat GLBT students face because of harassment, discrimination and \nprejudice at their schools.\n  Since the first-ever Day of Silence at the University of Virginia in \n1996, the event has grown in size each year. This year, thousands of \nstudents will be participating from more than 1,776 middle schools, \nhigh schools, colleges and universities in 49 States, Puerto Rico and \nthe District of Columbia, including at least 136 schools in my State of \nCalifornia. This year's effort will easily be the largest in its \nhistory.\n  Instead of speaking, participants of the Day of Silence will hand out \ncards that explain why they have chosen not to talk. The cards read:\n\n       Please understand my reasons for not speaking today. I am \n     participating in the Day of Silence, a national youth \n     movement protesting the silence faced by lesbian, gay, \n     bisexual and transgender people and their allies. My \n     deliberate silence echoes that silence, which is caused by \n     harassment, prejudice, and discrimination. I believe that \n     ending the silence is the first step toward fighting these \n     injustices. Think about the voices you are not hearing today. \n     What are you going to do to end the silence?\n\n  Some participants will also be wearing t-shirts that spell out why \nthey have chosen not to speak today. Others will wear buttons or \nstickers. And still others will offer ribbons to those who are not \nready to take a vow of complete silence but who want to show their \nsupport.\n  In some cases, teachers will even join the effort by taping their \nlessons for the day, screening movies, or writing on the blackboard \ninstead of speaking to their classes.\n  In fact, students who have organized the event in the past say that \nthe broad participation of their friends and teachers has elevated the \nDay of Silence from ``a bunch of gay kids complaining about \ndiscrimination'' to a formidable student-led movement for civil rights.\n  But, regardless of which participant you ask, they all agree that \nthey can speak loudest by not saying a word. And, even though they will \nbe silent, their message will get across loud and clear.\n  I would also like to give special recognition to two California \nstudents that have helped organize this year's Day of Silence:\n  Sumiko Braun, 17, of Carson, CA, is the California State Organizer. \nShe is currently a senior at the California Academy of Mathematics and \nScience, and is also the founder and president of her school's Gay-\nStraight Alliance. Although the Gay-Straight Alliance has faced much \nadversity, the group has remained one of the most active on the \nschool's campus.\n  Nikira Hernandez, 15, of Santa Cruz, CA, is one of the National Team \nCo-Advisors. She currently attends Santa Cruz High School, and is a \nmember of her school's Rainbow Alliance. Before organizing Santa Cruz \nHigh School's first Day of Silence last spring, Nikira said her \nschool's Rainbow Alliance counted about half a dozen students as \nmembers--and they weren't very motivated. Then, when more than 200 \npeople fell silent on their behalf last year, she couldn't believe how \nmuch her life changed. She said, ``Seeing how many allies we had made \nme feel much more accepted at my school.''\n  I am encouraged that these two talented and dedicated young ladies \nhave taken the initiative to help end the silence of GLBT students \nthat, unfortunately, has become the norm in our Nation's schools. These \noutstanding Californians are not only giving support to other young \npeople who are participating in the Day of Silence effort, they are \nhelping to make their schools and their communities more accepting in \nthe process.\n  The effects of today's silence will last much longer than just one \nday. This experience will offer students an opportunity to think about \nhow powerful silencing can be and to focus on how they can make their \nown voices stronger.\n  Long after this day has ended, I hope students will continue to speak \nout against discrimination and harassment so that everyone can feel \naccepted at their schools, and we can overcome the forces that impose \nsilence on our youth.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/10/senate-section/article/S2483-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2483]]\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    COMMENDING IDAHO NATIONAL GUARD\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the \ncontributions of the Idaho National Guard who are providing support for \nin Operation Enduring Freedom and other military operations now \nunderway in the war against terrorism. While many of our military \ntroops are serving our country far away, many others are working hard \nhere at home to keep us safe. Idaho National Guard members have played \nkey roles in several events and efforts here at home and I wanted to \ntake this time to thank them and their families for those efforts. \nTheir assignments have been varied.\n  From September until the end of May, Idaho National Guard members \nhave augmented airport security and civilian screening efforts in at \nleast six airports in Idaho. They have provided a trained, armed, and \nhighly visible military presence in airports in Boise, Lewiston, Idaho \nFalls, Pocatello, Twin Falls, and Hailey. For the most part, these \nassignments have not required Guard members to be away from home, \nalthough some have had to leave their families to rotate through the \nassignments.\n  During the Olympics, the Boise Airport served as one of four gateway \nairports to Salt Lake City, and Idaho Guard members assisted in a \nvariety of efforts, including screening of aircrafts and passengers. \nGuard members also participated in security screening efforts at the \nvenues during the Games in Salt Lake City, working closely with the \nSecret Service. Additionally, the Idaho Guard provided aircraft and \npersonnel to facilitate moving people and equipment around various \nlocations in the Salt Lake area. And just this week, a couple of dozen \nof Idaho Guard members returned from assisting at the Paralympics.\n  Members of the Idaho National Guard were on hand for several weeks \nfrom October to January to help the state police with increased \nsecurity at the Idaho State Capitol, providing an extra set of eyes and \nears.\n  Right now, there are more than 40 Idaho Guard personnel who have just \nbeen deployed to Bosnia for a six-month assignment. While there, they \nwill assist in the peace-making missions outlined in the 1995 Dayton \nPeace Accord.\n  As we continue to fight this war on terrorism, it is important to \nremember not only those who are serving in far-off places, but to \nrecognize those who are serving at home to keep us safe. This is a war \nlike no other we have fought, and we are reminded every day of the \nvalue of military service.

CARL F. SCHULTZ, JR.\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the \nReverend Dr. Carl F. Schultz, Jr., Senior Pastor of the First Church of \nChrist, Congregational, in Glastonbury, CT. Dr. Schultz will be \nretiring on June 9, 2002, after 43 years of ministry, 34 of which have \nbeen with First Church of Christ.\n  This is a significant milestone for Dr. Schultz and his congregation, \nfor he has been the longest serving pastor in the more than 300-year \nhistory of First Church of Christ in Glastonbury. Since 1968 when Dr. \nSchultz joined this congregation, the church has greatly expanded it \nfacilities, programs, and outreach. Under his leadership, First Church \nof Christ has expanded its sanctuary, classroom and office space and \nraised more than a million dollars for building improvements, a new \npipe organ, and television production facilities which have allowed the \nchurch to broadcast its services.\n  Dr. Schultz has been very active in the Glastonbury community through \nhis service with the Glastonbury Pastoral Counseling Center, the \nGlastonbury Conference of Churches, the Glastonbury Clergy Association, \nand as Chaplin to the Police and Fire Departments. He has also served \nin several capacities with the Connecticut Conference of the United \nChurch of Christ, lending his knowledge and expertise to the growth of \nthe church throughout the State.\n  On the national level, Dr. Schultz has been a delegate to the General \nSynod of the United Church of Christ on several occasions, and last, \nbut certainly not least, in 1994 and 1999, at my invitation, he served \nas Chaplain for a day here in the U.S. Senate, offering a prayer to \nstart our day as we serve here in the Nation's Capitol.\n  For his devoted service to the members of his congregation, the First \nChurch of Christ, Congregational, and for the many contributions he has \nmade to the citizens of our state, the people of Connecticut thank Dr. \nSchultz and wish him well in his retirement. On a personal level, I \nconsider Dr. Schultz and his dear wife, Della, to be my friends, and I \npray that his retirement may be a time of rebirth and new life for them \nboth. May God bless him and his family in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/10/senate-section/article/S2483-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO STEWART VERDERY\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today I recognize a former member \nof my staff, C. Stewart Verdery, who is leaving the Senate staff after \nseveral years of providing valuable counsel for many of us here.\n  Stewart first came to the Senate as a legislative counsel in my \noffice and, because of his good work, when I assumed the chairmanship \nof the Committee on Rules and Administration, I asked him to join the \ncommittee staff and serve as counsel. In addition to his excellent work \non legislation and other issues before the Rules Committee, Stewart \nserved the committee at a time when we faced an unusual challenge--that \nof conducting the first major investigation of a contested Senate \nelection since the 1970s and the first involving allegations of fraud \nsince the 1950s. Stewart played a key role coordinating the onsite \ninvestigations and then worked with outside counsel in questioning of \nwitnesses both onsite and here in Washington. He had a major role in \ndrafting a committee report on the investigation which now takes its \nplace with other historic documents in the 213-year history of the \nSenate to uphold standards and guide procedures for handling contested \nelections. His wise counsel and steady hand were invaluable to me and \nto the Senate.\n  After his outstanding work on the Rules Committee, Stewart went on to \nserve with the Senate's Assistant Republican Leader, Don Nickles, as \nGeneral Counsel. In his duties there, he worked directly with many \nSenators in this body. Stewart was widely respected for his knowledge \nof facts and sound political judgement.\n  As he leaves the Senate, we wish him well. I am confident he will go \non to add new successes to the many he has chalked up during his years \nhere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/10/senate-section/article/S2483-4", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2483-S2484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO LAWRENCE LONGLEY\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nhonor the life of a dear friend of mine, Lawrence Longley. Larry passed \naway at the end of last month after a long battle with cancer.\n  Larry was a professor at Lawrence University in Appleton, WI, for 37 \nyears. He taught in the University's government program and quickly \ngained the respect and admiration of his colleagues, the \nadministration, and his students. In addition to his work at Lawrence, \nhe served as a visiting scholar at Northwestern University and as a \nguest lecturer in politics at Imperial College in London. Additionally, \nhe taught in the Washington Semester Program of American University.\n  A strong influence in the political process and government, Larry's \nwritings were widely published and read by students and scholars alike. \nHe was the author or co-author of more than 100 books, including ``The \nPeople's President'' and ``The Electoral College Primer 2000.'' Larry \nwas a strong critic of the electoral college. The fictional opening \nchapter his ``The Electoral College Primer 2000,'' written\n\n[[Page S2484]]\n\nin 1999, told the story of a Presidential election crisis not unlike \nthe real one that transpired during the 2000 elections.\n  His sphere of influence was not limited to academia. Larry was an \nactive member of the Democratic Party. He was part of the Democratic \nNational Committee and served on the Executive Committee in 1996-1997. \nHe was among the 538 electors in the Electoral College in 1988 and \n1992. At the local and State levels, Larry headed many area campaigns \nfor nationally elected officials.\n  His expertise on the electoral college and its process made him an \ninvaluable consultant to this body's Judiciary Committee throughout the \n1970s and 1990s. Often called to testify before U.S. Senate hearings, \nhis research and findings on the electoral college contributed a great \ndeal to public debates on this important issue. His legacy will be long \nremembered in the halls surrounding this chamber as well as across the \ncountry.\n  Larry was a true friend and one of my best supporters. He was an \nintelligent observer of and an active and loyal participant in our \ndemocracy. He will be remembered for his honesty, his diligence, and \nhis kindness. We will dearly miss him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/10/senate-section/article/S2484-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING MARLOW McCULLOUGH\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I am afforded the \nopportunity to rise amongst my colleagues to honor Mrs. Marlow \nMcCullough of Taylor County, KY. Mrs. McCullough was recently named \nWoman of the Year for the Taylor County community.\n  When Marlow McCullough was informed that she had been named Woman of \nthe Year for Taylor County, she was completely shocked and surprised. \nIn fact, she did not have any idea that she had even been nominated for \nthe contest. In an extremely thoughtful and loving gesture, David \nMcCullough, Marlow's husband, nominated her for the award. Marlow was \none of 40 women to be considered for this honor.\n  In my experiences in sports, business, and politics, I have \ndiscovered that the most difficult part of being successful is \nbalancing responsibilities and commitments. Trying to find adequate and \nample time to satisfy all of our wants and needs can be quite an \noverwhelming and intimidating task. For most of us, this task is \nsomething we work toward for a lifetime. Marlow McCullough has \nskillfully mastered this seemingly impossible balancing act.\n  Mrs. McCullough is not just a loving wife of 24 years and devoted \nmother of 4 wonderful children. She also is a full-time and highly \nrespected instructor of mathematics at Campbellsville University. As if \nthese accolades would not suffice to earn her the title of Woman of the \nYear, Mrs. McCullough is an accomplished musician, an active and devout \nmember of the Campbellsville Baptist Church, an organizer of local \nyouth soccer, and an active and visible participant in many of her \nchildren's school activities. Mrs. McCullough stated it best when she \nsaid, ``Planning and partnerships are the keys to success.''\n  I applaud Mrs. McCullough for her commitment to church, family, \ncareer, and community, and congratulate her on being named Woman of the \nYear for Taylor County. I believe we all can learn something from her \nexemplary behavior.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/10/senate-section/article/S2484-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL PATRICK D. SCULLEY\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \na fellow Texan, Major General Patrick D. Sculley of the U.S. Army \nDental Corps. Major General Sculley has served our country for 29 years \nin a number of senior positions. His distinguished career culminated \nwith his appointment to be Deputy Surgeon General of the Army and \nChief, U.S. Army Dental Corps.\n  As the deputy surgeon general, Major General Sculley provided \nexceptional leadership and oversight of all Army healthcare facilities \nand biomedical research activities. His efforts facilitated the highest \nquality healthcare for military beneficiaries while ensuring health \nreadiness and a deployable medical force.\n  As the chief of the U.S. Army Dental Corps, he implemented a \nworldwide Dental Care Optimization Program that significantly increased \nthe dental readiness of military personnel and improved the dental \nhealth of America's Army. While still a colonel, he was integral to the \nestablishment of the U.S. Army Dental Command and was its first \ncommander. Throughout the nearly three decades of service to our \ncountry, Major General Sculley emphasized personal involvement with his \njunior officers. His leadership by example has been instrumental in the \nretention of quality dental officers.\n  I would like to commend Pat and his wife, Peggy, for their unwavering \ndedication to the United States and the Army and thank them for their \nservice. They have served our Nation with distinction and in the finest \ntraditions of the U.S. Army. I wish them well in future endeavors as \nthey enter a new phase of their lives in Texas. May God continue to \nbless Major General Sculley and his family and may God bless \nAmerica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/10/senate-section/article/S2484-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:07 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1009.

A bill to modify the application of the antitrust laws to \npermit collective development and implementation of a standard contract \nform for playwrights for the licensing of their plays; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Playwrights' \nLicensing Relief Act of 2002. I thank Senator Schumer, my cosponsor on \nthis bill, for his interest and leadership on this important \nlegislation.\n  This bill is necessary both to ensure the continued vitality of \nAmerican live theater and to protect the intellectual property and \nartistic rights of playwrights. When the theater is crowded and the \ncurtain rises, it is easy to forget that the entire show began with one \nperson: the lone playwright who put the pen to paper.\n  Playwrights and their voluntary peer membership organization, the \nDramatists Guild, operate under the shadow of the antitrust laws, and \nsubstantially without the ability to coordinate their actions in \nprotecting their interests. This has impeded playwrights' ability to \nact collectively in dealing with highly-oranized and unionized groups, \nsuch as actors, directors, and choreographers, on the one hand, and the \nincreasingly consolidated producers and investors on the other.\n  I am proud that this legislation enables playwrights to act \ncollectively without violating the antitrust laws. It lets them develop \nstandard form contracts as well as provisions ensuring that certain \nartists' rights are respected in the production of their plays. These \nsteps will help support playwrights, especially young playwrights, as \nthey enter this increasingly sophisticated and consolidated market. By \nhelping playwrights in the way we encourage the continued vibrance of \nour American theater and culture.\n  I am pleased to introduce this bill and look forward to working with \nSenator Schumer on this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2082\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Antitrust laws.--The term ``antitrust laws'' has the \n     meaning given it in section (a) of the first section of the \n     Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12) except that such term includes \n     section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45) \n     to the extent that such section applies to unfair methods of \n     competition.\n       (2) Playwright.--The term ``playwright'' means the author, \n     composer, or lyricist of a dramatic or musical work intended \n     to be performed on the speaking stage and shall include, \n     where appropriate, the adapter of a work from another medium.\n       (3) Producer.--The term ``producer''--\n       (A) means any person who obtains the rights to present live \n     stage productions of a play; and\n       (B) includes any person who presents a play as first class \n     performances in major cities, as well as those who present \n     plays in regional and not-for-profit theaters.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 2083. a bill to authorize the Secretary of Education to make \ngrants to educational organizations to carry out educational programs \nabout the Holocaust; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and colleague \nfrom Ohio, Senator DeWine, to introduce the Holocaust Education \nAssistance Act. This legislation provides for grants to support \nHolocaust education programs that teach the lessons that\n\n[[Page S2487]]\n\nthe Holocaust provides for all people, including developing curriculum \nguides and providing training to help teachers incorporate those \nlessons in their classes. This bill is especially timely this week, as \nwe observe the Holocaust Days of Remembrance. The Holocaust has always \nbeen a difficult issue to teach; the complexities and the sheer horror \nof what occurred in Nazi Germany can seem overwhelming. But, I am \nconfident that this bill will help educators to undertake the difficult \nbut vital task of helping this and future generations understand the \nmeaning of the Holocaust.\n  In the wake of the events of September 11, it is more important than \never to understand the damage and suffering that acts of hatred and \nracism can reap. The Holocaust was one of history's darkest moments and \nit must be remembered in order to prevent its repetition. Indeed, we \nare constantly reminded of why we must be vigilant against ethnic \nhatred and violence. In the past 10 years, for example, we have seen \nethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. The old axiom \nremains true: ``those who do not learn from history are doomed to \nrepeat it.''\n  Yet, even today, there are some who not only refuse to learn from the \nHolocaust, but who refuse even to accept that it happened. The \nHolocaust, of course, did happen. We saw the remains of the camps at \nTreblinka and Auschwitz; we read letters sent among Nazi leaders \ndiscussing the ``final solution,'' and we hear the eloquent words of \ncountless survivors such as Elie Wiesel and Primo Levi describing the \natrocities they witnessed and were forced to endure. In the face of all \nthat, it is our responsibility to educate ourselves and our children \nabout the horrors of the Holocaust and help to build a world in which \nsuch events never happen again.\n  Knowledge is the most effective tool in breaking down the barriers \nbetween groups and creating more inclusive and tolerant societies. This \nlegislation will help with the critical task of spreading such \nknowledge through education.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND:\n  S. 2084. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthe exemption from tax for small property and casualty insurance \ncompanies; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \naddresses an inequity facing an important segment of the small business \ncommunity. This legislation is simple and straight forward, it adjusts \nthe current tax exemption that has existed since 1942 for small \nproperty and casualty, (P), insurance companies so that it keeps pace \nwith inflation.\n  As the ranking member of the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I have heard from many small P insurers in Missouri \nand across the Nation that they are having to consider raising their \npremiums simply because the tax laws have not kept pace with inflation. \nUnder current law, mutual and stock P insurance companies are exempt \nfrom Federal income taxes if the greater of their direct or net written \npremiums in a taxable year do not exceed $350,000.\n  For companies that grow above the $350,000 threshold, current law \npermits electing P insurance companies to be taxed only on their \ninvestment income, provided their premiums do not exceed $1.2 million. \nUnfortunately, these thresholds, which were last updated in the Tax \nReform Act of 1986, have not been adjusted for inflation.\n  This situation has created an unintended outcome. Take, for instance, \na small P insurer in my State that started insuring the local farmers \nin the late 1980s. Over the ensuring years, the company's client base \nchanged very little, but the insurance premiums increased gradually to \nkeep pace with inflationary pressures. As a result, while the business \nitself has not grown, its premium base has and with it the loss of the \ntax exemption, (or the alternative tax on investment income).\n  For the farmers and ranchers covered by the small P insurer, this \nloss is certain to mean higher insurance premiums, leaving the client \nwith the choice of cutting coverage or paying higher costs, neither of \nwhich is a real option. And for our agricultural community over the \npast few years, this choice is about the last thing they need.\n  The bill I introduce today would correct this problem by simply \nadjusting the $350,000 and $1.2 million thresholds to bring them up to \nthe level they would have been this year if the 1986 tax code had \nincluded an inflation adjustment. Accordingly, the tax exemption would \napply to P insurers with premiums that do not exceed $551,000, and \nthe alternative for taxation of investment income would apply to \ncompanies with premiums above $551,000 but not more than $1,890,000. \nThe bill would apply for taxable years beginning in 2002 and would \nindex both thresholds for inflation thereafter.\n  According to the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, \nthis legislation will help at least 652 small P insurance companies \nnationwide. In my State, at least 62 small insurance companies will \ncontinue to be covered under the current tax provisions, thereby \nenabling them to continue providing critical insurance coverage to \nsmall businesses across Missouri.\n  With this legislation, we have an opportunity to infuse some fairness \ninto our tax code and at the same time help the thousands of farmers, \nranchers, and entrepreneurs covered by small P insurers in this \ncountry. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation, and I look \nforward to working with the Finance Committee to see it enacted into \nlaw.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be provided in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2084\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nclarify the definition of homebound with respect to home health \nservices under the medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today \nlegislation that is cosponsored by Senators Cleland, Bond, and \nHutchinson, that would modernize the current outdated homebound \nrequirement that has impeded access to needed home health care services \nfor far too many of our Nation's frail, elderly, and disabled Medicare \nbeneficiaries. I thank former Senator Bob Dole, one of our Nation's\n\n[[Page S2488]]\n\nleading advocates, on behalf of individuals with disabilities, for \nbringing this issue to my attention.\n  The highly skilled and often technically complex care that our home \nhealth care agencies provide has enabled millions of our most \nvulnerable older and disabled citizens to receive health care just \nwhere they want to be: in the security, comfort, and privacy of their \nown homes.\n  Under current law, a Medicare patient must be considered homebound to \nbe eligible for home health services. While an individual is not \nactually required to be bedridden in order to qualify, his or her \ncondition must be such that ``there exists a normal inability to leave \nhome.'' Moreover, leaving home must require ``a considerable and taxing \neffort by the individual.'' The law does allow for absences from the \nhome of ``infrequent'' or ``relatively short duration.''\n  Unfortunately, the law does not define precisely what this means. It \nleaves it to the fiscal intermediaries to interpret just how many \nabsences qualify as ``frequent'' and just how short these absences must \nbe. The result is that interpretations of the law vary widely from \nregion to region. As a consequence, there have been far too many \ninstances where an overzealous or arbitrary interpretation of the \ndefinition has turned elderly or disabled Medicare beneficiaries who \nare dependent on Medicare home health services and medical equipment \ninto virtual prisoners in their own homes. We have heard disturbing \naccounts of individuals on Medicare who have had their home health care \nbenefits terminated for leaving their homes briefly to visit a \nhospitalized spouse or to attend a major family gathering, including in \none case, to attend the funeral of their own child.\n  Another mother did not attend the funeral of her own child out of \nfear that by doing so, she would jeopardize her home health benefits. \nThis does not make sense, and it is just cruel.\n  The current homebound requirement is particularly hard on younger, \ndisabled Medicare patients. For example, People magazine reported a \nstory last year about a Georgia resident, David Jayne, a 40-year-old \nman with Lou Gehrig's disease, who was confined to a wheelchair and \ncould not swallow, speak, or even breathe on his own. Obviously, he \nneeded skilled nursing visits several times per week in order for him \nto remain at home and not at an inpatient facility.\n  Despite his disability, however, Mr. Jayne meets frequently with \nyouth and church groups. He is an inspirational person. He speaks using \na computerized voice synthesizer and gives inspirational talks about \nhow the human spirit can endure and even overcome great hardship.\n  The Atlantic Journal Constitution ran a feature article on Mr. Jayne \nand his activities, including a report about how he had, with great \neffort and help from his family and friends, attended a football game \nto root for the University of Georgia Bulldogs.\n  A few days later, unbelievably, at the direction of the fiscal \nintermediary, his home health agency--which had been sending a home \nhealth nurse to his home for 2 hours, 4 mornings a week--notified him \nthat he was no longer considered homebound and terminated his benefits. \nHis benefits were subsequently reinstated due to the enormous amount of \nmedia attention to this case, but this experience motivated him to \nlaunch a crusade to modernize the homebound definition and led him to \nfound the National Coalition to Amend the Medicare Homebound \nRestriction.\n  So even out of this terrible experience, once again this \ninspirational individual who is suffering so greatly from Lou Gehrig's \ndisease has managed to launch a crusade to try to prevent what happened \nto him from happening to other severely disabled individuals who are \ndependent on home health care.\n  The fact is, the current requirement that Medicare beneficiaries be \nhomebound in order to be eligible for home health benefits reflects an \noutmoded view of life for persons who are elderly or live with \ndisabilities. The legislation I am introducing attempts to correct this \nproblem. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting it.\n  I hope we can make this change, which will make a real difference for \nmillions of disabled and elderly Medicare beneficiaries.\n  The homebound criteria for home health may have made sense thirty \nyears ago, when an elderly or disabled person might expect to live in \nthe confines of their home, perhaps cared for by an extended family. \nThe current definition, however, fails to reflect the technological and \nmedical advances that have been made in supporting individuals with \nsignificant disabilities and mobility challenges. It also fails to \nreflect advances in treatment for seriously ill individuals--like Mr. \nJayne--which allows them brief periods of relative wellness. It also \nfails to recognize that an individual's mental acuity and physical \nstamina can only be maintained by use, and that the use of the body and \nmind is encouraged by social interactions outside the four walls of a \nhome.\n  The legislation that we are introducing today will amend the \nhomebound definition to base eligibility for the home health benefit on \nthe patient's functional limitations and clinical condition, rather \nthan on an arbitrary limitation on absences from the home. It would \nretain the requirements in current law that the individual must have \neither a condition, due to illness or injury, that restricts the \nability of the individual to leave his or her home except with the \nassistance of another individual or the aid of a supportive device; or \na condition such that leaving his or her home is medically \ncontraindicated.\n  In addition, the condition of the individual must still be such that \n``there exists a normal inability to leave home'' and that ``leaving \nhome requires a considerable and taxing effort.'' Under our \nlegislation, however, the current arbitrary requirement that patients \nbe allowed ``only infrequent absences of short duration'' from the home \nwould be dropped. Our legislation builds upon major improvements in the \ndefinition of homebound that were initiated in the last Congress by \nSenator Jeffords, Reed and others which specifically allow Medicare \npatients to leave the home to attend religious services and participate \nin adult day care.\n  Our proposal is supported by the Leadership Council of Aging \nOrganizations, the National Association for Home Care, and the Visiting \nNurses Association of America. It is also consistent with President \nBush's ``New Freedom Initiative,'' which has, as its goal, the removal \nof barriers that impede opportunities for those with disabilities to \nintegrate more fully into the community. By allowing reasonable \nabsences from the home, our legislation will bring the Medicare home \nhealth benefit into the 21st century, and we encourage all of our \ncolleagues to join us as cosponsors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 2087. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nemployers a credit against income tax for the provision of independent \ninvestment advice to employees; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nMaine, Senator Collins, to introduce legislation that will facilitate \nthe flow of investment advice by providing businesses with a Federal \nincome tax credit for small businesses of up to $30 per participant, \n$20 for larger businesses, for providing qualified independent \ninvestment advice. This legislation is a continuation of our efforts to \nhelp 401(k) participants better understand their investment options and \nenable them to make sound financial decisions. Last year, Senator \nCollins and I introduced S. 1677, ``The Independent Investment Advice \nAct of 2001'' that will create a safe harbor for employers to relieve \nthem of liability for the selection and monitoring of qualified \nindependent investment advisers. Combined, these pieces of legislation \nwill facilitate the flow of investment advice to all plan participants \nregardless of their income or net worth.\n  As introduced, this legislation will provide small businesses, as \ndefined as having 50 employees or less, with a 60 percent tax credit on \nthe first $50 of the cost associated with providing qualified \nindependent investment advice. All other employers will be eligible for \na 40 percent credit on the same amount of expenses. This legislation \nwill limit the benefit for any plan sponsor to a total of $50,000 of \ncredits per year under this provision.\n\n[[Page S2489]]\n\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle in advancing this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as folllows:\n\n                                S. 2087\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit an \nimportant resolution regarding the Jackson-Vanik Amendment and the \nRussian Federation. I am joined by my colleague Senator Clinton of New \nYork and 26 other cosponsors in submitting this resolution. This \nlegislation recognizes the progress made by the Russian Federation \nregarding religious freedom issues and the Jewish community, as well as \nthe impact the Jackson-Vanik Amendment has had even before it was \nsigned into law in 1975.\n  Over one million Israelis, hundreds of thousands of Americans and \ncountless thousands across the world are living free because of \nJackson-Vanik and the American commitment it reflects to religious \nfreedom and freedom of emigration. At the same time, countless Jews and \nothers in Russia live in relative freedom thanks in part to the very \nJackson-Vanik Amendment that U.S. and Soviet leaders once decried as a \n``Cold War relic''. Rather than a relic, it is a lesson for us today.\n  The legacy of Jackson-Vanik goes far beyond its impact on those \nliving freer today. Jackson-Vanik has actualized the notion that human \nrights are not the province of any country's ``domestic internal \npolicy''. Since the exchange of letters last November 13 between the \nU.S. and Russian governments, there can never again be a doubt that \nreligious freedom has earned a prominent place on the U.S.-Russian \nbilateral agenda.\n  The achievements of President Bush and his administration in this \nregard have carried out the spirit of previous administrations. In \naddition to recent letters from President Bush to the Congressional \nleadership, the President wrote last November 19 to Harold Paul Luks, \nChairman of NCSJ: ``The Jewish community has helped write a proud \nchapter in the history of American foreign relations, but the work is \nnot complete. We need your continued advocacy and support, and my \nAdministration looks forward to working closely with you on these \nchallenges.''\n  Clearly, Senate and citizen involvement is not an impediment to U.S. \nforeign policy. As the President's letter underscores, such activism is \nan underpinning of our approach to foreign governments. While this \nResolution takes no position on ``graduating'' Russia from Jackson-\nVanik, the test should not be the total elimination of xenophobia or \nthe completion of democratic civil society. Never before has religious \nactivity in Russia been so varied and widespread. And yet the threats \nto freedom of religion remain. We now have many channels for addressing \nour deep concerns.\n  If the legislation to graduate Russia does incorporate these channels \nand the commitments of the Russian and U.S. governments, then future \nleaders of Russia will know the context in which the United States \nCongress has considered the extension of Normal Trade Relations. And if \nour colleagues join in support of this Resolution, regardless of their \nposition on Russia's graduation, then the sense of the Senate will be \nan explicit part of the permanent record of this process.\n  The legacy of Jackson-Vanik vis-a-vis Russia is a proud one, and one \nthat can best be sealed through appropriate legislation and through \nmessages such as the resolution we introduce today. I want to thank the \n28 cosponsors of this resolution and ask that all my colleagues join me \non this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/10/senate-section/article/S2490-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2490-S2491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 235--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE WITH RESPECT \n      TO THE PROTECTION OF AFGHAN REFUGEES, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, and Mrs. Feinstein) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nForeign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 235\n\n       Whereas more than 3,500,000 Afghan citizens are currently \n     refugees in Pakistan and Iran, displaced by decades of civil \n     war and conflict, and at least 1,000,000 Afghans are \n     internally displaced within their own country;\n       Whereas, since the overthrow of the Taliban, thousands have \n     continued to flee Afghanistan or have been displaced inside \n     the country, including ethnic Pashtuns escaping persecution \n     in the north, and others are fearful of returning home due to \n     unstable, violent conditions in various parts of Afghanistan;\n       Whereas only the creation of a secure, stable Afghanistan \n     that protects the rights of all citizens, including women and \n     ethnic minorities, can provide the conditions in which \n     refugees and displaced persons can safely and voluntarily \n     return to their home communities;\n       Whereas, until conditions warrant the safe, voluntary \n     return of Afghans, neighboring countries should uphold their \n     international humanitarian and legal obligations to provide \n     refugees with adequate protection and humanitarian \n     assistance, and to uphold the right of refugees to cross \n     international borders in order to seek asylum;\n       Whereas the Governments of Pakistan and Iran have allowed \n     Afghan refugees to remain in those countries of asylum, \n     despite the enormous economic and social costs this involves;\n       Whereas the United States and other members of the \n     international community should continue to offer expanded \n     financial and other assistance to internally displaced \n     Afghans and to governments hosting large Afghan refugee \n     populations;\n       Whereas in November 2000, Iran and Pakistan officially \n     closed their borders to new incoming refugees, and as of \n     February 2002, at least 10,000 Afghans were stranded in camps \n     near the Iran border inside Afghanistan and were blocked from \n     gaining entry into Iran, and several thousand were awaiting \n     entry to Pakistan at the Chaman border crossing;\n       Whereas authorities of Pakistan and Iran have forcibly \n     returned some Afghans in violation of international legal \n     norms of nonrefoulement, and both governments began \n     repatriating refugees in March 2002, despite the clear \n     dangers many of them face in their home areas;\n       Whereas Australia, Indonesia, Tajikistan, and Dubai have \n     expressed their desire to begin returning refugees as soon as \n     possible or, in the case of Dubai, have already deported \n     hundreds of Afghans;\n       Whereas law enforcement authorities in Pakistan have \n     subjected Afghan refugees to physical violence, harassment, \n     extortion, and arbitrary detention because of their \n     undocumented status;\n       Whereas some refugee camps in the Federally Administered \n     Tribal Areas of Pakistan are located close to the Afghan \n     border in unsafe and unhealthy locations;

Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues \nSenators Boxer and Feinstein to submit a resolution calling for \nprotection and assistance for Afghan refugees, as they\n\n[[Page S2491]]\n\nstruggle to find their way home and rebuild their lives amid so much \nuncertainty.\n  Today more than 3.5 million Afghan citizens are refugees in Pakistan \nand Iran, having been displaced by decades of civil war and conflict. \nSince the overthrow of the Taliban, thousands have continued to flee \nAfghanistan, including ethnic Pashtuns escaping persecution in the \nNorth. Many have been subjected to physical violence, harassment, \nextortion, and arbitrary detention because of their undocumented \nstatus.\n  Unfortunately, many also now live under the threat of repatriation to \nAfghanistan against their will. In clear violation of international \nlegal norms, authorities in Pakistan and Iran have forcibly returned \nsome Afghans and have stated a desire to begin a large scale \nrepatriation effort of Afghan refugees, despite the clear dangers many \nof them would face in Afghanistan.\n  Like most observers, I believe that the United Nations High \nCommissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, is well-prepared for a massive \nrepatriation of refugees to Afghanistan this spring and also to assist \nlarge numbers of internally displaced Afghans return to their farms and \nhomes. That said, it is imperative that UNHCR and other U.N. agencies, \ndonors, and the international security force work closely together to \nmake the repatriation program as successful as possible.\n  According to UNHCR, each day, more and more Afghans come forward to \nparticipate in the voluntary return programs. Since the start of the \njoint Afghan Government and UNHCR assisted return program on March 1, \nmore than 200,000 Afghans have repatriated from Pakistan. However, \nthese efforts have been and likely will continue to be hampered by a \nnumber of factors. The peaceful transition to normalcy requires a \ncertain set of conditions for success. The main factors influencing the \nnumber of Afghan refugees and displaced who return home are security, \neconomic opportunity, and economic ties in countries of asylum.\n  As our G.I.'s in Afghanistan know all too well, many area in \nAfghanistan are still very dangerous. Military operations will \nundoubtedly continue in southeastern Afghanistan and elsewhere. In \nother areas, renewed strife among bandits, warlords and the government \nare likely to continue to break out. Accordingly, security is perhaps \nthe greatest challenge for the young Afghan nation, as well as for \nthose charged with the task of relief and repatriation.\n  While these fears make return to Afghanistan a daunting prospect, \nAfghan refugees are also experiencing increasingly hostile treatment in \nIran and Pakistan and pressure to leave. Mistreatment at the hands of \nPakistani or Iranian law enforcement authorities and violence in \nrefugee camps are just some of the problems Afghan refugees face on a \ndaily basis.\n  Refugees interviewed by Human Rights Watch in Pakistan described the \nhuman toll caused by that government's treatment of the refugee \npopulation: With borders closed, most refugees had to resort to \ndangerous and unofficial routes into Pakistan. Refugees were beaten at \nunofficial checkpoints when they could not afford to pay extortionate \nbribes. At official crossing points, families were beaten back, or \nlanguished in squalor without food, water or latrines, hoping to be let \nin. Once inside Pakistan, refugees were subjected to harassment and \ndetention, while others endured beatings by Pakistani police when \nlining up for food in camps.\n  According to Human Rights Watch, Iran also has been an egregious \noffender of international humanitarian law. Its border closure policies \nrun directly contrary to international standards, most fundamentally \nbecause they interfere with the right to seek asylum. By closing its \nborders, conducting systematic and large scale push-backs, and by \ninsisting on the establishment of camps for displaced persons inside \nAfghanistan, the Government of Iran has violated its obligations under \nnumerous international conventions.\n  Today, I join with human rights and refugee organizations to strongly \nurge the governments of Pakistan and Iran to identify those refugees \nwho continue to be in need of protection, to provide them with \ndocumentation and legal status, and to end persistent abuses of the \nrights of refugees in both countries. The governments of Pakistan and \nIran as well as UNHCR must ensure that Afghan refugees have access to \nfull and objective information about conditions inside Afghanistan \nbefore deciding whether or not to return. Moreover, refugees should not \nbe forced to return prematurely because of insecurity or lack of \nassistance in neighboring countries.\n  Economic opportunity also will determine whether or not refugees and \ninternally displaced persons, IDPs, return to their homes or villages. \nJobs and economic opportunities for Afghans wishing to return home are \nsparse. In addition, many long-term Afghan refugees are earning a \nlivelihood in their countries of asylum and their willingness to return \nhome has not yet been determined. Despite these uncertainties, most \nrefugees surveyed want to go home.\n  A successful return program also will require long-term economic \ndevelopment assistance to help returnees and their communities become \neconomically self-sufficient. Many of the returnees will be going back \nto the poorest, drought-impacted, and strife-ridden areas of \nAfghanistan. Longer-term development aid should be factored into the \nservices available for returnees and their communities from the outset \nto help ensure that they become economically self-sufficient and self-\nsustaining.\n  I will continue to call on the United States and other donor \ngovernments to provide adequate funding to the Afghan Interim \nAuthority's Ministry for the Return of Refugees, and for the voluntary \nreturn of refugees under conditions of safety and with full respect for \ntheir human rights. The key to success in any repatriation is \nvoluntariness. Iran and Pakistan must respect this mandate.\n  While the governments of Pakistan, Iran, and others have consistently \nallowed Afghan refugees to remain in those countries despite the \nenormous economic and social costs this involves, and Pakistan must be \ncommended for its extraordinary efforts in the campaign against \nterrorism over the last 6 months, Iran and Pakistan should not now turn \ntheir backs on these vulnerable people. They must fully cooperate with \nthe UNHCR in providing protection to Afghan refugees. They must allow \nopen access to refugees by nongovernmental organizations and \ninternational agencies offering humanitarian assistance. They must also \nimmediately cease any forcible return of Afghan refugees and take \naction to end their harassment, detention, and other mistreatment.\n  To address these concerns, a significant refugee repatriation \nagreement was signed last week in Geneva by the governments of Iran, \nAfghanistan and the UNHCR. I am confident that the Tripartite \nAgreement, which lays down the main legal and operational framework for \nthe voluntary return of Afghan refugees in Iran, will address many of \nthese concerns.\n  I ask that the Senate show unanimous support for Afghanistan in its \ntime of greatest need. This resolution highlights the uncertain and \ndangerous situation faced by Afghan refugees and calls upon the \nPresident to urge countries in the region to abide by well-established \nnorms of international refugee and humanitarian law. A vote for this \nresolution is a vote for the millions of displaced Afghans, and a test \ncase of our willingness to secure Afghanistan's peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/10/senate-section/article/S2491-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2491-S2492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3085.

Mr. President, it is late tonight, but I want to underline \nthis resolution. The staff did tremendous work. I can remember the \nfirst morning after they found the letter containing anthrax. Everyone \nwas very professional.\n  I also want to make sure everyone understands the great work that was \ndone by the Secretary of the Senate and the Sergeant at Arms, Jeri \nThomson and General Lenhardt, respectively. Their actions were \nexemplary. General Lenhardt had only briefly been working for the \nSenate. He was faced immediately with 9-11 and then this anthrax \nsituation. His being a general has certainly paid us dividends. He \nreally knew how to react under fire.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto; that the amendments to the preamble be agreed to; that the \npreamble, as amended, be agreed to; and that the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
