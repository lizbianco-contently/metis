He mentioned the terrible fires in the \nWest, which brings to my attention the fact that when there is trouble \nin the country, the place one has to look is to the Government. After \none has completed their prayers and the spiritual things they do, the \nGovernment is next in line.\n  If we think about the wildfires that sweep the West every summer, it \nis the Federal Government that steps in to help. Tens of thousands of \nFederal employees fight those fires. They are professional \nfirefighters. They come in every summer. They do very dangerous work. \nThey place themselves in harm's way to protect property and people's \nlives. We have these firefighters who jump out of airplanes and \nparachute, heavily loaded with all kinds of equipment, to fight these \nfires. We have firefighters who rappel off the back of helicopters to \nfight these fires.\n  So for all the bad that people hear about Government, I think we \nshould stop and think about the people who fight these fires that are \nconsuming--there is one fire now in Arizona that is raging in an area \nabout 10 times that of the District of Columbia. The fire line is 50 \nmiles long. Again, we have there professional firefighters who are \ntrained every summer. The Federal Government has programs for feeding \nthem.\n  We have had fires, of course, in Nevada, and I have seen the \ntremendous logistical problems in feeding thousands of firefighters, \nfor example, and having a place for them to sleep. Government is there \nto help us, not to hurt us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/24/senate-section/article/S5919-9", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5919-S5921]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EDUCATION AMENDMENTS OF 1972, TITLE IX\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, this week we celebrate the 30th \nanniversary of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the \nlandmark legislation that prohibits sex discrimination in federally \nfunded educational and athletic programs.\n  I look back with great pride at the teams we have had in Nevada. One\n\n[[Page S5920]]\n\nwould automatically think of the UNLV Running Rebels basketball team, \nwhich was a national champion, and I do look back with great pride at \nJerry Tarkanian and those great athletes. Six basketball players were \ndrafted in the first round that year, that is how good they were, but I \nalso look back with great pride to the UNLV Rebel women's softball \nteams. We had all-Americans there, too. Lori Harrigan is an example. \nShe pitched in two Olympics, won two gold medals. She is a Las Vegan. \nShe went to UNLV. It was during her years that we were ranked in the \ntop two or three teams in the country.\n  I love to go watch the Rebel women play. We now have a new stadium \nfor softball. I have told other people this, maybe not so many all at \nonce, but I would rather watch them play than the men's baseball team. \nIt is a much quicker game. They are tremendous athletes. You are right \non top of the game in that little stadium, right there with the \nplayers.\n  We should be happy with all of the progress we have made providing \ngirls and women with opportunities previously denied them. We must \ncontinue our efforts to promote gender equality because the job is not \ncomplete.\n  I can remember going to a rural community in Nevada, White Pine \nCounty High School, and I was going to speak to an assembly. They had \nme in a room waiting for the kids to gather. Two girls were there, \nobviously doing homework, studying. They had on letter sweaters. It was \nkind of cold in the room. I made conversation with them. We talked \nabout how much they loved their athletics.\n  I told them they were able to play ball because of the law we passed \nin Congress, that they would not be playing otherwise. They said they \ndid not understand that. When I left, one of the girls--her name was \nCassandra--said, ``I would die if I did not have my athletics.''\n  I am sure she was exaggerating, but she conveyed to me how much she \nenjoyed athletics. It was like when I was a young man in high school, \nthat was the No. 1 thing for me. It was the No. 1 thing for her.\n  We must be aware that Title IX programs that have proven so effective \nin helping girls and women are under assault from critics who would \nlike to turn the clock back.\n  A major column in Newsweek magazine was bashing Title IX about 3 \nweeks ago, saying it is a bad program and all it does is hurt boys. \nMillions of people see each Newsweek magazine publication.\n  I cannot allow the challenges to proceed. When my wife and I went to \nhigh school, the only thing she could do athletically was be a \ncheerleader. That is what she did. It did not matter if she could run \nas fast as Gail Devers, or that she could jump high, or whatever it \nmight be in athletics today, she could not be involved. They did not \nhave programs for girls. That is the way it was almost every place in \nAmerica.\n  My boys got their athletic ability from my wife, more so than from \nme. Yet she did not have the chance when she was young to be \ncompetitive in sports.\n  Title IX has helped dramatically to increase participation in sports \namong female students. Among high school girls, there has been an \nalmost tenfold increase, from fewer than 300,000 playing competitive \nsports 30 years ago, to now, almost 3 million. At the college level, \nthe number of female athletes increased from 30,000 to 150,000. \nClearly, these statistics show if you build it, they will come. Girls \nand young women have a high level of interest in sports and are eager \nto have equal opportunities.\n  I have no doubt that my participating in athletics and my sons' \nparticipating in athletics helped build character. That is what \nathletics is all about.\n  Recently, I had the opportunity to have Billie Jean King come to my \noffice. I had a great visit with her. Billie Jean King is what Title IX \nis all about. She inspired a generation of women, and some men, to \nparticipation in athletics when she beat a world-class tennis player. \nIt was on national TV. Everyone knew she would lose, but she trounced \nhim. We reminisced about that. The main reason she came to see me was \nto talk about the changing role in sports as it relates to women and \nthe importance of Title IX.\n  Billie Jean King has inspired successive generations of women \nathletes such as the world champion women's soccer team, whose players \nlike Julie Foudy, Brandi Chastain, and Mia Hamm have benefitted from \nTitle IX. I had the opportunity recently to join Julie Foudy at a \nsoccer clinic she conducted for some girls in Las Vegas, where she was \nplaying in a professional soccer league match that night. It was great \nto see hundreds and hundreds of people who came to see Julie Foudy, a \ngreat professional athlete who got there as a result of Title IX.\n  Judy Foudy, Brandy Chastain, and Mia Hamm now serve as role models, \nas do the current tennis stars, Venus and Serena Williams. We must \ncontinue to encourage participation in sports and give girls and women \nthe same opportunities that boys and men have traditionally had. \nAthletic training and competition have the same benefits for females as \nfor males, teaching them not only how to score goals but set goals and \nwork hard to achieve them through cooperation and teamwork, developing \nleadership skills and instilling self-confidence.\n  At a time where far too many American kids lead sedentary lives where \nthey do not move off the couch, and many are obese, we must support \nprograms that lead to improved fitness and health. Adolescent female \nathletes are more apt than nonathletes to develop a positive body \nimage, less likely to become pregnant, and are at less risk for \ndeveloping women's diseases such as osteoporosis and breast cancer.\n  In addition, sports provide a safe and healthy alternative to drugs, \nalcohol, and tobacco, and to antisocial behavior. Students who \nparticipate in sports feel a greater connection to school and keep \ntheir grades open to maintain their eligibility.\n\n  Mr. President, as I indicated, there are people who are trying to get \nrid of Title IX, saying it is unfair that we have girls participating \nin high school and college athletics because it hurts boys' programs, \nand for other reasons. They say things such as girls are not as \ncompetitive, they don't need to do this--I am not making this up. You \ncan read the editorial in Newsweek Magazine.\n  Mr. President, before Title IX, there were almost no athletic \nscholarships available for women. Now many women have been able to \npursue a higher education as a result of participation in sports, just \nlike young men did and still do.\n  I am disappointed, if not surprised, that some critics would like to \nhalt this program. They are making misleading and unfair criticisms of \nTitle IX.\n  Let's set the record straight. Title IX does not require ``quotas.'' \nIt is wrong to scapegoat women as the supposed cause of cuts in men's \nathletic programs. In fact, colleges have added hundreds of men's teams \nand there are tens of thousands more male athletes at universities \nsince Title IX was enacted. While it is true that some men's teams--and \nsome women's teams--have been dropped during this time period, many \nfactors, including a declining interest in a particular sport, \ninfluence a school's decision. Dropping a men's team has never been \nrequired by law or the courts enforcing the law of Title IX. Rather, \neach school is given discretion to make decisions about how to comply \nwith Title IX and provide equal opportunities and treatment for male \nand female student-athletes.\n  So while we remain vigilant against attacks on Title IX, we must also \npush for its continued implementation and enforcement.\n  For most Americans, Title IX is synonymous with our efforts to \nprovide girls and women an equal opportunity to participate in sports, \nbut Title IX addresses a whole range of important programs and issues \nrelated to education. In fact, only a small fraction of Title IX \ncomplaints received by the Department of Education's Office of Civil \nRights are related to athletics.\n  Title IX also has helped provide women with equal access to higher \neducation.\n  I remember when I practiced law. A very fine, brilliant man I worked \nwith was talking about women being lawyers. There were not many lawyers \nin Las Vegas at the time that were female--very few. My brilliant \nfriend\n\n[[Page S5921]]\n\nsaid there will never be a lot of women lawyers because they have to \ncarry these big briefcases and big files. Well, he was certainly wrong \nbecause a lot of men practice law that don't carry big files and big \nbriefcases. Now there are a lot of women who practice law who carry big \nbriefcases and big files. It has been found that they are just as good \nin court as men. They are just as good at drawing wills and working in \ncorporate America as men. So Title IX has helped provided equal access \nto education for women.\n  Years ago, many universities excluded or severely restricted women \nfrom admission to certain programs. Now, however, the percentages of \nwomen enrolled in American law schools and medical schools are about \nthe same as for men.\n  Unfortunately, according to reports recently issued by the National \nWomen's Law Center and the National Coalition for Women and Girls in \nEducation, young women continue to be subject to persistent gender \nsegregation and discriminatory counseling in high school vocational and \ntechnical education programs at American high schools. There was a \nwonderful piece a week ago last Saturday about women on public radio \nabout how girls are treated in high school, about going into programs \nthat are vocational in nature, mathematics in nature. School counselors \ntalk them out of it every day. While we are speaking, counselors are \ntelling girls: why don't you take up something else? How about being a \nnurse or a school teacher? You don't want to go into vocational \neducation or work on cars. But they do and they do just as well as men \nworking on cars. So there is some real significant discriminatory \npractice there.\n\n  They are often steered toward programs like cosmetology, health aide \npreparation, and child care training, nursing, teaching all of which \nlead to lower paying jobs most of the time; while male students \ncongregate in programs leading to higher paying careers in technology \nand the trades. This has significant negative implications for women's \nemployment prospects and earning power.\n  We need to vigorously defend and enforce Title IX in all of the areas \nit covers, so that we can sustain and expand upon the progress we have \nmade.\n  Often we hear that girls and women are the beneficiaries of Title IX, \nbut I think it is more accurate to say that we all benefit from this \nimportant civil rights legislation--these affirmative action programs \nthat are Title IX. Certainly, American society as a whole is better \nwhen women--who, after all, make up more than half of our population--\nare provided a fair and equal opportunity to develop their full \npotential.\n  I go back to what I said when I started this speech. I reflect on \nwatching the Running Rebels basketball team when they were the national \nchampions. There were great players on that team. As I indicated, six \nof the players on that team in 1 year were drafted in the first round.\n  I also reflect with pleasure on watching Lori Harrigan throw a \nsoftball and keep the UNLV Rebels softball team in the top 10.\n  I also reflect on how things have changed since I started practicing \nlaw. The legal profession is better now because of the women involved, \njust as the Senate is a better place because of the women who are here. \nThat is what Title IX is all about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Nevada for \nbringing up the issue of women in sports. It has meant a great deal for \nwomen and girls to have these opportunities.\n  The Senator talked about when his wife was in school and all she \ncould do was cheer for the team. I know Mrs. Reid. She and I are about \nthe same age. That was exactly my experience. I am very happy to say my \ndaughter was able to play soccer. I see the young girls today reaching \nfor the stars--and attaining them.\n  I wonder what the order is at this point in terms of the time \ndivision?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time until 4 o'clock is evenly divided for \nmorning business.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Our time runs out at 3:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes to each side.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, is it evenly divided on \nboth sides or just 10 minutes per Senator?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minute grants, evenly divided to each \nside, but no one side has control.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/24/senate-section/article/S5921-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5921-S5922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DECLINE IN QUALITY OF LIFE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I take to the floor today to call \nattention to an alarming trend that I see happening in this country. It \nis a decline in the quality of life for our people in this country. It \nis beginning. I am concerned it will continue.\n  Clearly, I am not talking today about the tragedy that hit on 9-11. \nOf course, that had an impact across the board in terms of worrying \nabout our children and concern for our communities. I am setting that \naside. What I really want to talk about is the business of this \nGovernment that is keeping our people safe from a couple of things. One \nis crime in the streets. The other is the quality of our air, our \nwater, our neighborhoods in terms of this environment that we so \ncherish.\n  I am very concerned we are beginning to see fallout from policies \nthat are occurring in this administration that has been in power now \nfor 17 months. We first get the alarming news that after 9 years of \ndecline, there is a very large change in the crime rate. We see \nincreases in the murder rate. We learn of increases across the board \nfrom reading the newspaper. We have an expert, Patrick Murphy, who \nbasically worries that we have eliminated the COPS program because this \nadministration does not support it. It has put 100,000 police on the \nbeat. We need to do more. That is having an impact.\n  Also, we are seeing cuts in aid to States and localities in the \ncriminal justice area. We are seeing these cuts because this \nadministration just does not have that as a priority. They have as a \npriority cutting taxes for people who earn over $1 million a year. That \nis the truth. It costs money to put a policeman on the beat, to protect \na neighborhood, a street, a school. If it is more important to give tax \nbreaks to people who do not need it, that is the price we are going to \npay. It is beginning to come home to roost.\n  Another area where we are beginning to see decline is in the quality \nof life in the environment. We already know this administration is \ncutting in half the Superfund sites that are going to be cleaned up. I \nhave a chart that shows the number of cleanups we did under the Clinton \nadministration, and the number of cleanups that are now being proposed \nby the Bush administration.\n  In the red here, the average number for the last 4 years of the \nClinton administration was 86 sites cleaned up each and every year. \nThat means 86 neighborhoods reclaiming an area that was so toxic and \npolluted there could be no economic development. Those sites were \ncleaned up.\n  When the Bush administration came in, they promised they would clean \nup 75 sites. We were not happy about that--we saw that was a reduction \nof 10 sites and that would mean 10 communities in trouble, property \nvalues declining, quality of life declining, children's health \ndeclining, and so on--but listen to what happened. After we adjusted to \nthe fact that we were going to see 11 sites fewer cleaned up, we now \nsee their proposal is to actually go to 47 sites.\n  They are cutting in half the number of Superfund sites to be cleaned. \nWhy? Because it is not a priority. It is more important to them to give \nmoney to people who earn over $1 million. That is the bottom line. \nThere is not enough money to put cops on the beat, not enough money to \nclean up these sites. It is a very troubling trend. These communities \nwere counting on these cleanups, and they are not going to happen.\n  These sites are not isolated. In my own State of California, 40 \npercent of the people live within 4 miles of a Superfund site. So we \nare talking about a real problem. But more than that, there are many \nother problems that we see.\n  I urge people who may be listening to go to a Web site that we have \nset up, on our side, to detail the various rollbacks that we are seeing \nin terms of the environment.\n  Go to this Web site: democrats.senate.gov/environment, and, you can \nsee what we are talking about. We\n\n[[Page S5922]]\n\nare going to show you the sites that have been abandoned, the rollbacks \nof this administration because there are so many I cannot fit them on \none chart.\n  I will show two charts that detail the various rollbacks and broken \npromises of this administration. You can see it is just impossible to \ntake the time because there are 100 rollbacks in clean air, clean \nwater, and safety and health for our people. It causes a lot of \nconcern.\n  Senator Jim Jeffords, who is the chair of the Environment Committee \non which I serve, is highly upset about the Superfund situation and \nhighly upset at the fact that there are rollbacks now being proposed on \nthe Clean Air Act.\n  Madam President, you have two beautiful young children. You know when \nthey breathe dirty air, the impact on their lungs is far greater than \nwhen you and I breathe that same air. The bottom line is by rolling \nback the Clean Air Act, as they plan to do, our children are going to \nsuffer.\n  We have a situation where the President has now proposed a rollback \nof the Clean Air Act. Senator Jeffords is trying to learn on what they \nbased this decision. He has asked the EPA for information similar to \nthe information I asked them for on the Superfund sites. I want to be \nable to tell you which of your constituencies are not going to have \ntheir Superfund sites cleaned up. I want to be able to tell the same to \nmy Republican colleagues and Democratic colleagues. I cannot get the \ninformation. Things have gotten so bad that we have had to ask, at the \ntime, the inspector general to help us get this information on \nSuperfund, and Senator Jeffords is going to have to call together our \ncommittee and issue a subpoena to get information in terms of the \nrollback of the Clean Air Act.\n  Let me sum up this way: I am concerned the priorities of this \nadministration are leaving our people vulnerable, vulnerable to high \ncrime rates, vulnerable to dirty air and dirty water. I think the \nchickens are coming home to roost. Maybe it is all theoretical, except \nwhen you find out it is not somebody else's Superfund site that is not \nbeing cleaned up but it is yours.\n  Let me show you the sites across the country. Every single State \nexcept North Dakota has a Superfund site, and the purple reflects the \nSuperfund sites.

Madam President, I rise for a few minutes to discuss in \nmorning business an issue that involves essentially every American \ntoday, and that is an issue regarding the shortage of vaccines. Every \nday, thousands and thousands of parents take their children to \nphysicians' offices all across this great country, not because their \nchildren are sick or in response to an acute illness, but because they \nunderstand the importance of preventing a potential illness.\n  They want, and they rightfully expect, their children will be able to \nreceive vaccines needed to prevent illnesses that range from \ntuberculosis to measles to mumps to rubella to chicken pox. Yet--and I \ntell this to my colleagues and to people listening across the country--\nthe fact is that many of these parents are being turned away with their \nchildren still vulnerable to some of these very destructive and often \ndeadly diseases. Five vaccines that prevent eight childhood diseases \nhave been in short supply in the United States since last summer.\n  Thankfully, there have been no major outbreaks among American \nchildren. We thankfully have been vigilant about vaccinations in this \ncountry in recent years, and our population on the whole has built up a \nstrong immunity. But we have a short supply of vaccines today. The \nlonger these vaccine shortages continue, the more vulnerable our \nchildren become.\n  If we do not take prudent steps today in Congress to address these \ncurrent and recurring vaccine shortages, it is almost certain--from a \npublic health standpoint, from what we know today--that American \nchildren will experience an outbreak of diseases that we have the \ntools, we have the ability, we have the medicines to prevent.\n  Is it possible to have these destructive diseases appear in this day \nand time? The answer is yes, and these vaccines that are in short \nsupply today in our country are necessary to prevent such outbreaks \nthat have occurred in other industrialized nations.\n  If we look at Japan, for example, vaccination rates for whooping \ncough dropped from the 80-percent rate in 1974, to 10 percent in 1976--\nfrom 80 percent to 10 percent over a 2-year period. This caused a \ndramatic rise in the incidence of the disease from 400 cases and no \ndeaths, to 13,000 cases and 41 deaths within 5 years.\n  The vaccine for pertussis, which is whooping cough, diphtheria and \ntetanus is one of the five vaccines in short supply. The others are for \ntetanus, measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox and pneumococcal disease, \nwhich can lead to pneumonia, bacteremia--that is bacteria floating in \nyour blood that can give you fever and make you ill--and meningitis, \nwhich is inflammation of the structures that surround the brain.\n  These vaccines for our children are in short supply. The Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, the CDC, reports that new supplies of \nthese vaccines will be available soon. That is good news. Two of the \nvaccines that are now in short supply will be available later this \nsummer, two more by the end of the year, and the last one in the fall, \nwe believe--maybe a little bit later.\n  That is welcome news. But the underlying, fundamental problems that \nhave caused the current shortage--and past shortages--if not addressed, \nwill cause another shortage in the future. Vaccine shortages will occur \nyear after year, time after time, if we do not act. Now is the time to \naddress the fundamental problems underlying these shortages.\n  Today, there are only four manufacturers producing vaccines for \nAmerica's children. Of those four, only two are American companies. New \ncompanies that may want to produce vaccines are confronted with this \ndual risk of increasing liability and at the same time questionable \nreturn on investment. When you put those two together, there are fewer \nand fewer manufacturers, and that is contributing to this shortage.\n  The remaining vaccine manufacturers are upgrading and expanding \nproduction facilities. Again, that is good news. Even if we have a \nflood in the supply of vaccines to take care of current shortages, it \nwill be only a matter of time when we have another drought for these \nlifesaving vaccines. We must address the underlying, fundamental \nreasons for these recurring vaccines shortages. We have to do that in a \nthoughtful and comprehensive way based on what we know are the \nrealities in terms of production and usage. It is the job of the Senate \nto set this framework in place.\n  In March, I introduced the Improved Vaccine Affordability and \nAvailability Act. This act does a number of things. In essence, it \nrequires the Federal Government to build and maintain a 6-month supply \nof prioritized vaccines that we and our public health and our medical \ncommunities agree are necessary to prevent these preventable diseases.\n  This would stabilize the supplies over time and help us to be better \nprepared in those years in which vaccine production cannot meet the \ndemand at that point in time. It would also expand the funding \navailable for State and local efforts to boost immunization rates. You \ncan have the vaccine and know that the vaccine prevents disease, but \nunless you actually apply that vaccine to our children it is not going \nto do much good. This increased vaccination effort will focus on adults \nand children who are underserved or who are at high risk of contracting \nvaccine-preventable diseases.\n  Perhaps the most important provisions in this bill are modifications \nto help restore balance to a program called the Vaccine Injury \nCompensation Program. This program was created about 20 years ago, in \nthe mid-1980s, to rapidly compensate those who suffer serious side \neffects from vaccines that we recommend, from a public\n\n[[Page S5923]]\n\nhealth perspective, our children receive. It has been very successful. \nThis program also reduces the burden of litigation for doctors and \nnurses who administer the vaccines, as well as for manufacturers.\n  Until a few years ago, the program seemed to work very well. But now \nfactors threaten it from working so well and will cause an impediment \nto the supply of vaccines over time. Let me briefly explain.\n  We have had a rush of new law suits, which are threatening our \nvaccine supplies. The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program is literally \nbeing overwhelmed today with new cases. Many of those are broadly \nwithout merit. As a result of the program's 240-day decision deadline, \nState and Federal courts are increasingly becoming the forum for \nexpensive litigation. And many of the meritorious claims and justified \nclaims are not being decided in a timely way.\n  One pending lawsuit is for $30 billion in damages--$30 billion. If \nyou look at the whole value today of the global vaccine market, the \ntotal value is only $5 billion. This one lawsuit is six times the \nglobal market for vaccines.\n\n  This climate of legal uncertainty has contributed to an exodus of \nmanufacturers from being in the business at all and also from being in \nthe business here in the U.S. We have seen a subsequent rise in the \nprice of vaccines. Since the 1980s, the number of vaccine manufacturers \nhas dwindled from 12 down to 4. In some cases, only a single \nmanufacturer is producing some of our most critical vaccines. The \nImproved Vaccine Affordability and Availability Act--S. 2053--restores \nbalance to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. It would help \ncompensate those with serious health side affects from vaccines while \nat the same time ensuring that unwarranted litigation does not further \ndestabilize our vaccine supply.\n  The development and widespread use of vaccines indeed has been one of \nthe most successful public health initiatives in our history. We have \nreduced the incidence of diseases, such as measles, mumps, and polio, \nand we have even eradicated smallpox--which over a period of time has \nkilled somewhere between 300 million to 500 million people in the 20th \ncentury alone. Smallpox as a disease does not exist.\n  The decision before us is whether or not to build on the successes \nthat we have achieved in vaccines in the 21st century. I speak not only \nof vaccines that already exist--the vaccines for our children that are \nin short supply--but also as we look at the role of future vaccines \nneeded to address bioterrorism--when we know we don't have the vaccine \nfor the Ebola virus today. We have inadequate vaccines for three of the \nseven agents that are classified by our intelligence agencies as \ncritical and for which we are at risk. Some day we will have a vaccine, \nI believe, that will hopefully cure Alzheimer's disease.\n  What we are looking for is a platform--a comprehensive approach for \nall vaccine development.\n  The Improved Vaccine Affordability and Availability Act will help us \nto expand the vaccine market. It will stabilize our vaccine supply, and \nit will improve access to vaccines.\n  When parents take their children to the doctor, they will not be \nturned away because of a shortage of supply of these vaccines.\n  Earlier this month the Improved Vaccine Affordability and \nAvailability Act gained additional momentum when the Advisory \nCommission for Childhood Vaccines--the group that advises the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services on improving the Vaccine Injury \nCompensation Program--voted on June 6 in favor of most of the \nprovisions in our bill, S. 2053.\n  I thank the members of the Advisory Commission for Childhood \nVaccines, or ACCV, for acting so quickly on a matter of such \nimportance, and also for lending their expertise to this debate. \nFurther, I thank them and express my appreciation for their suggestions \nin how we can modify some of the provisions in the bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at this particular bill and I look \nforward to working with my colleagues as we move forward in considering \nthe ACCV recommendations.\n  The need to act is urgent. We simply cannot afford to wait until \ntragedy strikes, or to surrender the gains we have made over the last \n50 years in reducing and preventing childhood diseases through \nvaccination. I urge my colleagues to join Senator Hutchison and Senator \nBunning in cosponsoring S. 2053, and to work with us to pass this \ncritical legislation this year.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I would like to share a few remarks \nabout the Defense bill that we will be back on in a few minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  I ask unanimous consent that this Senator be recognized for 10 \nminutes following the Senator's remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, we have had a good process in the \nArmed Services Committee, of which I am a member. Senator Levin is a \nmarvelous chairman, and leads in a very skilled and wise way. Our \nranking member, Senator John Warner, former Secretary of the Navy and a \npatriot, in many ways lends his wisdom to the debate. We have come out, \nexcept I suppose on national missile defense, with a bill with which we \nfeel comfortable. I think a large amount of the credit goes to \nPresident Bush for stepping forward and providing leadership in calling \nfor a strong budget.\n  I thought I would just share a few remarks about my view of where we \nare, what we are spending, what we have been spending in the past, and \nwhere we need to go in the future.\n  Many people may not know that 10 years ago, under the last budget of \nformer President Bush, the appropriated amount for defense was $327 \nbillion. We started, since that time, a continuous downgrade movement \nin spending for the defense of this country, which has really put us in \na bad position.\n  Several years ago, one of our key witnesses said we are facing a bow \nwave of unmet needs. We know that since the late 1980s personnel has \ndropped 40 percent in our services. They are better trained and better \nequipped than before. They are doing a terrific job, but we are down \nabout 40 percent from the height of our personnel at that time.\n  So what is it that has really happened? We have had inflation. In \nmany ways, we have had increased demands on us around the world. We \nhave a demand that we have all agreed to in this body of which I think \neverybody is on board; and that is, we need to transform our defense. \nWe need to reach our objective force. We have set an objective as to \nwhat we want our military to look like and be. We want it lighter. We \nwant it more mobile. We want it more lethal, more scientific, and \ntechnologically based. That has been our goal, and we have been moving \nin that direction, but it costs money.\n  But despite those demands, we have not done very well, until recent \nyears, frankly, in our spending. In 1993, our defense budget was $327 \nbillion. That is what we appropriated, $327 billion. In 1994, it \ndropped significantly in one year to $304 billion. In 1995, it dropped \nagain to $299 billion, falling below $300 billion. In 1996, it dropped \nagain to $295 billion. In 1997, it dropped again to $289 billion. In \n1998, it hit the bottom, $287 billion.\n\n  During this time, we had inflation, we had other demands, and we had \nsalary increases for our people in uniform, but the defense amount was \ngoing down steadily.\n  In 1999, we had the first increase in the defense budget from $287 \nbillion in 1998 to $292 billion in 1999--not enough, really, to meet \nthe cost of inflation, but in real dollars, actual dollars, it was the \nfirst increase in many years.\n  In 2000, we had another minor increase to $296 billion. In 2001, we \ngot over $300 billion again, for the first time in many years, and \nappropriated $309 billion.\n  That is not a very good record. It emphasizes how we began to lose \nsight and take for granted the forces that defend us around the world. \nIt represented a dramatic reduction in real\n\n[[Page S5924]]\n\ndollars, adjusted for inflation, which is even larger than the amount \nthat appears on paper because, as you know, the dollars were becoming \nalways a little bit less valuable each year.\n  So when President Bush campaigned on strengthening the military, he \ntook action to do that. So in 2002, we hit, under his leadership and \nhis direction--and I think he deserves great credit for this--we raised \nthe budget to $329 billion, exceeding, for the first time in many \nyears, the 1993 budget of $327 billion.\n  Then, in the course of that, we have had the war effort that we have \nbeen carrying on now against terrorism, and there has been a \nsupplemental defense budget of around $40 billion for defense this past \nyear to help us meet those crisis needs.\n  In this year's budget, President Bush has proposed--and we are pretty \nmuch on track to meet his request--$376 billion for defense. I think \nthat is a step in the right direction.\n  I am saying these things because a lot of people think we cannot \nafford anything, that defense is taking up all the money in the budget. \nBut as a percentage of the total gross domestic product of America, \nwhat America produces--all the goods and services we produce--our \nbudget today, for the year 2003, is much less than the percentage of \nthe gross domestic product we had in 1993 when we had an only slightly \nsmaller defense budget in terms of inflation-adjusted dollars, as well \nas in terms of the actual drain on the economy.\n  So what we need to do is ask ourselves where we are going. This \nbudget does not call for an increase in personnel. It calls for, again, \nsome pay increases, a cost for more training, bonuses for people in \nhigh-specialty areas whom we have to have in a military which operates \nwith as much technological sophistication as we operate in today. That \ndoes not produce anything.\n  We have risen to the challenge and have met the needs of our veterans \nfor health care coverage for life, which they were promised and were \nnot receiving. We have done that. We will do some other things in that \nregard.\n  Military housing has fallen behind in its needs. Military health care \nhas not been what it has needed to be. We have fallen off there.\n  So all of these things, I guess I am saying, are unmet needs that we \nhave had to fund out of the increases that we have had. And it has left \nus not as good as we would like to be in recapitalizing our military. \nIt is not as good as where we would need to be to step forward to reach \nthat objective we have for a future combat system that allows us to be \nagile, mobile, and hostile, as Eddie Robinson said, to make our \nmilitary able to project its power wherever the legitimate interests of \nthe United States are threatened around the globe.\n\n  So I think we do have some good increases. We are going to have \nincreases for smart munitions, the kind of precision-guided munitions \nthat proved exceedingly valuable in Afghanistan. Sixty, almost 70 \npercent of the munitions we expended in Afghanistan were precision-\nguided munitions.\n  We can drop a 2,000-pound JDAM from an airplane, and it can hit--\nprecision guided with global positioning systems--within 10 meters of a \ntarget. That is a precision weapon of extraordinary capability. We need \nto have plenty of those. We have an increase in what we have expended \nfor that. Frankly, I am not sure we have quite enough yet there. We dog \ngone sure don't want to be in a war and not be able to call down \nsufficient numbers of those kinds of weapons that are so effective \ntoday. So we have done that.\n  We made a tough call--the Defense Secretary did--on the Crusader \nartillery piece. It is an $11 billion item. It was not considered part \nof the objective force but an interim weapon system before we could get \nthat. It was going to drain us of $11 billion. For example, it would \nnot have been deployed by the Army in Korea. It would have been kept in \nthis country in the counterattack force.\n  The Secretary of Defense and the President concluded we could not \nafford that new weapon and that we need to leap forward to a new type \nof artillery piece that had precision-guided capability. We have those, \nreally, right now. If we work and develop them, we could bring those \nin, and they would be part of that new combat system we are looking \nforward to having.\n  So the President and Secretary Rumsfeld had to make that tough call. \nA lot of people wanted that system. They had invested a lot of years in \nit and developing it. They testified in favor of it, and they voted in \nfavor of it. But I think the President did the right thing. I supported \nhim on that. It will free up $11 billion for increased investment in \nsmarter munitions that will help us better in the future.\n  So the other big conflict I guess we have had--and I believe it is \nvery significant, and I hope the American people will be engaged on \nit--is the question of national missile defense.\n  We know, from unclassified testimony by professionals from the \nDirector of the CIA, George Tenet, and from the Director of the Defense \nIntelligence Agency, who studies these things exceedingly closely, that \nKorea will have an intercontinental ballistic missile from which they \ncan deliver weapons of mass destruction to Alaska and Hawaii and the \nUnited States proper very soon.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I see my friend in the Chamber, Senator Dorgan.\n  I will just finish up, if I can, and say that we are making progress. \nWe will have a debate on national missile defense. If we can get the \nmoney back for that, I believe we will have a defense budget of which \nwe can all be proud.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, my colleague just mentioned national \nmissile defense. I think we will have a robust, aggressive debate on \nthat subject in the Senate. We all agree that we need a defense of some \nsort against rogue nations or terrorists aiming a missile at our \ncountry.\n  But we need to look at the broad range of threats that this country \nfaces. We have 5.7 million containers come into our ports every year on \ncontainer ships; 100,000 of them are inspected; the other 5.6 million \nare not. Almost anyone will tell you it is far more likely that a \nweapon of mass destruction is going to come in on a container ship, \ncoming to a dock at 2 miles an hour to threaten an American city or to \nbe put on an 18-wheel truck and moved out to the middle part of the \ncountry. Almost anyone will tell that you the low-tech approach to \nthreatening America with a weapon of mass destruction is much more \nlikely than a terrorist having access to an intercontinental ballistic \nmissile and putting a nuclear tip on that ICBM.\n  I have supported billions and billions of dollars on research and \ndevelopment of missile defense. But that is not the only threat we \nface. We face so many other threats that are largely ignored. I just \nmention the one with respect to port security: 5.7 million big \ncontainers come in every single year, and 5.6 million are uninspected.\n  In the Middle East, a terrorist put himself in one of these \ncontainers. He had fresh water, a heater, a GPS, a computer, a bed, and \nhe was shipping himself to Canada in a container.\n  It is likely that terrorists will threaten this country not with a \nhigh-tech weapon but by putting a weapon of mass destruction in a \ncontainer on a ship coming up to a port at 1 or 2 miles an hour, not an \nICBM.\n  So we need to have a debate in terms of how we use our resources. Do \nwe put them all in one pot, or do we evaluate what is the most likely \nthreat? How do we respond to that threat?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/24/senate-section/article/S5924-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5924-S5925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 AMTRAK\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I rise to talk about Amtrak. As we did \nlast week, this morning we hear on the news that there is a proposal to \nshut down our Amtrak rail passenger service in the middle of this week. \nWhy? Because Amtrak needs the resources to continue and lacks them. You \nknow, you often hear that it is so-and-so's job to keep the trains \nrunning on time. Well, it has to be somebody's job to keep the trains \nrunning, period. It makes no sense for us to be here on a Monday \nwondering whether Amtrak will shut down on a Wednesday.\n  In North Dakota, we have Amtrak service; 82,000 North Dakotans \nboarded Amtrak last year as the trains came through and stopped at many \npoints. I\n\n[[Page S5925]]\n\nhappen to think Amtrak is critically important as a part of our \ntransportation system.\n  Every other form of transportation is subsidized. We have people \nsaying: Let's not subsidize Amtrak. Why not? Every other country in the \nworld provides a subsidy for their rail passenger service. I think our \ncountry is justified in doing so to keep that rail passenger service \nworking.\n  The Secretary of Transportation has a plan that would virtually \ndestroy Amtrak as we know it. He says: Let's take the Northeast \ncorridor out, Boston to Washington, DC, and separate it from the rest. \nThat is a sure-fire way to kill the rest of Amtrak service for the \ncountry. It is a huge step backwards; that is not progress.\n  We must ask the Secretary and the administration not only to announce \nWednesday that there is financing to have Amtrak continue, but also to \nwork with those of us in Congress who want to ensure the long-term \nfuture of rail passenger service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/24/senate-section/article/S5925-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             TRADE DEFICITS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, last Wednesday the Commerce Department \nreported that the monthly trade deficit for April 2002 was $35.5 \nbillion. That deficit is for both goods and services. The deficit in \ngoods alone was $39.9 billion.\n  Every single day, 7 days a week, we import $1 billion more in goods \nthan we export, and we charge the difference. What does that mean on an \nannual basis? Deficits on the order of $400 billion dollars, and \nclimbing.\n  As you can see in this chart, the trade deficit is totally out of \ncontrol. In fact, when we try to put in the 2002 numbers, we will be \nsomewhere off the chart, around $480 billion.\n  These trade deficits are to a large extent the result of bad trade \nagreements, particularly those entered into under fast-track authority. \nThis Senate, without my vote, just embraced fast-track trade authority \nso that the President can negotiate another trade agreement. I didn't \nbelieve President Clinton should have that trade authority, and I don't \nbelieve this President should either.\n  This next chart shows the increases in trade deficits as we entered \ninto one bad trade agreement after another. You see what has happened \nsince 1976. The deficit line goes up, up, up, and up--the highest trade \ndeficits in human history.\n  Nobody seems to think much of it. You didn't hear one whisper last \nWednesday when it was announced we had the largest monthly trade \ndeficit in the history of this country.\n  Where are all the exports that we were promised as a result of fast-\ntrack trade agreements? Do you know what our number one export item has \nbecome? American jobs. That is the biggest export as a result of the \ntrade agreements. You can see from the trade deficits we have that \nthese trade agreements simply aren't working.\n\n  Who pays these deficits? The American people have to pay for these \ndeficits at some point. You can make the case with respect to budget \ndeficits that it is money we owe to ourselves. You can't make that case \nwith the trade deficit. The trade deficit we owe to others, to people \nliving in other countries. We will pay trade deficits with a lower \nstandard of living. That is why it is so dangerous.\n  Today, as I speak, the financial markets are very unsettled. Day \nafter day after day, we see a further collapse of the stock market, the \nfinancial markets.\n  Why is that the case? Because there is a sense that our fundamentals \ndon't work. We are deep in red ink, drowning in trade deficits, and \nnobody here seems to give a darn at all. It is dangerous for our \ncountry.\n  Our negotiators go overseas and negotiate a trade deal, and in an \ninstant they lose. I have said it 100 times, but it is worth saying \nagain, in the words of Will Rogers: the United States of America has \nnever lost a war and never won a conference. He must surely have been \nthinking about our trade negotiators.\n  We have bad agreements in 100 different ways: Bad agreements with \nChina, with Japan, South Korea, Europe, and others. With Europe we have \na dispute over market access for U.S. beef. The EU does not let in our \nbeef when the cattle have been fed hormones, even though there is no \nevidence to support this ban. So we take the EU to the WTO, and we \nargue that we are entitled to sell our beef in Europe. The WTO agrees, \nand tells the EU to let our beef into their market. And the EU just \nthumbs its nose, and says forget it.\n  So we say: All right, we are going to get tough, and retaliate \nagainst you. And how does the United States get tough? We say: We will \nslap you with penalties on truffles, goose liver, and Roquefort cheese. \nThat is enough to put the fear of God into almost any country.\n  Well, when Europe wants to retaliate against our country over a trade \ndispute, as they did in the case of U.S. tariffs against European \nsteel, Europe goes after hundreds of millions of dollars of U.S. steel, \ntextiles, and citrus products. We, on the other hand, are retaliating \nby saying: We will nail you on truffles, goose liver, and Roquefort \ncheese.\n  I am sorry, but where is our backbone? Does this country have any \nguts to stand up for its producers and its workers?\n  So last month, we had the largest monthly trade deficit in human \nhistory. Does anybody here care? I think eventually we will have to \nreconcile for this failure in policy. It is not just a failure with \nthis administration--although this administration certainly has played \na part--it is a failure of past administrations and every \nadministration going back 20, 30 years. They have embraced policies \nthat have us in a situation where we have long-term, relentless \ndeficits with the Japanese, $60 billion, $70 billion a year every \nsingle year with Japan. And 14 years after we had a beef agreement with \nJapan, there is a 38.5 percent tariff on every pound of beef going into \nJapan.\n  I mentioned the Japanese beef agreement, which was described as a big \nsuccess by those who negotiated. Yet, 12 and 14 years later, we have \nthis huge tariff on every pound of American beef going into Japan. \nNobody says much about it. We have a large trade deficit with Japan.\n  We have 630,000 cars coming here from Korea every year. We are able \nto ship them only 2,800. When you raise that issue, and point out that \nthey are shipping us 630,000 Korean cars into the American marketplace \nand allowing only 2,800 American cars into Korea, they say: yes, but \nyour exports used to be 1,300 cars and now they have doubled. So if you \nhear trade negotiators talk and they say ``we doubled the amount of \nAmerican cars we shipped to Korea''--well, yes, from 1,300 to 2,800. \nBut the Koreans send us 630,000 in a year.\n  Our trade policies are failing badly. Nobody seems to care much about \nit. There is not a whisper about this huge trade deficit on the floor \nof the Senate--just following the Senate agreeing to extend fast track \ntrade authority to the President.\n  Because the time is limited, and we are going to the defense \nauthorization bill, I will defer a longer speech on international trade \nto a later time. But Mr. President, it is fascinating to me that last \nThursday we heard the announcement of the largest trade deficit in \nhistory, and you could not hear a voice in this town raise a point that \nthis is a serious problem for this country's economy. It is long past \nthe time to have a real debate about our country's trade policies and \nabout these growing, relentless trade deficits that cause great danger \nto the American economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/24/senate-section/article/S5925-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska).

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 2514, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2514) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2003 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the\n\n[[Page S5926]]\n\n     Department of Energy, to prescribe personnel strengths for \n     such fiscal year for the Armed Forces, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we made some very good progress on the \nnational Defense authorization bill last week, and I am optimistic, \nwith the continuing good help that is always available from our \nleadership and the cooperation of Senators, that we can complete action \non this bill in a timely manner this week.\n  We debated the bill for over 18 hours last week, and we disposed of \n29 amendments. We still have some amendments that will require debate \nand rollcall votes, and we will be working with the sponsors of those \namendments to try to get them before the Senate as promptly as \npossible.\n  We were able to clear a number of amendments last week. We have a \npackage of cleared amendments. I am looking at my good friend from \nVirginia. He is nodding his head, so we believe we can act on a number \nof cleared amendments later today.\n  We expect to move shortly to an amendment from the Senator from New \nHampshire and the Senator from Minnesota prohibiting the chain of \ncommand from requiring female servicemembers to wear an abaya in Saudi \nArabia. We are going to vote on that amendment. It is currently planned \nat approximately 5:45 p.m.\n  Following the disposition of that amendment, it is our hope that we \ncan have another amendment offered for debate and schedule a vote for \nsometime tomorrow morning.\n  Finally, I note that the Defense Department and the Nation lost a \ngreat public servant this weekend. Doc Cooke, whose official title was \nDirector of Administration and Management, but who was more widely and \naffectionately known as the mayor of the Pentagon, passed away on \nSaturday following an automobile accident several weeks ago.\n  There was no one more dedicated to the people of the Department of \nDefense than Doc Cooke. He will be greatly missed. Our thoughts and our \nprayers are with his family.\n  I know my good friend and colleague from Virginia also knew Doc Cooke \na lot better than I did, and I am sure he will want to add a few words.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my good friend. I remember him \nwith the warmest regard and respect. I will get for the record the \nnumber of Secretaries of Defense under whom he was privileged to serve, \nbut it is somewhere in the seven to eight number. He was affectionately \nknown as the mayor of the Department of Defense.\n  Mind you now, this is a building that was built in the late thirties \nand early forties, the thought being it might be used as a hospital for \nheavy casualties if we ever incurred them. Then it was quickly \ntransformed into the Department of Defense. It is vast. Some 25,000 \nindividuals are at work at any one time either in the building or the \nenvirons. He knew every square foot of that building. He knew it well.\n  I remember one time, I made a very foolish decision--perhaps I made \nseveral when I was Secretary of the Navy--when I decided to visit the \noffice which every sailor and marine occupied. It took me 1 year to \ncover the building. I was forewarned that I had made an ill-advised \ndecision. It was interesting. Doc Cooke helped me plot that, as he did \nmany other projects.\n  He was behind the restoring of the building the day the tragic \naccident befell the men and women who worked in certain spaces on 9-11. \nHe spearheaded that effort, together with the Secretary of Defense, \nsuch that all the schedules for completion are being met. That is the \ntype of man he was. He was very humble and very soft spoken.\n  He had an unfortunate accident on the way to give a speech in \nCharlottesville. He did not recover from his injuries. His car simply \nwent off the road, which indicates possibly he was afflicted by some \nillness and lost control. No one else was injured. We are thankful for \nthat.\n  I thank my good friend and colleague because those of us who were \nprivileged to serve in that building, as I did for over 5 years, \nremember well Doc Cooke.\n  Mr. President, turning to the bill, I thank the chairman for his \nestimate. I join him in saying we made progress last week. Our \nleadership not only challenged us but I think has given us a set of \norders to finish this week. There is every reason we can do that, and \ndo it in a way to allow Senators to bring forth their amendments to the \nbill and to have a reasonable period for debate.\n  Fortunately, we have in place an understanding with the leadership \nthat the chairman and I will make the determination as to relevancy of \namendments. Primarily the rule that governs the Parliamentarian as to \nwhether or not a bill is referred to a committee is the guidepost we \nwill follow, but we will consult together on these issues.\n  We are now awaiting the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire. I \nam told he is on his way.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Has Senator Smith offered his amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Not yet.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nSenator Smith's offering of his amendment, which will be momentarily, \nthe time until 5:45 p.m. today be equally divided and controlled in the \nusual form, with respect to the Smith amendment, with no second-degree \namendment in order prior to a vote in relation to the amendment, but at \n5:45 p.m., without intervening action or debate, the Senate vote in \nrelation to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3969\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith], for himself, \n     Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Reed, Mr. Craig, \n     Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Harkin, and Mrs. Boxer, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3969.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To impose certain prohibitions and requirements relating to \n the wearing of abayas by members of the Armed Forces in Saudi Arabia)\n\n       On page 125, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 554. WEAR OF ABAYAS BY FEMALE MEMBERS OF THE ARMED \n                   FORCES IN SAUDI ARABIA.\n\n       (a) Prohibitions Relating to Wear of Abayas.--No member of \n     the Armed Forces having authority over a member of the Armed \n     Forces and no officer or employee of the United States having \n     authority over a member of the Armed Forces may--\n       (1) require or encourage that member to wear the abaya \n     garment or any part of the abaya garment while the member is \n     in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia pursuant to a permanent change \n     of station or orders for temporary duty; or\n       (2) take any adverse action, whether formal or informal, \n     against the member for choosing not to wear the abaya garment \n     or any part of the abaya garment while the member is in the \n     Kingdom of Saudi Arabia pursuant to a permanent change of \n     station or orders for temporary duty.\n       (b) Instruction.--The Secretary of Defense shall provide \n     each female member of the Armed Forces ordered to a permanent \n     change of station or temporary duty in the Kingdom of Saudi \n     Arabia with instructions regarding the prohibitions in \n     subsection (a) immediately upon the arrival of the member at \n     a United States military installation within the Kingdom of \n     Saudi Arabia. The instructions shall be presented orally and \n     in writing. The written instruction shall include the full \n     text of this section.\n       (2) In carrying out paragraph (1), the Secretary shall act \n     through the Commander in Chief, United States Central Command \n     and Joint Task Force Southwest Asia, and the commanders of \n     the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps components of the \n     United States Central Command and Joint Task Force Southwest \n     Asia.\n       (c) Prohibition on Use of Funds for Procurement of \n     Abayas.--Funds appropriated or otherwise made available to \n     the Department of Defense may not be used to procure abayas \n     for regular or routine issuance to members of the Armed \n     Forces serving in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia or for any \n     personnel of contractors accompanying the\n\n[[Page S5927]]\n\n     Armed Forces in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the \n     performance of contracts entered into with such contractors \n     by the United States.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I offer this amendment \ntoday, an amendment to the Defense bill, along with Senators Cantwell, \nGrassley, Dayton, Reed, Craig, Landrieu, Harkin, and Boxer, to rectify \na DOD policy that is, frankly, unfair, inequitable, inexplicable, and \nwhich violates our basic values and beliefs as a nation that believes \nin freedom of expression and freedom of religion.\n  We are seeking to eliminate the abaya policy still being imposed upon \nour female soldiers in Saudi Arabia. For those who do not know what \nthis is, the abaya outfit covers, from head to toe, the person wearing \nit, and this abaya covers the entire military uniform of female \nofficers who serve in Saudi Arabia. This policy is unfair, and it is \ninexplicable.\n  More than a year ago, I wrote to Secretary Rumsfeld, along with four \nof my colleagues: Senators Helms, Craig, Nickles, and Collins, and I \nasked for an explanation from the Department of Defense regarding the \nabaya mandate upon females stationed in Saudi Arabia. We received \ninterim responses to the letter but never a substantive reply. Finally, \nthe letter was bucked down to General Shelton and then to General \nFranks. I wrote a second letter to Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz many \nweeks after our first letter went unanswered.\n  Eventually, we discovered the reason we never received a reply. \nFrankly, it was too hard for anyone to defend the policy. Everyone was \nso surprised when they got the letter. They could not understand where \nthis policy came from, why it would be implemented to the effect that a \nmilitary officer, on duty, would be forced to cover her uniform, the \nuniform of the United States of America, when on official duty.\n  How in the world could anyone justify that, as if they were ashamed \nof the uniform and had to cover it up? So we could not get an answer. \nThat is the bottom line.\n  I received a letter from a man who lived in Saudi Arabia for 19 years \nwho agreed with my position regarding the abaya. So I asked Paul \nWolfowitz essentially what this man asked me: Can we not instruct our \nofficers in avoiding harassment and help preserve our hard-fought \nfreedoms and not make them subject to police state tactics? Isn't that \npossible?\n  On September 11, as we all know, the United States was attacked. \nShortly thereafter, our Armed Forces began their operations in \nAfghanistan. After the Taliban and al-Qaida forces were in retreat, \nAfghan women joyfully--you can remember the press reports--began \nshedding their burqas, the head-to-toe gowns women were made to wear by \nthe brutal Taliban regime. I think we can all remember those vivid \npictures that began to crop up in the papers and in the magazines, \nshowing women peeking out through these burqas and finally beginning to \nhave the freedom of expression they so deserved. It was a very warm \nmoment to see that, and a very touching moment.\n  U.S. reporters began to question, now, the Department of Defense, \nabout how we could justify celebrating the victory over the repressive \nTaliban which the burqa symbolized, yet at the same time require our \nown American women in uniform to wear the Saudi equivalent of the \nburqa, which is the abaya. We just liberated the women in Afghanistan \nso they could remove the burqa if they so wished. Now, by the same \ntoken, at the same time, we are implementing--holding onto a policy \nwhich forces American women officers, officers of the U.S. military, to \ncover their uniform while on official duty.\n  I must say, when I first heard this, I did not believe it. I was told \nthis by an individual I will talk about later, and I said I didn't \nbelieve it. I said: I will have to check into this because I don't \nbelieve this is happening. But I found out it was true.\n\n  The Department had a hard time answering this glaring contradiction, \nand in fact they did not offer any reasonable explanation.\n  White House counselor Karen Hughes was presented with an Afghan burqa \nwhen Bush administration aides came back from the trip to Afghanistan. \nApparently--I wasn't there, but based on reports--she put it on. \nEveryone was amused when Karen put the burqa on and began to ask about \nit, wondering how the Secret Service would react if she walked into the \nOval Office with one on. But Karen Hughes is one of the administration \nrepresentatives in favor of the rights of Afghan women. The First Lady \nherself spoke out against this appalling mistreatment of women by the \nTaliban. So undoubtedly Karen Hughes's burqa episode may have seemed \nsomewhat amusing. But it certainly was not a laughing matter to Karen \nHughes, who spoke out very strongly in favor of the rights of Afghan \nwomen.\n  It is not a laughing matter that hundreds of United States female \nsoldiers are subjected to wearing the Saudi variant of the burqa, the \nabaya.\n  In a State Department publication, ``The Taliban's War Against \nWomen,'' there is this quotation about the burqa. Here is the quote \nabout the burqa:\n\n       The fate of women in Afghanistan is infamous and \n     intolerable. The burqa that imprisons them is a cloth prison, \n     but it is above all a moral prison. The torture imposed upon \n     little girls who dared to show their ankles or their polished \n     nails is appalling. It is unacceptable and unsupportable.\n\n  That is the State Department. That is not my quote, that is a quote \nissued by the State Department.\n  In the quotation from King Mohamed VI of Morocco, just substitute the \nword ``burqa'' for ``abaya'' and consider we are doing this to our \nwomen. After we cheered the liberation of Afghan women, after the fall \nof the Taliban, we are now doing this to our women in Saudi Arabia.\n  With all due respect, if you cannot defend a policy, you probably \nought to change it. This really doesn't require a lot of thought. If \nyou can't defend it, it probably should be changed. The Secretary of \nDefense, I am very pleased to say, did eventually repeal the abaya \nmandate.\n  However, that is the good news. Regrettably, that repeal, which I \nbelieve was meant in good faith, was then circumvented at lower levels. \nIn other words, the Secretary said let's repeal it, but when it went \ndown to the command level, nothing happened, and women were still being \nforced to wear the abaya. So basically the decision to repeal it was \nignored. I can't think of a nicer way to say it. Female soldiers in \nSaudi Arabia are now essentially coerced into wearing Muslim garb by \nbeing warned they will endanger their fellow comrades if they do not \nwear it. They are now strongly encouraged to wear this Muslim robe.\n  That is the exact language that is used in the command directive: \nWomen are ``strongly encouraged'' to wear this Muslim robe.\n  To a young soldier--those of you who have been in the military, as I \nhave, understand this--when you are strongly encouraged to do something \nby your superiors, and you are in uniform, you do it. It is no \ndifferent from a direct order. It is essentially the same thing. So the \nmandate is gone, but women are still being forced to wear abayas.\n\n  It is incredible to think that a woman in a military uniform has to \ncover that uniform up with an abaya, and that is a directive at the \ncommand level of the U.S. military. It really is incredible to me that \nwe have to be here on the Senate floor to correct this into law \nbecause, frankly, it is a stupid rule. It ought to be eliminated. It \nshould not have to be done here on the Senate floor.\n  I tried every way for months not to be here on the Senate floor to do \nthis. I tried, but I could not get it done because it is still there. I \nhave yet to meet a man or a woman who has served in Saudi Arabia in the \nmilitary who agrees with this policy. I have yet to meet anybody who \nagrees with the policy, whether they served or not. So repeal of the \nmandate may have helped the Department of Defense in terms of public \nrelations, and legally because of the lawsuit brought--reluctantly, I \nmight add--by Air Force COL Martha McSally, who fought for 6 years \nwithin the system to overturn this policy and first publicized the \ninjustice of this policy last year.\n  Here is an exemplary officer who fought for 6 years quietly to try to \nremove this, to say it was wrong. The essence of her message is this: I \nam a Christian. I don't want to wear an\n\n[[Page S5928]]\n\nabaya. I want to wear my uniform. I want to do what everybody else \ndoes, on duty and off. If I want to wear my uniform, I wear it. If I \nwant to wear civilian clothes, I wear civilian clothes. I don't want to \nwear an abaya.\n  Yet she was forced to do it. She tried for several years to get it \ncorrected, but to no avail. She was basically ignored.\n  Whoever brings this type of issue up, the so-called whistleblower, \nright away people say there must be something wrong with her; she is \nnot a good officer; she has some agenda; she is a women's rights \nadvocate, or whatever--things like that are spread around. Let me tell \nyou about her.\n  She is an Air Force Academy graduate. She was selected twice before \nher time to get an increase in rank. She was an A-10 pilot with 100 \nhours in the no-fly zone over Iraq and a devout Christian. She said in \nher interview she believes strongly that wearing the abaya violates her \nfaith. Since when are we in the business of telling a military officer \nthat she has to wear something that violates her faith and covers up \nher own uniform?\n  McSally's research on the issue showed that the policy was originally \njustified--here is the justification for the policy: ``Host nation \nsensitivities.'' Worries about offending the Saudis--offending the \nSaudis whom we saved from Saddam Hussein. They would all be buying oil \nfrom Saddam, while they sat in England someplace unless we had defended \nthem. Now we are worried about their sensitivities, telling a military \nofficer of the U.S. Army or Air Force or whatever that they can't wear \ntheir uniform proudly and show it off. They have to cover it up. That \njust doesn't cut it.\n  The issue showed that the policy was originally justified as ``host \nnation sensitivities.'' Then it was later changed to ``force \nprotection'' after the Khobar Towers were bombed. Neither action makes \nsense.\n  Let me say that again.\n  First, it was ``host nation sensitivities.'' When that didn't work, \nit became obvious that there was no justification for that. After the \nKhobar Towers were attacked, then we changed it to ``force \nprotection.''\n  In other words, we have to protect our troops. And because McSally, \nor anybody else, may not wear the abaya and show off her uniform, it \nwould infuriate some Saudi citizen. And, therefore, because our \nmilitary are walking around in Saudi Arabia somewhere on duty or off \nduty, some Saudi citizen might be offended and take some action to harm \nother military people as well.\n  McSally eloquently and courageously exposed the absurdity of the \njustifications of this abaya edict. In doing so, she may--the word \n``may'' is the action word here--have harmed her stellar military \ncareer.\n  In these fitness reports of officers, there are certain little action \nphrases that have to be put in there for you to get promoted. If they \nare not there, you get the message. Those of us in the military know \nall of that.\n  If her career is ruined, it would be a stain on the U.S. Air Force \nthat will never go away. If Colonel McSally is somehow getting any type \nof retribution--implied, indirect, or direct of not getting a \npromotion, or not getting a command--if that happens--I am not saying \nit is going to happen. I am not accusing anybody of it happening. But I \nam saying, if it does, I would say to the Air Force, it is a stain on \nthe Air Force that is going to take a long, long time to clean.\n  Women in Saudi Arabia have to have male escorts. American women \nwearing abayas are in the company of American males. Typically, they \nare military males with crewcuts and collared shirts. If an officer \njunior to McSally--a male--is walking down the streets of Saudi Arabia \nin a crewcut with an open-collared shirt and a pair of khakis, the \nofficer who is superior to the man has to cover her entire uniform with \nan abaya, and can't wear civvies at that.\n  I am going to tell you, that is not right. You do not have to be very \nsmart to figure out that it isn't right.\n  American men are prohibited from wearing Muslim garb. These women in \nabayas are Americans. It is obvious they are Americans. Why would a guy \nin a crewcut, who is obviously a marine, or an Air Force officer, be \nwalking down the street with a woman in an abaya? There is no secret \nhere. That doesn't constitute ``force protection.''\n  The whole argument is ridiculous. It is certainly not going to fool \nany terrorist, if that is the rationale.\n  Remember this: People do not want to wear these. They are willing to \ntake any risk, if there is such risk, not to have to wear the abaya.\n  Let me consider for a moment what ``host sensitivity'' means. It was \nthe original justification for the abaya policy. Does it mean we are \ngoing to subject our women to the same conditions that the Saudis set \nfor theirs? Will we eventually be making any American female \nservicemember who deploys to Afghanistan wear a burqa?\n  I visited Afghanistan. We landed in a snowstorm and reviewed the \nAmerican military who were there. Men and women were standing in a \nsnowstorm waiting for our plane to land. Senator Daschle was there. \nSeveral of my colleagues were there. They were wearing their uniforms. \nFrankly, they looked pretty doggone good in them.\n\n  Not one of those women had to wear a burqa or an abaya because they \nhappened to be in Afghanistan. It is so ridiculous it is not even worth \nthe breath it takes to talk about it.\n  Yet we have to talk about it right here on the floor of the Senate \nbecause some bullheaded person down there in the command wouldn't \nchange it. That is the reason we are here. It is the only reason we are \nhere.\n  I have heard some justify this practice as, well, when you are in \nRome, do as the Romans do. They are mistaking minor cultural norms, \nsuch as not showing the bottoms of one's feet, or removing your shoes \nat the door, for example, which is customary in Japan before entering a \nhome, with something entirely different and far more important. This is \nthe U.S. military officer's uniform.\n  It is not about harmless customs. Rather, it is about our fundamental \nvalues--religious freedom based on the first amendment. And it is about \ngender discrimination. That is what this is. It is gender \ndiscrimination. And it is a violation of the first amendment. It goes \nagainst every rule we have in the military about showing off our \nuniforms and being proud to wear them.\n  The Saudis certainly don't believe in ``When in Rome, do as the \nRomans do.'' Let me give you an example.\n  The Dallas Morning News reported that Crown Prince Abdullah asked \nwomen to be barred from air traffic control duties when he traveled to \nTexas to meet with President Bush. So much for reciprocal ``host nation \nsensitivities.''\n  Can you imagine that? Crown Prince Abdullah asked that women in our \nair traffic control towers be barred from those towers when he traveled \nto Texas to meet the President of the United States.\n  Don't tell me about reciprocal ``host nation sensitivities.''\n  I have also heard some say the burqa is just plain clothing; it just \nrepresents culture; that it is like the Indian sari.\n  That is not true.\n  A Washington Times article on Saudi authorities seizing women's robes \npoints out this fallacy. The Washington Times' story said the Saudi \nMinistry of Commerce confiscated 82,000 gowns from stores and factories \nafter inspection showed they were not in conformance with Islamic law. \nI repeat, in conformance with Islamic law. The abayas were not plain \nand opaque, but rather were determined to be ``provocatively \nclinging,'' or too highly decorated, or too revealing.\n  Are our DOD officials going to be asking the Saudi Ministry of \nCommerce to determine whether our issued abayas are in conformance with \nIslamic law? Do we consult with the Saudi Committee for Preservation of \nMorality and Prevention of Vice--the morality police--on the \nappropriateness of our abaya purchases for our female soldiers? We are \npaying for them. We are buying these abayas with U.S. taxpayer dollars.\n  Let me provide a short history of this mandate. It surfaced somewhere \nin 1992, 1994, or 1995. There was never an abaya mandate during Desert \nStorm--never an abaya mandate during Desert Storm when we had 500,000 \ntroops in the gulf. General Schwarzkopf never\n\n[[Page S5929]]\n\nordered our women to wear abayas during the gulf crisis, nor were they \nordered not to drive cars, which is another order given to American \nmilitary women.\n  Let us consider the contradictions. Women in the military in Saudi \nArabia are forced to wear the abaya by a local U.S. command decision. \nState Department women are not under any abaya mandate. If you are \nworking for the State Department, or if you are the wife of an \nAmbassador, whatever, there is no abaya mandate for you. Wives of \nmilitary attaches, there is no abaya mandate. Even the Saudi Government \nnever mandated the wearing of an abaya for non-Muslim women. I can't \nfind it anywhere. If somebody can find it, show me, because I can't \nfind it. No such mandate.\n\n  We are choosing to say that American military officers--outstanding \nU.S. military officers--have to wear an abaya to cover the uniform that \nthey wear with pride. You and I--or anyone who knows anything about the \nmilitary--know that the two things military officers like to show off \nare their fitness, because they work hard at being in shape, and their \nuniforms. Yet they are forced to cover up.\n  Colonel McSally explained that this is an indignity and an outrage we \nhave perpetrated upon ourselves. We did this. The Saudis did not do \nthis. The U.S. command did this. We are eventually making our women \nmore vulnerable to harassment by making them wear an abaya.\n  Imagine the ridicule and the jokes that must occur back on the base \nand the insults these women have to take from colleagues over this. \nWhen a woman puts one on, she immediately places herself under the \njurisdiction of the dreaded mutawa. You know who they are. In Saudi \nArabia, they are the religious police.\n  The U.S. Embassy in Saudi Arabia points this out when it states that \nwith regard to ``force protection,'' that ``even with the abaya and \nscarf, harassment still occurs.''\n  The Embassy's policy is sound and reasonable compared to DOD's. It \nsays, ``The Embassy will support a women in whatever personal choice \nshe makes on the issue of not wearing an abaya or head scarf.''\n  That is the Embassy policy.\n  The State Department, unlike DOD, trusts women to make these \ndecisions of their own accord and judgment. So the State Department \nsays: You make the choice. If you want to wear an abaya, wear it. But \nthe DOD says you have to wear it.\n\n  Let me tell you a little bit about the mutawa. One press report I \nfound was of a female soldier harassed in Saudi Arabia because she was \nwearing an abaya. The religious police ordered her to cover her head, \nrapping a cane against the wall beside her head. This, again, proves \nthe point that an abaya puts you at risk of harassment from the mutawa.\n  They knew she was an officer so they harassed her. They knew she was \na soldier, because she was walking with some guy wearing Bermuda shorts \nwho had a crewcut. They knew he was an officer in the military, and \nthey knew she was, too. So they chose to harass her.\n  DOD women are instructed to carry the veil. Imagine, this is DOD \nwomen instructed to carry the veil, and told to put it on immediately \nif they are confronted by a ``local.'' This, again, makes my case that \nwomen are subject to harassment for wearing an abaya and more likely to \nbe left alone if they are dressed in other garb, tourist clothing, or \ntheir uniform.\n  Tourists are not required to wear abayas. The Saudis only encourage \ntourists to wear conservative western dress. Forcing a female soldier \nto wear an abaya actually identifies her as an American. If she were \nwearing conservative attire, she would blend in with other tourists, \nand there would be nothing said about it.\n  One other story about the mutawa. My colleagues should be aware of \nthis story. The mutawa are the religious police in Saudi Arabia. They \nrecently caused the death of 15 school girls in Saudi Arabia. These \nwere Saudi girls. These school girls--here is what they did wrong--they \nwere trying to flee their burning school. They were trying to flee \ntheir burning school, but because they were not suitably attired--they \ndid not have their full abaya garb on--they were forced back into the \nflames by the religious police. Do you know what? Not one major news \norganization in our country carried the story front page, that I know \nof. I will stand corrected if somebody can produce one. It is a \nshocking incident. They forced the deaths of 15 girls because they were \ntrying to run out of a burning building, their school, and did not have \ntheir abayas on. That is the mutawa. Those are the people who are \nharassing our military personnel when they are forced to wear these \nabayas.\n  Yet consider the fact that our policy in Saudi Arabia towards our \nfemale soldiers seems to be done in deference to these religious \nzealots, not the ordinary Saudi or the Saudi Government. They are the \nsame ones who recently caused the senseless deaths of these 15 young \nwomen in their own country for lack of a head scarf. Think about that. \nAnd we are going to kowtow? We are going to tell a U.S. Air Force \nofficer--who is a decorated officer and has been promoted ahead of \nschedule twice, an Air Force Academy graduate, who flies over Iraq in \nthe no-fly zone--we are going to say to her, you have to cover up your \nU.S. uniform because you might be harassed by somebody who did \nsomething such as this, allowing 15 school children to die because they \ndid not have a head scarf on when trying to run out of a burning \nbuilding?\n  They ought to be thankful, the Saudis, that they are still a country. \nIf it had not been for us, they would be living under Saddam right now. \nOur military personnel--our men and women--should not have to put up \nwith this kind of stupidity.\n  Again, I am here on the Senate floor, taking my colleagues' time, to \noffer this amendment because we could not get the local commander to \npull back from this rule, this order.\n\n  These are the same people, these self-anointed religious police, whom \nwe seek to accommodate under the rationale of ``host nation \nsensitivities.'' I will not use profanity on the Senate floor, but \n``host nation sensitivities'' can go straight to that place way down \nbelow as far as I am concerned. Maybe we need to have some sensitivity \ntraining for the host nation. Maybe that is the idea. Maybe that is \nwhat we should do.\n  I do not need to repeat that this Nation is a superpower. We ought to \nact like one. Our military is the envy of the world. Our men and women \nin uniform are proud of those uniforms, as I said before, and proud of \nwhat those uniforms stand for. We should not treat any of them--men or \nwomen--as second-class citizens, regardless of the sensitivities of the \nhost nation.\n  They do not want to be treated that way. They are willing to take any \nrisk of somebody harassing them, or whatever it is, to wear their \nuniform. And they have that right. They should never be asked to cover \ntheir uniform in some disgraceful attempt to hide the military uniform \nof the U.S. Air Force or any other branch of our military.\n  We deployed a half million troops in the gulf against Iraq only a \nlittle over a decade ago and suffered nearly 300 casualties to defend \nthe sovereignty of Kuwait and to protect the Saudi Kingdom, which was \ndirectly threatened by the invasion of Kuwait by Iraqi forces. And \nbecause the mutawa wants these women to wear burqas or abayas, we are \ngoing to kowtow to that? And we can't get this repealed without coming \nto the Senate floor? Give me a break.\n  Our deployment in the gulf was pretty important. I supported going to \nthe gulf. But it was not more important than the esprit de corps and \nthe unity of our servicepeople in the region, nor more important than \nabiding by the principles fundamental to the creation of the United \nStates of America: Religious freedom of expression, and to wear proudly \nthe uniform of the United States of America, which millions have done.\n  How can you ask a military officer--an exemplary military officer--to \ncover up her uniform, to be ashamed of her uniform?\n  In 1981, an Air Force officer sued the Air Force because he wanted to \nwear a yarmulke, a symbol of the Jewish faith. The case went to the \nSupreme Court, and the officer lost. The Air Force's argument then--and \nI juxtapose it now to show the contradictory rationale for the abaya \ntoday--is the importance of the military uniform and uniformity itself \nin terms of discipline and hierarchical unity.\n\n[[Page S5930]]\n\n  The Air Force's argument in the yarmulke case can be summed up thus: \nThe considered professional judgment of the Air Force is that the \ntraditional outfitting of personnel in standardized uniforms encourages \nthe subordination of personal preferences and identities in favor of \nthe overall group mission.\n  That is exactly right. That is the point.\n\n       Uniforms encourage a sense of hierarchical unity by tending \n     to eliminate outward individual distinctions except for those \n     of rank. The Air Force considers them as vital during \n     peacetime as during war because its personnel must be ready \n     to provide an effective defense on a moment's notice; the \n     necessary habits of discipline and unity must be developed in \n     advance of trouble.\n\n  Let me use, for a moment, an anecdote, a fictitious anecdote, but one \nthat likely happened.\n  A person like Colonel McSally decides to drive off base on duty, in a \njeep, with three other officers. First of all, according to this rule, \nshe has to sit in the back because she is not allowed to drive the car. \nAnd the other three officers, in this fictitious example, which \nprobably happened, are junior to her. She is the senior officer. She is \nforced to sit in the back. On top of that, she has to wear an abaya to \ncover herself up from head to foot so nobody knows she has the uniform \non.\n\n  How humiliating is that? Give me one good reason anybody would \nsupport a policy like that? There is not a person in that jeep who \nwould ever say that she should have to do that. They would be willing \nto take any risk that might come their way, if there were some, so that \nshe would not have to do it. And she tried to change this for years, to \nno avail.\n  How far we have come. Martha McSally is not asking to wear publicly a \ncross as the symbol of her faith. She is asking not to wear a religious \ngarment not of her faith.\n  She is arguing the Air Force's case when it argued against the \nyarmulke. She is arguing not to be wearing a badge of religious and \nethnic identity. That is all she is asking.\n  Interestingly, the Senate disagreed with the decision by the Supreme \nCourt that disallowed the wearing of a yarmulke. The Senate voted 55-42 \nfor a Lautenberg amendment that would have allowed first amendment \nexpression by permitting ``neat and conservative'' religious attire, \nbut letting the DOD decide when wearing such apparel interfered with \nmembers' duties.\n  Many Senators still serving today voted in favor of that Lautenberg \namendment.\n  The Reagan administration supported the Air Force, and the Senate \namendment was never enacted into law.\n  The Senate vote was a defense of religious expression. Fifteen years \nlater, we are facing a grievous situation where our servicewomen in \nSaudi Arabia are coerced into wearing religious garb in conflict with \ntheir faith and which subverts the discipline and uniformity of the \nU.S. military uniform.\n  This is intolerable, humiliating, deplorable, and it is \nunjustifiable. I would be happy to provide for the record the numbers \nof letters and phone calls I have made in the last year or so, to try \nto avoid coming here on the Senate floor to have this put into the \nlegislative process--to no avail. I see it primarily as a first \namendment issue in that we should not be conforming by dress to a \nforeign state religion. It is also an issue of gender discrimination.\n  Support for lifting this mandate comes from all directions--the left \nand the right of the political spectrum, from the Rutherford Institute, \nwhich sued the Air Force over this policy and on behalf of Lt. Col. \nMcSally, to the National Council of Women's Organizations, an umbrella \norganization.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Wyden). The time of the Senator from New \nHampshire has expired.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I didn't realize I was under a time \nconstraint. I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Support for lifting this mandate comes \nfrom both the left and right--the Rutherford Institute, which sued the \nAir Force on behalf of Lt. Col. McSally, to the National Council of \nWomen's Organizations, an umbrella organization which now includes such \nwell-known members as the League of Women Voters, the National \nOrganization of Women, Women in Government, the YWCA, Hadassah, and the \nFeminist Majority Foundation. The House has already spoken, approving a \nsimilar bipartisan amendment by Representatives Langevin, Hostettler, \nand Wilson to repeal the mandate and stop the DOD from purchasing \nabayas. We purchase them on top of everything else. The taxpayers are \npaying for the abaya.\n\n  The majority leader in a front page Washington Times story on June 17 \ncommented about the U.S. relationship with the Saudi Government:\n\n       We need to be more aggressive. We need to be even \n     confrontational with the leadership of the Saudi government \n     in those occasions when they're not doing enough, and when \n     they are sponsoring this propaganda of the ilk we've . . . \n     seen.\n\n  He was talking about fighting terrorism. The same advice should apply \nto the Saudis when it comes to making our female troops wear Muslim \nclothing. We need to stand up to the Saudis, stand up for women in the \nmilitary. We also need to stand up for ourselves as a nation, stand up \nfor our values and our beliefs.\n  I also note that the chairman of our Armed Services Committee made a \npointed comment when the abaya issue surfaced about disrespect for \nfemale servicepeople in Saudi Arabia, and maybe we should reconsider \nour bases there in light of this disrespect.\n  I totally agree with the distinguished Senator from Michigan. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this amendment.\n  To repeat the four points this amendment addresses, it says: You \ncannot require or encourage an abaya to be worn; No. 2, no adverse \naction against women who choose not to wear it; No. 3, no money to \nprocure abayas for regular or routine issuance; and No. 4, that the \nSecretary of Defense provide instructions to this effect immediately \nupon arrival in Saudi Arabia. That is it. That is the amendment. That \nis what it does.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I yield the floor \nand thank my colleagues for their attention.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does the Senator from Massachusetts wish to speak on this \namendment?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Just for a moment, if I have the opportunity to speak on \nanother amendment as well. I will follow whatever procedure the \nchairman wishes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does the Senator from Vermont wish to speak on this \namendment?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I wish to follow the Senator from Massachusetts on this \namendment, yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. On the pending amendment?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I reserve the right to object.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if I could ask the Chair, is there a time \nagreement on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time was evenly divided until 5:45. The \nSenator from Michigan does control all of the remaining time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes on this amendment. \nThen if no one else wishes to speak on the amendment, it will be up to \nthe author of the amendment if he wishes to speak further. I would \nsuggest that the time that remains between now and 5:45 then be used \nfor other purposes, if there is nobody who wishes to speak further on \nthis amendment. I yield myself 4 minutes on the amendment.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. If the Senator will yield for a moment, I \ndid have a couple of requests from Senators who may be here to speak. \nThat is all. I didn't want to ignore that request. I have no objection \nto the Senator speaking to another matter. If the Senators do come down \nand wish to speak, I would like them to have that opportunity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. With that understanding, I will proceed and yield myself 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment of the Senator from \nNew Hampshire to prohibit the requirement or the encouragement that our \nfemale service members serving in Saudi Arabia wear an abaya when they \nleave their military bases.\n  From 1991 until January 2002, U.S. military authorities required \nfemale\n\n[[Page S5931]]\n\nservice members leaving military bases in Saudi Arabia to wear the \nabaya, a traditional religious garment for Saudi women. The rationale \nfor this policy was force protection, respect for host nation customs, \nand preventing conflicts with the Saudi religious police.\n  This issue came to a head in December 2001, when Lt. Col. Martha \nMcSally, an Air Force pilot stationed at Prince Bandar air base, \ninitiated a lawsuit against DoD seeking a court order declaring the \npolicy unconstitutional. In January 2002, the military announced a \nchange in the uniform policy, making wearing of the abaya ``not \nmandatory, but strongly encouraged.'' Lt. Col. McSally claimed this was \ninsufficient and did little to change de facto pressure on military \nservice women to conform to the old policy.\n  Mr. President, Lt. Col. McSally is the highest ranking female Air \nForce jet pilot. She is an Air Force Academy graduate with a Masters \ndegree, a Desert Storm veteran, and has over 100 hours as a rescue \npilot. When she refused to wear the abaya, Lt. Col. McSally was \ncriticized for her unprofessionalism and lack of leadership. When she \ntold her commanding officer ``I cannot, will not put that thing on,'' \nshe risked her career for the rights of America's female service \nmembers and, I suggest, for the rights of all of us.\n  Lt. Col. McSally is an officer who has patrolled the no-fly zone in \nIraq and led search-and-rescue missions in Afghanistan. She is asked \nevery day to be ready to save the lives of her fellow service members. \nYet we deny her and all female service members serving our Nation in \nSaudi Arabia the same rights as their male counterparts as soon as they \nleave the base.\n  The Department's decision to change the requirement for female \nservice members stationed in Saudi to wear the abaya off-base to a \n``strong encouragement'' is, at best, a superficial change. A ``strong \nencouragement'' is practically the same as an order in military terms.\n  The State Department doesn't require female foreign service officers \nto wear an abeya in Saudi Arabia. Forcing service members to conform to \na religious code not of their own violates their religious freedoms. \nRequiring, or ``strongly encouraging,'' female service members to wear \nthe abaya is oppressive, and it is demeaning to people who do not \nbelieve in the same religion as those presumably putting pressure on \nthe U.S. to require wearing an abaya. At the same time we are asking \nour female service members to risk their lives to fight for the \nliberties we cherish, we are denying them the very freedom they are \ndefending, simply because they are stationed in a country with \ndifferent cultural norms. This is not acceptable.\n  The amendment before us would correct this policy by prohibiting, \nrequiring, or encouraging our female servicemembers to wear an abaya \nwhen serving in Saudi Arabia. It would also prohibit taking adverse \naction against servicemembers for choosing not to wear an abaya while \nassigned or on temporary duty in Saudi Arabia. Further, it would \nprohibit the use of Department of Defense funds to procure abayas for \nmilitary personnel serving in Saudi Arabia and would require the \nmilitary to inform female servicemembers of these prohibitions when \nthey are ordered to duty in Saudi Arabia.\n  Mr. President, this is simply the right thing to do for our \nservicemembers who so loyally serve our country wherever we ask them to \nserve.\n  I congratulate Senator Smith for his initiative in this matter. I \nthink it is a very significant statement about what we are all about \nand what our military is all about. I hope the Senate will adopt this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join strongly in recommending that our \ncolleagues support Senator Smith's initiative. And I associate myself \nwith the remarks of our distinguished chairman. This is something that \nhas to be corrected right now. We have extraordinary women performing \nin almost every capacity of our military today. This is one of those \nsituations where maybe there were the best of intentions at the time, \nbut it is out of hand now. It is time to correct it with finality and \nclarity. We are doing that with the Smith amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I'm pleased to join Senators Smith and \nCantwell, along with several other Senators, in proposing an amendment \nto end, once and for all, an ill-conceived and discriminatory policy in \nthe U.S. Military.\n  Several years ago, the United States Central Command instituted a \npolicy that requires our female service members in Saudi Arabia to wear \nan abaya while off base.\n  The abaya is a traditional religious garment worn by Saudi women not \nunlike the Afghan burqa.\n  Saudi women can face beatings by religious police if they are not \nwearing this garment and the U.S. Central Command has justified this \npolicy as a force protection measure.\n  However, the Saudi Government does not require non-Muslim women to \nwear an abaya.\n  Westerners are merely expected to wear conservative clothing, such as \nslacks and collared shirts for men and long skirts and long sleeved \nblouses for women.\n  While it's sensible to make reasonable accommodations for a host \nculture, we must not forget that American personnel abroad are \nrepresentatives of our free society.\n  In fact, the U.S. State Department explicitly forbids its female \nemployees in Saudi Arabia from wearing the abaya while serving in an \nofficial capacity for the United States Government.\n  We should be setting a positive example of respect for women, \nespecially the very women who are helping to defend Saudi Arabia from \nwould-be aggressors.\n  In order to try to alleviate the mounting criticism of the abaya \npolicy, the Central Command revised its policy in January to state that \nthe wearing of the abaya is ``not mandatory but is strongly \nencouraged''.\n  This distinction does not go nearly far enough and may mean little in \npractice.\n  Let me be clear, the abaya policy is not simply a bad idea and \ncompletely unnecessary, it is blatantly discriminatory.\n  All attempts to justify this policy have fallen flat and it has \nbecome painfully obvious that this policy must be abolished entirely.\n  Our amendment would prohibit the Department of Defense from requiring \nAmerican servicewomen in Saudi Arabia to wear the abaya and forbid DOD \nto spend taxpayer money to purchase the garment.\n  It also protects our female service members from any kind of \nretaliation for not wearing the abaya garment.\n  At a time when Afghan women are celebrating their new found \nliberties, it is frankly embarrassing to have a policy in place that \nsubjects our own servicewomen to a demeaning practice.\n  It is time for this policy to go and I would urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, \nSenator Cantwell of Washington, Senator Smith of New Hampshire, and \nSenator Grassley of Iowa, as a co-sponsor of this critical amendment to \nprovide justice, dignity, and equal rights to our service women \nstationed in Saudi Arabia.\n  The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia requires its women to wear garment called \nthe abaya, it is a covering which extends from head to toe on a woman. \nIt is part of the Muslim faith and their customs and traditions.\n  The Saudi Arabian government does not require American women living \nor visiting in Saudi Arabia to wear the abaya. Rather, both men and \nwomen are encouraged to wear modest American clothing.\n  When visitors come to my home, I anticipate they will abide by the \nrules I have established in my home. Therefore, I respect the wishes of \nthe Saudi government, that when westerns enter Saudi Arabia, westerns \nshould wear modest clothing. I would not want to violate the customs of \na host country.\n  What I cannot understand is why the Department of Defense has \ndetermined that American service-women must wear the abaya when they \nleave the confines of the military bases in Saudi Arabia. The host \ngovernment does not mandate that service women wear the abaya. More \nimportantly to me, the\n\n[[Page S5932]]\n\nSaudi government does not require our service women to dress \ndifferently from our service men. However, our very own Department of \nDefense requires our service-women to dress differently from our \nservice men. This is unjust and outrageous.\n  Our service women are equals to their male counterparts in the Armed \nServices. Women have died and bled in defense of this country. They can \nfly fighters, pilot helicopters, and drive ships. Those rights did not \ncome easily. Roadblocks were put in the way, and I thought they has \nbeen overcome. But now, the Department of Defense wants to make our \nfirst-rate women soldiers second class citizens in the United States \nmilitary.\n  I hope the Senate will approve this amendment and stand with the \nHouse of Representatives, which passed similar legislation, to send a \nstrong message to the Department of Defense that women in uniform are \nnot second class citizens.\n  In closing, I want to salute the women who brought this issue to \nAmerica's attention. Lieutenant Colonel Martha McSally has always been \na warrior. She fought the Pentagon's bureaucracy to become one of the \nfirst female fighter pilots. And, now she has to fight the Pentagon, \nonce gain, in a court of law to overturn the Pentagon's abaya policy. \nColonel McSally you serve as an inspiration to young women across the \nUnited States who want to serve their country. Today, I hope the Senate \ncan come to Colonel McSally's defense, and all women serving in Saudi \nArabia, to lift this irrational Pentagon rule.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMikulski be added as an original cosponsor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will yield some of the time to Senator \nSmith to control. Apparently, I control the time. Why don't I yield 5 \nminutes to Senator Smith under his control, and then yield to Senator \nKennedy for 12 minutes, and then yield to Senator Jeffords for 10 \nminutes. That is just about right.\n  Mr. WARNER. May I inquire as to the subject of the Senator from \nVermont?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. It is about homeland security.\n  Mr. WARNER. We are very anxious to get to the Kennedy matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I congratulate my colleague \nfrom New Hampshire for an excellent presentation. I look forward to \nsupporting it for reasons that he has outlined. He made a very \ncompelling case here this afternoon.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Smith amendment be \ntemporarily laid aside so that I may call up amendment No. 3918.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that \nimmediately upon the reporting of my amendment, it be laid aside, and \nthe Senate resume the consideration of the Smith amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3918\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for himself, \n     Mr. Reed, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Durbin, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 3918.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Thursday, June 20, 2002, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have 12 minutes. I see my friend from \nHawaii. He wanted to speak on my amendment. If the Chair reminds me \nwhen 9 minutes is up, if there is no objection, I will let the Senator \nfrom Hawaii speak for 3 minutes, if that is all right, following me.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will yield myself 9 minutes.\n  Mr. President, as I understand it, for the benefit of the Members, we \nare going to vote at 5:45. I bring to the attention of the floor \nleaders that we can have a vote on this at a time agreeable sometime in \nthe middle of the morning tomorrow. We will have additional time to \ndiscuss this.\n  I offer this amendment to promote public-private competition for \nDepartment of Defense work. Today, there is far too little real \ncompetition for contracts to provide goods and services to Federal \nagencies. We should be getting the most out of every taxpayer dollar. \nSo if a Federal agency could do the job better and cheaper than a \ndefense contractor, the Federal worker should get the job.\n  Today, less than 1 percent of Department of Defense service contracts \nare subject to public-private competition. Only a tiny fraction of the \nmore than 2 million DOD contracts face real competition. As a result, \nwe are depriving loyal and dedicated public workers of the chance even \nto compete for their own jobs. At the same time, we are depriving the \nAmerican people of the efficiencies they deserve, especially as we take \non today's great challenges in defending the security of our Nation.\n  My amendment would lower costs for taxpayers and enhance our Nation's \nreadiness by promoting expanded public-private competition.\n  Over the last decade, there has been a massive shift in who does the \nwork for the Department of Defense. This work has shifted dramatically \nfrom civilian employees to private contractors. Between 1993 and 2001, \nthe number of civilian employees at the Department of Defense declined \nby more than one-third. That represents the loss of 300,000 public \njobs. The work has gone instead to private contractors. During a period \nof only 3 years, the contractor workforce expanded by almost 400 \npercent. The number of private contract jobs grew astoundingly, from \n197,000 to 734,000 jobs--substantially surpassing the DOD's civilian \nworkforce of public workers.\n  These are the same contractors who overcharge the Defense Department \nand taxpayers for simple tools and even toilet seats. The GAO study \nfound that the cost of nearly 3,000 spare parts purchased by the \nmilitary from private contractors increased by a 1,000 percent or more \nin just 1 year. One spare part estimated to cost less than $3 was sold \nto the Government by contractors for $14,529.\n  I have a list here from the GAO: A machine bolt, estimated at $40, \nactual price: $1,887; a hub body, estimate $35, actual price: $14,529; \na self-locking nut, initial estimate $2.69, actual price: $2,185; a \nradio transformer, initial estimate $683, actual price: $11,000. The \nlist goes on and on and on and on.\n  Surely, the DOD found that the cost of spare parts increased more \nthan twice as fast between 1993 to 2000 when there was no competition. \nDo we understand that the cost of these spare parts increased \ndramatically over the period of time when there was no competition. \nSurely, we can do better.\n  The critical work by DOD is not subject to open, full competition. In \nmany cases, the private contractors face no competition at all. In \nfact, the Associated Press reported last year that the Government \nbought more than half of its products without bidding or other \npractices to take advantage of the marketplace. As a result, current \ndefense contractors are being unfairly shielded from competition. It is \nthe taxpayers who are paying the price in higher costs.\n\n  In any other area of American business, these noncompetitive \npractices would be unacceptable. In fact, no private company would \nreasonably outsource jobs without a hard-headed analysis showing cost \nsavings. Even the Department of Defense recognized that real \ncompetition has been sorely lacking.\n  When the inspector general looked at the Department of Defense \nservice contract process in the year 2000, he concluded that 60 percent \nof service contracts suffered from ``inadequate competition.''\n  Despite these huge markups by private contractors, it doesn't mean \ntheir workers are being paid even a living wage. In fact, according to \na study by the Economic Policy Institute, more than 1 in 10 Federal \ncontract workers is earning poverty-level wages, and most of the firms \npaying these wages are defense contractors. Workers are\n\n[[Page S5933]]\n\nlosing out and taxpayers are losing out from this lack of competition. \nClearly, more private-public competition is needed to ensure that the \ntaxpayers, as well as public workers, are getting a fair shake.\n  The record shows when there is real competition, public workers will \nshow their strength. In fact, when Government agencies have competed \nfor contracts, they have won the bids 60 percent of the time fair and \nsquare.\n  The public-private competitions that have taken place have saved an \naverage of over 30 percent for an estimated $660 million in savings to \ntaxpayers. That means the taxpayers save money and good workers keep \ntheir jobs.\n  The amendment I am offering this evening requires an analysis of the \ncosts of maintaining work in the public sector and contracting work out \nto the private sector. It lays out flexible principles to guide the \npublic-private competition process and allows DOD broad flexibility in \nestablishing a competition consistent with these principles.\n  The amendment also offers wide discretion to DOD by creating a number \nof exemptions from the public-private competition. When national \nsecurity so demands, DOD is given the power to waive public-private \ncompetition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator from \nMassachusetts he has used 7 minutes of his time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the amendment also exempts many categories of work for \npublic-private competition, including high-tech work.\n  The amendment also provides a waiver to DOD for functions that must \nbe performed urgently.\n  Finally, it remains in the discretion of DOD to determine which jobs \nmay be open to public-private competition.\n  The principles underlying this legislation have broad support. In \nfact, the administration is on record for expanded public-private \ncompetition. I want to show statements that were made this past spring.\n  This is Angela Styles of the Office of Management and Budget:\n\n       No one in this administration cares who wins a public-\n     private competition. But we very much care that government \n     service is provided by those best able to do so. Every study \n     on public-private competition I have seen concludes that \n     these competitions generate significant cost savings.\n\n  GAO recommendations:\n\n       Competitions, including private competitions, have been \n     shown to produce significant cost savings for the government, \n     regardless of whether a public or private entity is selected.\n\n  Mr. President, why not have competition? That is what this amendment \nis all about. When we have not had the competition, we have seen these \nexplosions of cost. We are just saying let the Department of Defense \nset up the criteria. They can exclude the matters which are of national \nsecurity importance, urgent, or have some other requirements. But when \nwe have the results, as I mentioned, the fact we have bolts and self-\nlocking nuts, radio transformers, routine matters--I have a list of \nover 30 items right here in my hand--cable assembly; linear \nmicrocircuit; aircraft stiffener, $125, sold for $3,400; insulation, \n$1, sold for $3,390.\n  Why do we tolerate it, Mr. President? How can the Defense Department \nnot be willing to accept this?\n  I believe I have about 3 minutes. I yield those remaining 3 minutes \nto my friend and colleague from Hawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kennedy for the time.\n  Mr. President. I rise in support of an amendment to the DOD \nauthorization bill that takes important steps to enhance cost-\neffectiveness and accountability in Government. I am pleased to have \nworked with Senator Kennedy to offer this amendment to improve \nfinancial transparency and cost savings in procurement policies.\n  This amendment will promote sensible procurement policies by \nrequiring cost savings before decisions are made to outsource \nGovernment functions. The requirement that the government show a 10-\npercent cost savings prior to outsourcing has been a part of the \ncommercial activities analysis for many years and is considered \nstandard practice. I tried to codify the 10-percent cost-saving \nprovision last year in the National Defense Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 2002. I was met, however, with opposition because the \nCommercial Activities Panel had not yet completed its review. I am \nhappy to report that the Commercial Activities panel completed its \nreview last month and I am renewing my efforts, with my colleagues, to \ncodify the 10-percent cost-savings provision. It is important to note \nthat the amendment includes a provision which allows the Secretary of \nDefense to waive the cost-savings requirement if national security \ninterests are compelling.\n  This amendment would promote public-private competition by ensuring \nthat federal employees have the opportunity to compete for existing and \nnew DOD work. It strengthens fairness in public-private competitions by \nensuring that DOD competes an equitable number of contractor and \ncivilian jobs. It also improves government transparency by establishing \nmeasures to track the true cost and size of the DOD contractor \nworkforce.\n  The amendment offers wide discretion to the Department by creating a \nnumber of exemptions from the requirements of public-private \ncompetition. The amendment gives the Department the authority to waive \npublic-private competition requirements when national security requires \nsuch action.\n  The passage of this amendment would lead to smarter and more \nefficient procurement policy for the Federal Government. As chairman of \nthe Senate Armed Services Readiness Subcommittee, I will continue to \nwork to ensure DOD procurement policies are conducted in a manner that \nachieves the best return on the dollar. This amendment takes important \nsteps toward this goal.\n  I yield back my time, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3969\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Washington needs \n5 minutes, and Senator Jeffords has agreed to withhold his comments \nuntil after the vote, which is very helpful. Senator Smith has 5 \nminutes, and I believe Senator Thomas wants 8 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I do not need 5 minutes. I \nyield my 5 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is the Senator from Iowa here to speak on this amendment?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. No.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Senator Reid is not in the Chamber. The agreement is we \nwill vote at 5:45 p.m. If we provide time for those two Senators, it \nwill be 5:40 p.m. Do we know whether there is any objection to voting \nat 5:50 p.m. instead of 5:45 p.m.? None.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Cantwell speak for 5 minutes, \nthen Senator Thomas speak for 7 minutes, and then we will vote at 5:50 \np.m. instead of 5:45 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Smith-\nCantwell-Grassley amendment to prohibit the Department of Defense from \nordering female military personnel to wear the Saudi abaya garment. \nBefore I begin my statement, I would like to thank Senator Bob Smith \nfor his tremendous work on the issue.\n  For most of the last 8 years, officer and enlisted women who are \nstationed with the Joint Task Force Southwest Asia in Saudi Arabia have \nbeen required to wear the abaya when going off base, either for \nofficial duties over their uniforms or in their off duty hours. The \nabaya is the traditional religious garment for Saudi women, similar to \nthe Afghan burqa.\n  On Tuesday, May 14, the House passed, by unanimous voice vote, its \nprohibition against the Department of Defense requiring or compelling \nU.S. female service members in Saudi Arabia to wear the abaya garment, \neither on or off duty. Like the House legislation, the amendment we are \ndiscussing today prohibits the Department of Defense from forcing or \nencouraging American servicewomen in Saudi Arabia to wear the abaya \ngarment, restricts the Department of Defense from spending taxpayer \nmoney to purchase the garment, and protects servicewomen from \nretaliation should they choose not to wear the garment off base.\n  As a democracy, we should be at the forefront of embracing equality \nfor all\n\n[[Page S5934]]\n\nof our citizens, and by our actions show that we practice what we \npreach. The military has gone to great lengths to communicate to the \ntroops that they are respected regardless of race, religion or gender. \nBut encouraging our military women in Saudi Arabia to wear the abaya \ncommunicates just the opposite viewpoint . . . it reinforces gender \nstereotypes and sends the message to our soldiers that women are not \nequally valued.\n  The Department of Defense policy requiring military women to wear an \nabaya whenever they went off base, and other measures directed \nexclusively towards women, started shortly after the Gulf War. It is \nimportant to note that during the war, General Schwarzkopf worked \nclosely with the U.S. embassy and the consulate in Dhahran on the Gulf \ncoast to set up liaison procedures with the Saudis that would nip \nproblems in the bud. As a result, while women were encouraged to wear \nthe abaya when off base, they were not required to. Nor were they \nrequired to sit in the back seat of motor vehicles. Nor were they \nforbidden from driving, since that rule impeded the military's mission.\n  Why these policies changed in the early 1990s is still unclear. At \nfirst, the reason was ``host nation sensitivities.'' As you may recall, \nalthough there were many restrictions on the troops during Operation \nDesert Storm, the relative freedom our military women enjoyed vis-a-vis \nthe local women, prompted a demonstration by defiant Saudi women who \ndrove their cars around Riyadh, saying, in effect, that what U.S. \nmilitary women could do, Saudi women should be allowed to do, too. This \nsituation, and the fact that Riyadh is one of the most conservative \nareas of the country, may have been the reason the Joint Task Force \nSouthwest Asia commander acquiesced to these new policies. The \nconsequence of this, however, is a policy that sets up a double \nstandard and denigrates female personnel in the U.S. military.\n  After the Khobar Towers bombing in 1996, the primary reason for the \nrestrictive policies towards women changed to ``force protection.'' The \nDepartment of Defense states that this policy is for the protection of \nthe military women . . . that if they do not wear this garment they \nwould be subject to beatings and other harassment by the Mutawa, the \nSaudi religious police. The Department of Defense states that if women \ndo not wear the abaya, they will not blend in, thus making military \npersonnel in Saudi Arabia targets for terrorist attack. Finally, the \nDepartment of Defense states that if women do not wear the abaya, male \nmilitary personnel would be subject to harassment and arrest.\n  Frankly, any action taken against U.S. military personnel--male or \nfemale--by the Saudi religious police--the Mutawa--for purported \ninfractions of their strict behavioral codes should be strongly \nprotested by the military and the state department to the Saudi \ngovernment. Although women have been harassed, both while wearing the \nabaya and when not wearing the abaya, I have no information that any \nprotest about the Mutawa's actions has ever been initiated either by \nthe State department or the Department of Defense.\n  I understand that the norms for public behavior in Saudi Arabia are \nextremely conservative. According to our own State Department travel \nadvisory regarding proper attire and behavior when visiting Saudi \nArabia, visitors, both male and female, should wear very conservative \nclothing, and behave so as not to draw attention to themselves.\n  For women, skirts should be ankle length, sleeves wrist length, and \nnecklines above the collarbone. Pants and pantsuits may attract \nunwanted attention. The Mutawa are charged with enforcing these \nstandards. Although the climate in Saudi Arabia is very hot, and \nlightweight clothing is recommended for travelers, the abaya consists \nof a black material that, along with the headscarf, covers the wearer \nfrom head to foot. However, I think it is really important to note that \nthe Saudi government does not require non-Muslim women to wear the \nabaya.\n  While U.S. military women have been required to wear the abaya even \nwhen on duty, official State department policy is that its female \npersonnel on official business are expressly forbidden from wearing the \nabaya because they are representing the United States Government. These \nwomen may wear the abaya when off-duty if they choose, and many state \ndepartment female employees do choose to wear the garment when not on \nofficial business, in deference to the Saudi culture.\n  The Department of Defense now says that it will change its policy \nfrom explicitly ordering that women wear the abaya while on duty but \noff base, to a policy that ``strongly encourages'' wearing an abaya. \nWomen in my state who have been stationed with the military in Saudi \nArabia tell me that the words ``strongly encourage'' are tantamount to \nan order. There is no choice.\n  Many other men and women from my home state of Washington have \nwritten me supporting changing the Department of Defense policy in \nSaudi Arabia that strongly encourages women to wear the abaya garment \nover their clothes when they leave the base.\n  One of my constituents, a veteran from Kent, WA, wrote to say ``women \nthat have served this country honorably and distinguished themselves in \nbattle deserve our respect and support.'' He applauded the willingness \nto women, especially Lieutenant Colonel Martha McSally, the Air Force \nColonel who first brought this attention to national attention, for \n``her willingness to stand up and fight the repressive and unreasonable \norders for females in the services to wear an abaya and be subject to \nother demeaning practices when they are stationed in Saudi Arabia.''\n  Another veteran from Olympia, WA, who writes that he is ``appalled at \nthe treatment of a true American hero . . . [while] the Pentagon \ndemeans her with an embarrassing dress code while in Saudi Arabia.''\n  Another constituent from Seattle, WA, was a military police officer \nin the U.S. Army, and wrote that she was ``incensed to learn that our \nmilitary women in Saudi Arabia are being subjected to'' wearing the \nabaya and asked that we immediately rescind these regulations.\n  We are not advocating that military women be able to wear tank tops \nand shorts when off base in Saudi Arabia . . . but we do believe that \nwearing the recommended conservative clothing maintains a woman's \ndignity and status among our U.S. troops stationed there. We need to \nbalance host nation sensitivities with our nation's goal to promote \nAmerican values of democracy and equality abroad.\n  The fact of the matter is that what it comes down to, when you value \npeople, you give them freedom, including the freedom of self-\ndetermination. That is who we are and what our country represents \nacross the world.\n  As U.S. Senators, we should strive to ensure that our military men \nand women are treated fairly wherever we send them to accomplish our \ncountry's work. I understand that Americans serving overseas are there \nby agreement of the host nation, and that the host nation can withdraw \nthat agreement when they see fit. I also understand and believe that \nAmericans should respect and abide by a host nation's laws.\n  Yet, every military member is a representative of our country and a \nsoldier-statesman whether a private or a general. When they represent \nus, they represent our democratic ideals. Soldiers, both men and women, \nare fighting for our democratic principles. We want our military \npersonnel to abide by the rules of the country in which they are \nstationed, but we should not impose stricter rules on only one group of \nour soldiers, especially when it is not required by the host nation.\n  The Department of Defense has had ample opportunity to rescind this \npolicy, but they have only made token attempts to change its policy in \na manner that effectively leaves its original policy in place. There is \nno doubt that the Department of Defense needs the flexibility to ensure \nthe force is protected and our country's military readiness is not \nimpeded. However, this must not be done at the expense of our female \nsoldiers' civil and religious freedoms. There are approximately 1,000 \nwomen stationed in Saudi Arabia. It inconceivable that while we entrust \nthese women and ask them to put their lives on the line, at the same \ntime we are asking them to succumb to outdated ideas about what \nindividuals can or cannot do because of gender.\n\n[[Page S5935]]\n\n  Last month, the House, by voice vote, unanimously approved similar \nlegislation. We are here today to complete the circle and show our \nsupport for our women in uniform who not only have to fight our \nenemies, but also apparently have to fight for their rights within our \nown military.\n  While there are sometimes conflicts in what the military wants, and \nwhat the civilian leadership wants, we must remember that the military \nanswers to its civilian leadership. If Congress didn't use its \nauthority to require the military to change its policies, our service \nacademies would still be all men, our fighter pilots would still be all \nmen, and our ships would still be all men. And our military would be a \nshell of what it is today, because without women, the military could \nnot function as a professional, all-volunteer force.\n  Mr. President, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the hard work \nof Darlene Iskra, a legislative fellow in my office. Darlene is a \nretired Navy Commander; in fact, she is the first woman ever to command \na U.S. Navy ship. Her work in my office, and especially on this issue, \nhas been invaluable.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \nKennedy amendment.\n  In 1998, this body passed unanimously the Federal Activities \nInventory Reform Act of 1998. I was one of the principal sponsors. The \nFAIR Act was passed unanimously, as I said. It was a carefully crafted \ncompromise at that time between the private sector and the unions, the \nfirst time a process was codified to help assure proper implementation \nof a 47-year-old Federal policy that states the Government shall not be \ninvolved in commercial activities, a policy that has been in place for \na very long time, and a very clear policy, I believe, that we ought to \ngo to the private sector for those things that can be done in the \nprivate sector that are not inherently governmental. We passed that \nunanimously. It is now in the process of being implemented.\n  The sponsor of this amendment spent most of his time talking about \nthe Defense Department support of this proposition. I want to share a \nletter or two that I received. This one happens to be from the \nSecretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld:\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to express my strong \n     opposition to the draft amendment proposed by Senator Edward \n     Kennedy. . . . As you know, we have made a top priority of \n     finding efficiencies and savings within the Defense \n     Department to enable us to improve our tooth-to-tail ratio. . \n     . . The draft Kennedy amendment would increase Department \n     cost by requiring public-private competitions for new \n     functions and for previously contracted work already \n     subjected to competition. It would also adversely impact \n     mission effectiveness by delaying contract awards for needed \n     services.\n\n  This is very strong opposition from the Secretary of Defense.\n  This next letter comes from the Executive Office of the President, \nOffice of Management and Budget Director Mitchell Daniels. He says:\n\n       I am writing to express deep concern over the possible \n     Kennedy amendment. . . . While agencies are embracing \n     competition, focusing on core mission, and eliminating \n     barriers to entering the marketplace, this amendment does the \n     opposite. It would require the government to consider \n     reforming noncore activities that it doesn't have the skills \n     to do when entrepreneurs and their employees are ready, \n     willing and able to perform.\n\n  Finally, let me share one more letter, from Assistant Secretary of \nDefense Powell Moore. He says:\n\n       The Department of Defense strongly opposes an amendment to \n     be offered by Senator Kennedy that would restrict the \n     Department's ability to contract with the private sector. The \n     following information sheet outlines the Department of \n     Defense' views on the proposed Kennedy amendment.\n\n  Very briefly--and this is from the Department of Defense--the \namendment would increase costs to the Department by over $200 million a \nyear. By requiring 10-percent cost savings with no limitation, DOD will \nnot be able to take advantage of savings greater than $10 million but \nless than 10 percent.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield for a question on that cost point?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. That derives from the 10-percent differential, does it \nnot?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. WARNER. It does not include the costs of the hiring and the \ntraining and incalculable number of new Federal employees; am I not \ncorrect?\n  Mr. THOMAS. The Senator from Virginia is correct. Indeed, the \nSecretary says the added costs to which the Senator refers are likely \nto exceed $100 million per year in addition.\n  Mr. WARNER. In addition. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. THOMAS. He says further:\n\n       Less efficiency: The amendment would adversely impact \n     mission efficiencies and effectiveness.\n\n  I just got through saying we unanimously adopted the outsourcing \nbill, the FAIR bill. This amendment, according to the Department of \nDefense, would foster insourcing which would exacerbate the Federal \nhuman capital crisis we are now in, in this war on terrorism.\n  Finally, he indicates it preempts the congressional intent. This \namendment would preempt implementation of the recommendations of the \ncongressionally mandated, GAO-chaired, commercial activities panel.\n  I intend to spend a good deal more time talking about this as we have \nmore time after the vote. There are a number of others who wish to \nspeak as well, and I will say I will object to any certain time before \nnoon tomorrow for a vote on the Kennedy amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 3969\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has now been yielded back.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3969.\n  The clerk will now call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin), the \nSenator from Maryland (Ms. Mikulski), and the Senator from New Jersey \n(Mr. Torricelli) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nIllinois (Mr. Durbin) and the Senator from Maryland (Ms. Mikulski) \nwould each vote ``aye.''\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms), the Senator from Arkansas (Mr. Hutchinson), the Senator from \nAlaska (Mr. Murkowski), and the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nSantorum) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Akaka).

The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, is it clear that the matter has been \nreconsidered and laid on the table?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has been so ordered.\n\n[[Page S5936]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I just came down and voted, and I am not \naware of the parliamentary situation. But I wonder if it would be \nappropriate to get 5 minutes on a very urgent subject.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Surely.\n  Mr. REID. We see a number of people on the floor. We see the Senator \nfrom Kansas is here, the Senator from New Mexico, the Senator from \nArizona. And I know the two managers have some work to do on the bill. \nI am wondering how long the Senator from Kansas wishes to speak.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. About 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Is that on the pending amendment or some unrelated matter?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. On the pending amendment.\n  Mr. REID. On the pending amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. And Senator Domenici wants to speak.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Domenici wants to speak on an unrelated matter.\n  Mr. WARNER. And I believe my colleagues from Wyoming and Arizona want \nto speak on the pending amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. However you would like it. You would rather I speak on \nthe pending amendment?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from New Mexico may speak on whatever he \nwishes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I was just kidding.\n  Mr. REID. I just want to make sure we have a lot of conversation on \nthis amendment. I am sure we would allow the Senator from New Mexico to \nspeak as in morning business. Is that what the Senator wishes to do?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for 5 minutes--not on this--as in morning \nbusiness. And I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom New Mexico be recognized to speak as in morning business for 5 \nminutes, and that following his statement we turn to the pending \namendment, the Kennedy amendment, and that Senators then speak to their \nhearts' content on that matter.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I wonder if \nI might, as a manager, be recognized first in the order of those to be \nrecognized following the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. REID. That sounds entirely appropriate. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the comanager of the bill, the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, \nbe recognized following the statement by the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Domenici are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, with all due respect to my good friend and \nvalued member of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Kennedy, his \namendment, in my judgment, would do very serious damage to the \nDepartment of Defense, particularly to the ability of the Department to \ncontract quickly for essential services--the operative word being \nquickly. What now takes the Department weeks to contract for would take \nup to years if this amendment is adopted. As DOD wages a global war \nagainst terrorism, I and many others find it very hard to believe that \nthe Senate would even consider approving such legislation.\n  I understand the frustrations with the current A-76 process, which \ngoverns public-private competition of existing Federal work. That is \nwhy 2 years ago, as part of the fiscal year 2001 Defense Authorization \nAct the Congress established the Commercial Activities Panel, under the \nauspices of the GAO, to review and recommend ways to fix the A-76 \nprocess. This panel recently issued its recommendations. Those \nrecommendations should include replacing A-76--and the Presiding \nOfficer spent a lot of time on this issue and was very much involved in \nthe debates last year--with a process that relies on an existing \nFederal acquisition framework that emphasizes quality, best value, \nfairness, and transparency.\n  Let's give this initiative time to work. The legislation before us, \nhowever, would go directly counter to the recommendations of this \npanel--a panel comprised of members of the administration, industry, \nlabor, and the Comptroller General of the United States, who spent \nalmost 2 years analyzing the complexity of this subject. And now, if \nwe, the Senate, were to adopt this amendment, and indeed it would go to \nconference and somehow become law--which I seriously doubt--were we to \ngo on record at this time and adopt this amendment, we would be sort of \nignoring the good work taking over 2 years by a panel, which was \nestablished by this body.\n  The Senate needs more time to review the issue of public-private \nsector competitions, in light of the recommendations of this panel. We \nhave not yet held hearings on the recommendations which were released \nonly last month by the Commercial Activities Panel. The Governmental \nAffairs Committee and the Armed Services Committee should seriously \nreview the commission's recommendations and hear from other parties. \nIndeed, we could consider Senator Kennedy's legislation as part of that \nreview, as well as any other legislation that other Members of this \nbody may have. To consider this issue at this time would be to preempt \nthe work that should be and will be done by the committee.\n  At the appropriate time, I regret to say, I will offer a motion to \ntable the amendment of our distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, \nMr. Kennedy. If that motion fails, I will offer my own alternative that \nimplements the recent recommendations of the GAO Commercial Activities \nPanel to fix the A-76 process. I hope that will not be necessary \nbecause we should go through a series of hearings by the appropriate \noversight committees.\n  I believe Senator Thomas, likewise, has several other alternatives, \nand there may be other Members with amendments on our side. I hope we \ncan find a way at this point in time to respectfully decline to accept \nthe amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The amendment before us would arbitrarily require the government to \ncompete with the private sector, under the time consuming and expensive \nA-76 process, for the performance of commercial services--regardless of \nwhether there are any Federal workers to perform the work. In so doing, \nthis amendment would cripple government performance, undermine \ncompetition, exacerbate the federal human capital problem, and \ndevastate small businesses. This amendment overturns over 50 years of \nbipartisan policy mandates that the government should not compete with \nthe private sector for ``non-inherently governmental'' functions.\n  Under this amendment, almost every new contract, contract \nmodification, task order, renewal, or re-competition would have to \nundergo a lengthy public-private ``competition'' under the OMB Circular \nA-76--whether or not the government even has the right skills and \npersonnel to perform the work. The private sector and many in the \nFederal workforce, believe the process is too expensive, too complex, \nand unfair to all parties. Yet this amendment would require a vast \nincrease in A-76. DOD estimates this expansion would cost over $200 \nmillion a year, at a minimum.\n  By mandating A-76 competitions, this amendment would cause long \ndelays in the performance of defense services. Compared to most modern \ncompetitive procurements, which are completed in weeks or months, A-76 \ncompetitions take a minimum of 18 months and often as long as three \nyears or more to complete. Under the amendment, DOD would lose its \ncritical ability to swiftly procure innovative defense and homeland \nsecurity services and products necessary to prevail in the war against \nterrorism.\n  The advocates for this legislation say they have given DOD a waiver \nfrom the requirements of the bill. With over $60 billion in services \ncontracts a year there are just too many contracts for DOD to process \nwaivers at the Secretary of Defense or Assistant Secretary level. DOD's \nprocurement process is already too cumbersome. We do not need another \nstep in the process. As the top federal acquisition official, Angela \nStyles recently stated:\n\n       The proposed legislation would put at risk the Federal \n     Government's ability to acquire needed support services in \n     both the short and long term.\n\n\n[[Page S5937]]\n\n\n  The amendment would undermine the robust competition for government \nservice work that currently exists. The fact is that almost all of the \nwork that would be affected by this amendment is already routinely \ncompeted in a robust and aggressive marketplace. According to the \nFederal Procurement Data System, in FY00 72 percent of all service \ncontract actions--and more than 90 percent of all information \ntechnology contract actions--were subject to competition. Of the \nremainder, over 50 percent involved services--e.g., electricity or \nwater--for which there was only one available provider. By contrast, \nless than two percent of all service work performed by Federal \nemployees is subject to the competition of any kind. When Federal \nemployees are subjected to competition the savings have--according to \nDOD--consistently averaged 34 percent.\n  The amendment would devastate small businesses. Small businesses \naccount for 35 percent of Federal contract dollars. Yet the amendment \nwould exclude most small businesses--particularly woman-, minority-, \nand veteran-owned companies--from participating in service contracting, \nbecause of the added costs and time associated with the A-76 process, \nwhen compared to traditional procurements. Small businesses just don't \nhave the capital to wait several years to begin work. They would, in \neffect, be excluded from new Federal contracts under this amendment.\n  In general, the cumulative effect of the provisions of the Kennedy \namendment would add significant costs to Department of Defense \noperations. These costs would result from: (1) The vastly increased use \nof the burdensome A-76 process for contracting-out or contracting-in \ndecisions; (2) the delay of up to 3 years in providing essential \noperational support services because of the expanded A-76 requirements; \nand (3) a massive diversion of DOD administrative resources from \nmission critical support to administer a several fold increase in \nburdensome, labor-intensive A-76 studies.\n  I hope my colleagues will reach the conclusion that this amendment \ndoes not succeed in resolving the underlying problem the amendment is \ntrying to address--that is, how to structure public-private \ncompetitions that are fair, transparent, and protect the rights of \nFederal workers while ensuring that DOD receives quality solutions at \nthe best value to the taxpayer to meet its missions and \nresponsibilities in our fight against global terrorism.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Kennedy \namendment to the DOD authorization bill. When I first came into the \nSenate, I chaired a subcommittee within the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee that dealt with this issue. We held a number of hearings on \nthe topic of public-private competition. I wish to talk briefly about \nthis legislation and the background of it and why I don't think it is a \ngood idea to move forward on it at this time.\n  In 1998, Congress passed the Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act, \nthe FAIR Act. I was a strong supporter of this legislation, and it \npassed the Senate unanimously in 1998.\n  This piece of legislation was a compromise between the private sector \nand unions that, for the first time, codified a process to help assure \nproper implementation of the 47-year-old Federal policy that states:\n\n       The government should not be involved in commercial \n     activities.\n\n  That was a simple Government policy for 47 years, and the FACT Act \ncodified and fleshed out that simple statement, a statement with which \neverybody agreed.\n  The goal of the FAIR Act was to eliminate the Government's direct \ncompetition with the private sector--again, unanimously passed by this \nbody--while at the same time providing a better utilization of \ntaxpayers' dollars. The FAIR Act created a more cost-effective and \nstreamlined Federal Government and people agreed with that. Much of the \nFAIR Act was pushed forward by the Clinton administration.\n  The Kennedy amendment applies only to the Department of Defense. It \ndirectly impacts the FAIR Act. This amendment would create a two-tier \ncontracting system setting up different standards for DOD versus \ncivilian agencies. That is the first problem.\n  Next, this amendment would revise the steps that were made with \nenactment of the FAIR Act. That is the next problem with the amendment. \nThis is a policy that was unanimously agreed to by this body. The \nKennedy amendment, for the first time, would mandate the Federal \nGovernment compete with the private sector for work not currently being \nperformed by Federal employees.\n  The Kennedy amendment would increase the size and the cost of the \nFederal Government.\n  The amendment would adversely impact DOD's mission, efficiencies, and \neffectiveness because all service contracts would be significantly \ndelayed. If enacted, DOD would lose the flexibility it needs to \npurchase innovative solutions to improve our military's performance and \nnational security.\n  This amendment would increase the cost to the Department of Defense \nby over $200 million, not an insignificant sum at a time when we are \nlooking at deficit spending and trying to figure out ways to curtail \ndeficit spending and get back into surpluses.\n\n  Furthermore, this amendment would complicate DOD's procurement \nprocess, cost the taxpayers more money, and increase dramatically the \nnumber of DOD employees. This is not necessarily the direction in which \nmost people desire to go.\n  The amendment would hurt small businesses by making it harder for \nthem to compete in the business process. It goes against longstanding \ngoals of both Democratic and Republican administrations.\n  The Kennedy amendment ignores the progress made under the Clinton \nadministration's policy in its reinventing Government initiative of \nstreamlining the Government procurement process.\n  The Kennedy amendment also is counter to the efforts by the Bush \nadministration aimed at performance-based contracting and increasing \nGovernment efficiencies.\n  The Bush administration opposes this amendment. Secretary Rumsfeld \nsaid:\n\n       The Kennedy amendment would increase Department cost by \n     requiring public-private competitions for new functions and \n     for previously contracted work already subjected to market \n     competition. It would also adversely impact mission \n     effectiveness by delaying contract awards for needed \n     services. The proposed amendment would increase Department \n     costs and dull our warfighting edge.\n\n  This matter is not a union versus nonunion or labor-management issue. \nSeveral groups have come out already against the Kennedy amendment, \nincluding the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Laborers' International Union \nof North America, International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship \nBuilders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers.\n  A similar amendment offered by Representatives Allen and Andrews was \ndefeated by the House when it was considered during its version of the \nDefense authorization bill for 2003.\n  As we face the challenges of homeland security and national defense, \nkeeping our borders, economy, and society safe and free, we need to \ncreate more efficient and effective partnerships between the public and \nprivate sectors. Now is not the time to restrict the Department of \nDefense's competitive sourcing policies with this amendment.\n  I think this is an ill-advised procedure for us to enter into at this \ntime. It goes against the longstanding bipartisan effort to not have \nthe Federal Government competing with the private sector. There is no \nreason for us to go into this at this time. It really will be harmful \nto our overall operation. For those reasons, I oppose the Kennedy \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Kansas yields \nthe floor.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Certainly.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if I may have a colloquy with Senator \nWarner for a moment.\n  Mr. President, I wonder if Senator Warner and I can agree on the \nfollowing order: That after Senator Thomas has finished, then Senator \nKyl be recognized perhaps at about 7 o'clock, and after Senator Kyl has \nfinished, we go into a period for morning business with Senators to be \nrecognized for not\n\n[[Page S5938]]\n\nmore than 10 minutes each; that as soon as Senator Kyl is recognized, \nthat will be it for the day. We will do our cleared amendments in the \nmorning rather than trying to do them tonight.\n  We will try to proceed in the morning after we have had an \nopportunity to review the amendment that Senator Warner has shared with \nme now relative to missile defense.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am basically in concurrence, and then we \nwill be clear on the understanding that at the conclusion of the debate \nby those Senators designated, we will conclude all work on the \nauthorization bill and go into morning business, subject, of course, to \nwhatever the leaders wish to take place.\n  I have provided the distinguished chairman with the proposal on \nmissile defense that I have. It is my hope we can debate that tomorrow, \nestablish a time agreement giving all a reasonable amount of time for \ndebate, spend some time in the morning, some time in the afternoon, and \nhave a vote tomorrow afternoon, so we can then move into Wednesday in \nthe expectation we can conclude this bill on Wednesday.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is surely our hope we conclude the bill as early as \npossible this week, but I will reserve judgment on the amendment \nrelative to missile defense that Senator Warner shared with me until \nafter we have had a chance to read it and study it.\n  I thank Senator Warner always for his courtesy. He is wonderful to \nwork with. We will try to get back with him either tonight by phone or \nfirst thing in the morning relative to a possible procedure tomorrow.\n  As he stated, after Senator Thomas and Senator Kyl have completed \ntheir remarks tonight relative to the Kennedy amendment--I ask \nunanimous consent that after these two Senators have finished their \nremarks relative to the Kennedy amendment, there be a period for \nmorning business, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes \neach.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Thomas, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair, and I thank the floor managers of the \nbill for arranging this time and setting it up for this evening.\n  Mr. President, I wish to comment a little more on this bill. It is \none that I believe is very important. It is very important because it \nchanges what we have done in the past. It changes the concepts and the \nprinciples that we have had for a very long time.\n  I suppose there are always different ideas about where we ought to be \ngoing in Government. I am one who believes that those activities that \nare not inherently governmental certainly ought to be available for the \nprivate sector and that, indeed, we ought to try to contain the size of \nthe public sector--I think all of us would say we want to do that--and \nto use the competition among the private sector to get the most \nefficient task done for us that we possibly can.\n  Of course, as has been mentioned, this has been the policy of the \nFederal Government for a very long time. Frankly, it has not worked \nvery well. We have not been able to find a way to identify those \nissues, those activities that are nongovernmental, or at least not \ninherently governmental, that could be contracted out. We have not gone \nthrough the system. So we finally, in 1998, passed another bill that \nprovided for the identification of various activities. Unfortunately, \nthere was not much done with it. The administrations were not very \ninterested in doing that.\n  As has been mentioned, we now have some principles that have been put \nin place that will provide for a more efficient way of moving toward \nthe concept with which I think most of us would agree, and that is we \nought to do in the private sector, in the competitive sector, all those \nactivities that are appropriate. If that is our view, then this \namendment is inconsistent with that view and, indeed, makes it much \nmore difficult for us to accomplish that.\n  For example, these are some of the things that were set forth by the \nDefense Department that they believe are difficult and that should \ncause us not to pass this amendment that is before us. First, it would \nhave more requirements. The amendment would significantly increase the \nnumbers of public-private competition by requiring each competition for \nnew work and work already under contract without any benefit to the \ntaxpayer or war fight. Private sector competition already provides \nsavings and efficiencies in the work that is covered by this amendment. \nCertainly, costs ought to be something that we are always aware of, but \nas we get into this business of terrorism and all this spending that we \nmust have, then increased costs seem to me to be even more important.\n  The amendment would increase costs to the Department. This is \ninformation brought forth by the Defense Department. It would increase \ncosts to the Department by over $200 million a year. Cost for \nadditional competitions is likely to exceed $100 million or $4,000 per \nposition. By requiring 10-percent cost savings, with no limitation, DOD \nwill not be able to take advantage of savings greater than $10 million \nbut less than 10 percent. Added costs would likely exceed $100 million \na year in addition to what is already there.\n  Less efficiency: The amendment would adversely impact mission \neffectiveness and efficiencies. Awarding contracts for services will be \nsignificantly delayed under the contract. The average time to conduct a \npublic-private competition is 25 months, whereas the average time to \naward a competitive contract with private firms is less than half of \nthat.\n  Time is important in the defense industry. We are in a time when we \nneed to make changes quickly.\n  Because contractors must commit more resources to pursue public-\nprivate competitions due to longer lead times and more involved \nprocess, there would be fewer competitors on such competitions, thus \nlimiting DOD's access. So it would result in the opposite of what we \nsay we have been for, for a very long time, and that is more \ninsourcing.\n  The amendment would foster insourcing, which would exacerbate the \nFederal human capital crises. We talk a lot about the military and what \nwe are going to do and how we fulfill the numbers that are necessary. \nHere is an opportunity to make that even more difficult and require \nthat we do that.\n  DOD does not have idle capacity available to compete for either new \nwork or work currently being performed by contractors. If DOD were to \nwin new work or already contracted work, hiring would have to increase \nsignificantly at a time when we are already faced with difficulties.\n  The Government personnel system is not nimble enough to hire or move \nlarge numbers of personnel on short notice. This is the assessment of \nthe Department of Defense of themselves.\n  Having DOD personnel perform new work or work previously contracted \nout is not the best use of limited defense resources. Further, they say \nit preempts congressional intent. Well, we are the ones, of course, who \nought to know that.\n  It has been indicated that this is supported by the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce. But here is one that is kind of interesting. It is also \nsupported by a letter from the Laborers International Union of North \nAmerica. This is a labor union that is opposed to this amendment and \nhas two pages of materials as to why they are opposed.\n  Then, of course, I suppose not unexpectedly, there is a letter from \nthe Contract Services Association of America. These are the people who \nare involved. These are the people whom we have been seeking to give \nmore opportunities, to make this work, than they have had in the past.\n\n  It is interesting how no more real attention has been paid to this \nthan the number of people and organizations that have come out in \nopposition to the amendment. This says: Attention, Members of the U.S. \nSenate--and it lists national security officials and experts, about 15 \nof them: Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, OMB Director Mitchell \nDaniels, the Under Secretary of Defense, a number of admirals, a whole \nlist of people who say this is not a good thing for us to do; organized \nlabor, the Laborers International Union of North America, AFL-CIO; \nSeafarers International Union, AFL-CIO; Industrial Technical \nProfessional Employees Union, International Union of Operating \nEngineers, International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron\n\n[[Page S5939]]\n\nShip Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers, and Helpers, and others, as well \nas small minority- and women-owned businesses. It is quite a large \nlist.\n  So it is interesting, and I think very important, to recognize the \nnumber of groups that have indeed expressed their opposition to the \namendment we are seeking to deal with now.\n  This time, of course, will be very important. We have some others who \nwant to speak who will be coming out a little later to speak, as well \nas tomorrow. Again, there are many reasons that have been set forth as \nto why the Kennedy amendment should be stopped. The amendment would \narbitrarily require the Federal Government to compete with the private \nsector for performance of noninherently government services, whether or \nnot there is an incumbent Federal workforce performing the act. It is \ntotally beyond what we sought to do unanimously in the Senate, and we \nare very interested in seeking to keep that from happening.\n  Over 50 years of bipartisan policy has mandated the Government should \nnot compete with the private sector for noninherently governmental \nfunctions. Nevertheless, this amendment would require every new \ncontract modification, task order, or renewal undergo a lengthy public-\nprivate competition under OMB Circular A-76, whether or not the \nGovernment even has the requisite skills or the personnel required to \nperform the work.\n  Today, less than 2 percent of all Government services contracted are \nconducted under A-76 because only that small portion of Government has \nbeen involved in the incumbent Federal workforce. So this changes \nthings dramatically and not for the better. The amendment would cripple \nGovernment performance. The amendment would undermine robust \ncompetition for opportunities that already exist. So there are a lot of \nthings that are involved. One of them has been that the A-76 process \nhas been one that has needed help, and continues to.\n  For those who do not know, the Office of Management and Budget's \nCircular A-76 is the Government's policy that is used to determine who \ncan best provide products and services it needs. The circular defines \nFederal policy for determining whether commercial activity should be \noutsourced to commercial sources or kept within the Federal Government.\n  OMB Circular A-76 was first issued in 1966 and has been revised \nnumerous times since. The A-76 process is very formal and intricate, \noften a lengthy process for conducting public-private competitions. In \norder to win an A-76 competition, an outside proposal must be at least \n10 percent less than the Government proposal. The average A-76 study \nrequires approximately 30 months to be completed. For years, \nindividuals within the Government and the private sector \nhave criticized the A-76 process.\n\n  Two years ago, the Congress called upon the General Accounting Office \nto evaluate the A-76 process because of concerns about its \neffectiveness. A GAO panel unanimously agreed to 10 principles. In \nparticular, the panel agreed unanimously that public-private \ncompetition should not be mandated, particularly for already contracted \nor new work. However, that is exactly what the Kennedy amendment \nproposes. The amendment goes against the recommendations of the GAO \npanel. In fact, Senator Kennedy's amendment would derail the GAO \npanel's recommendations and therefore would cause us a great deal of \nslowness and indeed potentially losing the idea of the reconsideration \nand the changing of A-76.\n  The goals of the FAIR Act were very clear. They were to create more \ncost efficiency and streamline the Federal Government, to eliminate the \nGovernment's direct competition with the private sector. This amendment \nwould in fact do very serious damage to the FAIR Act. The amendment, \nfor the first time, would mandate the Federal Government compete with \nthe private sector. The Kennedy amendment would drastically grow \nGovernment workers. Page 12 of the amendment allows for unrestricted \ngrowth. I can hardly understand why anyone would offer such an \namendment in this wartime situation where the numbers are very \ndifficult in the military.\n  Furthermore, as we have mentioned, the amendment would increase costs \nto the Department by over $200 million, which would complicate the \nprocess. So it is basically a step backwards in terms of what we have \nbeen seeking to accomplish over a period of time. I think the goals \nthat have been out there have been shared by both Democrat and \nRepublican administrations. The movement was forward in the last \nadministration, slowed at the end, but now we have more movement in \nthis administration than in the past to move toward private-sector \nactivities. The administration is opposed to this amendment, and a \nsimilar amendment was offered in the House of Representatives and was \ndefeated in the same authorization bill.\n  I hope we can take a long look at what this means in terms of the \nprinciples we have established in the past and are seeking to continue \nto establish.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, this is a very important bill, the Defense \nauthorization.\n  I ask if there is an order in effect as to how debate will be handled \nfor the rest of the evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Kyl is to be recognized, and following \nhis speech there will be a period of morning business.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Kyl is not here, so I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. We talk a lot about the national defense of this country, \nand rightfully so. There is something happening today in America that \nnecessitates our attention. It deals also with the national security; \nthat is, what are we going to do about passenger rail service in this \ncountry? That is part of the security of this country. We are dismal \nfailures if we let this country have no passenger rail service. If \nthere were ever an opportunity to talk about how it is important we \nhave a good passenger rail service, it is now, during this time of \nterrorism.\n  What has happened since September 11? Passengers have boarded the \nAmtrak trains 47 percent more than they did before September 11. Why? \nBecause they feel more secure in a train than in a plane.\n  Every place in the world where they have train service it is \nsubsidized by the Government. It is interesting to note when Amtrak \ncame into being in 1970 it was done so because the private sector could \nnot make any money hauling people.\n  I come from Las Vegas, NV--the tourist destination, some say, of the \nworld. Las Vegas is separated by 250 miles from Los Angeles. The two \nairports--Los Angeles International and McCarran Field, Las Vegas--have \nmore people coming into them than any airport in the country--more than \nO'Hare. We are the sixth busiest airport as far as takeoffs and \nlandings in America. As far as people coming into the airport each day, \nthe only airport with more people is Los Angeles International.\n  The airports in Las Vegas and Los Angeles are jammed. The freeway \nbetween Los Angeles and Las Vegas is jammed, I-15. We need a passenger \nrail service.\n  What are we talking about doing? Going out of business, instead of \nincreasing travel between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, the two busiest \nairports. Rather than relieve congestion, we are talking about going \nout of business. That is disgraceful.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am very pleased my friend has raised this issue of \nAmtrak rail passenger service in this country, a system owned by the \nAmerican people. I am glad to see one of our leaders on this issue on \nthe floor, Senator Carper. He and Senator Biden have been extraordinary \non this issue.\n  I am here to join because a lot of people think it is just a \nNortheast issue. If you look at California--and we are highly \nimpacted--in the year 2001 we had 8 million passenger trips in \nCalifornia related to Amtrak.\n  My friend is right on the issue of national security. But it is not \nonly national security, which is huge; it is also economic security for \nour people.\n  Mr. REID. And I respond to my friend, economic security is national \nsecurity.\n\n[[Page S5940]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely. Right now, I am very concerned about a \ndoubledipper recession. I am very concerned we may have real problems \nin this country with unemployment. We see what is happening in the last \n17 months since this administration took over, and what is happening to \nthe crime rate. It is going up. One of the reasons it is going up, \nexperts say, is that the economy is bad. We know we are not spending \nmoney to put cops on the beat. That hurts.\n  We have a quality-of-life situation and it is spiraling out of \ncontrol.\n  I say to my friend, on all fronts, this is a national security issue, \nwhether or not we say we want to have a rail system as does every other \ngreat nation in the world. We are playing around with this issue and it \nhas to stop. It is bad management on the part of this administration to \nbe taking us to the 11th hour on this deal. We could have thousands of \npeople unemployed, thousands of people stranded, who cannot get to \nwork, shutting down a system that could be a backup to our air system, \nespecially at a time of terrorist threats.\n\n  My question to my friend is this: Is it true this Congress voted to \ngive $15 billion to the airlines, $5 billion of that in a direct check, \nand then loan guarantees for the rest because we believe it is very \nimportant to our economy, to our national security, to keep travel \ngoing? Is it not ironic that when the people's own train system needs \n$200 million to keep it going, we cannot get a direct answer from this \nadministration, and they are taking it to this 11th hour?\n  Mr. REID. I respond to the distinguished Senator from California, the \nneighbor of the State of Nevada, yes, we did give money to the \nairlines. I am glad we did. We provided money to help them stay in \nbusiness. We still have a large pot of money to which airlines can \napply.\n  I say to my friend from California, we help airlines every day, \nairports every day. Highways are Federal construction. Ninety percent \nof the construction that takes place in Nevada and California is \nFederal money; 8 million passenger rides in California last year with \nAmtrak. If the system were better, it would be triple. There could be \n24 million passengers in that largest State in the Union.\n  We have such an antiquated system in most places we cannot run high-\nspeed rail. I do not apologize for my support for Amtrak. Nevada does \nnot get a lot of benefit. I hope we get more in the year to come. If it \ncloses down, we certainly will not.\n  I have heard people ask: What benefit do I get out of Amtrak? The \nState of California and the State of Nevada have the Hoover Dam which \nwas built in the 1930s with Federal dollars. Those Federal dollars do \nnot help much of the rest of the country. They help California, \nArizona, and Nevada principally. But it is a great program that the \ntaxpayers helped to provide that is good for our country. Amtrak is \ngood for our country.\n  How can we have a country, which we all love so much, the only \nsuperpower left in the world, and not have a passenger rail service? We \nshould be embarrassed about the passenger rail service we have today. \nIt is pretty bad. But we love it. We want to make it better.\n  I say to the administration, if they are listening: Fine, if you want \nto bail us out with a few million dollars to keep us going, that is \nfine, but that will not do the trick. We need a long-term plan for \nAmtrak, a plan that spends money in improving the tracks.\n  I am in favor of high-speed rail between California and Nevada, \nbetween Los Angeles and Las Vegas. It would increase productivity, it \nwould alleviate the burden at our airports and on our highways, and \nmake a more productive society.\n  I appreciate the statements of the Senator from California. I see my \nfriend from Delaware in the Chamber. He has been a leader in this \nfield.\n  I appreciate their interest and support for this program that people \nare trying to let die. I feel so bad about that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend and my colleagues who may be \nlistening, during wartime I remember a bumper sticker that said \n``Imagine Peace.'' It was a pretty simple thing, but you really have to \nthink what something could be.\n  We could really imagine this country connected by a rail system that \nserves all our people. What an improvement in the quality of life; what \nan improvement in the economy; what an improvement in air quality; what \na better way for us to go when we are competing for economic dollars. \nThis is an efficiency plan.\n  So whether it is the economy or national security, we do need some \nbold leadership. I am glad my friend raised this issue. We certainly \nhave it from my friend from Delaware. I am glad he is on the floor \ntonight. I am going to do everything I can.

Madam President, I do not believe any of the Senators who \nare on the floor at this time were serving in the House or the Senate \nwhen Amtrak was created. It was created in 1970 and it was created \nafter an extended debate which found none of the private railroads in \nthis country wanted to continue to provide passenger rail service. They \nwanted out of the business and they got out. They convinced the \nCongress and then the President, Richard Nixon, that they should be \nable to buy stock in this entity called Amtrak, they should turn over a \nlot of their rolling stock--their locomotives and their passenger cars \nor dining cars, the whole Northeast corridor from Washington to Boston, \nrepair shops, train stations--to this new entity, Amtrak, to see if \nthey could make it go as a quasi-governmental entity whereas for years \nthe private sector had not been able to make a go of it.\n  Lo and behold, 32 years later Amtrak has not been able to figure out \nhow to make money, how to make a profit doing what the private \nrailroads could not make a profit doing in the 1970s or 1960s or the \nyears before that; that is, carrying people.\n  Last Thursday here on the floor I talked a bit about all those other \ncountries around the world that offer terrific passenger train service, \nwhether it is Britain or France or Spain or Italy, Scandinavia or \nGermany--or over the other side of the world, Asian countries such as \nJapan, where people can go in trains that run at 200 miles an hour and \ncan actually write on the trains and people can read your writing--\nsomething no one is able to do with mine when I ride the rails with \nAmtrak. They can put a cup of coffee on the table and the coffee is \nstill like it would be on this table before me.\n  The reason why they have such good train service in those countries \nis because they make it a national priority. They believe it is in \ntheir national interest to have good passenger rail service.\n  Some of those countries are more densely populated than our own, but \nas time goes by we are becoming more densely populated, too. I said \nlast week that some 75 percent of Americans today live within 50 miles \nof one of our coasts. As time goes by, we are going to become more \ndensely populated. Those dense populations provide for a number of \nproblems: congestion on our highways, congestion in our airports, the \nfouling of our air. As we all climb into our cars, trucks, and vans to \ngo from one place to the other and then fill them up with gas, we \nimport a lot of the oil we refine into gasoline and we end up with a \nhuge trade deficit, about a third of which is attributable to imported \noil.\n  Part of the reason so many of those other countries put so much of \ntheir\n\n[[Page S5941]]\n\nmoney, so much of their resources into their passenger rail system is \nnot because of nostalgia. They do not pine for the days when people \nrode the trains from coast to coast. They do it because it is in their \nnaked self-interest to have good passenger rail service.\n  It is in our naked self-interest to have good passenger rail service \nas well. As a former Governor, I served on the Amtrak Board appointed \nby the President, confirmed by the Senate, and I served there as a \nmember of the board of directors for 4 years. There were a number of \ntimes during the time I served on the board--and a number of times \nsince--that Amtrak has run short of cash. They negotiated with a \nconsortium of private lenders and got enough money to carry them \nthrough their tough patch and when the next Federal appropriation comes \nthrough or the ridership peaks in one of the peak ridership periods for \nthe summer or Thanksgiving or Christmas or the other holidays, they pay \noff the loans.\n\n  Amtrak is endeavoring to arrange a bridge loan from a consortium of \nprivate banks to carry them through to the end of this fiscal year. \nTheir ability to negotiate that loan fell apart with the announcement \nof the administration's restructuring plan for Amtrak, which is not so \nmuch a restructuring plan for Amtrak but it is, frankly, the end, the \ndemise of Amtrak as we know it.\n  With that having been done and the inability to negotiate with the \nprivate lending consortium, I think in large part because of the \nannouncement of the restructuring plan for Amtrak by the \nadministration, the administration has some responsibility to step to \nthe plate and to provide--as they can under law; they have the \ndiscretion under the law--a loan guarantee so Amtrak can go ahead with \nthis negotiation with the private bankers. They ought to do that.\n  When we get past this very difficult time--and I want to tell you if \nAmtrak does shut down, it is not because everybody rides Amtrak but \nbecause Amtrak is very involved in commuter operations. Amtrak runs the \nentire Northeast corridor. Electricity is sold to the commuter trains. \nThe commuter trains use Penn Station. Amtrak is involved in the \nMidwest--we have a colleague here from Chicago--in helping run the \ncommuter operations there, and California. It is not just the Northeast \ncorridor. It is throughout the country. A shutdown, especially a hasty \nshutdown, will create havoc, not necessarily because of the people who \nrun Amtrak trains but all the people who depend on Amtrak and maybe \ndon't know it. They depend on Amtrak to get to work every day and to \nget home.\n  Let me close with this thought, if I could. When we get through this \ndifficult time--and we need to, and I hope the administration steps up \nto the plate and says we have some responsibility and acts to discharge \nthose responsibilities--when we get through this, that carries us to \nthe next fiscal year. We need to determine as a country, with a healthy \ndebate with the administration fully engaged, what we are going to do \nfor passenger rail service in America. What will taxpayers support? \nWhat will Congress and the administration support? That debate is one \nin which I look forward to participating.\n  I think passenger rail going forward will depend, in no small part, \non our willingness, and that of the administration, to find a dedicated \nsource of capital funding. Since Amtrak's creation 32 years ago, there \nhas never been adequate capital support for the railroad. There has \nnever been capital support.\n  We all know that railroading is capital intensive. There needs to be \na dedicated source of capital funding. My colleagues will hear me say \nthat more in the months to come. In my judgment, that is the key. If we \nsupport passenger rail service, we have to provide the capital to \nsupport it.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Madam President.\n  If the Senator from New Jersey wishes to speak for any period of \ntime, I will go ahead and take my right.

Madam President, I rise to reinforce some of the dialog \nwe have had on the floor with regard to Amtrak. This is a major \neconomic issue for our Nation--not just the Northeast corridor.\n  We have enormous numbers of interconnected elements of our economy \nwhich are dependent on the functioning of inner-city rail \ntransportation, and certainly in the Northeast corridor where I come \nfrom, the most densely populated State in the Nation. There are almost \n300,000 commuters a day using Amtrak or Amtrak-related facilities that \nmove in and out of Penn Station and the New York metropolitan region. \nThere are 82,000 daily commuters in New Jersey traffic.\n  These folks are involved in the financial affairs of this Nation. We \nare going to create havoc in operations in our metropolitan regions of \nNew York City if we have a shutdown of this highway transportation. I \nthink it is absolutely essential that we get long-term Amtrak reform.\n  What I want to speak about tonight is that we need not create a \ncrisis with a short-term shutdown, which is going to impact an enormous \nnumber of innocent bystanders, to get to long-term reform. The \nPresident, the Transportation Department, and the Congress need to sit \ndown and put together a long-term plan with regard to how we are going \nto reform Amtrak.\n  I don't think it should be done at the expense of a part of our \ncountry that is already suffering. It would spread across the country \nand undermine the confidence of our already shaken economic expansion. \nWe have seen enormous erosion in a whole series of different levels--\nthe stock market being the most obvious reminder, but at levels that \nare approaching where we were right after September 11. It strikes me \nthat we don't need to throw another log on the fire and undermine the \neconomic security of our Nation.\n\n  That is why I think we need to have a short-term solution with loan \nguarantees, with the administration and Congress working together to \nimplement a solution to keep this railroad running. We don't need a \ntrain ride. What we need to do is make sure we are supportive of our \neconomy.\n  I am very fearful that if we don't move forward with this short-run \nsolution, we may never get to the long-run reform of Amtrak, which will \nbe deteriorating substantially in the interim while it is shut down.\n  Let me give you two facts. It costs $50 million to shut this entity \ndown and $200 million to keep it running for the remainder of the year. \nIt would cost almost $1 billion to bring Amtrak back and operating if \nit were shut down. That is on a nationwide basis.\n  I think that is too much of an investment to make in a risky \nproposition of getting to reform without the kind of debate we have \nhad. I hope we can do that on a thoughtful, measured basis in the days \nand weeks ahead in this 107th Congress. I don't think it should be \nformulated on the basis of a crisis brought about by a temporary \nshutdown.\n  I want to make sure that I am registered very strongly for the people \nof New Jersey, for the people of the metropolitan New York region, and \nfor the Nation in support of our economy by making sure that Amtrak \ncontinues to run until we have a thoughtful, long-term solution.\n  I thank my colleague from Arizona. I appreciate it. I hope I stayed \nunder 4 minutes. I will come back on another day.\n\n[[Page S5942]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, by way of introduction, my remarks will \nprimarily be in support of an amendment that will be offered by the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, the \nSenator from Virginia, tomorrow to restore missile defense funding that \nwas cut in the Armed Services Committee.\n  I wanted to note that this afternoon the President advised both \nSenator McCain and I that he would be traveling to our home State of \nArizona tomorrow--specifically to the town of Show Low which is under \nthreat of this raging wildfire we have all seen and read about--and he \ngraciously offered to allow us to accompany him on that trip. But, \nobviously, the importance of this Defense authorization bill--\nspecifically, the votes we will have tomorrow, including an effort to \nrestore funding for the missile defense portion of the bill--requires \nthat we remain.\n  I am going to speak to the issue that will involve his visit to \nArizona tomorrow, why these raging wildfires don't need to continue to \ndevastate our country, what we can do about it, and what we need to do \nabout it as a country at the conclusion of my remarks on the Defense \nbill. I will address my comments first to this bill which is before the \nSenate, and which we will be considering this week.\n  It seems to me that there is a strange disconnect between recent \ndevelopments in the world and some of the contents of the bill that we \nare considering.\n  For example, in early May, Iran--newly dubbed by the State Department \nas the No. 1 terrorist nation in the world--conducted a successful test \nof its 800-plus-mile-range Shahab III missile. There are some reports \nthat Iran is now set to begin domestic production of the Shahab III \nwhich will be able to reach Israel, as well as U.S. troops deployed in \nthe Middle East and South Asia.\n\n  On May 7, the Associated Press, citing an administration official, \nreported that Iran is continuing the development of a longer range \nmissile, the Shahab IV, with an estimated range of 1,200 to 1,800 \nmiles. The Shahab IV will be able to reach deep into Europe.\n  That means that the fanatical mullahs in Tehran will be able to put a \nmultitude of U.S. allies and our troops within striking distance of \ntheir missiles and weapons of mass destruction.\n  We have also just witnessed one of the scariest standoffs in recent \ndecades with India and Pakistan angrily pointing their nuclear-tipped \nmissiles at each other.\n  These developments represent a dramatic increase in the worldwide \nmissile threat.\n  You might think that the United States would therefore want to \naccelerate its effort to build a defense against such weapons. But the \nbill before us today would seriously hamper our ability to do exactly \nthat. This is not something that the American people will stand for.\n  This is why I believe that tomorrow it is incumbent upon the Members \nof this body to listen to their constituents, to listen to the \nPresident of the United States, to look at the events around the world, \nand to reconnect our policy here in the Senate to the realities of the \nworld around us.\n  This bill makes very deep and damaging cuts to the President's \nproposed budget for missile defense. Unless remedied, those cuts will \nseriously limit our ability to end our current--and let me say our \nunacceptable--vulnerabilities to ballistic missile attack.\n  As I noted, the threat from ballistic missiles continues to grow.\n  In addition to the two examples I mentioned, consider this: Today, \nthere are nearly three dozen countries that either have or are \ndeveloping ballistic missiles of increasing range and sophistication. \nThat includes Iran's fellow ``axis of evil'' partners--or members, I \nshould say--Iraq and North Korea, as well as the terrorist regimes of \nSyria and Libya.\n  Let us take a look at some of these developments, which, unless \nindicated otherwise, are taken straight from the December 2001 National \nIntelligence Estimate on Foreign Ballistic Missiles. That is the \nestimate of our intelligence community about this threat.\n  North Korea, despite the moratorium on flight testing that it is \nsupposedly adhering to, continues its development of long-range \nmissiles. According to press accounts and administration officials, \nNorth Korea has recently conducted rocket motor tests of these \nmissiles.\n\n  In fact, North Korea's Taepo Dong 2 missile, which is capable of \nreaching the United States with a nuclear-weapon-sized payload, may now \nbe ready for flight testing.\n  As to Iraq, despite U.N. sanctions, Baghdad has been able to maintain \nthe infrastructure and expertise necessary to develop longer range \nmissiles.\n  Its Al-Samoud missile, with a 60 to 90-mile range, probably will be \ndeployed soon.\n  And Iraq retains a covert force of scud-variant missiles, launchers, \nand conventional, chemical, and biological warheads.\n  Not to forget about China, the intelligence community assesses that \nit could begin deploying its 5,000-mile-range DF-31 missile during the \nfirst half of this decade. That means essentially any time now. China's \neven longer range mobile missile, the DF-41, could be deployed in the \nlatter half of the decade.\n  China also maintains a robust force of medium-range CSS-5 missiles \nwhich can reach our troops in Japan and Korea.\n  Of course, China continues to add to its arsenal of short-range \nmissiles which already number in the several hundreds and are deployed \nopposite Taiwan.\n  According to the intelligence community--and I am quoting now--\n\n       China's leaders calculate that conventionally armed \n     ballistic missiles add a potent new dimension to Chinese \n     military capabilities, and they are committed to continue \n     fielding them at a rapid pace. Beijing's growing short-range \n     ballistic missile force provides China with a military \n     capability that avoids the political and practical \n     constraints associated with the use of nuclear-armed \n     missiles. The latest Chinese short-range ballistic missiles \n     provide a survivable and effective conventional strike force \n     and expand conventional ballistic missile coverage.\n\n  Even the terrorists are getting into the act. According to a variety \nof news sources, some of which have quoted U.S. and Israeli officials, \nIran and Syria have supplied Lebanon's Hezbollah terrorist organization \nwith Fajr-5 missiles, which, at 40 to 50 miles, can reach deeper into \nIsrael than any rockets Hezbollah has fired so far. One press account \nstated further that Hezbollah is assembling chemical warheads for these \nmissiles.\n  These developments, among others, led to the following conclusions in \nthe December 2001 National Intelligence Estimate:\n  One, short- and medium-range ballistic missiles, particularly if \narmed with weapons of mass destruction, already pose a significant \nthreat overseas to U.S. interests, military forces, and allies.\n  Two, proliferation of ballistic-missile-related technologies, \nmaterials, and expertise--especially by Russian, Chinese, and North \nKorean entities--has enabled emerging missile states to accelerate \ndevelopment timelines for their missile programs.\n  In other words, this is making the point that instead of having to \nalways indigenously develop a missile capability, a country can now buy \nthese literally readymade missiles from countries such as China, North \nKorea, and Russia.\n  Three, most intelligence community agencies project that, before \n2015, the United States most likely will face ICBM threats from North \nKorea and Iran, and possibly from Iraq, as well as from the existing \nICBM forces of China and, of course, Russia.\n\n  Four, the probability that a missile with a weapon of mass \ndestruction will be used against U.S. forces or interests is higher \ntoday than during most of the cold war, and will continue to grow as \nthe capabilities of potential adversaries mature.\n  After September 11, we dare not willfully remain vulnerable to these \nthreats. But that is essentially the impact of the partisan cuts that \nwere made to this bill when it was before the Armed Services Committee.\n  Of course, there are those who suggest that the September 11 attacks \ndemonstrated that the major threat to\n\n[[Page S5943]]\n\nthis country comes from relatively low-tech attacks: suitcase bombs and \nthe like. But what September 11 really demonstrated is that our enemies \nhave the will and the ruthlessness to exploit our weaknesses in any way \nthey can. In other words, if we are weak in a given area, that will be \nan area attempted to be exploited. Therefore, if we have no missile \ndefense, is there any question that a potential adversary would see the \nability to strike us with ballistic missiles as a potential area for \ntheir policy?\n  The new types of threats we face from terrorists and the rogue \nregimes that support them cannot be dealt with solely through \ntraditional deterrence. President Bush was right when he recently \nremarked at West Point:\n\n       Deterrence--the promise of massive retaliation against \n     nations--means nothing against shadowy terrorist networks \n     with no nation or citizens to defend.\n\n  In addition, I make this point. I do not think the majority of the \nIranian or Iraqi people or Syrian people detest the United States or \nwish to attack us with nuclear weapons.\n  If tyrants like Saddam Hussein, who dictatorially rule some of those \ncountries, were to use a weapon of mass destruction against our ally \nIsrael, or even against U.S. troops abroad, I am not sure the President \nof the United States, in those circumstances, would want to retaliate \nwith a nuclear weapon in the middle of Baghdad, let's say, or some \nother Iraqi city.\n  Clearly, we would rain massive retaliation upon Saddam Hussein, but \nwe would have to think very carefully about a nuclear deterrent in a \nsituation such as that.\n  So traditional deterrence may or may not be an appropriate response \nto a terrorist attack. The bottom line is, we are not always dealing \nwith rational actors. To depend on nuclear deterrence alone with a \ndictator like Saddam Hussein, who, remember, used chemical weapons \nagainst his own people, or a terrorist like Osama bin Laden would be to \nplace American lives in the hands of madmen. That, itself, is mad when \nwe have the ability to defend against such an attack.\n  That alternative, of course, is to develop and deploy missile \ndefenses. They will add to our options in terms of a crisis. Defenses \nagainst missiles will help the United States avoid being frozen into \ninaction by the threat of a missile attack.\n  This is the threat of blackmail: A country that acquires a nuclear \nweapon and the ballistic missile capability to deliver it will be in a \nmuch stronger position to dictate what it wants around the world--or to \nprevent the United States from acting--than one that does not. It \nreduces our options significantly.\n  Just imagine the impact on our decision to go to war against Saddam \nHussein in 1991 had he been able to threaten the United States or our \nallies with nuclear missiles. Missile defense will also reduce the \nincentives for proliferation by devaluing offensive missiles. If a \nrogue actor views missiles as likely to be effective because of our \nlack of defenses, they will be developed. If, on the other hand, we \nhave defenses, then they will obviously be less inclined to spend as \nmuch time or money trying to acquire it.\n  Finally, and perhaps most important of all, in the worst case \nscenario, we will save American lives with missile defense.\n  So we should not be fooled by the fact that the bill still authorizes \nseveral billion dollars for something called missile defense. Make no \nmistake that the cuts in this bill are very carefully designed to gut \nthe administration's plans to protect the American people from \nmissiles.\n  If one had wanted to leave intact a program that looked very much \nlike missile defense, but very surgically gutted the key components of \nit, one could not have done better than the language and the money that \ncomes out of the Armed Services Committee bill.\n  Allow me to describe some of the features of the President's new \napproach. We are very much aware that the President has decided that we \nneed to transform our military. And the President has proposed an \naggressive overhaul of not only the missile defense program but other \nprograms from the previous administration.\n  Let me describe some of the features of this transformational \napproach: First, a single, integrated architecture to command and \ncontrol all of the various components of a missile defense system. What \nthis does is to move us from the old concept of several unlinked \nsystems to one overarching system composed of several integrated \ncomponents or elements, as they are now called. This system removes the \nneed for each element to do everything and, instead, distributes the \nbasic tasks--such as launch detection, tracking, and battle \nmanagement--across the entire system.\n  So instead of having three or four specific components that do \neverything, you have several ways of attacking the problem, all linked \ntogether; therefore, they are much more effective in their overall \nability to detect, track, and destroy an enemy missile.\n  Secondly, multilayered defenses capable of intercepting missiles in \nall phases of flight, including the boost, midcourse, and terminal \nphases is an element of the President's transformation plan. The \nobvious benefits of this feature is that it will give us several shots, \nif necessary, to knock down a missile after it has been launched.\n  The point is, we do not have very much time, when a missile has been \nlaunched against us, to make a decision to launch a counterattack. By \nthe time we do that, the missile could well be coming down on top of \nus. We need the ability to have multilayered defenses which can be \neffective in the boost phase, as the offending missile is going up, \nwhich can try to attack it in midcourse, and, as a last resort, as it \nis barreling down on us at something like 17,000 miles an hour.\n  But if you only rely on that last system, you are not going to get \nmultiple shots. You are going to get one shot. And it may not always do \nthe trick. In that case, you have lost.\n  Third, the ability to deploy defenses rapidly in the event of an \nemergency is one of the critical components of the President's plan. To \naccommodate these goals and others, the administration reformed the \nMissile Defense Agency and gave it wide latitude to pursue innovative \napproaches rather than the former approach which was to have a long-\nterm project of design and research and then development and then \ndeployment.\n  The problem is that the bill on the floor today takes dead aim at \neach of these worthy efforts. The system's integration and command and \ncontrol accounts, the brains of the whole system, if you will, are \nreduced in funding by two-thirds. That is gutting the program. To cut \nthe funding by two-thirds, literally, imagine the human body. It looks \njust like it did after the operation except for one thing: You have \ntaken out the brain. It is not going to work very well. That is the \nfirst damage that was done to the President's program as a result of \nArmed Services Committee action.\n  Programs to intercept missiles in the boost phase, particularly those \nemploying new basing modes and technologies, are virtually wiped out. \nFunding for 10 THAAD test missiles, which would be deployed in an \nemergency, is eliminated, and the Missile Defense Agency staff is cut \nby two-thirds. Essentially what the bill leaves us is the old piecemeal \napproach, with many of the most promising technologies starved of \nfunding and a variety of impediments created to early deployment of the \nPresident's proposed system.\n  It is quite interesting that just as these cuts were being made, cuts \nthat will wreck the Bush administration's approach to protecting the \nAmerican people from missiles, the ABM Treaty lapsed into history on \nJune 13. The bill is an attempt to revive the spirit of that treaty by \nthose who have never accepted President Bush's decision to opt out of \nit. If this is the case, they are in dwindling company.\n  A year ago, the anti-missile defense, pro-ABM Treaty crowd created \nmuch hubbub over how any decision to renounce the ABM Treaty would \nsupposedly alienate our allies, cause a major rift with Russia, and \nspark an arms race. It was going to be a disaster. Well, as it turns \nout, none of those dire predictions came true. Let's have a look.\n  Have we alienated our allies? As of last count, 12 of our 19 NATO \nallies have contributed troops to our campaign in Afghanistan, 7 \ncountries have sent their troops into combat alongside\n\n[[Page S5944]]\n\nour own, and dozens of countries are contributing to our war on \nterrorism.\n  Did it cause a rift with Russia? No. Russia has just entered into a \nnew partnership with NATO, and President Bush just signed a communique \nwith President Putin of Russia in May, committing both sides to \ncooperation on a host of issues, including, of all things, missile \ndefense.\n  How about a new arms race? No, again. President Bush also signed a \ntreaty with Russia under which both sides intend to reduce strategic \nnuclear warheads to between 1,700 and 2,200. So the doomsayers were \nwrong. It is true that Russia and many European countries might have \npreferred that President Bush not renounce the ABM Treaty, but it seems \nthese countries were not quite as wedded to this outmoded document as \nsome of its Americans supporters.\n  The ABM Treaty, as the cold war that gave birth to it, is gone. \nRussia and the United States, despite a number of disagreements and \ninterests that don't always intersect, have moved beyond enmity toward \na new, more cooperative relationship, and at the same time we have \nentered into a new area in international relations in which the threats \nto this Nation are increasingly complex and difficult to predict.\n\n  So the President expended a great deal of energy and capital in \nworking with our allies and Russia to terminate the cold war and its \ndocumentation in the form of the ABM Treaty, to enter into new \nagreements with Russia, to demonstrate we are friends, not enemies. In \norder to be able to pivot and address the new threats that face us, the \nthreats from these Third World rogue powers, he proposes a national \nmissile defense.\n  Having gone to all of that trouble--and I shouldn't characterize it \nas trouble so much as devoting a great deal of America's prestige and \ncommitment to this effort--we now have opponents in the Senate who \nwould go right back to a missile defense of the kind that would be \nauthorized by the ABM Treaty, which is to say virtually none at all. \nThat is wrong, very wrong.\n  The traditional cold-war-style deterrence is not going to deal with \nthe threats we face today. It is time for ABM Treaty supporters who \nhave stood in the way of missile defense for nearly 30 years to \nrecognize this new reality. This reality was brought home with horrible \nabruptness on September 11. Just imagine if that day were to repeat \nitself but this time with a ballistic missile armed with a nuclear or \nchemical or biological warhead. The only responsible course of action \nto deal with that possibility is to proceed with the most robust \nprogram of missile defense development we can muster. That is what the \nPresident proposed.\n  The Pentagon's approach to missile defense is exactly that. It is an \naggressive, forward-looking plan to provide the American people with \nprotection against ballistic missiles at the earliest possible date. \nIndeed, this body overwhelmingly voted to make such a plan U.S. policy \nin the 1999 Missile Defense Act.\n  We have to fund the plan, and we can't allow those who oppose missile \ndefense to go in and surgically remove the key components of the \nPresident's program in order to effectively defeat missile defense \nwhile at the same time arguing that they have left the program intact. \nIt does no good to spend $5 or $6 billion on a program without a brain, \non a program that can't communicate among its independent parts, and on \na program that does not begin the transformational policy the President \nhas outlined.\n  I am hopeful that when we vote on the amendment of the Senator from \nVirginia tomorrow, which restores the funding that was proposed by the \nPresident, the Senate will overwhelmingly stand with the President and \nwith the American people, with common sense, to be able to defend the \nAmerican people against ballistic missile attack. The issue is \nliterally that stark.\n  If we support the committee action, while people can claim that they \nstill support missile defense, the reality will be that that program \ncannot go forward because it has effectively been denuded by the cuts \nthat have been made. We have to support the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Virginia.\n  I wanted to talk about that tonight because I am not sure that \ntomorrow I will be able to engage in the debate prior to the vote. As I \nsaid, it is a vote which we must be here to cast, notwithstanding a \ndevastating tragedy occurring in my home State.\n  Since I believe it is the desire of the majority to terminate my \nremarks on the Defense authorization bill and the Warner amendment so \nthat we can go into morning business for a little bit and I can discuss \nthat subject separately, I ask unanimous consent that a Wall Street \nJournal editorial of June 17, 2002, be printed in the Record on the \nDefense authorization bill.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 17, 2002]\n\n                            Don't Go Wobbly\n\n                         (By Margaret Thatcher)\n\n       The crisis in the Indian subcontinent is currently engaging \n     the diplomatic activity of all the great powers. Rightly so. \n     The calamity a nuclear exchange could bring is truly dreadful \n     to contemplate.\n       We can expect that this somber fact alone will exercise an \n     effective restraint on both sides. But we cannot assume that \n     the nuclear deterrent effect is the same in the Cold War and \n     post-Cold War worlds. This reflection has implications far \n     beyond the subcontinent. It goes to the heart of our \n     priorities since the events of Sept. 11.\n\n\n                             untold damage\n\n       During most of my political lifetime the two superpowers, \n     the U.S. and the Soviet Union, had massive nuclear arsenals, \n     even a small proportion of which would have inflicted untold \n     damage. But this knowledge imposed discipline on the \n     aggressive expansionism of the Soviets and made for a kind of \n     stability. There were, in fact, well-understood limits on the \n     extent to which either side would directly challenge the \n     other's interests. The exceptions--like the Cuban Missile \n     Crisis of 1962--only proved the rule.\n       The nuclear deterrent did not prevent all war; the \n     conflicts in South East Asia show that. But the West's \n     possession of a credible nuclear deterrent prevented nuclear \n     war. It also prevented conventional war in the Alliance's \n     most vulnerable sector--Europe. The calculation behind the \n     deterrent was not completely fail-safe. But the rules were \n     clear, the psychology understood and each side's sticking \n     points known.\n       One cannot say the same with India and Pakistan. The \n     conflicting claims on Kashmir are compounded by lack of \n     experience in coping with the temptations offered by their \n     own nuclear capabilities. President Clinton's attempt four \n     years ago to persuade the hostile neighbors to relinquish \n     their nuclear status was doomed to failure. The task of \n     President Bush and his envoys now is both more complex and \n     more realistic: to remind New Delhi and Islamabad that war, \n     even a victorious conventional war, would in the long run \n     damage their nations' interests more than a messy and \n     unsatisfactory peace. The dangers of a nuclear escalation \n     only make that more true.\n       But this crisis also holds wider lessons for us. The \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction has \n     fundamentally changed the world in which we and our children \n     will live. India's and Pakistan's nuclear arsenals have given \n     them the power to inflict huge destruction. But neither is a \n     rogue state. India is a democracy. Pakistan is not, but it \n     has a ruler who has demonstrated his willingness to side with \n     democracies against terror. Both are basically friendly to \n     the West.\n       Proliferation of WMD offers far more menacing risks when \n     those weapons are in the hands of the West's sworn enemies. \n     We have to assume that if those who hate us are confident \n     that they can threaten us or our allies by this means they \n     will do so. The threat alone could transform the West's \n     ability to intervene in order to protect its interests or to \n     undertake humanitarian missions. In some cases we must expect \n     the rogue states to try to go beyond mere threat.\n       It is still true that any such action would be irrational. \n     There can be no doubt that response to the use of WMD against \n     us would be massive--probably nuclear. Yet even this awesome \n     prospect might not deter a fanatic who cared nothing for his \n     own country or safety. We already see such a mentality at \n     work in the suicide bombers. At the rate at which nuclear, \n     chemical and biological weaponry and missile technology have \n     been proliferating we must expect that at some point these \n     weapons will be used.\n       The is quite simply the greatest challenge of our times. We \n     must rise to it.\n       The right strategy has been clearly enunciated by President \n     Bush. America must speedily build a ballistic missile defense \n     system which will afford protection against missiles launched \n     from anywhere in the globe. The president has made progress \n     in winning the argument for this policy. He deserves the \n     fullest cooperation from all who stand to gain from it, \n     including Britain.\n       We also have to isolate rogue states that are seeking to \n     develop (or have developed) WMD, and eliminate the threat \n     they pose. Sometimes this will be possible by a mixture of \n     diplomatic sticks and carrots. Iran for example, was quite \n     rightly classed by the president as part of the ``axis of \n     evil.'' It has a missile program which poses a threat to\n\n[[Page S5945]]\n\n     Israel's security--a threat that Iran's support for terrorism \n     against Israel only magnifies. But this is part of a more \n     complex picture. Iran is a theocracy which is edging toward \n     democracy. At a certain point, the continuing growth of civil \n     society in Iran may require its rehabilitation.\n       North Korea, on the other hand, is beyond reform. Diplomacy \n     has little value. Indeed, North Korea has already been \n     appeased too much. It is in the grip of a psychotic Stalinist \n     regime whose rule is sustained by terror and bankrolled by \n     those who buy its missiles. It is one of the few states that \n     could launch an unprovoked nuclear strike. The regime must \n     go, and I fear that it may not go peacefully.\n       Between Iran on the one hand and North Korea on the other, \n     the list of rogue states will be the subject of continuing \n     revision and debate. And in each case there will be a mix of \n     policies appropriate to achieve our goal of removing the \n     threat which these states pose.\n       That is also true of Iraq. I have detected a certain amount \n     of wobbling about the need to remove Saddam Hussein--though \n     not from President Bush. It is not surprising, given the \n     hostility of many allies to this venture, that some in \n     Washington may be having second thoughts. It is, of course, \n     right that those who have the duty to weigh up the risks of \n     particular courses of action should give their advice--though \n     they would be better to direct their counsel to the president \n     not the press. But in any case, as somebody once said, this \n     is no time to go wobbly.\n       Saddam must go. His continued survival after \n     comprehensively losing the Gulf War had done untold damage to \n     the West's standing in a region where the only forgivable sin \n     is weakness. His flouting of the terms on which hostilities \n     ceased has made a laughingstock of the international \n     community. His appalling mistreatment of his own countrymen \n     continues unabated. It is clear to anyone willing to face \n     reality that the only reason Saddam took the risk of refusing \n     to submit his activities to U.N. inspectors was that he is \n     exerting every muscle to build WMD. We do not know exactly \n     what stage that has reached. But to allow this process to \n     continue because the risks of action to arrest it seem too \n     great would be foolish in the extreme.\n\n\n                           coercive measures\n\n       I do not claim to know the precise balance of coercive \n     measures required now to remove Saddam: only those with \n     access to the best intelligence can assess that. A major \n     deployment of ground forces as well as sustained air strikes \n     will probably be required. And it will be essential that \n     internal groups opposed to Saddam be mobilized and assisted. \n     No one pretends that an equivalent of the Afghan Northern \n     Alliance is available. But I suspect that once the aura of \n     terror surrounding the Iraqi regime is dispelled we may be \n     astonished by the number of opponents who come forward to \n     help finish the job.\n       Finally, a warning: We should not try now to predetermine \n     the final outcome for a post-Saddam Iraq. One of the errors \n     in 1991 was an exaggerated fear of the possible breakup of \n     Iraq if the measures required to topple Saddam were taken. \n     The Kirds and Shiites have since endured years of murderous \n     repression as a result. In great strategic questions it is \n     possible to be too clever. We need to concentrate on what we \n     can achieve with the instruments at hand, and then press \n     ahead boldly with the task before us. That will be quite \n     taxing enough.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, that terminates my remarks on the bill. May \nI inquire of the Chair, is it correct that at the conclusion of my \nremarks the Chair was prepared to put the Senate into a period of \nmorning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senate is in morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/24/senate-section/article/S5945-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5945-S5947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FOREST FIRES IN ARIZONA\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I rise to speak on the crisis pending \nbefore the whole State of Arizona.\n  Arizona has never had a tragedy like this Rodeo fire. It has now \nconsumed an area 10 times the size of the District of Columbia. It has \nburned at least 200 homes, probably more. We can't go back into areas \nthat have been burned because it is still too hot. It has destroyed a \nlot more buildings than that, and animals, both domestic and a lot of \nthe animals that populate our beautiful forests.\n  People who are not familiar with Arizona might not understand how \nthere can be a forest fire in Arizona. But the world's largest \nponderosa pine forest stretches from the Grand Canyon into New Mexico, \nacross a rather wide swath of Arizona at an elevation of about 7,000 \nfeet. It is beautiful country, with pine trees, aspen, fir, spruce, \nlakes, rivers--not the kind of environment you would ordinarily \nassociate with Arizona. It is a place to which many Arizonans repair \nduring the summer when it is very warm ``down in the valley,'' as we \ncall it. It contains some of the most interesting and unique habitat in \nthe United States--habitat, both flora and fauna, which is not \npreserved by wildfire but is absolutely and utterly destroyed.\n\n  You might be interested to know that an area not far from this--\n75,000 acres--burned a couple years ago, and it was the largest black \nbear habitat in the whole United States. When you think of Arizona, \nthink of habitat for an enormous variety of animals, including fish and \nbirds, that has now been destroyed by this fire. We have the Apache \ngolden trout, which, at great pains and at great cost, the Apache \nIndian tribe and the U.S. Government have tried for years to bring back \nto the area of the White Mountain Apache Indian Reservation and \nsurrounding areas. It has been dealt a huge setback because of the fire \nthat has gone through the area which this trout ordinarily populates. \nThe erosion that will come from the devastation caused by this fire \nwill clog the streams, and it is unlikely, I have heard today, that the \nApache trout will be able to make a comeback in this area.\n  I am sure there are many other species--the gosant, just to mention \none--that will be devastated as a result of this fire.\n  Yet it is interesting that some of the radical environmentalists in \nour country are the very ones who are responsible for preventing the \nkind of management of our forests that might have prevented this \ndevastation. Their view is that man should not touch the forest. As one \nof them was reported as saying today: If the price for that is a \n500,000-acre fire with an entire town like Show Low, AZ, devastated, \nthen so be it; that is the way it should be. That is a misreading of \nhistory and science.\n  A century ago, before we overgrazed the area, and before we employed \na policy of fighting all of the fires, fire regularly burned through \nour beautiful ponderosa pine forests. We had, about every 7 years, a \nsmall fire that would burn the ``fuel'' on the ground and a few of the \nsmaller trees, but it could not hurt the great big, beautiful trees--\nmaybe 50, or 60, or 70, or 80 per acre. Now we have 3,000 trees per \nacre, or more, because we have suppressed the fires and the grazing has \nresulted not in more grass growing but all of these seedlings growing.\n  If you look at a lot of these forests in Arizona today, instead of \nthe big sequoia trees, which is what the mature ponderosas look like, \nyou see what is called a ``dog-haired thicket,'' which is a forest so \nthick with stunted, little--frankly, ugly--trees and brush that they \nsay a dog cannot even run through without losing half of his hair. It \nis hard to walk through these forests; they are so thick with this \n``fuel,'' as the Forest Service people call it.\n  What happens when there is a lightning strike or a man-caused fire, \nas in this case? Instead of burning around the ground, licking at the \nbase of these big trees--and they shrug it off--it roars throughout the \nunderbrush and climbs up the ladder of the smaller trees, up through \nthe higher trees, and finally the superheated structure at top of the \ntrees explodes into flame, and the flames swirl, creating air currents, \nand even affecting the weather. The fire then races across the top of \nthe forest, devastating everything in its path. The heat is so intense, \nthe soil is sterilized and the waxes from the needles that ordinarily \ndon't bother the forest floor melt and literally create a coating on \nthe floor. The rains that may someday come--although we have not had \nany for a long time--will wash the unprotected soil into the streams, \ncreating huge erosion problems, and it will be a hundred years before \nthis forest once again looks like it did a week ago.\n\n  That is just the impact on the forest itself. The other fauna--\nvarious varieties of animals, birds, fish, and insects--are destroyed. \nThat is not to mention the human tragedy. The elderly people who moved \nto these communities, because they are retirement and recreation \ncommunities, don't want to leave their homes. A family I heard about \nsaw the pictures and saw that their outbuildings had been burned, and \nthey had no idea whether their own home was still standing. The town of \nShow Low, with 30,000-plus people, was evacuated. Every one of the \ncitizens was forced to leave town. The fire is within the town limits, \nand it has been there for basically a day now, as the firemen from our \nState and from other places in the country are battling to keep it from \ntotally destroying that town.\n  Almost as bad, immediately to the south of town there is basically a \nclear path of forest, tinderbox dry, all the way to New Mexico that \nwould literally devastate the entire Apache-\n\n[[Page S5946]]\n\nSitgreaves Forest, which I consider to be some of the most beautiful \ncountry in the world. Our own summer cabin is in those mountains. I \nknow the area. I have hiked it. I love it.\n  It is a tragedy of unspeakable proportion that we have allowed a \ncondition to endure that created this much devastation. To give you an \nidea of the magnitude, a person not from Arizona was asked to describe \nit, or try to characterize it, provide an objective description. He \nthought for a long time and finally said:\n\n       I have seen one thing worse, Mount St. Helens.\n\n  Now, could this have been prevented? The answer is, probably so--at \nleast to the order of magnitude of this devastation. We have known for \na long time that it is possible to manage our forests by going into \nthese densely populated forests, mechanically thinning them--that is to \nsay, removing all the little trees I spoke of in the brush, the downed \ntrees, and so on, mechanically moving most of it; and then during \nOctober and November, when it is cool and wet, you burn what is left \nduring a prescribed burn, which is very safe, so that the following \nspring grasses crop up. And what we have found by research done out of \nthe Northern Arizona University--primarily by Wally Covington and his \ngroup--is that the number of species of butterflies and birds and \nanimals of all kinds, by orders of magnitude, return to the area and \nthe protein content of the grass is great. The antelope, deer, and elk \nwant to get there to graze. Also, the pitch content of the trees is \nimproved so the bark beetles cannot get in and cause the trees to die. \nIt looks so much better. Instead of this tangled mass of little trees \nand brush, which I talked about before, you have beautiful, big trees \nthat, as I say, look like the sequoias in California, and which are \nmuch healthier as a result of the fact that they are not competing with \nso many little trees for the nutrients in the water and the soil.\n  It can be done by thinning and taking out that dead brush and then, \nin appropriate cases, doing a prescribed burn as well. After that, \nnature can take its course. When you have a lightning strike 5, 6, 7 \nyears later, what happens? It burns along the ground. It will burn the \ngrass and some of the stumps that are left, but it will not crown to \nthe top of these trees, creating the devastating fires we have seen.\n\n  Why haven't we been able to do that? I am sorry to say it is a \ncombination of a lot of factors, but most of it goes back to one \ncentral problem: There are radical environmentalists who don't agree \nwith this. Most mainstream environmentalists understand that this so-\ncalled ecological restoration is exactly what our forests need, and \nthey are willing to support it. Yes, there are quibbles about, do you \ncut 16-inch or 24-inch diameter trees, but the concept is agreed to.\n  Some of the radicals are so afraid that there will be any commercial \ntimber operation left standing in this country--and there is none in \nArizona to speak of anymore--but they are so afraid somebody might make \na little bit of money cutting timber commercially that they will do \nanything to prevent anybody from getting into the forest to cut trees; \nthus, our roadless policy, and thus, 5,000 appeals to Forest Service \nactions seeking to go into our forests and provide this kind of \nmanagement. Between 40 and 50 percent of the Forest Service budget is \ndevoted to dealing with these legal challenges.\n  Think about that for a moment. Talk about a litigious society. \nBetween 40 and 50 percent of the Forest Service budget is devoted to \nthese administrative and legal challenges to moving forward with this \nmanagement. Part of the fault is Congress. We have written laws that \nare so open-ended and unclear that it is very easy for radical \nenvironmentalists to find something wrong and challenge one of these \nproposed management programs.\n  Bureaucrats make mistakes. It is always easy to stop a project. It is \nvery difficult to move these projects forward, as a result of which a \nlot of Forest Service people have essentially given up. I have asked \nthem and they say: Why should we propose any more? We will get stopped, \nand we don't have enough personnel to fight this in court or in the \nadministrative process.\n  There is plenty of blame to go around. We tried to get more funding \nin the Congress, and, frankly, my colleagues have not been all that \nsupportive. We tried to get support from this administration and the \npast administration. Again, we could have had a whole lot more help \nthan we have received.\n  To its credit, this administration only had one budget, and I am \nhopeful that as a result of this--the Secretary of the Interior I know \nis strongly committed to this kind of management, as is the head of the \nForest Service. I am hopeful that as unfortunate as the Rodeo fire is--\nand, by the way, the Chediski fire--might stimulate both the \nadministration and my colleagues in the Congress to support more \nmeaningful management practices.\n  I spoke with friends on the other side of the aisle who are anxious \nto help in this regard because all the Western States have the same \nenvironment. The ponderosa forest is a little different than other \nforests. They have their own nuances but generally the concept is \npretty much the same.\n  We need to do three things. We need to, first, provide whatever \nsupplemental funding is necessary to deal with the crisis that is here \ntoday. The Forest Service long ago spent all the money we gave it to \nfight fires. We are just entering the fire season. We have to replenish \nthose accounts and get more money into the Departments of Agriculture \nand Interior.\n  Second, we have to in next year's budget provide adequate funding for \nthe implementation of a forest plan that provides this management on a \nlarge-scale basis. The General Accounting Office said 3 years ago that \nwe have to treat 35 million acres in a 15- to 20-year period or these \nforests will be lost forever through disease and burning. Now it is \ndown to about 30 million because about 4 million of those have burned. \nBut we still have a job and less time within which to do it. We need to \ndevote the resources that are necessary, and that will mean spending \nsome money.\n\n  Third, we will have to change some of the laws to provide for more \nexpedited procedures to get these plans approved and to make it more \ndifficult for frivolous objections to prevail or to slow up the \nprocess. If these plans are done in accordance with commonly accepted \ngood management practices, then the burden should be on those opposing \nthe sale to prove why the sale should not go forward.\n  When I use the term ``sale,'' I want to be very specific. We do not \nhave enough money in this country to treat these forests without \ncommercial enterprise. I have gotten a little bit of money each year to \nsupport Northern Arizona University and the research people in Denver \nwho hire AmeriCorps volunteers and grad students at the university to \ngo out during the summer and do some of the work by hand. They can \ntreat a few hundred acres doing that, but they cannot do a large area \ntreatment that the GAO said is necessary. That is why we are going to \nneed commercial enterprises to clear the forest of the debris, the fuel \nabout which we are talking.\n  Somebody might make a little bit of money doing that, but it is not \ngoing to be by taking out the big trees that all of us want to \npreserve. It will be by having enough wood for fiber board, plywood, \nand a few poles for cabinet construction, for example. There may be a \nlittle bit of lumber but not very much.\n  Those are the actions we are going to have to undertake in the next \nfew days to begin to deal with this situation. The one way we can begin \nto repair what has occurred and to keep faith with the people who have \nlost their homes and their livelihood, their livestock, and, frankly, \nthe people of this great Nation who have now lost a tremendous resource \nof almost half a million acres in Arizona, one way we can help to make \nthis right is to see it does not happen again. We can do that by \nimplementing sound management that begins to restore our forests to the \nway God created them and the way they can be preserved if we will but \ntreat them as we would treat anything that belongs to us in our own \nyard or in our own garden.\n  We would never hope to have a successful garden without ever weeding \nit, and there has been a parallel made of our forests to our gardens. \nTo keep it healthy, one has to weed it every now and then. That is not \nunnatural. In fact, it is a very natural way of dealing with our \nforests.\n\n[[Page S5947]]\n\n  Madam President, I join all who have expressed sympathies and best \nwishes for the people who have suffered as a result of this fire. I \nappreciate all the comments that have been made to me, expressions of \nconcern and support. I am absolutely delighted President Bush is going \nto be flying to Arizona tomorrow to this little town of Show Low whose \nFourth of July parade I do not think I have missed now in about 15 \nyears. It is a beautiful little town. I know the people of Show Low and \nof northeast Arizona will appreciate the President's visit, and I know \nit will be on behalf of all of us that he visits there and expresses \nour sympathies and concerns and hope for the future as a result of our \nability to join together and engage in sound management practice.\n  I support what he is doing. I regret I cannot join him. I know he \nwould ask us to do the work here in response to this important Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a Wall Street Journal \neditorial of Friday, June 21.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From The Wall Street Journal, June 21, 2002]\n\n                           Review and Outlook\n\n\n                           the fire this time\n\n       In December 1995, a storm hit the Six Rivers National \n     Forest in northern California, tossing dead trees across \n     35,000 acres and creating dangerous fire conditions. For \n     three years local U.S. Forest Service officials labored to \n     clean it up, but they were blocked by environmental groups \n     and federal policy. In 1999 the time bomb blew: A fire roared \n     over the untreated land and 90,000 more acres.\n       Bear this anecdote in mind as you watch the 135,000-acre \n     Hayman fire now roasting close to Denver. And bear it in mind \n     the rest of this summer, in what could be the biggest \n     marshmallow-toasting season in half a century. Because \n     despite the Sierra Club spin, catastrophic fires like the \n     Hayman are not inevitable, or good. They stem from bad forest \n     management--which found a happy home in the Clinton \n     Administration.\n       In a briefing to Congress last week, U.S. Forest chief Dale \n     Bosworth finally sorted the forest from the tree-huggers. He \n     said that if proper forest-management had been implemented 10 \n     years ago, and if the agency weren't in the grip of \n     ``analysis paralysis'' from environmental regulation and \n     lawsuits, the Hayman fire wouldn't be raging like an inferno.\n       Mr. Bosworth also presented Congress with a sobering report \n     on our national forests. Of the 192 million acres the Forest \n     Service administraters, 73 million are at risk from severe \n     fire. Tens of millions of acres are dying from insects and \n     diseases. Thousands of miles of roads, critical to fighting \n     fires, are unusable. Those facts back up a General Accounting \n     Office report, which estimates that one in three forest acres \n     is dead or dying. So much for the green mantra of ``healthy \n     ecosystems.''\n       How did one of America's great resources come to such a \n     pass? Look no further than the greens who trouped into power \n     with the last Administration. Senior officials adopted an \n     untested philosophy known as ``ecosystem management,'' a \n     bourgeois bohemian plan to return forests to their \n     ``natural'' state. The Clintonites cut back timber harvesting \n     by 80% and used laws and lawsuits to put swathes of land off-\n     limits to commercial use.\n       We now see the results. Millions of acres are choked with \n     dead wood, infected trees and underbrush. Many areas have \n     more than 400 tons of dry fuel per acre--10 times manageable \n     level. This is tinder that turns small fires into infernos, \n     outrunning fire control and killing every fuzzy endangered \n     animal in sight. In 2000 alone fires destroyed 8.4 million \n     acres, the worst fire year since the 1950s. Some 800 \n     structures were destroyed--many as a fire swept across Los \n     Alamos, New Mexico--and control and recovery costs neared $3 \n     billion. The Forest Service's entire budget is $4.9 billion.\n       That number, too, is important. Before the Clinton \n     Administration limited timber sales, U.S. forests helped pay \n     for their own upkeep. Selective logging cleaned up grounds \n     and paid for staff, forestry stations, cleanup and roads. \n     Today, with green groups blocking timber sales at every turn, \n     the GAO says taxpayers will have to spend $12 billion to cart \n     off dead wood.\n       It's no accident that two of the main Clinton culprits--\n     former director of Fish & Wildlife Jamie Rappaport Clark and \n     former Forest Service boss Michael Dombeck--have both landed \n     at the National Wildlife Federation, which broadcasts across \n     its Internet homepage, ``Fires Are Good.''\n       Fixing all of this won't be easy. After 30 years of \n     environmental regulation, the Forest Service now spends 40% \n     of its time in ``planning and assessment.'' Even the smallest \n     project takes years. Mr. Bosworth has identified the \n     problems, but fixing them will require White House leadership \n     and Congressional cooperation.\n       One solution would be to follow the lead of private timber \n     companies, whose forests don't tend to suffer such \n     catastrophic fires. Their trees are an investment; they can't \n     afford to let them burn. Americans should feel the same way \n     about theirs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/24/senate-section/article/S5947-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5947-S5948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MANAGEMENT OF OUR FORESTS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I know a number of Senators who are in \nthe Chamber who could probably speak to this subject better than I. \nCertainly the Senator from Wyoming and the Senator from Colorado know \nplenty about the subject matter. But I thought I might give my own \nassessment, very cursory in nature but, nonetheless, somewhat relevant.\n  We here in Washington, DC, are only getting to view the State of \nArizona, as it burns, on our television sets. We have seen, in the last \nfew days, large forests in Colorado burn. They are not under control \nyet. We can only imagine the additional fires that are likely to come \nin the State of New Mexico. New Mexico has already had a number this \nyear. We also had a series last year and the year before.\n  Senators remember when we came to the floor about Los Alamos, NM. \nThere, the forest burned right around the city of Los Alamos. We lost \nalmost 400 houses. We have not lost that many this year, but the way \nthe fire season looks, there will be plenty of damage.\n  I just want to say to the Senate and to those listening, it is this \nSenator's opinion that we have not made an American decision about the \nmaintenance of our forests.\n  I believe we have made decisions in a haphazard way because of \nlitigation and certain people in our country who think they know best \nabout forest management. These same people have prevailed in the courts \nover our professional managers. It leaves us wondering tonight how many \nmore hundreds of thousands of acres will burn? And we don't know. But \nwhat many of us think is that our forests are not being managed and \nmaintained. They do not have the maximum opportunity to stand, but \nrather are likely to burn down.\n  Our forests are so clogged with underbrush that you cannot even walk \nin some of them--but they sure will burn. I submit that we have taken \nfor granted too long that forest management is going all right. Now, \nthe courts are determining lawsuits, which, in turn, determine forest \nmanagement policies. It seems to this Senator that it is all finally \ncatching up.\n  When drought and heat are combined with forests clogged with fuel, \nthe incendiary nature is so severe. We sit here every year wondering \nwhat we can do in our committees. We continue to call the land managers \nand they tell us they are making headway. It is hard to see sometimes, \nbut pretty soon we must get this done.\n  I believe this year--even though we cannot finish it--we ought to \nstart with the appropriate committee and get prepared to undertake a \nmajor senatorial investigation of the forests of the United States, \nincluding those that are part of the Agriculture Department and those \nthat are BLM. We should make some determinations sooner rather than \nlater, as to whether we have been maintaining the forests in a manner \nthat is most apt to cause them to be burned down, and that either is or \nis not good for our country.\n  Some think what I just described is good. I don't think it is. But I \nthink we owe it to our people to get the experts of our country and \nmake a big, major American decision: Are we to maintain our forests so \nthey are filled with underbrush that will burn down, or are we to \nmaintain it another way? Which way are we maintaining it? Is it in an \norderly manner, or is it being determined by court cases pushed and \npursued by endangered species laws and others that have caused our \nforests to be so mismanaged that they are just ready to burn and burn? \nThis isn't the last one today. We are not even in the middle of the \nsummer. Imagine. We see forests out there loaded with underbrush, with \nthe hot, boiling sun, no rain or clouds in the sky, but no trees on the \nground either.\n  Just in passing, it is amazing because, even when the trees are all \nburned we cannot cut them down. We have to leave them there to rot \nbecause there are some who win in the courts of law and say that is a \nbetter way to manage. So there they stand as relics\n\n[[Page S5948]]\n\nto a management plan that, to this Senator, seems to say that our \nforests are not managed, but mismanaged.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, on Friday, amendment No. 3954 to S. 2514 \nwas approved by the Senate and I would like to make a few remarks \nregarding this important provision.\n  I am proud to have sponsored this amendment with my good friend from \nFlorida, Senator Nelson. We both have a strong interest in space, for \npersonal and constituent reasons, and believe this amendment, while \nonly a Sense of the Senate, is important to show that the Senate is on \nrecord supporting assured access to space.\n  United States national security and economic vitality depend on our \nability to launch a variety of satellites into earth orbit. Access to \nand utilization of space provides an advantage to the United States \nthat must be maintained. Unfortunately, significant contractions in the \ncommercial space launch marketplace have eroded the overall viability \nof the United States space launch industrial base and could jeopardize \nthe ability of the Department of Defense to provide assured access to \nspace in the future.\n  The Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle, EELV, program is the Air \nForce's solution for assured access. EELV is designed to be more \nresponsive and affordable than current launch vehicles. With EELV, the \nAir Force has adopted a commercial launch services approach. The DOD \nalso shared with the contractors the investment to develop next \ngeneration launch vehicles--the Atlas V and Delta IV. In 1997, at a \ntime when worldwide projections envisioned 70 launches per year, the \nAir Force decided to retain both EELV contractors rather than down \nselecting to a single provider. The commercial satellite marketplace, \nit appeared, would provide adequate sustainment for the U.S. space \nlaunch industrial base, thereby justifying the large contractor \ninvestments in EELV, and providing the DOD a more robust assured access \ncapability for a relatively modest government investment. Since 1997, \nhowever, such launch projections have deteriorated by 65 percent. The \n2002 projection envisions approximately 25 launches per year.\n  As the EELV program transitions from development to recurring \noperations, the Air Force is evaluating a range of options for \nsustaining the launch infrastructure and industrial base necessary to \nassure access to space. The key to this effort is the maintenance of \ntwo financially stable launch service providers that will keep U.S. \nlaunch providers competitive in the global market and provide backup \nfor any technical or operational problems that may be encountered. Such \na program will not fundamentally alter the projected cost savings \nassociated with the EELV program, a 25-50 percent reduction over \ntoday's systems. The Air Force is currently negotiating with the two \nEELV contractors to develop an appropriate cost and risk sharing \nstrategy for assured success.\n  The amendment calls on the Air Force to evaluate all the options for \nsustaining the space launch industry base, develop an integrated, long-\nrange, and adequately funded plan for assuring U.S. access to space, \nand for the Air Force to submit a report to Congress at the earliest \npossible time.\n  Again, I want to thank Senator Nelson for working with me on this \nsimple but important sense of the Senate. I look forward to working \nwith him on this and other space issues in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/24/senate-section/article/S5948-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MILITARY CHIEF NURSES\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, today I wish to address a timely and \nimportant amendment to increase the grade for the Chief Nurses of the \nArmy, the Navy, and the Air Force to that of two stars. The existing \nlaw limits the position of Chief Nurse of the three branches of the \nmilitary to that of Brigadier General in the Army and Air Force, and \nRear Admiral, lower half, in the Navy.\n  Chief Nurses have a tremendous responsibility, their scope of duties \ninclude peacetime and wartime health care delivery, plus establishing \nstandards and policy for all nursing personnel within their respective \nbranches. They are responsible for thousands of Army, Navy, and Air \nForce officer and enlisted nursing personnel in the active, reserve, \nand guard components of the military. The military medical mission \ncould not be carried out without nursing personnel. They are crucial to \nthe mission in war and peace time, at home and abroad.\n  Organizations are best served when the leadership is composed of a \nmix of specialties, of equal rank, who bring their unique perspectives \nto the table when policies are established and decisions are made. This \nincreased rank would guarantee that the nursing perspective is \nrepresented on critical issues that affect the military medical \nmission, patient care, and nursing practice. I believe it is time to \nensure that the military health care system fully recognize and utilize \nthe leadership ability of these outstanding patient care professionals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/24/senate-section/article/S5948-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5948-S5949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            E-MAIL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to address the Senate on an \nincreasingly important topic: the security of the Internet, and \nspecifically, the security of the e-mail we send across the Internet.\n  During my service on the Judiciary Committee I have held and attended \na number of hearings on Internet oversight, and on the development of \nrelated legislation. Despite a thinning in the ranks of Internet \nfocused companies, the Internet of course continues to become a more \nand more important part of our economic and personal lives.\n  In the wake of the September 11th and anthrax attacks, much of our \nattention has been focused on national security issues. The \ninterruptions in traditional communications systems like the phone and \ntraditional mail systems underscore the wisdom of the founders of the \nInternet, which began as a Defense Department project to develop a \ncommunications system that would be flexible and decentralized enough \nto withstand attacks that might cripple other systems. Internet \ntechnology is continually changing, and we need to be aware of its \ncapabilities as well as any signs of vulnerability that can be \nexploited by those bent on using Internet access to attack the \nintegrity of communications or vital data. In particular, since the \nanthrax attacks the nation has come to rely even more heavily on e-\nmail. There is no doubt that trust and confidence in e-mail, especially \nbetween businesses and consumers, is critical to the vital role such \nmail has played during recent months in keeping the channels of \ncommerce and communication open despite blows to telephone service and \ntraditional mail.\n  Yet, the Internet is vulnerable in its own ways. The Internet itself \ncan be used by terrorists as well as by those of good intentions. While \ne-mail cannot be used by criminals and terrorists to spread harmful \nbiological or chemical agents, there are risks in the way most e-mail \nis generated and transmitted. We have all been familiar with the \nvarious viruses that have been sent via e-mail and affected many \ncomputer systems. Among some of the risks are loss of privacy through \nunauthorized access to e-mail in transit and through invasions of e-\nmail host databases. Another technique is ``spoofing,'' in which \nmessages are sent purporting to be from a trusted sender in order to \ndeceive the recipient, especially individual consumers and other \ncitizens. We are increasingly threatened by viruses and other malicious \ncode that can be carried on e-mails and unwittingly activated by the \nrecipient.\n  We need to review industry's ongoing efforts to answer these \nchallenges, and assess what individual consumers and policy makers can \ndo. Some of these threats are familiar, others are just emerging. For \nexample, by sending\n\n[[Page S5949]]\n\nmessages with spoofed false send identities and misleading subject \nidentifiers, hackers and unethical marketers can overcome the \nreluctance of even experienced e-mail recipients to open mail from \nunknown sources. As users are hurt or inconvenienced by falsified \nmessages, their trust and confidence in the medium is damaged, and the \nusefulness of e-mail for all legitimate senders declines. We addressed \nsome of these concerns in the PATRIOT Act last year, as we included a \nnumber of reforms to our computer fraud and abuse laws. It will be \neasier to investigate and prosecute unauthorized access to computer \nsystems and to prevent cyberattack with these changes.\n  America has deep strategic interests in advancing the Internet, and \nespecially its most frequently used service: e-mail. I am hopeful that, \nand have read about, new technologies and practices that can help \nimprove sender accountability for e-mail, empower recipients to screen \ne-mail by assuring them of its real sender, and deliver on the promise \nof greater privacy for personally identifiable data.\n  It is important that we continue our efforts to keep our laws updated \nwith new technologies and threats that could be posed using such new \ntechnologies. We should also take actions to motivate industry and the \npublic where more needs to be done. Over the years, the public has come \nto value e-mail's convenience and speed, and to trust it as an \nalternative to the traditional postal envelope.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/24/senate-section/article/S5949-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5949-S5951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    PROMOTING FOREIGN LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY IN THE FEDERAL WORKFORCE\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I rise today to urge the passage of two \nbills vital to our Nation's ability to combat terrorism, S. 1799, the \nHomeland Security Education Act, and S. 1800, the Homeland Security \nFederal Workforce Act. These bills are designed to assist our nation's \nnational security agencies in recruiting individuals fluent in crucial \nforeign languages and skilled in other areas of critical concern. I \nfear that the lack of foreign language-speaking employees has \ncontributed to one of the worst security lapses in the history of our \ngreat Nation.\n  The information that has surfaced in recent weeks about our \nintelligence agencies' inability to articulate a complete intelligence \npicture in the weeks and months preceding September 11 underscores the \nneed for language-proficient professionals throughout Federal agencies \nto decipher and interpret information from foreign sources, as well as \ninteract with foreign nationals.\n  In the article by Katherine McIntire Peters from the May 1, 2002, \nGovernment Executive Magazine, entitled ``Lost in Translation,'' she \ndemonstrates explicitly how a critical shortage of Federal employees \nwith foreign language skills is hurting national security. According to \nthe article, the Army has a 44-percent shortfall in translators and \ninterpreters in five critical languages, including Arabic, Korean, \nPersian-Farsi, Mandarin-Chinese, and Russian; the Department of State \nlacks 26 percent of its calculated need in authorized translator and \ninterpreter positions, and the FBI has a 13-percent deficiency in the \nstaffing of similar positions.\n  With such a startling lack of workers with proficient foreign \nlanguage skills throughout the Federal Government, enacting S. 1799 and \nS. 1800 is essential for our national security. The 107th Congress must \nact now to alleviate these grave deficiencies to recruit personnel \npossessing vital skills. To do this, we must promote the pursuit of \nlanguage skills at all levels of education.\n  S. 1799 strengthens national security by assisting in the expansion \nand the improvement of primary through graduate-level foreign language \nprograms. This bill gives a boost to the foreign language programs \ntaught in our Nation's schools by promoting concentrated and effective \nlanguage study and by providing intensive professional development for \nteachers. Language study from a very early age will open students' \nminds to the opportunities and benefits of learning foreign languages. \nThese benefits, combined with an across-the-board strengthening in \nscience and engineering programs, will ensure an educated and \ncompetitive citizenry while providing a qualified applicant pool for \nnational security positions.\n  S. 1800 provides incentives for accomplished university students to \nenter governmental service. The bill provides an enhanced loan \nrepayment program for students with degrees in areas of critical \nimportance and also provides fellowships to graduate students with \nexpertise in similarly sensitive areas. These incentives will result in \nthe recruitment of the highly-trained, dynamic young individuals our \nNation needs to assist in the war against terrorism.\n  Our security organizations will benefit tremendously from an influx \nof proficient foreign language speakers. In addition to increasing the \nnumber of security personnel entering the Federal service with language \nproficiency, the legislation encourages current employees to improve \ntheir language ability and to hone other skills. We must provide \ntraining to improve foreign language skills of our present Federal \nworkers and invest in the next generation of employees to ensure a \ndedicated and capable workforce that will contribute to our national \nsecurity. The legislation I and the other sponsors have proposed would \naccomplish this.\n  I urge my colleagues to support S. 1799 and S. 1800.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Government Executive Magazine \narticle to which I referred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n         [From the Government Executive Magazine, May 1, 2002]\n\n                          Lost in Translation\n\n                     (By Katherine McIntire Peters)\n\n       When then-CIA field agent Robert Baer served in Tajikistan \n     in the early 1990s, he saw a golden opportunity to collect \n     information that might prove vital to U.S. interests. \n     Thousands of refugees were pouring into Tajikistan from \n     Afghanistan, where civil war was raging. The refugees \n     represented a gold mine of intelligence from a nation at the \n     crossroads of American interests in the region. But Baer, who \n     spoke Arabic and Russian, didn't speak Dari or Pashto, the \n     language predominant among the refugees. So he contacted CIA \n     headquarters and asked the agency to send Dari and Pashto \n     speakers to debrief the refugees. The CIA couldn't--there \n     weren't any, according to Baer. The refugees continued to \n     come, and the United States missed an opportunity to get a \n     life-saving glimpse into the brewing threat of radical Islam \n     in Afghanistan.\n       Baer related his experiences in See No Evil (Crown \n     Publishers, 2002), his memoir of a 21-year career in the CIA. \n     During his two decades of service, the agency grew \n     increasingly reliant on satellite technology and electronic \n     intelligence-gathering at the expense of maintaining the \n     language skills and regional expertise of its field officers. \n     When Baer was transferred out of Tajikistan in 1992, his \n     replacement spoke neither Tajik nor Russian, essentially \n     crippling the agency's human intelligence-gathering efforts \n     there, an assessment confirmed by another U.S. government \n     official who served in Tajikistan at the time.\n       Baer's experience is hardly unique. Across government, \n     countless opportunities are squandered every day for want of \n     personnel who speak and understand foreign languages. While \n     Baer was lamenting the CIA's lack of people with language \n     skills in Central Asia, the FBI was sitting on its own gold \n     mine of information back in New York--if only the agency had \n     had the eyes and ears to recognize it. Only after terrorists \n     bombed the World Trade Center in February 1993, did agents go \n     back and translate previously taped phone conversations and \n     confiscated documents, all in Arabic, that offered vital \n     clues to the bombings. But the FBI missed those clues because \n     it didn't have enough translators to get through the material \n     when it might have been useful in preventing an attack, \n     instead of understanding the attack after the fact.\n       More than 70 federal agencies require employees with \n     foreign language skills, which are vital to national defense, \n     law enforcement and economic security. In March, Susan \n     Westin, managing director of international affairs and trade \n     issues for the General Accounting Office, told the Senate \n     Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on International Security, \n     Proliferation and Federal Service that shortages of language-\n     qualified personnel have hindered operations in a range of \n     areas:\n       The Army doesn't have enough linguists to support its \n     current war plans or meet intelligence-gathering \n     requirements.\n       Intelligence agencies lack the staff to translate and \n     interpret thousands of technical papers that detail foreign \n     research and development in scientific and technical areas.\n       Without more timely translation of Spanish conversations, \n     the assistant U.S. attorney in Miami in charge of health care \n     fraud investigations soon will have to turn away\n\n[[Page S5950]]\n\n     cases. The implications are significant: Medicare and \n     Medicaid losses in the region top $3 billion.\n       The FBI holds thousands of hours of audiotapes and pages of \n     written material that never have been reviewed or translated \n     because the agency lacks qualified linguists. FBI officials \n     told GAO the situation has hindered criminal prosecutions and \n     limited the agency's ability to arrest and convict violent \n     gang members.\n       Lack of proficiency in foreign languages among State \n     Department personnel has hindered diplomatic readiness, \n     resulting in ineffective representation and advocacy of U.S. \n     interests abroad, lost exports and foreign investments, and \n     lost opportunities combating international terrorism and drug \n     trafficking.\n\n\n                             poor planning\n\n       It is impossible to know the full extent to which a lack of \n     language expertise hurts American interests. The Office of \n     Personnel Management doesn't maintain comprehensive records \n     of the number of federal employees with foreign language \n     skills, or the number of positions that require such skills. \n     OPM's records indicate that the government employs fewer than \n     1,000 translators and interpreters--a specially designated \n     job series in the federal workforce. But tens of thousands of \n     additional positions across government require language \n     skills.\n       In January, GAO reported in ``Foreign Languages: Human \n     Capital Approach Needed to Correct Staffing and Proficiency \n     Shortfalls'' that the lack of competence in foreign languages \n     has hindered U.S. commercial interests, military operations, \n     diplomacy, law enforcement, intelligence operations and \n     counter-terrorism efforts (GAO-02-375). To assess the \n     situation broadly, GAO auditors reviewed operations at four \n     agencies where language skills are critical: the State \n     Department, the FBI, the Army, and the Foreign Commercial \n     Service, which is part of the Commerce Department.\n       The Army, State Department and FBI all reported significant \n     shortages in translators and interpreters, positions that \n     tend to require the highest levels of skills. The Army \n     reported, on average, a 44 percent shortfall in translators \n     and interpreters in five critical languages--Arabic, Korean, \n     Mandarin-Chinese, Persian-Farsi and Russian. The State \n     Department had a 26 percent shortfall in authorized \n     translator and interpreter positions, and the FBI had a 13 \n     percent shortfall. (The Foreign Commercial Service does not \n     have designated translator and interpreter positions, but \n     hires locally for those jobs.)\n       All four agencies reported shortages in other positions \n     requiring language skills:\n       The Army has about 15,000 positions requiring proficiency \n     in 62 languages. Last year the service had 142 unfilled \n     positions for cryptologic linguists in Korean and Mandarin \n     Chinese, and 108 unfilled positions for human intelligence \n     collectors in Arabic, Russian, Spanish, Korean and Mandarin \n     Chinese.\n       The State Department has 2,581 positions requiring some \n     foreign language proficiency spanning 64 languages. State has \n     acknowledged its lack of Foreign Service officers who meet \n     language requirements, but it doesn't have reliable data to \n     show the extent of the problem--two different agency reports \n     put shortfalls at 50 percent and 16 percent.\n       The Foreign Commercial Service had significant shortfalls, \n     55 percent overall, in staff with the required proficiency in \n     Mandarin-Chinese, Russian, Japanese, Indonesian, Korean and \n     Turkish.\n       The FBI had 1,792 special agents with skills in 40 \n     languages, adding tremendously to the agency's ability to \n     interview suspects and develop connections with informants. \n     However, the FBI does not set staffing goals for special \n     agents with foreign language skills, making it impossible to \n     determine shortfalls.\n       In many cases, the problems agencies have with hiring and \n     keeping personnel with language skills stem from deeper \n     management challenges. For example, budget cuts at the State \n     Department throughout the 1990s left the Foreign Service with \n     about 1,000 vacancies by the time Secretary of State Colin \n     Powell took office in January 2001. ``These are positions \n     that existed that we had no bodies to fill,'' says John \n     Naland, president of the American Foreign Service \n     Association. ``The people we did have had to be rushed to \n     post. In a lot of cases language training had to be shortened \n     or not provided at all. That's a huge problem and a legacy of \n     the lack of hiring in the 1990s.'' One of the first things \n     Powell did was request an increase in resources, in both \n     staffing and operating funds, to fill the personnel deficit \n     and hire enough extra Foreign Service officers over the next \n     three years to maintain a ``training float''--a reserve of \n     employees assumed to be in training at any given time. If \n     Congress continues to fund the plan, ``We'll be able to put \n     someone in two years of Arabic training or Chinese training \n     and there won't be a vacancy in Cairo or Beijing while \n     they're in training,'' Naland says. But even if State and \n     other agencies were fully staffed, they wouldn't necessarily \n     have enough people with the right skills to meet their \n     language requirements. Advances in technology and wider \n     access to foreign language publications have tremendously \n     increased the need for employees who can read and understand \n     non-English materials.\n       Of the four agencies that GAO focused on, only the FBI has \n     a staffing plan that links its foreign language program to \n     its strategic objectives and program goals. GAO found that \n     the FBI plan identified strategies, performance measures, \n     responsible parties and resources the bureau needs to fill \n     its language deficit. None of the other agencies had a \n     comprehensive strategy for resolving shortages.\n\n\n                           No Easy Solutions\n\n       Military deployments in recent years have revealed \n     shortages of personnel skilled in languages few Defense \n     planners anticipated needing. When U.S. troops were deployed \n     to Somalia in 1992, for instance, the Defense Department \n     found itself desperately seeking hundreds of Somali \n     interpreters. Many had to be recruited from the ranks of new \n     immigrants found driving taxi cabs in New York and \n     Washington. The current deployment to Afghanistan is \n     presenting similar challenges. The languages of Afghanistan \n     include Pashto, Dari, Azgari, Uzbek, Turkmen, Berberi, Aimaq \n     and Baluchi--languages few Americans even recognize, let \n     alone speak. The war on terrorism virtually ensures that U.S. \n     troops will be operating in regions where language skills \n     will be in short supply.\n       It's a problem that's become familiar to the faculty at the \n     Defense Language Institute in Monterey, Calif., the largest \n     language school in the world and the source of 85 percent of \n     language training for government personnel, primarily \n     Defense. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the \n     Cold War, U.S. military language requirements have expanded \n     dramatically, and the DLI has responded. Unlike colleges and \n     universities the DLI produces students with the skills the \n     Defense Department and military services demand.\n       ``We don't put out a class list and then hope people will \n     enroll,'' says DLI Chancellor Ray Clifford. ``The enrollments \n     take place first. As enrollments shift, we adjust our faculty \n     and teaching strength.''\n       Last year, 2,083 students graduated from basic language \n     training in 20 languages. Depending on the difficulty of the \n     language, training lasts from 25 weeks to 63. In 2001, more \n     than half of DLI students were enrolled in four of the \n     toughest languages for Americans to learn: Arabic, Chinese-\n     Mandarin, Korean and Persian-Farsi. (Several hundred more \n     students completed intermediate and advanced training as \n     well.)\n       Neil Granoien, a former Russian instructor and former dean \n     of the DLI's Korean school, now oversees a special task force \n     to provide support to Operation Enduring Freedom in \n     Afghanistan. The DLI recently has added new courses in \n     Pashto, Dari and Uzbek, and plans to add courses in Basha \n     Indonesian, Urdu and Turkic languages.\n       There are considerable challenges in creating language \n     courses for some of the more obscure languages now needed, \n     says Granoien. In many cases, instructors must first develop \n     grammar where none exists. ``People have been writing Spanish \n     grammar for a couple hundred years, French even longer. If \n     you take a language like Uzbek, there's much work to be done, \n     or [Pashto], for example, where there's very little work \n     that's been done, and most of that was done in Victoria's \n     reign.'' That's Queen Victoria, who ruled Britain from 1837 \n     to 1901, when the British controlled much of the area that is \n     now Afghanistan.\n       ``We've got considerable expertise in the applied \n     linguistics area so we're able to [develop the grammar], but \n     it's not something that happens overnight and it's not \n     something you pull off a shelf,'' Granoien says.\n       Finding enough qualified instructors is another major \n     challenge. ``The faculty we need to find are not being \n     produced for us by U.S. colleges and universities,'' says \n     Clifford. Ideally, instructors will be qualified teachers as \n     well as native speakers able to function linguistically at a \n     professional level. Typically, the Defense Language Institute \n     recruits foreign students doing graduate work in the United \n     States in the field of teaching English as a second language, \n     but the institute can't find instructors for some of the more \n     obscure languages for which the school is now recruiting. \n     Granoien recently found four Turkmen instructors through a \n     friend who was traveling in Turkmenistan. The DLI has found a \n     few other instructors through contacts with South Asian \n     relief agencies.\n       Once faculty are recruited and trained--the DLI has a one-\n     month intensive training program for native speakers with \n     little or no teaching experience--building a curriculum and \n     developing testing programs is another challenge. The \n     language programs are based on real-world instruction, making \n     it difficult to teach languages that are rarely published in \n     newspapers, magazines and the like.\n       The DLI is accredited, and students completing the \n     intensive basic program in any language receive 45 semester \n     hours of college credit. To successfully complete the \n     program, students must pass a battery of tests that measure \n     their proficiency in speaking, reading and listening. \n     Proficiency levels range from Level 1 (elementary), in which \n     an individual can speak well enough to get his or her basic \n     needs met and demonstrate common courtesy, to Level 5 \n     (functionally native), in which an individual has the \n     proficiency of an articulate, well-educated native speaker.\n       The institute's basic training program is designed to get \n     students to Level 2 (limited working ability), in which they \n     can handle routine social demands and deal with concrete \n     topics in the past, present and future tenses. ``It doesn't \n     enable them to go on to hypothetical areas or be able to read \n     between the lines,'' Granoien says. To achieve proficiency at \n     Levels 3 and 4, the general and\n\n[[Page S5951]]\n\n     advanced professional levels, students generally need \n     practical experience, he says.\n       The school also maintains an extensive field program, and \n     develops programs to meet the specific needs of military \n     personnel in the field. Last year, the DLI provided 20,000 \n     hours of instruction in far-flung locations, broadcast from \n     the Monterey campus.\n\n\n                         long-standing problems\n\n       Most of the attention on language skills shortfalls has \n     centered on Arabic and languages used in and around \n     Afghanistan, but just as worrisome for Defense officials is \n     the shortage of personnel with language and regional \n     expertise in Asia.\n       In a recent study of the Defense Department's preparedness \n     for dealing with emerging security issues in Asia, \n     researchers at DFI International, a Washington research and \n     consulting firm, found that language training outside the \n     intelligence field was a low priority in the military \n     services, mainly because of limited resources. Compounding \n     the problem is the absence of a Defense strategy for \n     identifying critical language requirements and providing top-\n     down guidance to the services on meeting those needs. \n     Instead, each service independently defines its language \n     requirements and determines its policy for rewarding language \n     skills with bonus pay. The payments generally are not high \n     enough to provide troops with sufficient incentive for the \n     difficult task of maintaining language skills. Also, most \n     services don't differentiate between critical languages in \n     which the services are experiencing shortages, and those more \n     commonly spoken, such as Spanish and French.\n       Only the Army has embraced the concept of training regional \n     specialists. Through its career-track Foreign Area Officer \n     Program, officers develop regional expertise and language \n     skills. DFI noted that the Air Force and Navy FAO programs \n     are underdeveloped and ineffective, which is of particular \n     concern in Asia, where those services predominate.\n       In its final report Sept. 30, ``Focusing the Department of \n     Defense on Asia,'' DFI also noted that only a small \n     percentage of regional policy positions at the U.S. Pacific \n     Command were filled with qualified personnel. Navy and Air \n     Force regional headquarters offices each have five ``country \n     desk'' billets in their policy and planning directorates, but \n     ``only one of the five incumbent officers in these billets \n     has any regional experience or expertise.'' The Marine Corps \n     had only a single desk officer for the entire Asia-Pacific \n     area. ``As security challenges in the Asia-Pacific theater \n     rise, so do intelligence requirements. However, a shortfall \n     of properly trained analysts and Asian linguists is creating \n     backlogs in the analysis of gathered [intelligence],'' \n     according to the DFI report. ``China poses a particular \n     problem: Officials at the Joint Intelligence Center Pacific \n     noted that, even if they dedicated all of their all-source \n     intelligence analysts to China, they would still not have \n     enough analysts to handle China intel/analytical requirements \n     alone.''\n       The shortage of language-qualified personnel in government \n     and its harmful effects on national security are not new--nor \n     is concern about language deficits. DLI's Clifford says the \n     United States has a long history of ambivalence about the \n     value of foreign languages: In 1923, the U.S. Supreme Court \n     had to overturn laws restricting the teaching of foreign \n     languages in 22 states. In 1940, a national report on high \n     schools determined that ``overly academic'' programs were \n     causing too many students to fail. The report recommended \n     eliminating foreign language instruction. By the late 1950s, \n     however, concern about being outpaced by the Soviet Union \n     resulted in the 1958 National Defense Education Act, which, \n     among other things, was designed to produce more foreign \n     language teachers and programs. But enthusiasm was short-\n     lived. The 1979 Presidential Commission on Foreign Language \n     and International Studies found that ``Americans' \n     incompetence in foreign languages is nothing short of \n     scandalous, and it is becoming worse.''\n       In many ways, the problems of federal agencies with \n     recruiting and training language-competent employees reflect \n     the failure of our public education system. According to data \n     compiled by the Center for Applied Linguistics, the vast \n     majority of elementary schools don't teach foreign languages, \n     and while 86 percent of high schools offer foreign languages, \n     few high schools offer instruction in languages beyond \n     Spanish or French. According to 1998 survey data from the \n     Modern Language Association, a New York-based professional \n     group, about 8 percent of college students are enrolled in \n     foreign language classes. And as anyone who has studied a \n     language in high school or college knows, taking classes does \n     not necessarily result in proficiency.\n       ``To build the kind of expertise the government needs in \n     intelligence and defense and economics, we have to recognize \n     that language learning is long-term, serious, and \n     difficult,'' David Edwards, executive director for the Joint \n     National Committee for Languages, said at a January briefing \n     on language and national security sponsored by the National \n     Foreign Language Center and the National Security Education \n     Program.\n       ``As most other nations of the world already know, we have \n     to begin the process in the elementary schools and continue \n     it the whole way through graduate school if we're to do it \n     well,'' Edwards said.\n       ``We cannot address the government's language needs without \n     addressing the nation's language needs,'' Edwards added.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/24/senate-section/article/S5951-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Second baseman Will Bolt set or tied 7 career school \nrecords. Outfielder Daniel Bruce set a dubious record by being hit by a \npitch 26 times this season and the team set a record with 95 Husker \nhitters plunked this season. Catcher Jed Morris set or tied 3 school \nrecords and became only the second Husker to be named the Big 12 Player \nof the Year.\n  Seven players also received recognition for their academic \naccomplishments, applying the dedication they learned on the field to \nthe classroom.\n  Record numbers of fans came out to support the Huskers this year and \nseason ticket sales soared 400 percent as the new Hawks Field at \nHaymarket Park in Lincoln opened.\n  However, all of these achievements would not be possible without \nteamwork. The diverse Husker team, with players from 15 different \nstates, worked together to produce an impressive 47-21 season.\n  These accomplishments give us reason to be proud of our Huskers. And \nwhile the College World Series may not have turned out how we had \nwished, we can all look forward to next year and hope the Husker \nbaseball team continues its winning ways.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/24/senate-section/article/S5951-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5951-S5952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              35TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE METROPOLITAN CHORUS\n\n Mr. ALLEN.

I want to \nexpress my deepest sympathies to his wife and their five children for \ntheir heart-wrenching loss. Master Sgt. Tycz was killed June 12 when \nhis plane caught fire and crashed after taking off from an airstrip in \nAfghanistan. Our entire nation is saddened by this immeasurable loss \nand I rise in recognition of his profound contribution to America.\n  A native of Tonawanda, New York, Master Sgt. Tycz was a Green Beret \nand the father of five girls, ages 1 to 9: Elizabeth, Samantha, Faith, \nTiffany and Felicia. He joined the Army out of high school and was \ncommitted to the fight for freedom wherever it took him. He welcomed \nthe opportunity to defend America in Afghanistan. Master Sgt. Tycz \nwrote in an email to his mother, Terry Harnden, this past fall, which \nread: ``[I] will have to make great sacrifices to make sure our \nlifestyle is not threatened and I'm prepared to do that.'' His \ndaughters will grow up knowing that their father was a true American \nhero who represents the very best of our great Nation.\n  Master Sgt. Tycz's sacrifice for his country reminds us of the \nenormous debt of gratitude we owe all of our men and women in uniform--\nthose who risk their lives and, in particular, those who have been lost \nin the defense of our country. Their courage and steadfast \ndetermination keeps America safe and our freedom strong.\n  We are grateful to Master Sgt. Tycz and the many American service men \nand women like him who are determined to defend and protect our great \ncountry. In that same email to his mother, Master Sgt. Tycz wrote, ``Do \nnot ever be sad for me because you will defeat my reason for being.'' I \nhope that we will always remember his words and that they will bring us \nall, most especially his family, comfort and strength.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/24/senate-section/article/S5952-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PASSING OF JUSTIN DART, JR.\n\n Mr. McCAIN.

Afflicted with polio at a young age, Justin Dart didn't let his \nwheelchair get in the way of fighting for the rights of the disabled \nfor more than five decades. Today, millions of disabled Americans have \nmore opportunities and better access to public facilities because of \nthe tireless work and dedication of Justin Dart.\n  From 1988 to 1990, he served as Chairman of the Congressional Task \nForce on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities and \nwas instrumental in getting the Americans with Disabilities Act signed \ninto law in 1990. To ensure its passage, Justin literally visited all \nfifty states to educate Americans about the barriers people with \ndisabilities face every day in their lives, and he spent countless days \non Capitol Hill to make the ADA a reality.\n  In 1998, to honor his lifelong public service, President Clinton \nawarded Justin Dart our Nation's highest civilian honor, the Medal of \nFreedom, and told those who gathered to honor him that Justin had \n``literally opened the doors of opportunities to millions of our \ncitizens by securing one of the Nation's landmark civil rights laws.'' \nSuch tremendous desire to help secure the rights of others defined the \nlife of Justin Dart.

His assumption \nof the role of President is the culmination of a lifelong commitment to \nservice in the Bar Association. Larry received his J.D. degree in 1974 \nfrom the LSU Paul M. Hebert Law Center and was admitted that year to \npractice in the State of Louisiana. Since this time he has been \nactively involved in the Bar Association. Larry has also demonstrated a \ncommitment to excellence in programming on the Continuing Legal \nEducation Program Committee and served as Chairman of the Committee \nfrom 1986-1987. He was one of the pioneers of the Sandestin Summer \nSchool for Lawyers. He served on the Board of Governors from 1994-1997. \nHe was Secretary of the Association from 1997-1999, a position in which \nhe served as Editor of the Louisiana State Bar Journal. In 1996, he \nreceived the LSBA's President's Award, which is the highest award given \nby the Louisiana State Bar Association to a member for their service to \nthe organization. Through all of his effort, Larry Feldman has clearly \ndemonstrated his dedication to the Association. However, Larry has not \nonly been dedication to the Association, but also to his family. As the \nfather of three daughters, he has shown that giving children a strong \nsense of self and independence is a great gift. As a devoted son, he \nhas displayed that love, warmth, and support are excellent gifts to \nparents as they age. And as a husband, he has proven that love is best \nwhen it is between equals.

Madam President, I stand among my colleagues \ntoday to honor and congratulate Carl Wicklund or Kenton County, KY on \nbeing named the 2002 recipient of the Warren H. Proudfoot Award for \nOutstanding School Board Member.\n  The Proudfoot Award is named after the late Dr. Warren H. Proudfoot, \na longtime member of the Rowan County Board of Education and past \npresident of the Kentucky School Board Association. Created in 1992, \nthe award recognizes a past or present member of a school board for \ndistinguished leadership and community service.\n  Mr. Wicklund received this year's award due primarily to his work in \nestablishing a special class in conjunction with the Northern Kentucky \nChamber of Commerce to allow students considering a career in \nmanufacturing a first-hand look at the industry by visiting area \nbusinesses and observing their day-to-day operational procedures. Mr. \nWicklund's hard work and selfless acts deserve our recognition.\n  In order for Kentucky to improve upon itself socially, economically \nand technologically, education must be a top priority for kids, parents \nand board members. Only when all three of these groups are working \ntogether can we ensure that our youth are receiving the proper \neducational attention. Carl Wicklund has personally gone above and \nbeyond the call of duty to create more and better opportunities for \nKentucky's youth. I applaud him for his hard work and dedication and \ncongratulate him on receiving this prestigious award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/24/senate-section/article/S5952-5", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5952-S5953]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              IN MEMORY OF GUNNERY SERGEANT JOHN BASILONE\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, today I stand before you to \nrecognize the outstanding service exemplified by United States Marine \nSergeant John Basilone. Sergeant Basilone was killed in action fighting \nat Iwo Jima on February 19, 1942. He remains distinguished as the only \nenlisted Marine to receive three of the military's highest honors: The \nMedal of Honor, the Purple Heart, and the Navy Cross.\n  Sergeant Basilone enlisted in the Army at eighteen years of age and \nbecame known as ``Manila John'' during his service in the Philippine \nIslands. After receiving an honorable discharge from the Army, young \nBasilone returned home. It was not long, however, before the soldier \nrejoined the armed services as a Marine In time for the Second World \nWar. He was a member of the First Battalion under the First Marine \nDivision during the Solomon Island campaign. After a courageous victory \nthere, he was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. He humbly\n\n[[Page S5953]]\n\nreceived this honor and declined the opportunity to remain stateside, \nreturning instead to the Fifth Division of the Marines. On the \nNineteenth of February, 1942, Sergeant John Basilone completed his \nfinal mission at Iwo Jima.\n  Born in Buffalo, NY, to Salvatore and Dora Basilone, John was one of \nten children. From his early days as a boxer to his final stand as a \ngunnery sergeant, it was evident that he possessed a unique spirit of \nstrength, dedication, and determination. His heroism was recognized \nnationally with the highest military honors, and he posthumously \nreceived the Navy Cross, three bronze stars, a Purple Heart, as well as \nthe World War II Victory Medal.\n  As a fellow American sharing Basilone's Italian heritage, it is my \nhonor to celebrate the legacy of a man so committed to defending the \ncherished ideals of this Nation. Commemorating our Nation's heroes and \nveterans remains vital to keeping this country's tradition of freedom \nintact.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/24/senate-section/article/S5953-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5953]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IN HONOR OF THE 75TH BIRTHDAY OF KOOL-AID\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, few childhood \nexperiences span the generation gap as successfully as Kool-Aid. Many \nof today's business leaders started down the road to financial success \nby standing at a folding table in their front yard selling one-cent \ncups of refreshing Kool-Aid.\n  While the business of Kool-Aid now spans front yards around the \nglobe, I am pleased to say that the very first Kool-Aid entrepreneur \nwas a Nebraskan.\n  Edward Perkins had a curious young mind and at age 11 he began \nexperimenting; transforming the back of his father's mercantile store \nin Hendley, NE, into a flavor factory. The early experience he gained \nwould come in handy 27 years later in Hastings, NE, when Perkins \ncreated Kool-Aid. The delicious drink was a hit and quickly became a \nhousehold name.\n  The story of Kool-Aid is the perfect illustration of the value of \nperseverance. Perkins was dedicated to his business and worked hard as \nan innovator for many years before finally creating the drink that \nwould make him famous, and Hastings, famous.\n  Hastings celebrates Kool-Aid days with the world's largest Kool-Aid \nstand every August. They also show their Nebraskan hospitality by \nserving Kool-Aid at rest stops throughout Nebraska. There are currently \n22 flavors of Kool-Aid and it is no wonder that the current best \nseller, Tropical Punch, has a Husker red color glow to it.\n  For all these reasons and many more I am proud that Kool-Aid is the \nofficial State soft drink of Nebraska and wish it a very happy 75th \nbirthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/24/senate-section/article/S5953-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5953]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING REBECCA COLTEY\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire, Madam President, I rise today to \npay tribute to the ``New Hampshire Star of Life.''

He \nrecently led the City through the Multi-Site Landfill Closure and Park \nRenovation Project which provides state-of-the-art closure and post-\nclosure refuse to five former City landfills, as well as construction \nof one of New Hampshire's few publicly owned and operated lined \nlandfills.

Madam President, I rise today to \nhonor Captain Humbert Roque ``Rocky'' Versace, U.S. Army. On Monday, 8 \nJuly 2002, Captain Rocky Versace will be awarded posthumously the \nCongressional Medal of Honor for service in the Viet Nam war.\n  On 29 October 1963, Captain Versace, along with First Lieutenant \nNicholas Rowe, was captured in South Vietnam. Taken prisoner by the \nViet Cong, he demonstrated exceptional leadership, resolute adherence \nto the Code of Conduct and unflagging faith in his country. Captain \nVersace ultimately sacrificed his life rather than betray his country \nand the Viet Cong executed him in September 1965 as he set an example \nof an American officer that the Viet Cong could not tolerate. Captain \nVersace died upholding the military creed of Duty, Honor, Country.\n  I want to recognize Captain Versace through the words of his fellow \ncaptive, Nick Rowe, who escaped from captivity to freedom on 31 \nDecember 1968. Nick Rowe remained in the Army, rose to the rank of \nColonel, and continued to serve in Special Forces until April 1989, \nwhen he was assassinated by the communist New People's Army in Manila, \nPhilippine Islands. His captivity memoir, ``Five Years to Freedom'' was \npublished in 1971 and contains this tribute.\n  The tribute follows:\n\n                  Nick Rowe's Tribute to Rocky Versace\n\n     He stood as others dream to stand;\n     He spoke as others dared not even think;\n     From soul deep faith, he drew his courage,\n     his granite spirit, his ironclad will.\n\n     The Alien force, applied with hate,\n     could not break him, failed to bend him;\n     Though solitary imprisonment gave him no friends,\n     he drew upon his inner self to create a force so strong\n     that those who sought to destroy his will, met an army\n     his to command.\n\n     Phrases of his I shall not forget,\n     spoken sincerely, filled with truth:\n     All I wish is to return to family, home and those I love;\n     For I am young and life is dear,\n     but to bargain for this life of mine when the price you ask\n     requires of me to verify a lie\n     and sell my honor short,\n     makes clear the choice between the two;\n     a life with honor, a life without;\n     With me, you see, life without honor is no life at all,\n     So I will not comply with what you require and choose to \n           suffer\n     whatever may come.\n\n     This is my answer at this time,\n     this is my answer in times to come;\n     I only pray that I shall not weaken, for I am right\n     and with God's help, I will have the strength to resist \n           whatever means you use\n     while attempting to fulfill your evil scheme.\n\n     Thus his fate was surely sealed,\n     for such a man, standing firm\n     defeated them on their own ground\n     and for him to live and tell of this\n     was a thing that could not be.\n\n     I saw him not the day he died,\n\n[[Page S5954]]\n\n     for, I imagine, as he lived alone;\n     so they arranged for him to die alone;\n     But in my mind there is no doubt,\n     as he stood while he was alive,\n     Duty bound, Honor bound, Unswerving in allegiance,\n     so he stood the day he died . . . a Rock.--James Nicholas \n           Rowe,\n     ``Five Years to Freedom,'' pp. 205-206.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/24/senate-section/article/S5954-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING DENNIS MECHEM\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

A bill to amend part A of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to toll the 5-year limit for assistance under the temporary \nassistance to\n\n[[Page S5958]]\n\nneedy families program for recipients who live in a State that is \nexperiencing significant increases in unemployment; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nthe Unemployment Protection for Low-Income Families on TANF Act, or \nUPLIFT Act, that will protect low-income families who are transitioning \nfrom welfare to work from losing their welfare benefits during periods \nof high unemployment.\n  Forcing families off welfare during a recession because they cannot \nfind a job lacks commonsense. In fact, during a weak economy, low-\nskilled workers and recently employed workers are more likely to lose \ntheir jobs, and unfortunately, only 30 to 40 percent of former welfare \nrecipients who become unemployed qualify for Unemployment Insurance.\n  A single parent receiving welfare assistance while working 30 hours a \nweek who loses her job during a recession should not be penalized. For \nfamilies like this, welfare is the only unemployment insurance they \nhave. But, under current law, Federal welfare time limits and work \nrequirements continue to apply during periods of high-unemployment.\n  The Unemployment Protection for Low-Income Families through TANF Act, \nor UPLIFT Act, would require States to disregard Federal TANF \nassistance for all recipients when the national unemployment rate \nreaches or exceeds 6.5 percent or when a State unemployment rate rises \nby 1.5 percentage points over a three-month period.\n  Every percentage point increase in unemployment results in a welfare \ncaseload increase of 5 percent. In addition to enacting a strong \ncontingency fund for States experiencing high unemployment and \nincreased caseloads, Congress must act to ensure that welfare \nrecipients are not time-limited off of welfare when the economy is weak \nand jobs are in short supply. In addition to promoting self-\nsufficiency, TANF programs should be a safety net for low-income \nfamilies who are unable to find work or meet their needs.\n  My legislation will help parents who are trying to transition from \nwelfare to work, but are unable to find work during a weak economy, to \nprovide for their families without the fear of losing cash assistance. \nThe TANF program is not only about moving people from welfare to work, \nit is also about reducing poverty and helping families in need.\n  While welfare reform has succeeded at moving thousands of people into \nwork, its success has come in strong economic times. As people reach \ntheir 5-year time limits, we can only hope they will be able to find \njobs in what is now a more difficult economy. The reality is that many \nstates are experiencing high unemployment right now, making it \nextremely difficult for welfare recipients to find good paying full-\ntime jobs. We shouldn't penalize people who are trying to transition \nfrom welfare to work just because the economy is bad. We need to \ncontinue to help these families build their skills and find employment \nwhen times are tough.\n  As Congress acts to reauthorize the TANF program I ask my colleagues \nto support legislation that will protect families transitioning from \nwelfare to work from losing their benefits during a recession.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2669\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Child Care and Development Block Grant \nAct of 1990 to provide for child care quality improvements for children \nwith disabilities or other special needs, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Madam President, I rise today to join with my colleague \nand friend, Senator Mike DeWine, to announce the introduction of \nlegislation that will meaningfully improve the lives and well-being of \nchildren with disabilities and other special needs, their parents, and \nthe child care providers who care for them.\n  In recent years our commitment to helping working families afford \nchild care has grown significantly through discretionary and \nnondiscretionary allocations under the Child Care and Development Fund, \nCCDF, and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, TANF, program. \nFrom a total Federal outlay of $2.5 billion in 1997, spending on child \ncare through CCDF and TANF grew to $6.5 billion in 2000. When added to \nstate spending, total Federal and State investments in child care \nassistance reached $9.0 billion in 2000. This figure represents a \nhistoric commitment to affordable, high quality child care in America, \nand I applaud all of my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, whose \nsupport made the current levels of child care assistance possible. But \nthe past, as they say, is behind us, reauthorization for CCDF and TANF \nis looming. It is vitally important for us to understand what our \nfederal and state investments have bought us as we undertake the \ndifficult job of renewing this legislation.\n  Sadly, despite our historic Federal investments in world-class child \ncare, the services available for too many hard-working families are \nneither affordable nor of very high quality. Though 1.8 million \nchildren received assistance in 1999, the Department of Health and \nHuman Services estimated that 14.75 million children were eligible.\n  Let me repeat that, in 1999, a little under 13 million children were \nliving in working families poor enough to qualify for assistance under \nCCDF but got no help because no funds were available. Put another way, \nonly 12 percent of eligible children received assistance. And that 12 \npercent figure reflects 1999 data at the height of a historic economic \nexpansion that is now long past. The numbers of eligible families have \nundoubtedly grown, our commitments have not. We need to put the full \neffect of what we're talking about in context. The average cost of \nchild care in America exceeds $4,000 per year. That's often more than \nthe cost of tuition at many of our state colleges. $4,000 per year. For \nthe working families with kids who are eligible, whose family income \nfalls somewhere under 85 percent of the state median income level, but \nwho never receive assistance, how in the world do we expect them to \ncope? For\n\n[[Page S5959]]\n\nmost of my constituents, $4,000 is a lot of money. When I talk to \nparents in North Carolina about the challenges they face, I can assure \nyou, affordable child care is an issue parents worry a lot about.\n  Finally, what does ``affordable'' child care look like? By that, I \nmean the child care that working parents can actually afford. The data \non child care quality is daunting--85 percent of child care in America \nis rated as poor to mediocre. I invite my colleagues to think about a \nsingle young child, someone under 5, say, who they know personally. \nPerhaps someone in their family.\n  Would anyone in this body willingly permit a child to spend even one \nminute in a care setting described as ``poor to mediocre''? Think about \nwhat that means for a healthy, growing infant or toddler. Young brains \nare developing, synaptic connections forming. The child's verbal and \nmotor skills are actively expanding, growing, testing limits. \nScientists tell us that there is a fairly direct and crucial \nrelationship between the time and quality of interaction with adult \ncaregivers and the healthy social and psychological development of a \nyoung child. Enriched early learning is not a luxury. A child who \nspends its critical early years in ``poor to mediocre'' care is like a \nrunner who starts the race 20 yards behind the block. For the rest of \nhis or her life, that child will be trying to catch up. And that's not \nfair. Now imagine if that same child had a disability. If he or she had \ncerebral palsy, or a sight impairment, or a learning disorder, or \nautism. A healthy child might be able to overcome a poor to mediocre \nstart in life, but some of our most vulnerable children may not.\n  As you might expect, it is more costly for child care providers to \nserve children with disabilities or other special needs. But often, \nstates are under pressure to serve the record numbers of families who \nneed child care assistance, and additional resources for children with \ndisabilities or other special needs are not available. In many \ninstances, providers simply are not able or willing to take on the \nunique challenges of caring for a disabled child. Children's advocates \nand parents of children with disabilities have reported significant \nshortages of affordable, high quality child care for children with \ndisabilities and other special needs. These findings have been affirmed \nby the General Accounting Office, the Institute of Medicine, and the \nNational Research Council.\n  Low-income children are particularly at risk. Children in low-income \nfamilies are more likely to be disabled than children in higher income \nfamilies. Children who are poor are twice as likely to have a \nsignificant disability than their middle and upper income counterparts. \nA 2000 report based on interviews with California welfare recipients in \n1992 and 1996 found that almost 20 percent of the families had at least \none child who has a disability or illness. Low-income children also \ntend to live in poorer neighborhoods, compounding their lack of \nresources with the lack of readily available child care for special \nneeds populations. As the GAO reported in 2001, ``low-income \nneighborhoods tend to have less overall child care supply as well as \nless supply for [special needs kids] than do higher-income \nneighborhoods.''\n  Finally, many child care providers require additional training and \nother resources necessary to deliver appropriate care, or to understand \nor comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, or other \napplicable state or Federal standards.\n  The Nurturing Special Kids Act of 2002 would: set aside additional \nCCDF funding, after the Quality Set-Aside is funded, to expand access \nto affordable, high-quality child care for children with disabilities \nor other special needs; support child care programs that accept \nchildren with disabilities or other special needs; provide higher \nreimbursement rates to child care providers that reflect the additional \ncost of specialized care in the State; fund consultations by providers \nwith licensed professionals to improve identification of children with \ndisabilities or other special needs, and strengthen providers' ability \nto care for children with disabilities or other special needs; provide \na comprehensive system of training and technical assistance to enable \nchild care providers to better care for children with disabilities or \nother special needs, including compliance with ADA and other regulatory \nrequirements; provide grants for recruitment and retention of qualified \nstaff; and provide grant funding for public agencies and private non-\nprofits for projects that increase the availability of inclusive child \ncare programs, up to 50 percent special needs kids.\n  Most of us were elected to the Senate for one purpose: to stand for \nthe vulnerable and for the defenseless when we make decisions that \nshape our society's future. To ensure that, whatever we do, we secure \nfor all Americans, no matter their physical or mental disability or \nother impairment, the capacity to grow and succeed to the limits of \ntheir potential.\n  I join with my friend, Senator DeWine, in introducing the Nurturing \nSpecial Kids Act of 2002, and I invite my colleagues to share this \nresponsibility in support of affordable, high quality child care for \nchildren with disabilities or other special needs.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I rise today with my colleague and \nfriend from North Carolina, Senator Edwards, to introduce the Nurturing \nSpecial Kids Act of 2002. Our bill would expand access to affordable, \nhigh quality childcare for children with disabilities or other special \nneeds.\n  We need this bill, because the reality is that children from low-\nincome families are more likely to have disabilities or other special \nneeds. They are twice as likely as children from higher-income families \nto have a significant disability, nearly twice as likely to have \nserious mental or physical disabilities, and 1.3 times as likely to \nhave learning disabilities.\n  Parents and the disability community continually report significant \nshortages in affordable, high quality specialized childcare for \nchildren with disabilities and other unique needs. Specialized \nchildcare is costly to deliver and often requires additional training \nfor caregivers. Furthermore, many childcare centers simply cannot \nafford to create a setting that is accessible for disabled children or \nequipped to meet the physical or emotional challenges of these \nchildren.\n  Our legislation would help remedy this by providing technical \nassistance to help families locate specialized care. Additionally, the \nbill sets aside a portion of the Childcare and Development Block Grant \nfunds specifically for special needs care. This funding could be used \nto increase a special needs child voucher, or enable states to provide \nspecialized training to better understand a child's disability, provide \nproper care, or set up centers designed to provide specialized care to \nchildren with particular conditions, like autism, Down Syndrome, or \nCerebral Palsy. Additionally, our bill help disabled children, but it \nalso would help all children with special needs by providing technical \nassistance to help families locate specialized care.\n  No one can replace a parent, but parents who work outside the home \nneed to feel confident that the people caring for their children are \ngiving them the same type of love and support that they would provide. \nIn the case of a disabled child, parents also want to make sure that \nthe caretakers of their children are trained to deal with special \nneeds.\n  This bill is necessary to ensure that when parents work, they have \naccess to quality care. I urge my colleagues to join us in support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 2672. A bill to provide opportunities for collaborative \nrestoration projects on National Forest System and other public domain \nlands, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, today I am introducing legislation to \nauthorize a coordinated, consistent, community-based program to restore \nand maintain the ecological integrity of degraded National Forest \nSystem and public lands watersheds. I am pleased to be introducing this \nlegislation with Senator Craig. He has been a true champion for rural, \nnatural resource-dependent communities.\n  Two years ago, residents of Los Alamos were evacuated to escape the \nCerro Grande fire. Many ultimately lost their homes. While the \ndevastation that resulted from the fire will not soon be forgotten, \nthis event also was\n\n[[Page S5960]]\n\nsignificant because it finally focused our attention on a problem that \nhas been brewing for a long time, increasing fire risk due to the \ndegraded condition of our national forests and public lands. \nUnfortunately, the problem continues as this year's fires continue to \nthreaten numerous communities.\n  Increasing threats to people and homes as a result of forest fires is \nonly one symptom of the current condition of our national forests and \npublic lands. Water quality, water flows, animal and plant habitats are \nall adversely affected. Moreover, the health of adjacent communities is \nat risk when our national forests and public lands are in a degraded \ncondition. Restoration is desperately needed.\n  Three years ago, I introduced the Community Forest Restoration Act, a \nbill to establish a cooperative forest restoration program in New \nMexico to begin addressing this problem in a collaborative way. \nUltimately, the legislation was enacted into law. Implementation has \nbeen very successful to date.\n  Through my work on the Community Forest Restoration Act and other \nsimilar efforts, it has become clear to me that new and creative \napproaches to the management of our forests is critical to ensure a \nmeaningful future for both our federal lands and the communities that \ndepend on these lands. A major, multi-year investment in restoration \nwork on our national forests and Federal lands is a critical component \nof achieving our desired result. Senator Craig and I, as well as other \nMembers, have worked to secure increased funding for such an \ninvestment. The additional funding that Congress has approved for the \nlast few years for hazardous fuels reduction near communities is one \nexample of our success.\n  However, an investment alone is not enough. An investment in our \nnatural resources must occur in a way that benefits the rural \ncommunities located within and adjacent to our national forests and \npublic lands. I grew up in Silver City, New Mexico, a forested \ncommunity adjacent to the Gila National Forest. I learned firsthand \nthat if the forest is in good shape, the community is in good shape.\n  The Federal land managers need to respect local and traditional \nknowledge by including it in project planning. Community forestry \nrepresents a way to integrate local knowledge and science in order to \nmake the best decisions about how to take care of the land.\n  Communities are coming together to restore the ecological integrity \nand resiliency of our public lands. In New Mexico, groups such as Las \nHumanas Cooperative, the Truchas Land Grant, the Catron County Citizens \nGroup, and the Rocky Mountain Youth Corps are working to restore \nwatersheds and build a high-skill, high-wage workforce in rural \ncommunities. In the Pacific Northwest, groups such as Sustainable \nNorthwest, Wallowa Resources, and Partners for a Sustainable Methow are \nseeking ways to increase the stewardship role of local communities in \nthe maintenance and restoration of ecosystem integrity and \nbiodiversity. In California, the Watershed Research & Training Center \nis striving tirelessly to include communities in the Forest Service's \nplanning, restoration projects, and follow up monitoring of \nrestoration. At the national level, American Forests and the National \nNetwork for Forest Practitioners are important partners that are \nseeking changes in policy to ensure that community benefits are an \nintegral component of national forests and public land management.\n  The legislation that Senator Craig and I are introducing today is \nmeant to help facilitate these types of approaches nationwide. \nCommunities cannot create collaboratively restore our national forests \nand public lands alone. The Federal government is an important partner \nin this effort and this legislation will provide much needed new \nauthority and programs to assist communities.\n  A few years ago, representatives from the Forest Service's Forest \nProduct Laboratory visited my State to make recommendations on how to \nfind new markets for products created from small trees that need to be \nremoved to reduce fire threat. They noted that a lack of entrepreneurs \nand micro-businesses was a barrier to increasing the number of natural \nresource-based economic opportunities in rural communities. New Mexico \nneeds these stimuli in the private sector, as do communities across the \nWest, and this legislation will help create rural economies that depend \non maintaining the ecological resiliency of the National Forest System \nand public lands.\n  Finally, I want to emphasize that, because what we are talking about \nis new and in many ways untested, we all will need to closely monitor \nimplementation. Everyone now agrees that past policies, such as \nsystematically suppressing all wildfires, were misguided and \ncontributed to the problems we face today. But how do we avoid \nrepeating similar mistakes? Meaningful and open monitoring processes \nusing ecological and social indicators will help to ensure that the \nright policies are in place for both the land and the communities.\n  I would like to thank all of the individuals and groups who provided \ndata, input, and comments on earlier drafts of this bill. Senator Craig \nand I sought to ensure that this bill was a comprehensive approach to \nthe issue and we received a lot of assistance from many communities \nacross the country in this endeavor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, as well as letters \nof support we have received for the bill, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows.\n\n                                S. 2672\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECION 1.

Jeff Bingaman,\n     Hon. Larry Craig,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Bingaman and Craig: The Community Based \n     Forest and Public Lands Restoration Act that you are \n     introducing on Monday is yet another indication of your true \n     commitment to the health of rural communities and the \n     ecosystems in which they reside. I applaud your foresight \n     into the issues that forested communities are facing, not \n     only in the West, but also in the Nation as a whole.\n       Wallowa Resources is a non-profit, community based \n     organization that is focused on blending the needs of the \n     land and community in an area where public land issues have \n     had an incredibly negative impact on the livelihoods of \n     people and the health of the resources. Our experience with \n     collaboration, the need to build community capacity, and the \n     benefit of performing adaptive management driven by \n     monitoring have highlighted the importance of legislation \n     that is focused on restoration of our public lands. It is \n     imperative that restoration be performed with the economic \n     and social well being of communities in mind. This \n     legislation is a vehicle to address many of the most \n     challenging concerns we face.\n       Thank you again for your interest and commitment to \n     resource health and the well being of rural communities. If I \n     can be of assistance or provide additional information, \n     please feel free to contact me. I am eager to help in any way \n     possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Diane Snyder,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    Wallowa County\n\n\n                                       Board of Commissioners,\n\n                                   State of Oregon, June 21, 2002.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Hon. Larry Craig,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Bingaman and Craig: As an elected official in \n     Wallowa County, I struggle every day with the economic \n     realities for public land communities in the Northwest. We \n     continue to see high unemployment rates, high poverty levels, \n     decreasing school enrollment, changing demographics as \n     traditional employment opportunities dwindle. We are \n     fortunate here in Wallowa County to have had the foresight to \n     begin collaborative processes in the early 1990's with the \n     creation of the Wallowa County/Nez Perce Tribe Salmon \n     Recovery Plain.\n       I am proud to tell you that the remaining citizens of \n     Wallowa County are resilient and have begun to embark on a \n     restoration-based economy. We long for the day that many \n     contractors will be active in the forest performing a myriad \n     of restoration activities, valued-added processing centers \n     will be buzzing with activity, and entrepreneurs will be \n     financially rewarded for innovation with small diameter wood. \n     We must retain the skilled workforce and their families and \n     we must ensure that they have the opportunity to benefit \n     economically for the work that they do.\n       Introduction of the Community Based Forest and Public Lands \n     Restoration Act is a step toward reinvigorating rural \n     communities and restoring health to the ecosystems in which \n     they live. On behalf of my community and many, many others \n     across the nation, thank you for recognizing our needs and \n     working to address them.\n       I urge you to forward this legislation as expeditiously as \n     you can and escort it through the appropriations process. \n     Adequate funding for this legislation is critical to its \n     success. If I can be of service in this endeavor, please feel \n     free to call upon me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Mike Hayward,\n     Chair.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        The Watershed Research and\n\n\n                                              Training Center,\n\n                                       Hayford, CA, June 20, 2002.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Hon. Larry Craig,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Bingaman and Craig: I am writing to express \n     our support for the bill you are introducing today, the \n     Community Based Forest and Public Lands Restoration Act. \n     There is a great need for stronger and more consistent annual \n     investment in programs that protect, restore, and maintain \n     public lands and resources. We applaud your bipartisan effort \n     to develop community-based programs to meet these objectives. \n     We are especially pleased with the focus on implementing \n     projects in a way that promotes collaboration, builds \n     community capacity, and establishes multi-party monitoring. \n     These emphases are consistent with the principles of \n     community-based forestry that we and our community partners \n     have developed over recent years.\n       The Watershed Center has been working with USFS/BLM \n     partners for over 10 years to try to build the local \n     workforce for restoration on public lands. We are ecstatic \n     that you are providing congressional leadership for building \n     a new vision for community stewardship and a new reality for \n     forest restoration.\n       We believe your bill is an excellent vehicle for addressing \n     some of the most challenging concerns facing resource \n     managers and resource-dependent communities in the United \n     States. Hazardous fuels build-up, insect-infestation, and the \n     degradation of fish and wildlife habitat are among key \n     concerns on the land.

Jeff Bingaman,\n     Hon. Larry Craig,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Bingaman and Craig: I am writing to express \n     our support for the bill you are introducing today, the \n     Community Based Forest and Public Lands Restoration Act. \n     There is a great need for stronger and more consistent annual \n     investment in programs that protect, restore, and maintain \n     public lands and resources. We applaud your bipartisan effort \n     to develop community-based programs to meet these objectives. \n     We are especially pleased with the focus on implementing \n     projects in a way that promotes collaboration, builds \n     community capacity, and establishes multi-party monitoring. \n     These emphases are consistent with the principles of \n     community-based forestry that we and our community partners \n     have developed over recent years.\n       American Forests is the oldest national nonprofit \n     organization in the U.S. Since 1875, we have worked with \n     scientists, resource managers, policymakers, and citizens to \n     promote policies and programs that help people improve the \n     environment with trees and forests. We partner with public \n     and private organizations in communities around the country \n     providing technical information and resources to leverage \n     local actions.\n       We believe your bill is an excellent vehicle for addressing \n     some of the most challenging concerns of facing resource \n     managers and resource-dependent communities in the United \n     States. Hazardous fuels build-up, insect infestation, and the \n     degradation of fish and wildlife habitat are among key \n     concerns on the land. Collaborative projects involving \n     communities present promising means to address these problems \n     while building community capacity. The American public \n     depends on public and private organizations and the workers \n     in resource-dependent communities to do ever-more-critical \n     restoration work on our federal lands. The technical and \n     financial assistance, opportunities for partnerships, \n     innovative contracting mechanisms, program of applied \n     research, and monitoring activities in your bill are critical \n     to achieving the restoration and maintenance of our public \n     lands ecosystems and to sustaining the rural economies \n     dependent upon them.\n       We appreciate your leadership in calling attention to the \n     need to increase support for collaborative, community-based \n     restoration projects. If we can be of any assistance with \n     respect to your new bill, we stand ready to help.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Deborah Gangloff,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, today I am introducing legislation to \nauthorize a community-based forestry program aimed at ensuring small \nbusinesses in small rural communities have the ability to participate \nin all land management programs that the Forest\n\n[[Page S5963]]\n\nService and the Bureau of Land Management undertake through contract \nservices. I am pleased to be introducing this legislation with Senator \nBingaman. His persistence in working on this legislation is a testament \nto his interest in sound forest management that is good for the \nenvironment, as well as good for thousands of small rural communities.\n  Senator Bingaman and I both understand that we have fundamental \nproblems with the management of many of our public lands. We both have \nseen the devastation that catastrophic fires are imposing on our \nWestern forests. Two years ago as a result of the Cerro Grande Fire \nthat consumed portions of Los Alamos, New Mexico, many Americans had to \nface up to the deplorable forest health conditions and the devastating \nimpacts of these catastrophic fires. The recent fires in Colorado, New \nMexico and now Eastern Arizona are re-enforcing the message that we \nsimply cannot stand back and ignore the deplorable health conditions in \nour public forests.\n  While many in the West, including Senator Bingaman and myself, have \nlong understood the challenge of poor forest health followed by these \nconflagrations, nothing focuses your attention like a community in your \nState consumed in a raging forest fire. As a result of this watershed \nevent, Congress put together the funding for the National Fire Plan.\n  Having grown up near Cascade, ID, I know that large forest fires are \nnot new to our community. But when in the space of three years a third \nof two national forests were consumed in large intense fires, such as \nthose that occurred on the Boise and Payette National Forest in 1994 \nand 1996, you are forced to conclude something has gone haywire with \nour public land's management.\n  For a number of years I watched the implementation of the Pacific \nNorthwest Forest Plan. I watched to see if the community assistance \nfunding would trickle down to the small communities and to the workers \nthat were displaced as a result of the plan. Sadly, the evidence is \nthat in the smaller more rural communities many of the displaced \nworkers did not benefit from those programs.\n  In 2000, with the help of Senator Bingaman, Senator Wyden and I \nintroduced and passed the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-\nDetermination Act. This legislation includes provisions to empower \nrural communities to work with the federal land managers to undertake \nconsensus-based projects designed to help meet the resource needs of \nthe agency and to develop projects that will generate the economic \nactivity so desperately needed in many of our small rural communities. \nIn spite of our success Senator Bingaman and I knew that more had to be \ndone.\n  We understood that we needed to construct more opportunities for our \nFederal land managers to work cooperatively with the people living in \nthese rural communities. We understood that we needed to change \ndynamics so the knowledge, logic and wisdom harbored within the citizen \nof these small rural communities could be tapped to improve our public \nlands.\n  The legislation that we are introducing today will authorize the \nestablishment of Restoration and Value-Added Centers designed to help \nsmall communities and business be better prepared to help our Federal \nland managers complete the forest management work that our forests so \ndesperately need.\n  When Congress directed the Forest Service, BLM and other land \nmanagement agencies to develop the National Fire Management Plan, and \nthen increased funding for fire prevention, suppression, and \nrestoration activities, many of the proponents expected much of the \nwork would be funneled to smaller communities to take advantage of the \nexpertise that exists in these communities, as well as to help \nstabilize the economies of these areas. Sadly most of the Federal \nagency's funding and efforts have been consumed with fire fighting and \nby the looks of this fire season that is not going to improve any time \nsoon. Very little restoration work to reduce the risk of intense fires \nbefore they occur has been undertaken. Thus, we have not seen \nsufficient efforts made to take advantage of the human resource located \nin these small rural communities.\n  I believe the legislation Senator Bingaman and I are introducing \ntoday will help the Federal land managers take advantage of the local \nand traditional knowledge as well as take advantage of the under \nutilized woods workforces that have been put out of work over the last \ndecade. This legislation will help small community and consensus-based \ngroups who are eager to undertake work designed to improve our public \nlands. It will help our federal land managers reestablish a close \nworking relationship with these communities and it will be very good \nfor the public land.\n  Like any new experimental program we have included a number of \nprovisions that first are designed to phase into these new \nrelationships and secondly, designed to ensure that the Restoration and \nValue-Added Centers will not become a long term financial burden to the \nAmerican public. We have included provisions to shift away from federal \nfinancing and toward private funding sources five years after the \nopening of the centers. Additionally, we have included monitoring \nprovisions so we can track these new programs and make corrections as \nneeded.\n  Finally, I would be remiss if I did not recognize the coalition who \nhelped to form and clarify the thinking of Senator Bingaman and myself \nas we developed this proposal. We held lengthy hearings to which many \nin the coalition traveled long distances to participate. They have been \ninspirational in their willingness to think outside the box and to work \nwith our staff to refine this proposal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/24/senate-section/article/S5963-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 289--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT A \n     COMMEMORATIVE POSTAGE STAMP SHOULD BE ISSUED TO CELEBRATE THE \n                 BICENTENNIAL OF THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself and Mr. Breaux) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs:\n\n                              S.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) \n     established the National Urban Search and Rescue Response \n     System in 1989 pursuant to requirement in the Earthquakes \n     Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 which directed FEMA to provide \n     adequate search and rescue capacity in the event of an \n     earthquake.\n       (2) once the President has issued a major disaster \n     declaration following a request by a governor, FEMA may \n     activate up to three task forces that are closest to the \n     disaster and additional task forces may be activated as \n     necessary;\n       (3) each task force must be able to deploy all personnel \n     and equipment within six hours of activation and are expected \n     to be able to sustain themselves for the first 72 hours of \n     operations;\n       (4) each task force must be capable of deploying at least \n     62 fully trained individuals, with each position staffed \n     three deep to ensure the availability of at least two \n     alternatives available in reserve for each position for a \n     total of 186 members in each task force;\n       (5) task forces are supported by Incident Support Teams \n     which provide technical assistance to state and local \n     emergency managers, coordinate the activities of multiple \n     task forces and provide logistical support;\n       (6) in fiscal year 2001, FEMA provided $7,200,000 to the \n     task forces for training and equipment, allocated according \n     to need;\n       (7) in fiscal year 2001, FEMA provided some $6,000,000 for \n     upgrading the capability of six task forces to respond to \n     disaster resulting from the use of weapons of mass \n     destruction, including the capacity to search and provide \n     assistance in an environment with chemical, biological, or \n     radiological contamination;\n       (8) there currently are 28 task forces throughout the \n     United States;\n       (9) since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the \n     need for fully equipped and trained task forces is obvious;\n       (10) by noon of September 12, 2001, eight task forces were \n     working valiantly with the courageous New York firefighters \n     to address the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the \n     World Trade Center, four task forces responded to the attacks \n     on the Pentagon, and 25 of 28 task forces were deployed over \n     a three-week period;\n       (11) each task force is currently in need of additional \n     training and support equipment with each task force being \n     deployed with some 80,000 lbs. of search, rescue and support \n     equipment valued at some $1,800,000;\n       (12) each task force is supported by some $150,000 per year \n     in operating costs with with needs of approximately \n     $1,500,000 to maintain optimum operational efficiency;\n       (13) many task forces have inadequate transportation to \n     ensure a timely response to disasters, including acts of \n     terrorism;\n       (14) the cost of maintaining FEMA's Incident Support Teams \n     as part of the search and rescue task forces is $5,000,000 \n     per year;\n       (15) the Federal Government needs to ensure that each task \n     force is adequately trained and equipped to perform urban \n     search and rescue functions in all environments, including \n     the aftermath from acts of terrorism involving weapons of \n     mass destruction;\n       (16) the Federal Government needs to ensure that each task \n     force has adequate equipment to meet all operational needs \n     and staff support.\n       (17) the Federal Government needs to ensure that each task \n     force has the capability to put two full teams in the field \n     to meet any disaster or act of terrorism;\n       (18) the Federal Government needs to ensure that designated \n     task forces have the capability to deploy internationally to \n     provide search and rescue functions vital to our interests \n     and those of our allies; and\n       (19) while these task forces were originally created for \n     earthquake response, these highly capable task forces have an \n     expanding and vital role in responding to acts of terrorism, \n     including those involving weapons of mass destruction.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this act is to provide the \n     needed funds, equipment and training to ensure that all urban \n     search and rescue task forces have the full capability to \n     respond to all emergency search and rescue needs arising from \n     any disaster, including acts of terrorism involving a weapon \n     of mass destruction.\n\n     SEC. 3303.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 290, which was submitted \nearlier today by Senator Smith of New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 290) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate regarding the designation of June 24, 2002, through \n     July 24, 2002, as French Heritage Month (Le Mois De \n     L'Heritage Francais).\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, today is June 24, St. \nJean Baptiste Day, or St. John the Baptist Day, a day of recognition \nand remembrance.\n  Today is also the first day of ``French Heritage Month'' in many \nStates. This month also encompasses Bastille Day.\n  I believe that we should also recognize the contributions of French \nAmericans at the national level. This resolution will do just that.\n  Many of my constituents in New Hampshire are of French descent. New \nHampshire also, along with many other States, shares a common border \nwith Quebec. Our French-Canadian partners have been great allies and \npartners in trade. Millions of Americans trace their ancestry to \nFrance, Quebec, Acadia or other French-speaking parts of the world.\n  Many of my fellow Granite Staters are proud of their French heritage, \nas well they should, because the French heritage brings with it the \nvirtues of liberty and freedom; virtues that helped us win our war for \nindependence.\n  King Louis XVI, the Marquis De LaFayette, and other brave Frenchmen \nmade immeasurable contributions in our war for independence.\n  After we won our independence, Alexis De Toqueville fell in love with \nour young country, and his writings on our fledgling democracy are \nstill read by American students today.\n  French Maj. Charles Pierre L'Enfant helped design the city plan of \nour Nation's Capital.\n\n[[Page S5967]]\n\n  The Statue of Liberty was presented as a gift from France to the \npeople of New York.\n  Our shared virtues also helped us win two of the greatest wars \nagainst totalitarianism that this world has ever seen.\n  Over the years, the Franco-American people have given us many \nculinary delights, artistic pleasures, and a unique devotion to liberty \nand citizenship without which our Nation would not be the same.\n  Our Franco-American community has enriched our common culture, and \nmany Franco-Americans are productive members of our society.\n  Franco-Americans bring a unique perspective and contribute to the \ndiversity of our country, and they should be recognized as such.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution and preamble be agreed to; that the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table; and that any statements regarding this matter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
