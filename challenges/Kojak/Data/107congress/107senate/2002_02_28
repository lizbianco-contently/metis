Mr. President, I see here one of the persons responsible \nfor the amendment that has brought the Senate to a standstill--Senator \nWyden. I think it is really too bad that the amendment has brought the \nSenate to a standstill.\n  The opponents of the Schumer-Wyden amendment claim they are seeking \nto eliminate fraud and that is why they oppose the amendment. Well, of \ncourse, everybody in the Senate is against fraud. However, we over here \nbelieve that also we must do anything we can to stop disenfranchisement \nof voters.\n  I think it is so important to recognize that we need to encourage \npeople to vote, and vote honestly. Nobody is encouraging people to vote \nby fraud. But by holding up this legislation--and that is what is \nhappening--the opponents are preventing, among other things, $3 billion \ngoing to the States for election reform efforts.\n  My State, Nevada, needs this money very badly. We have the most \nmodern machines you can buy in southern Nevada, in Las Vegas. They are \nelectronic, beautiful, and they are without fail. But in the other 16 \ncounties, we have a mishmash of other types of machines. In the 1998 \nelection Senator Ensign had with me, we had a registrar of voters in \nWashoe County, Reno, NV, who wanted to save the county money, so she \nhad printed the ballots herself. They were approximately a 16th or a \n32nd of an inch off. A lot of them didn't count. They didn't match the \nmachines. It created all kinds of problems. In addition to that, there \nwere--because of the inappropriateness of the machines--a number of \nballots that were not counted because they were not put into the \nmachines correctly.\n  In other counties, we have old-fashioned, very old punchcard \nmachines. This legislation would allow the State of Nevada to have all \ngood machines. That is one of the things being held up here--$3 billion \nin funding going to the States for election reform efforts.\n  The secretary of state of Nevada, one of the most progressive \nsecretaries of state, has been in conference with Senator Dodd on this \nlegislation. He is a Republican, by the way. He loves our legislation \nand thinks it should pass. He likes the amendment of the Senator from \nOregon. We have letters from secretaries of state of Arkansas, \nKentucky, and North Carolina, to name a few, who have strong \nreservations with the bill's original language dealing with \nidentification.\n  Currently, there are 19 States and the District of Columbia that have \nsignature verification. An additional 22 States use a signature system \nin conjunction with something else.\n  No eligible voter should be prevented from casting their vote. \nRemember, this bill still has to go to conference, and one of the \nthings that so troubles me with the minority is the President of the \nUnited States is a member of their party. The leadership in the House \nis all Republican. So when we go to conference with this bill, we are \nin the minority because we are dealing with the President and the \nRepublican leadership in the House. So I cannot understand why they \nwill not let this legislation move on and go to conference. It is as if \nthey are changing the rules in the middle of the game.\n  Legislation has come before the Senate, an amendment was offered and \nwas adopted. Does that mean anytime legislation comes before this body \nand an amendment is offered to it we just close up and go on to \nsomething else? If that is the case, then we should do everything in \ncommittee and forget about action by the full Senate.\n  By holding up this important legislation, we are wasting valuable \ntime that could be spent on, for example, the energy bill or campaign \nfinance reform. I am terribly disappointed we are not moving forward. I \nhope cloture will be invoked tomorrow.\n  I say to my friend from Oregon, I have been tremendously impressed \nwith the State of Oregon and their method of election. The two Senators \nfrom Oregon who voted in favor, of course, of the amendment that \nSenator Wyden offered were elected by virtue of ballots cast by mail.\n  I followed very closely what went on in Oregon. I have not heard an \niota from newspapers or any other commentary that there was anything \nwrong with the election. I have never known anyone to say there was any \nfraud in electing Senator Wyden or Senator Smith. They were elected by \nmail.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Not only is the Senator right, but Senator Smith, in \nparticular, deserves great credit because in a very close election, he \nmade no assertions that there was any fraud in the election.\n  My question is, Is the Senator from Nevada aware of any evidence of \nany studies or analyses indicating that these vote-by-mail elections \nare tainted by fraud? I am not aware of any. Senator Smith deserves a \nlot of credit because he could have raised that issue in our election, \nand he declined to do it.\n  Is the Senator aware of any evidence of fraud in these races?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, the evidence speaks for \nitself. The Senator from Oregon courageously stepped forward yesterday \nand was the only Republican to vote in favor of Senator Wyden's \namendment. Why did he do that? Because he knows the process in Oregon \nis good.\n  I think we, as Senators, have to do everything we can to stimulate \nvoter turnout, to make it easier. I am in favor of voting 2 days. In \nNevada, I am in favor of--we are a 24-hour town--voting all night long. \nWe have to do everything we can to allow more participation.\n  I am so impressed with what North Dakota does. In North Dakota, if \nyou want to vote, come on in, we will let you vote. They have same-day \nregistration. Imagine that. I have talked to my friend from North \nDakota, and I have never heard--and I do not think he has either--of \nany fraud.\n  We live in a world of computers. People are going to cheat. It is \neasy to find out if they cheat.\n\n  We should do everything we can to move forward with allowing people \nto vote. We should not make it harder for them to vote. We should make \nit easier for them to vote.\n  I applaud my friend from Oregon for working on this legislation so \nhard and, I think, making the legislation so much better. Recognizing \nthere is a problem with it, let us work it out in conference and not \nsay we are going to close up shop and not allow us to move forward on \nthis legislation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I, too, compliment the distinguished \nSenator from Oregon for his outstanding work and leadership on this \nissue. He has gone the extra mile to find a way to resolve this matter. \nI know he has worked diligently over the last several weeks. He and I \nhave talked about this matter on a number of occasions.\n  I think Oregon has been the leader in this country in innovative ways \nto encourage broader voter participation. He so ably represents his \nState. On this particular issue, no one has provided greater leadership \nand more insight on what we can do to improve participation than he \nhas.\n  I join with my colleague from Nevada in thanking him and commending \nhim for his efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/28/senate-section/article/S1328-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1328-S1329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AMERICA'S STEEL INDUSTRY\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask the indulgence of my colleagues. I \nhave a short statement that I will use my leader time to make. It \ninvolves a matter I know is of great concern to a number of our \ncolleagues. I wish to make a couple of remarks with regard to the so-\ncalled 201 decision to be made by the administration relating to steel.\n  The last few years have been among the worst in history for the \nAmerican steel industry. In just the last 2 years, 31 steel companies \nhave filed for bankruptcy. Since January of 2000, more than 50 steel-\nmaking or related plants have shut down or been idle. Steel prices are \nnow at their lowest level in 20 years.\n  This crisis has been devastating for steelworkers, their families, \nand communities. Over 43,000 steelworkers have\n\n[[Page S1329]]\n\nlost their jobs, and another 600,000 retirees and their surviving \nspouses are in danger of losing their health care benefits because the \ncompanies that once employed them are now facing bankruptcy.\n  A number of those families are in Washington today. In talking with \nthem, one quickly realizes the numbers do not even begin to capture the \npain they are feeling and the insecurity they face about their very \nfuture.\n  These families are hurting because this important sector of our \neconomy is competing against global competitors who unfairly benefit \nfrom government subsidies or have resorted to flooding our Nation with \nimports.\n  Seven months ago, the President initiated what is called a section \n201 investigation. This investigation, conducted by the International \nTrade Commission, found unanimously that imports have caused serious \ninjury. That means under our trade laws the steel industry deserves an \nimmediate and effective remedy.\n\n  In less than a week, by March 6, the President has to make his final \nruling on what that remedy will be. But we already know the right \nremedy. The remedy is a 40-percent tariff rate for 4 years. That would \nbe an effective enforcement of our trade laws and the right thing to do \nfor hard-hit steelworker families.\n  There is one other action the President must take, and that is lead \non the issue of promoting consolidation and the protection of \nretirement health benefits, the benefits that were promised years ago \nto workers by companies that are now teetering on the verge of \nbankruptcy.\n  These benefits are so-called legacy costs. They really are a lifeline \nfor 600,000 retirees and their surviving spouses and a measure of our \ncommitment to the healthy and decent retirement these workers have \nearned.\n  America's steelworkers have literally built this Nation, from \nskyscrapers that define us, to the military that defends us. In the \nprocess, they have proven they can compete against any workers anywhere \nin the world and win, so long as the rules are fair.\n  In a very real sense, the future of the steel industry in America \nhinges on the administration's decision. So today we are asking the \nadministration to use this historic opportunity to do the right thing \nfor America's steelworkers, their industry, and the retirement health \nbenefits on which they depend.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank my colleagues for their willingness to \naccommodate me.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/28/senate-section/article/S1329-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1329-S1330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ELECTION REFORM\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I just happened to catch the last of the \nremarks of my very good friend, the distinguished majority whip, about \nwhat has happened with this election reform bill.\n  We ought to get the record straight. My good friend mentioned the \nfact that we seem to be holding this up over one little amendment. I \nwill tell you what this is all about, Mr. President. We worked long and \nhard to come to a reasonable, responsible compromise because the \nSenator from Connecticut very eloquently made the case that we need to \nmake it easier to vote, and I agree with that.\n  We worked on his portion of the bill. He made some compromises that \ntook care of some of our concerns, but at the same time I tried to \ntestify before the Rules Committee, and I came to the floor and made \nthe case that there is another problem that is as serious a problem as \nmaking it difficult for somebody to vote, and that is diluting their \nvote with fraudulent, improper votes.\n  I have laid out for this body a number of times the fact that vote \nfraud continues to exist in Missouri and too many other States. So I \nproposed some solutions to give us some minimal protection against vote \nfraud in the future.\n  As part of the compromise, it was pointed out by my colleagues on the \nother side that requiring the photo ID may be too difficult, or \nrequiring them to vote in person may be too difficult, although seven \nStates do it, and I think that makes a lot of sense. St. Louis, MO, \nafter we called attention to the vote fraud committed in November of \n2000, decided to require photo IDs at the poll in the mayoral primary. \nDo you know something. It worked. We did not hear any complaints that \npeople could not vote. They had an honest election in St. Louis.\n  I was willing to compromise with my colleagues, the Senator from \nConnecticut, the Senator from New York, and the Senator from New \nJersey, and say if it is too burdensome to require a photo ID, let us \ngo down the list and see what other things could be done. That is why \nwe added that a bank statement with one's name and address can be used, \nor a utility bill, a government check, a paycheck, to try to make it \npossible so that one time in the process they would have to have proof \nthat they were a real live human being.\n  Now our friends on the other side made fun of the fact that we had \ndogs registered to vote in Missouri and in Maryland. Well, that sounds \nkind of crazy, but the system is so sloppy, the motor voter law has \nmade it possible for people to register dogs. I will guarantee there \nare a lot more fraudulent votes than just the dogs.\n  Some have objected and said we have not shown widespread fraud in St. \nLouis. Oh, yes, we have. Wherever we have looked, we have found fraud. \nWherever we have looked, we have found ineligible people voting, dead \npeople voting, felons voting--in Virginia, Wisconsin, California, \nColorado, North Carolina, Indiana, Florida, and Texas.\n  What we found that in Missouri they had judges ordering people to be \nregistered to vote. They went before a judge, and he said: Why are you \nnot registered? One said: I am a Democrat. Another one said: I want to \nvote for Gore. Another one said: I have been a felon and forgot to \nreregister. Thirteen hundred people were registered by judge order. The \nsecretary of state went back and did an exhaustive search on those \n1,300 and found 97 percent of them were not lawful votes.\n  In the mayoral primary in 2001, 3,000 postcard registrations were \ndumped on the election board on the last day. At that point, my \ncolleagues in the other party in St. Louis, who were a lot more \nconcerned about stealing a mayor's race than they were about stealing a \nGovernor's race or President's race or a Senate race, raised cane.\n  When those postcard registrations were looked at, they were all found \nto have had the same handwriting--many of them had the same \nhandwriting. They were on one or two blocks. Those have all been turned \nover to the prosecuting authorities. We have not gotten any convictions \nyet.\n  We also know that right before the general election in November of \n2000, 30,000 postcard registrations were dumped on the St. Louis city \nelection board. Nobody has gone back and reviewed them, but the guess \nis that at least 15,000 of them were fraudulent. Is it not a little bit \nbeyond credibility that St. Louis, which had 200,000 registered voters, \nwould on the last 2 days of registration register 30,000 people, equal \nto 15 percent?\n  That is one of the reasons St. Louis has almost as many registered \nvoters as it has adults. It would be truly remarkable if each one of \nthose registrations equaled a registration of somebody who was an adult \nhuman being entitled to vote in Missouri. I do not believe it. We have \nnot had the resources to go back and check.\n  Frankly, as the Senator from Pennsylvania pointed out yesterday, it \nis very difficult, particularly under motor voter, to prosecute people \nwho register illegally. Why? Because there is nobody there. You sign \nsomebody else's name, send it in, and say I promise to, with a \nsignature affirmation and verification. I could register all my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle in a Republican area of \nMissouri, and we would have signatures on their mail-in ballots every \ntime. This time they might be voting our way rather than the other way.\n  I believe some of the people arguing against the bill yesterday were \nwoefully uninformed about what this bill requires. I say to my friend \nfrom Oregon, this only applies to people registering after the bill \nbecomes law. It only applies one time, either when you register or when \nyou vote for the first time. You have to show something that would tend \nto prove you are a live human being, living where you said you were, \nentitled to vote.\n\n[[Page S1330]]\n\n  Concern was expressed over provisional voting, and the registration--\nthe identification goes into effect immediately. Right now, 39 States \nhave either provisional voting or same-day registration. I did not \ndraft that part of the bill that says provisional voting would only go \ninto effect in 2004. We would be happy to move it up for the other 11 \nStates so it takes effect immediately.\n  The Senator from Oregon made a very good point in his discussions \nyesterday: When a person registers, we ought to make sure when they \nregister that they are legitimate voters. I agree 100 percent.\n  Do you know what. Motor voter prevents verification of the \nregistration, as it now stands. That is why we had to amend it.\n  There was a lot of discussion yesterday about how many people we \nwould disenfranchise, and they postulated hundreds of thousands, maybe \nmillions, of people would be disenfranchised because they would not \nhave a photo ID, a utility bill, a bank statement, a government check, \nthat shows their address. I think that is hogwash.\n  There may be a handful of people who do not have that, but we have \nmoney in the bill for the States to go out and affirmatively identify \nand provide registration for people who fall through the cracks. I am \nhappy to put a provision in there saying the States--if on application \nby somebody who is entitled to vote, who does not have any of these \ndocuments, they can get a State or an election board identification \ncard. Put the burden on the States when somebody shows they have none \nof these articles or identifiers. I think that might be one-hundredth \nof a percent at the maximum.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/28/senate-section/article/S1330-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I do not need an additional 10 minutes. I \nhave said all the things I need to say.\n  It is not just my view that signature affirmation or verification \ndoes not work. Professor Melody Rose of Portland State University in \nOregon has pointed out the significant numbers, 60,000 to 80,000, \nperhaps, who signed someone else's ballot or had someone else mark it \nfor them. There were problems in Oregon.\n  The Carter-Ford commission said signature verification and \naffirmation is not adequate, it is inaccurate. Check page 31 of the \nreport. Why? You sign a mail-in registration which cannot be checked \nunder motor voter; you put a signature on it--it could be a dog, a dead \nalderman, a neighbor, a fictitious brother--and every time you vote as \nthat person, your signature will match the signature that you put on \nfraudulently when you registered that person.\n  I knew when we took on fraud, fraud would fight back. I want to make \nsure everybody understands that the deal we worked out was widely \npraised. The Senator from New York said we ought to come together \nbecause we have a good bill. I agree. I thought we had a good bill. We \nmade a lot of compromises. There is money there to improve the voting \nsystem and get statewide registration to make it easier for those with \ndisabilities to vote, to cut down on fraud, to have provisional voting. \nThat is a reasonable, rational system.\n  I believe this body cannot go down the road saying we are making it \neasier to vote and harder to cheat. They blow a huge hole in the voter \nfraud section by saying all you have to do is sign your name or sign a \ndog's name or sign a dead person's name or sign a fictitious brother or \nsister's name. That is what this is all about.\n  I am not the one trying to torpedo this bill. We had a torpedo in \nmidship, yesterday, from people who had been part of the compromise on \ngrounds I do not think were legitimate. I think there was some \nmisunderstanding by many. We talked to staff people who did not realize \nthe aspects I just pointed out, the fact that it is a one-time \nregistration, only for people who register after this goes into effect. \nThey said, maybe people will be disenfranchised. We will do everything \nin our power to make sure that does not happen.\n  Fraud has been proven. Fraud is alive and well in Missouri. There is \na whole list of other places where fraud exists.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BOND. I am happy to yield the floor, and I am happy to respond to \nany of my colleagues.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I have been listening to the Senator as we had a debate \non the amendment. The Senator from Oregon and I have added to his \nproposal. I have been very mindful of the passion of the Senator from \nMissouri about fraud. I respect it, appreciate it, and do not belittle \nit in any way. He has been through it.\n  If the Senator says there has been a large amount of fraud in \nMissouri, I am not here to quarrel with that. He knows his State better \nthan I do. All I ask is to understand where this Senator is coming \nfrom. The Senator from Oregon and I are coming from slightly different \nplaces because our systems are different. In New York--and I checked \nagain yesterday; we called around the State, people not just of one \nparty or another--there has been almost no allegation of any kind of \nfraud with our system, which is a signature system.\n  Yet I do know one thing. If we were to adopt the section he proposed, \nit would make it more difficult for many of our citizens to vote. We \nhave 8 million people in New York. About 6 million, a little over than \nthat, are above voting age. Only 3 million have driver's licenses. Half \nthe people in New York City don't have driver's licenses. A good number \nof those--there are no statistics, as there are no statistics, really, \non fraud in our State; it is what you hear and know of your State--a \ngood number of those do not have a utility bill to exhibit.\n  Having spent a lot of time at polling places, which I do in New York, \nas does the Senator in Missouri, I know how worried and scared lots of \nour voters are--new voters, people who voted for the first time, even \nif they are 30 or 40 years old.\n  I say to the Senator, I respect his passion to try to deal with \nfraud. Fraud is terrible for the system. As the Senator knows, except \nfor this provision, I have been fully supportive in our meetings of all \nthe other items--the registration lists and everything else--that the \nSenator has added to the bill. I believe he has made it a better bill.\n  My question to the Senator: Is there a way we can deal with the \nproblems in Missouri and still deal with the problems in New York and \nmove this bill forward? That is what I would like to do. I know the \nSenator from Connecticut has some ideas and others have some ideas. I \nask the Senator if he has any thoughts about that. Perhaps we are not--\nI pray, we are not--on an irreconcilable course.\n  I yield.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am very pleased to hear that fraud does \nnot exist in New York. That is reassuring.\n  I pointed out yesterday that 14,000 New York City residents were also \nregistered to vote in south Florida. Would\n\n[[Page S1331]]\n\nthe Senator care to make a friendly wager that none of them voted \ntwice?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. In answer to my friend's question, I would ask the \nSenator to give me a single instance of people who voted twice. Here is \nwhy: The way our voting rolls work, it would be cleared up by the bill. \nYou must remain on the voting rolls for a minimum, I believe, of 8 \nyears once you stop voting. So every day probably 1,000 people from New \nYork move to south Florida.\n  My guess is there are more than 14,000 people on the voting rolls in \nNew York and south Florida because you are not stricken from the rolls \nin New York even if you have not voted for 6 years. That is not an \nindication of any fraud whatever. If the Senator from Missouri could \ncome forward and show me even 10 cases where this happened--maybe it \nhas, but we don't have evidence of it, and we certainly don't have \nevidence that anyone is organized to do it. It is just the way our \nsystem works.\n  I am sure there is occasional fraud in New York. I said to the \nSenator there is no instance of widespread or organized fraud, of large \nnumbers of people who come in and vote fraudulently, organized by \nsomeone or not.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I make a friendly wager that maybe quite a \nfew of those people voted twice.\n  I think the Senator from New York has raised a point we did not \nadequately address. It was a point raised by the Senator from Montana \nwho said there has to be a more effective way of getting those voters \nno longer living in the State off the rolls. That causes confusion.\n  In Montana they have many people who come in and register while they \nare at college, then move away. If we are going to go back and \ncompromise again, I told some people yesterday this compromise on \nelection reform is like loading frogs in a wheelbarrow: I keep thinking \nI have a half wheelbarrow full, and I come back with the frogs and the \nwheelbarrow is empty.\n  We need to be able to clean up those rolls. Eight years means there \nis a lot of confusion and a lot of opportunity. We will be happy to \nwork on that.\n\n  The second point the Senator from New York has pointed out is there \nmay well be voters in New York who do not have a driver's license. \nGranted. When I lived in New York, I was scared to death to drive. I \nwas scared to death of taxicabs, but I sure wouldn't take a bike. I did \nnot keep a car in New York City when I lived there.\n  They may not have a paycheck. Some of them don't even get a \ngovernment check of any kind.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Right.\n  Mr. BOND. Some of them don't even have a bank account. I think that \nis a rather small universe. But I am willing to make explicit what I \nbelieve is already in the law--staff on the majority side has assured \nus it is already in the law--that money can be used. But I will be \nhappy to make it explicit. If you have Joe or Jane Doe, who do not have \nany of those things, we should be providing the money to the \nregistration authority to give them a card or to ascertain their \nregistration and get them registered. If they don't have any of those \nitems, they ought to have a chance to be registered. We ought to \nidentify them.\n  The Carter-Ford commission says one should have an identifying \nnumber. That would help us a lot. Carter-Ford pointed out that, No. 1, \nsignature verification doesn't work--and I can assure you, it doesn't \nwork from our side, from what we have seen in Missouri.\n  Those are the outlines that I think would work.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The additional time allotted to the \nSenator from Missouri has expired. The Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized under the previous order.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Missouri is in the \nChamber. I want to make a comment to address some of the concerns the \nSenator has voiced.\n  In particular, with respect to the process that has been followed, I \nwas not involved in any of the negotiations with the Senator from \nMissouri. I made it very clear I am interested in meeting him halfway \nin trying to find some common ground. We have been talking since the \nvote yesterday--Senator Dodd, Senator McConnell, Senator Schumer, \nSenator Bond, myself--really, hour after hour since yesterday. I do \nbelieve at this point there is a framework for a genuine compromise \nthat could allow this bill to go forward. I want to outline what I \nthink that framework is because we all ought to try to come together \nand get a bill.\n  I was asked yesterday by the press and others: Maybe those on the \nother side just don't want a bill? I stuck up for the Senator from \nMissouri. I said I believe he wants a bill. I think he wants us to come \ntogether. We have some differences of opinion.\n  Here is the framework for what in my view is a genuine compromise. \nWhat we ought to try to do is tighten up at the front end of the \nprocess. Let's tighten up with respect to registration. That is the \nbest way to deter fraud. Right now, the tough antifraud provisions with \nrespect to registration don't kick in until a ways down the road. Let's \nfigure out a way to make them kick in earlier. Let's tighten up at the \nfront end so we all come together and make it clear we are interested \nin deterring fraud, we are not interested in deterring voting.\n  But at the same time, what we would ask in return for our effort to \nmeet the concerns of our colleague from Missouri with respect to the \nregistration process and tough antifraud processes--at the front end we \nask to let the signature be valid when people vote because on our side, \nand in the State of Oregon, we believe very strongly in the 27 States \nwhere that is used, it works. We know our colleague does not share that \nview. Sincere people agree with him. But I would say when he cites \nstudies in Oregon, which I have not seen, the colleague that sits just \na few seats from him, Senator Smith, made it clear--after a very \ndifficult and contested election where he clearly could have said: I \nhave some questions about how these votes were cast--Senator Smith, to \nhis credit, said the system worked and there were not the problems the \nSenator from Missouri has found.\n\n  So as of right now, without the legislation that has been drafted by \nthe Senator from New York and me, it seems what we are doing is \ndiscouraging people from voting now but not putting in place the \ntoughest antifraud provisions until 2004. We ought to keep negotiating. \nWe ought to continue the work.\n  By the way, even when we were debating the Schumer and Wyden \namendment, I suggested to my colleagues, and was very appreciative of \nwhat the chairman of the committee said--I went to him and said: We \nhave the votes. We have the votes now. We have done our checking. We \nhave the votes. But let's still reach out even before the vote and try \nto have a compromise.\n  That was echoed by the distinguished chairman of the committee, \nSenator Dodd, who said even the night before the vote: Let's stay at \nit.\n  I didn't have a chance to be part of the negotiations and the \nprocess. I know there are some who have concerns about that process. \nBut I said from the very beginning, because I was not part of that \nprocess, I would have to take steps--I was inclined to put a public \nhold on the bill to make sure my State wasn't rolled.\n  At every stage of the process that I had a chance to be part of, and \nthis has been backed up by Senator Dodd and Senator Schumer and the \nleadership, we have been trying to find a way to meet in a genuine \ncompromise. I think the framework for that genuine compromise is to \ntighten up on the front end, come down as aggressively as we possibly \ncan on fraud where we can best deter it, which is at the beginning of \nthe process, through registration, but then let those signatures be \nvalid for a ballot, a system that we believe works in 27 States, and \nnot create new obstacles.\n  Mr. BOND. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BOND. First, the Senator is aware that we did take care of one of \nthe Oregon problems. When he pointed out we could not send a second \nballot, he is aware that we did agree to change the requirement in the \nunderlying law. I understood it was at the request of the Senators from \nOregon and Washington. We made the change.\n  Your staff asked for it and we did make the change.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I want to respond. The Senator clearly has been working in\n\n[[Page S1332]]\n\ngood faith and we appreciate that. What I am trying to do this morning \nis to see if I can help get the rest of the way. I think in this arcane \narea of election law, where I think, frankly, the Senators from \nMissouri and Connecticut and New York know more about this nationally \nthan do I, it is very complicated. But I think there is the framework \nfor a genuine compromise. If we stick with that kind of outline, I \nthink we can still get there and we ought to try with this bill which, \nas a result of efforts of the Senator from Missouri and the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, has a lot of good in it. It has a lot of useful \nprovisions. I am for it, but we have to get over this particular \nproblem.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Of course.\n  Mr. BOND. Just a further question. I stated very clearly that I \napplaud and support the Senator's premise that we ought to make sure \nthe registration the first time is legitimate because that is where the \nproblem begins. I will ask the Senator a two-part question: Does he \nunderstand that existing motor voter law does not permit effective \nascertainment of the legitimacy of a registration upon registration, \nNo. 1? And, No. 2, that the bill before us would not apply to anybody \nwho is already registered?\n  We had set up these requirements. Is the Senator aware we set up \nthese requirements only for people registering after the date of the \nact, and they only have to meet the requirements to prove they are a \nlive, qualified human being, one time--either upon registration or upon \nthe first vote? Is the Senator aware of those two things?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Senator makes a valid point with \nrespect to the first part. With respect to the second part, I and \nothers think the motor voter law has been an important step forward. We \nare concerned about the implication that some of the spirit and \nsubstance of it could be unraveled. That is why we are trying to stay \nat the table with the distinguished Senator from Missouri and work this \nout.\n  I think if we can get an acceptance of the proposition that a \nsignature should be valid to the ballot--if that basic proposition can \nbe accepted, which is something we believe works in 27 States--I think \nwe can do a great deal to reach out on the other concerns the Senator \nfrom Missouri has. He has raised them consistently. He understands the \nsubstance of this very well. We are trying to reach out to him in an \neffort to get this compromise.\n  But what we need in return is to know that when people actually vote \nafter they have gone through what I would call a real gauntlet of steps \nto make sure there are antifraud provisions at the front end, then let \nus have a signature be valid for the ballot, a system which works very \nwell in our State.\n  I will close by way of saying I think people are stunned by this. In \nthe Senate special election in 1996, we trippled the rate of voter \nparticipation from the previous Senate special elections in this \ncountry. This is a system that has empowered voters.\n  That is why it is so important in those 27 States to seniors, the \ndisabled, minorities, and others. With record turnouts, people are \nbeing prosecuted now in a small number of instances. Where there is \nfraud, we would like to find a way to protect against that as it \nrelates to having a signature be valid to the ballot.\n  In return, we are willing to meet the Senator from Missouri halfway \nand more on the front end so that we come down aggressively on fraud in \nthe area where we believe it can do the most.\n  My time has expired. I am inclined to get back to the negotiating \ntable with the Senators from Missouri, Connecticut, and New York so we \ncan get a bipartisan compromise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, my chief of staff and my counsel negotiated \n4 to 5 hours a day for 6 months, and they thought they had reached the \nend. If the Senator from Oregon and I are now talking about different \nthings than what he has outlined, it would seem to make very good \nsense. No. 1, he says make sure there is a real, live person qualified \nto vote when they register. Hallelujah. If we can do that, then I agree \nthat they sign a registration, and any time they go to vote, all they \nhave to do is sign, whether it is a mail-in or whether it is voting in \nperson.\n  But what I want to make sure of is when that first registration comes \nin, there is something to identify it. It is not a gauntlet. It is \npicking one of the pieces of evidence that shows they are a real, live \nhuman being, or, if we can find a better way, that we can even task the \nlocal election authorities to use money we provide them to verify.\n  If they confirm that the registrations are legitimate, and if they \ndeal with the problem that the Senator from New York and the Senator \nfrom Connecticut laid out about the 8 years full of clogged rolls, \nthere is no problem that I have with letting people vote by signature \nonce it is proven they are real, live human beings at the beginning of \nthe registration process. If that is the basis, we can start over \nagain, and see all of you in July, maybe.\n  But the Senator from Connecticut is good humored, equally determined, \nand is willing to go at it again.\n  If what the Senator from Oregon laid out is what I said, then I think \nthere is some good possibility that we can get agreement. But sending \nin a signature alone is not going to cut the mustard.\n  We will get back to the Senator from New York on the number of people \ndoubledipping. The December 19th issue of the New York Post reports on \ndoubledippers. We will get back with the information on that. That is a \ngood reason to clean up the registration rolls. I hope we can do that \nas well.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank particularly my colleague from Connecticut \nfor his good humor throughout this.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I thank the steelworkers of America for \ncoming to Washington, DC, today. I think it is a historic gathering. \nTime is not neutral or on the side of these workers and their families, \nincluding the taconite workers in the Iron Range in Minnesota. I could \nspend hours on our trade policy and the ways in which I do not think we \nhave a fair trade policy. But when you have the best workers who care \nfiercely about their families and their communities in our country and \nessentially the dumping of steel and, for that matter, semifinished \nsteel in our market, way below the cost of production in other \ncountries, much less quite often produced at wages that are deplorable \nwages, the effect is devastating.\n  The request and the demand of the White House, which follows up on an \nInternational Trade Commission recommendation, is for a 40-percent \nimport fee. If we get that fee, then we will be able to compete \neffectively. If we don't get that fee, I think it will be very \ndifficult to see a future for the steel industry in our country. There \nwill be no way we can cover legacy costs, health care costs of \nretirees; and a whole lot of very decent, good, working people are \ngoing to be spat out of this economy.\n  Nobody is asking for a leg up on anybody else. Frankly, when you see \nthe\n\n[[Page S1333]]\n\nimport surge of the last several years--so much of this well below cost \nof production--and you see the impact on people, you know we ought to \ndo something.\n  So the President has until the beginning of next week to act. We call \non him to do the right thing. We believe it is the right thing. There \nare going to be steelworkers from all across the country today. There \nare going to be marching bands from high schools from all across the \ncountry today. I have been told there may be more than 10,000 \nsteelworkers coming to Washington, DC, for themselves, for their \nchildren, their communities, and for the country. I hope their voice is \nlistened to.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Landrieu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak in morning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a 10-minute time limitation. Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair and welcome the occupant, the \nSenator from Louisiana. I look forward to providing her with some \nfactual information this morning, not that she has not been exposed to \nfactual information before.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/28/senate-section/article/S1333-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1333-S1336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I received a letter in my office from \nthe respected former President Jimmy Carter. I suspect this letter went \nto every Member. It was an appeal on the issue of the energy bill which \nhas been laid down by the majority leader and will be taken up at some \npoint, probably next week.\n  In his letter, President Carter highlights the realization that every \ndecade or so we have a great national debate about whether or not to \npreserve our national heritage. He indicated that in the sixties, it \nwas over building dams in the Grand Canyon to oil drilling in Yosemite \nor Yellowstone. Clearly, there is no consideration for oil drilling in \neither Yosemite or Yellowstone, to both of which I would object. I know \nvirtually every Member in this body would.\n  President Carter indicates in his letter that the significant issue \nbefore us today is the fate of the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge, an area first set aside for protection by President \nDwight Eisenhower. He is correct in that generalization, but what he \ndoes not add is that out of that area, so-called ANWR, there were 1.5 \nmillion acres, or the 1002 area, left out specifically at the \ndeclaration of President Eisenhower for Congress to make a \ndetermination of the disposition.\n  Since that time, the matter of opening ANWR has been debated before \nthis body. Many of us will recall that in 1995, in the omnibus bill, \nANWR had prevailed and President Clinton vetoed it.\n  It is important to recognize the sequence of events because they are \nnot necessarily as recounted in President Carter's letter. He states \nthat he has enjoyed the extraordinary beauty of the peninsula and \nBeaufort Sea, watching the musk ox circle their young. He has wandered \non the tundra near the Jago River as the caribou streamed through. He \nhas watched this timeless migration from vital calving grounds. He has \nwatched the dens of wolves, large flocks of Dall sheep, and isolated \npolar bears. ``These phenomena,'' he terms it, ``of the untrammeled \nearth are what lead wildlife experts to characterize the coastal plain \nas America's Serengeti.''\n\n  I live there. I have spent all my life there. I have spent a good \ndeal of time in the Arctic. His description is not without some further \nexplanation.\n  The difference with the American Serengeti is, of course, the \nwildlife concentration is virtually year round, and the caribou, which \nis a nomadic animal, moves through the area. It is quite inspiring when \nthey move through the area, but they are not residents.\n  In the wintertime, which is 9\\1/2\\ to 10 months of the year, there is \nvirtually no activity of any kind relative to wildlife and bird life. \nNonetheless, we have an obligation to address the compatibility of the \nnatural wildlife and the wildlife experience of visitors and the \nrealization that we also have a tremendous amount of reserves of oil in \nthis area. There is a compatibility.\n  President Carter further states:\n\n       Having traveled extensively in this unique wilderness, I \n     feel very strongly about its incredible natural values.\n\n  I do, too.\n  He hopes Members ``will not be distracted by the argument that oil \nexploration and development will have minimal impact because the \n`footprint' of modern drilling technology will be small amid the \n1,500,000 acres of the coastal plain.''\n  This is where we depart because what he fails to take into \nconsideration is the people who live there and their thoughts and \naspirations. I will perhaps go into that a little later.\n  One realizes in his letter he assumes this area is an absolute \nwilderness devoid of any villages, devoid of any footprint, and devoid \nof any personal expression of attitude from the Eskimo people who live \non the Coastal Plain, whether they live in Barrow or Kaktovik, or \nwhether the activities in Prudhoe Bay have, in fact, been a \ndistraction.\n  He further suggests a precise measurement of activity in the 1002 \narea would involve a web of drilling pads, gravel pits, access roads, \nand air fields. While these might not exceed 2,000 acres, they would be \nspread across a far wider expanse covering hundreds of square miles, \nconnected by a network of what he calls modern transportation routes.\n  As those who follow the debate recognize, that simply is not the \ncase. We have developed the technology dramatically, and that \ntechnology is evidenced in the transition from Prudhoe Bay, which is \nthe 30-year-old technology which uses large areas of surface for roads \nand so forth, to the development of Endicott, which came on as the 10th \nlargest field, and the actual footprint was 56 acres.\n  So the point is, we have this technology. It will be advanced if \nindeed ANWR is opened. It would be further advanced to have ice roads \nas the access for development of drilling, not roads. We would not open \nup gravel pits; that would not be necessary because we have technology \nnow that allows us to move only in the wintertime and not leave a \nfootprint in the summer. Further, the directional drilling technology \nsuggests if we were to drill on the Capitol Grounds, we could focus on \nan oilfield as far away as the Reagan Airport, outside the edge of \nWashington, DC. That is the technology we have.\n  So it is an entirely different set of circumstances. To suggest that \nsomehow this would be an expanse covering hundreds of miles, with \nairports and so forth, is totally inaccurate.\n  I have a picture. This is children in Kaktovik. To indicate where \nKaktovik is, this is in the 1002 area. This is a village that has been \nthere for a long time. There are real people there. They have hopes and \naspirations. We have other pictures of Kaktovik which can give an idea \nof the realism that President Carter simply overlooks in his letter. He \nsuggests this is an unspoiled wilderness. Here is a village that is \nactually in the 1002 area. There is an old radar site. Here is the \ncommunity hall.\n  These people happen to support opening the area. Why? They want a \nbetter opportunity. They want health care. They want toilets that \nflush. They want running water. They want to have opportunities for the \nchildren.\n  It is one thing to simply address the environmental aspects, but that \nis hardly fair when you have to consider the fact that there are real \npeople living here.\n  I want to show a little bit about how we develop the Arctic and show \nsome of the activity. Some of the technology we have developed--and I \nknow the occupant of the chair is quite familiar with it--that is used \nnow more often than not is called directional drilling.\n  This was an article that appeared in the New York Times, and it shows \nhow\n\n[[Page S1334]]\n\nin one drill pad you can access a huge area that otherwise was \nunaccessible. This is called directional drilling. You do this through \na process called 3D sizement. That has only come about in the last \ndecade.\n  Before, we used to have to drill down, and if we hit one of those \npockets of oil--they are the dark areas--we would hit them or we would \nmiss them. With 3D sizing, you can spot where these other pockets are \nand directionally drill from one pad. That is the technology of today. \nThat is why President Carter's generalization that this area is going \nto be covered with roads and air fields and pipelines, and so forth, is \ntotally inaccurate.\n  Now let me show you how we operate. I said we are not going to have \nroads. We are not going to open up gravel pits. That is drilling in the \nArctic. That is the same as in the 1002 area of ANWR. That is a winter \nroad. It is a road that is frozen. It works fine. You have a drill pad \nthat is on frozen ground. This ground is permafrost. It is frozen year \nround. On the surface, it does thaw, but remember, winter is just about \n9\\1/2\\, 10 months. So you have a long period of time when you can do \ndevelopment. This is what it looks like in the summertime as a \nconsequence of not having to have a road into the area. That is a spot \nas well.\n\n  So when he says the impacts on the fragile tundra, ecosystem, \nmigratory waterfowl, and other wildlife would be devastated by oil \nactivity, that is not necessarily true.\n  The Senator from Louisiana knows how you operate in the State of \nLouisiana. You have numerous areas where you have oil and gas drilling. \nYou have commercial shrimping. You have sport fishing. You have access \nfor waterfowl because you consciously protect them. But there is a \ncompatibility by doing it right and using technology. You do it in \nmonuments that have been set aside by Congress, and you do it \ncorrectly.\n  There is some suggestion that this somehow is of a magnitude to \nparallel dams on the Colorado River, that we have to make choices: We \ncannot have the untouched, sublime wilderness on one hand compatible \nwith oil development.\n  If we look at this map, we note that few people have an idea of the \ndistance and the vastness of the State of Alaska. It is one-fifth the \nsize of the United States. It overlays the United States dramatically \nin a proportional view that hopefully we have with us--but I guess we \ndo not. It shows Alaska overlaying the United States. It shows an \noverlay, and Alaska runs basically from Florida to California. It runs \nfrom Canada to Mexico on a proportionate overlay. It is a big piece of \nreal estate.\n  We have this entire area of portions of Alaska associated with \nwilderness. We have 56 million acres of wilderness, and what we do not \nreally reflect on in the issue of opening up ANWR is the fact there are \nalready footprints in the area; there is a community of Kaktovikians, \nand the Coastal Plain is the green area that would be proposed to be \nleased. The rest of the 19 million acres is split between a wilderness \narea, which is about 8\\1/2\\ million acres. That is the light buff color \non the chart, and the darker buff color is already in the wilderness. \nSo we are talking about a very small area.\n  We are also talking about, in the House bill, which authorized the \nopening, only 2,000 acres. That is the size of that little red dot in \nthe chart. That is about the size of a small farm.\n  So what does 19 million acres equate to? A lot of people do not \nrecognize that. ANWR and the State of South Carolina are about the same \nsize, 19 million acres. So we are talking about 2,000 acres out of 19 \nmillion acres of development, which is hardly reflected in the \nPresident's letter to each Member. He says: Opening of the Coastal \nPlain for oil exploration and development would be, despite all the \nmuch-vaunted technological promises, severely damaging to wildlife and \nthe ecosystem.\n  Let me show what our evidence is in Prudhoe Bay. I am sure we have a \nchart of the caribou and the bear. This is Prudhoe Bay. We had about \n3,000 or 4,000 caribou in Prudhoe Bay when the development started in \nthat particular area. Today we have over 20,000 caribou. The issue is, \nyou cannot shoot them, you cannot run them down with a snow machine, so \nthey propagate dramatically. And those are not stuffed; those are real \ncaribou wandering around. So there is a compatibility.\n  There is a compatibility with the bears. Here are the bears. I know \nthe occupant of the chair has seen this chart many times. They are \nwalking on the pipeline because it beats walking on the snow. You \ncannot shoot them. You cannot take a gun in there.\n  People are concerned about polar bears and polar bear dens, but they \nnever tell you it is against the law to shoot a polar bear in the \nUnited States. And Alaska is in the United States. You can go out and \nget a guide in Canada, you can get a guide in Russia, and take a polar \nbear, but not in the United States.\n  Talking about conservation, one of the best ways is to make sure they \nare protected, and they are. So to suggest a mild amount of activity is \ngoing to displace their dens is absolutely balderdash.\n  They talk about the wilderness qualities. You are talking about huge \nareas. Fifty-six million acres of wilderness is what we have in the \nState of Alaska alone. We are very proud of it. To suggest we cannot \nopen this area is totally unrealistic.\n  Let me show some of the other areas in the United States where we \nhave oil and gas exploration. These two charts show oil production \nfacilities in the Nation's wildlife refuges and wetland management \ndistricts. We have 9 in Texas, 12 in Louisiana, 4 in California. The \nother charts oil production in national wildlife refuges and wetland \nmanagement districts. We have them in Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota, \nNew Mexico, Montana, Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, one in Alaska, \nCalifornia, Kansas, Louisiana, and Michigan.\n  We have oil and gas development and mineral development in refuges. \nIt is common. Can we do it safely? That is the question. The answer is \nyes.\n  Former President Jimmy Carter's letter fails to recognize people have \ndreams and aspirations and certain rights. He says:\n\n       It is inherently fatal to the wilderness qualities of this \n     matchless example of America's heritage.\n\n  The letter does not say there are 56 million acres of wilderness in \nAlaska, and we are proud. He implies somehow if the area is open to \nmodest development, it will be detrimental.\n  He makes another mistake when he says:\n\n       Through compromises that began more than four decades ago \n     and were concluded when I signed the Alaska National Interest \n     Lands Conservation Act in 1980, 95 percent of Alaska's North \n     Slope has already been made available for oil exploration.\n\n  We have charts that show the upper Arctic area. This chart \nillustrates the Arctic Coast from Canada, the area we are talking \nabout, and next is the Prudhoe Bay area, and from Prudhoe Bay we go \nacross the Naval Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. The suggestion that 95 \npercent is open is inaccurate; 95 percent of it is closed. I guarantee, \none cannot get a drilling permit on public land in these areas. This \narea is the National Petroleum Reserve, and the dark area shows the \nconcentration of lakes. That is where the bird life is. That is Lake \nNestia Puk. That is a delicate area. The Department of Interior refused \nto open leases in those areas. They have leases issued which have been \nmodestly successful, but to make the statement that 95 percent is open, \nand therefore why not leave the area, is false.\n  The President has inaccurate information. He said we should not \nsacrifice the last 5 percent. Well, 95 percent is closed. Furthermore, \nin his letter he says this issue has assumed gigantic symbolic stature. \nHe is right on target. It is symbolic. It has nothing to do with \nscientific evidence. It has nothing to do with whether or not there is \nenough oil to offset the amount of oil we import from Iraq or Saudi \nArabia. Some have indicated that this issue is all about our national \nsecurity. To a large extent, they are right. We are 58-percent \ndependent upon imported oil in this country. The ramifications of that \nare very real. As we increase our dependence, we are going to be more \nand more beholden to those who supply the energy.\n  We have seen the power of OPEC in reducing the supply and the price \ngoes up. I have discussed time and time again the issue of Iraq. We \nwonder how we will deal with Saddam Hussein. On September 11, we \nimported 1 million\n\n[[Page S1335]]\n\nbarrels a day from Iraq; today it is 780,000 barrels. We are still \nmaintaining a no-fly zone, an area blockade, over that country. We put \nthe lives of men and women at risk each day enforcing that no-fly zone. \nWe take out Saddam Hussein's targets, and he tries to shoot us down, \nbut we are taking his oil. We take his oil, put it in our airplanes, \nand go back. But he takes our money and develops missile capability, \nmaybe aimed at Israel. We have not had an inspector in that country in \n6 or 7 years. When will we deal with that? When we have an unfortunate \nissue such as a terrorist development that might emanate from there we \nwill wish we would have moved sooner?\n\n  These are the questions the administration has to deal with and each \nMember has to deal with in his or her own conscience. These are very \nreal.\n  From the Persian Gulf we get almost 3 million barrels; from OPEC \nproducing countries, 5.5 million barrels of oil. That is where we get \nthe oil. We need all the conservation we can get--CAFE, wind power, \nsolar power--but America and the world moves on nothing but oil. We do \nnot have the technology. We will continue to be more dependent.\n  The question is, How can we relieve that dependence? Obviously, in \nthe Gulf of Mexico and off Louisiana and Texas they have extraordinary \ntechnology. They are drilling in 2,500 and 3,000 feet of water. The \nrecord has been very good because we have that technology. Can we open \nup ANWR safely? Absolutely.\n  This next chart is important. What we are doing is rather \ninteresting. We have substantial prospects for oil and gas off the \nAtlantic Ocean, off our coastal States, including Florida clear up to \nMaine. Those States do not want development. That is fine if they do \nnot want development. They have taken 31 trillion cubic feet of natural \ngas that is believed to be off the east coast and said they do not want \nto develop it. We should respect that. Off Florida on the gulf side, 24 \ntrillion cubic feet, we have taken that off limits.\n  Now the west coast--Washington, Oregon, California--they do not want \ndrilling offshore where the risks are relatively high. There are storms \nand all kinds of bad things that can happen. We have taken the middle \narea of the country, the overthrust zone of Montana, to a degree, \nWyoming, Colorado, Utah, and said we will not allow any road access in \npublic lands. We have taken that off. We take these off because the \npeople do not want it. We should respect those areas where people \nsupport drilling. In my State of Alaska they do. We are not talking \nabout offshore. We are talking about on land. There is a difference. \nThere is much less risk.\n  These are the arguments used that frustrate those in the Alaska \ndelegation. It is fair to say we probably include Texas, Louisiana, \nMississippi, and Alabama, who do want responsible development offshore. \nIt provides a standard of living. It provides a tax base. Those are \nvery important for working men and women.\n  This is a jobs issue. If we open ANWR, we are putting up for lease in \nthe area of 1.5 million acres out of 19 million acres. That will be \ncompetitive lease sale. Companies will put up money to have the \nopportunity to lease those lands. How much money? It is estimated \nsomewhere in the area of close to $3 billion. That means $3 billion \ncoming into the Federal Treasury. That, in itself, should interest our \nbudgeteers. In addition, it is jobs for Americans at a time when we are \nlosing jobs. It is payback time to American labor. These people are \nentitled to these jobs as opposed to sending our dollars overseas and \nbringing back the oil from Iraq or Saudi Arabia. We have the know-how, \nwe have the technical ability, and we can bring these jobs home.\n  How many jobs are we talking about with ANWR? Somewhere in the area \nof 250,000. Talk about stimulus; show me a better stimulus that does \nnot cost the taxpayer a red cent. That is $3 billion in revenue and \n250,000 jobs, all paid for and put up by the private sector, not the \ngovernment and not the taxpayer.\n  These are some of the issues to which we should relate. It is a \nmatter of what is in the national security interests of our country as \nwell as the realism associated with sound jobs in this country.\n  President Carter goes on to say the truth: We can drill in every \nnational park, wildlife refuge, et cetera.\n  We are not talking about that. We are talking about a small area, a \nfootprint of 2,000 acres out of 19 million acres. To suggest we can get \nthere through conservation is unrealistic. It will be an interesting \nissue to watch the debate on CAFE. Some are going to say we are going \nto do it, and we will mandate the type of cars or public businesses. We \nare going to compromise safety. We are going to bring in more foreign \ncars. That is not the answer.\n\n  We need better mileage. There is no question about it. But you just \ncan't get there from here because this particular CAFE is going to be \neffective in the year 2015, 15 years from now. Some of us are not going \nto be here to be held accountable.\n  It is very easy to vote and say, yes, we ought to do that; get 37 \nmiles per gallon by the year 2015. Technically, they say you can't get \nthere without a mandate by the Government telling you what kind of car \nyou are going to drive.\n  We will have that debate later. Nevertheless, I think we have to \naddress the national energy security of this country.\n  I am always reminded of the statement of Mark Hatfield, a very \nrespected Member of this body from the State of Oregon, who stood here \ntime and time again and said: I'll vote for ANWR any day rather than \nsend a young man or woman overseas to fight a war on foreign land over \noil.\n  This is leaving us more dependent on foreign oil, and then we know \njust what happens. Some people forget what happened in 1973 during the \nArab oil embargo, the Yom Kippur War, because, I guess, they were too \nyoung. We had gas lines around the block. People were indignant. They \nsaid: How could Government let this happen?\n  We were 37-percent dependent on imported oil at that time. Now we are \n58-percent dependent.\n  What does the Department of Energy say? In the year 2007, 2008, we \nwill be somewhere up to 63 or 64 percent dependent. That is reality.\n  I hope when Members reflect on their vote and recognize the pressures \nthat have been brought about by environmental groups, by President \nCarter in his letter to each Member, and others, they reflect somewhat \non accuracy, factual information, and not the emotional arguments that \nsuggest this is only a 6-month supply; that it is going to take 10 \nyears to go on line; that it is not going to make any difference.\n  They recognize reality. I hope they recognize their vote should be \nwhat is right for America, not what is right to satisfy the \nenvironmental lobbyists' desires to use this issue for what it has been \nused, and that is to generate a tremendous amount of membership and \ndollars. Once they lose on ANWR, they will go to another major \nenvironmental issue and that is understood.\n  They make a significant contribution. But on this issue they are \nsimply wrong. We can do it right. We can do it safely. It is a \nsignificant amount of oil because it is somewhere between 5.6 billion \nbarrels and 16 billion barrels. If it is half that, it is as big as \nPrudhoe Bay, which has supplied the Nation with 25 percent of the total \ncrude oil produced in this country in the last 27 years.\n  I will have a chart later. I didn't want to run the risk of having \none of my friends from Texas acknowledge that, indeed, ANWR has more \noil in it than the proven reserves in one of our largest producer \nStates, and that is the State of Texas.\n  I think we have to keep the argument in perspective. We have the \ntechnology. We can do it right.\n  When we get on the debate, I trust Members will reflect on the \nreality that this is one of the biggest jobs issues in the country. \nOrganized labor feels very strongly about the reality of keeping these \njobs in the United States.\n  I will make one more point. As the occupant of the chair is aware, \nthere is a great deal of shipbuilding in Louisiana, Mississippi, and \nsouthern California. There is a whole new fleet of tankers being built. \nThey are being built because U.S. law mandates that the movement of oil \nbetween two States goes in a U.S.-flagged vessel built in a U.S. \nshipyard with U.S.\n\n[[Page S1336]]\n\ncrews. Let me tell you, our oil that goes from the Port of Valdez down \nthere, clear down to the west coast of the United States, primarily in \nthe Puget Sound area, the San Francisco Bay area, and the Los Angeles \nharbor area--these new ships mean jobs in the shipyards, jobs on the \nship, and U.S.-documented vessels.\n\n  So it is a big jobs issue. The most significant portions of our \nmerchant marine are these tankers that haul the oil.\n  Washington, Oregon, and California are going to get oil. What \nhappens? They will get it from Iraq, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. It is \ngoing to come over in foreign vessels that do not have double bottoms--\nall our new vessels have double bottoms--and it is going to come over \nwith foreign crews, and they are not going to have the deep pockets of \nExxon. I point out what this means in terms of sound, high-paying U.S. \njobs.\n  Let's do what is right for America. I appreciate the time allotted to \nme and unless there is another Senator seeking recognition, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Mr. President, as our celebration of Black \nHistory Month now comes to a close, I want to acknowledge some of the \nrich and ongoing contributions made by my State's African-American \ncitizens. Of course, the efforts of African Americans in Florida and \nthroughout our Nation's history should be recognized every day, not \njust during Black History Month. Back home in Florida, our State has \nbeen blessed with a remarkable number of prominent African-American \ncitizens who have served our State and Nation with distinction in a \nvariety of fields. I want to mention a few.\n  Although not a Florida native, just think of the contributions of \nMary McLeod Bethune. She founded one of the oldest and most prestigious \nblack colleges, Bethune-Cookman College. In addition to serving as \nPresident of Bethune-Cookman, she also was one of the leading civil \nrights activists of her time, and the first African-American woman to \nserve on a Presidential commission. Bethune-Cookman College is one of \nour stellar institutions of higher learning. It is located in Daytona \nBeach. I have had the privilege of attending that college and visiting \nwith the distinguished president, who has been there over 2 decades, \nDr. Oswald Bronson.\n  The spirit that school has today carries on in the memory of Mrs. \nMary McLeod Bethune. It is just amazing. I have seen that in the \nclassrooms. I have seen it in their auditorium. I have seen it on the \nfootball field and the band performing at half time. It is a wonderful \nand rich part of our heritage in Florida.\n  That is just one. Let me name another: Justice Joe Hatcher. He was \nborn in Clearwater and, in 1975, Judge Hatcher became the first African \nAmerican elected a justice of the Supreme Court of Florida. He later \nwent on to serve with distinction on the Federal court of appeals, a \nbody that sits in Atlanta, although he maintained his office right \nthere in Tallahassee. His election to the State supreme court marked \nthe first time an African American won a statewide office since \nReconstruction.\n  I will give you another one: James Weldon Johnson, the first African-\nAmerican executive director of the NAACP, author, lyricist, creator of \nthe National Negro Anthem, and poet. He was born in Jacksonville.\n  And then Eatonville, Florida's native, Zora Neale Hurston. She was a \nfolklorist, anthropologist, and acclaimed author of such works as \n``Their Eyes Were Watching God,'' and ``Of Mules and Men.'' I got to \nknow about her heritage when I had the privilege, as a young \nCongressman, of representing Eatonville, FL, in the late 1970s as part \nof my congressional district.\n  I will give you another one: Timothy Thomas Fortune. He was born up \nin the panhandle in Marianna, FL, Jackson County, in 1856. He was the \neditor and publisher of a paper called the New York Age, and his paper \nwas a platform for defending the civil rights of both northern and \nsouthern Blacks.\n  Here is one you will recognize: Asa Philip Randolph, founder of the \nBrotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. He was born in Crescent City, FL. \nThe Brotherhood was the first union founded by and for African \nAmericans.\n  Not far from there was born, in Palatka, FL, John Henry Lloyd. He was \na baseball player and a manager in the Negro leagues, and was \nconsidered one of the greatest shortstops in the game. In 1930, as a \nmember of the New York Lincoln Giants, he played in the first Negro \nLeague game in Yankee Stadium against the Baltimore Black Sox.\n\n  Now I am going to tell you a name that everybody recognizes today: \nSidney Poitier, the renowned actor who won an Academy Award in 1964 for \nhis performance in ``Lilies of the Field.'' He was born in Miami.\n  And our contemporary, my colleague, Winston Scott, one of our \nNation's pioneering African-American astronauts, was born in Miami. In \n1992, Winston was selected by NASA and served as a mission specialist \non flights in 1996 and 1997, and today he has returned to his alma \nmater, Florida State, where he serves as the dean of students. Winston \nhad logged a total of 24 days, 14 hours, and 34 minutes in space.\n  Augusta Christine Savage was born in Green Cove Springs, just south \nof Jacksonville. In 1923, Augusta Christine Savage was among 100 young \nAmerican women selected to attend the summer program at Fontainebleau, \noutside of Paris, but was refused admission once the program directors \nbecame aware of her race. In the mid-1930s she founded and became the \nfirst director of the Harlem Community Arts Theater, which played a \ncrucial role in the development of many young African-American artists. \nIn addition, she became the first Black elected to the National \nAssociation of Women Painters and Sculptors.\n  A Washington hero, GEN Chappie James, the first African-American \nfour-star general, was born in Pensacola. As a young State legislator, \nI had the privilege of meeting General James. He was right back from \nVietnam where he had flown so many combat missions. He became one of \nthe famed Tuskegee Airmen, earning his wings back in World War II and \ngoing on to serve as a pilot, a fighter pilot in Korea and Vietnam. In \n1975 he received his fourth star and he became the commander of the \nNorth American Air Defense System.\n  I could go on. As we remember the contributions of these and many \nothers, and so many other African-American citizens, duty calls us to \nremember the difficulties this community faced as our Nation traveled \nthrough the struggle to achieve full civil rights for all people. I \nwant to highlight two small initiatives that should help us preserve \nthese important memories.\n  Florida now is home to more than a dozen former Negro League baseball \nplayers. These men are nearing the end of their lives, and they have \nnever received a pension for their time in the league, unlike their \ncounterparts who played Major League baseball. Although Jackie Robinson \nbroke baseball's color barrier in 1947, baseball didn't truly integrate \nuntil a decade after Robinson's historic feat. It took all the way up \nto 1959 for Major League baseball to integrate the last team.\n  No doubt their fans appreciate their contribution to baseball, but by \nrefusing to grant a pension to these oldtimers who played in a \nsegregated society, Major League baseball is denying\n\n[[Page S1337]]\n\nthem an appropriate reward in their efforts. I am trying to help these \nmen resolve their dispute with Major League baseball so that they can \nreceive a small but important token for their contributions to sports \nhistory.\n  Also throughout the era of segregation, when public facilities were \nsegregated by law, the African-American community of Miami was \nforbidden to use all of the area's beaches but one, Virginia Key Beach, \nin Biscayne Bay known as ``the Negro beach.''\n  Known in those days as the ``Colored Only Beach,'' Virginia Key Beach \nwas an important place in the lives of African-American families--a \nplace for them to gather and enjoy the pleasures of relaxation beside \nthe ocean. The memories of this place are sweet, even mixed and \nintertwined with the bitterness and memories of segregation.\n  Together with my friend and colleague, Congresswoman Carrie Meek of \nMiami, we have sponsored legislation that will help preserve this \nhistoric place. Our bill would require the Secretary of the Interior to \nstudy and report to Congress on the feasibility of incorporating \nVirginia Key Beach into the National Park System.\n  By enacting this legislation, we can preserve its 77 acres of beach \nand wildlife, while honoring its past and present importance to the \npeople of Florida.\n  These are examples of some of the small ways in which we can honor \nthe lives and memories of our Nation's African-Americans.\n  My own State, Florida, has an especially proud history in this \nregard, as well as a willingness to correct past mistakes.\n  In 1994, for example, the Florida Legislature passed, and the late \nGov. Lawton Chiles signed, the Rosewood claims bill, which provided \n$2.1 million to survivors and the families of victims of the 1923 \nRosewood Massacre.\n  Last year, the legislature enacted sweeping reforms to give every \nperson an equal opportunity to have his or her vote counted.\n  You don't want any State to ever have to go through what we went \nthrough in Florida in the last Presidential election because there were \nvotes that were not counted. So the Florida Legislature, in 2001, in \ntrying to correct the voting rights abuses, passed legislation to help \nmodernize the system in a Presidential election.\n  Unfortunately, a $50-billion State budget proposed by the Florida \nHouse last week left out the second of two installments of $12 million \nto help counties replace antiquated, punch-card voting machines.\n  African-Americans were disproportionately affected by flaws in the \nelection system. And Florida lawmakers have made a commitment not only \nto that community but also to all the people of Florida to fix the \nsystem.\n  Without this funding, they will have broken their promise.\n  It would be appropriate at this time of recognizing the achievements \nof African-Americans for the State House to do its duty and to keep its \nword so that every vote gets counted.\n  Today--and every day--let us celebrate African-American achievement \nboth by remembering our past and by recommitting ourselves to the \ncurrent fight for social, political, and economic equality for \neveryone.\n  I thank the Chair for the time to address the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/28/senate-section/article/S1337-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I want to follow my remarks of \na few minutes ago about Black History Month with an underlining of my \nconcern of what is happening in the Florida Legislature as we speak, \nwhich is meeting in the capital city of Tallahassee.\n  It is almost ironic that at the very time the Senate is considering \nan election reform bill, of which for that legislation we are having \ndiscussions, negotiations, and awaiting agreements to finally come \nforth so we do not have to come to the Chamber to break a filibuster to \npass it--and it is legislation that is going to get wide support once \nwe get to final passage--but it is almost ironic what has happened in \nthe Florida Legislature since we started this legislation 2\\1/2\\ weeks \nago when I spoke in this Chamber in favor of the legislation. At that \ntime, I took to the floor complimenting the Florida Legislature.\n  In the State of Florida, we went through a grueling experience in the \nPresidential election of 2000. We saw so many ballots that were not \ncounted. We saw clear voter intent that was not followed. There was \nconfusion over the ballots. There was confusion in the construction of \nthe ballot, how it fit together. There was the famous butterfly ballot. \nWe saw how even when voter intent was so clear for example, a first-\ntime voter, who was not familiar with the ballot, would go down the \nPresidential names and select one name and mark that on a punchcard \nballot, and then at the bottom of the Presidential names there was a \nline, and it said: ``Write-in,'' and they would write in the same \nPresidential candidate--the voter intent was clear, but that ballot was \nnot counted.\n  So after that awful experience, before which I had never known \nanything about error rates in ballot counting--and thank the Good Lord \nI never had a close election, and little did I ever know there could be \nthe confusion and so many people, in effect, disenfranchised in an \nelection--when we started our election reform bill in this Chamber a \ncouple weeks ago, I took to the floor and complimented the Florida \nLegislature because it changed all of the punchcard ballots and it \nappropriated, out of a $50 billion annual budget, $24 million so that \nthe counties could buy new voting equipment and they would never have \nto go through the confusion of that punchcard voting system again. They \nwould have an optical scan system with a much lower error rate.\n  That was my compliment to the Florida Legislature. They did right. \nThat was a year ago. But just last week, the Florida House of \nRepresentatives did not appropriate, in its appropriations bill, the \nsecond $12 million installment to modernize the election system. What \nin the world are we thinking in the year 2002, when it is almost taken \nfor granted that it is a bedrock principle that registered voters \nshould have the right to vote and to have their vote counted?\n\n[[Page S1338]]\n\n  So as we continue to discuss and debate--and ultimately we will \npass--this election reform bill at the Federal level, let me make a \nplea to the Florida Legislature: You were so gallant, as leaders in the \nNation, after the debacle and the disenfranchisement of the 2000 \nelection, to first step forward with an election reform bill and \nproviding the appropriations to fund that election reform.\n  Please do not falter now, Florida Legislature. Please, appropriate \nthe second half of that appropriation that was promised a year ago so \nFlorida will not have any serious questions about every Floridian's \nvote being counted.\n  I thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator suggest the \nabsence of a quorum?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Yes. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida).

Mr. President, Senator Daschle, the majority leader, was \nin the Chamber today talking about a decision that will be made in the \ncoming days by the Bush administration on the subject of trade disputes \nthat exist with respect to the American steel industry.\n  What is all this about? It is that the steel industry, as with many \nother American industries, has been under assault. It has been under \nassault by unfair trade coming from abroad, products being dumped in \nour country into our marketplace below their acquisition cost, \nundercutting our domestic producers. This is unfair trade. It is trade \nthat violates our trade laws. In fact, an International Trade \nCommission investigation has recently determined that the flood of \nforeign steel has significantly hurt the U.S. steel industry.\n  The question the President will decide next week is: What will be the \nremedy? What will be done about it? If our steel industry is being \nthreatened and assaulted by unfair trade and it is closing plants, \ngoing into bankruptcy, laying off workers, what is the remedy? That is \nthe question this administration will answer next Wednesday.\n  My hope is they will answer this question in an aggressive way. My \nhope is they will say, we intend to stand up for American steel. My \nhope is they will say, we intend to stand up for all American producers \nwhen confronted with unfair trade. How do you stand up for producers \nwhen confronted with unfair trade? You take action against those \nperpetrating that unfair trade against our producers.\n  We have something like 10,000 steelworkers in Washington, DC, today \nwho are here demonstrating the point that they are losing their jobs \nand their companies are going bankrupt. This is about them and their \nfamilies and their future. They are saying: Give us some fairness in \ninternational trade. Stand up for our interests.\n\n  It is not steelworkers saying, we want our country to be \nprotectionist. It is not them saying, we want to build a wall around \nour country and prevent imports from coming in. It is a group of \nworkers who have come to Washington to say: When we are confronted with \nunfair trade, we expect our Government to be in our corner. We expect \nour Government to stand with us.\n  It is interesting that the steel dispute is very much like a dispute \nwe have with Canada on the issue of wheat. The North Dakota wheat \nproducers, with a 301 case, brought a trade case against Canada. That \ncase, after investigation, was recently resolved by the United States \nTrade Representative saying, yes, the Canadian Wheat Board is a state-\nsponsored monopoly that engages in unfair trade practices that harm \nUnited States wheat growers.\n  If we have decided Canada is guilty of unfair trade with respect to \nwheat, what have we done about it? USTR's answer was: We are not going \nto have any remedies. If we provide relief at this moment, it will \nviolate NAFTA and it will violate our World Trade Organization \ncommitments. Therefore, even though we have decided Canada is guilty of \nunfair trade practices that injure American farmers, we essentially \nwill do nothing at the moment; we will instead take this to the WTO.\n  That means that our great grandchildren, if we are lucky, may see \naction by the WTO. Although they probably won't see it because the WTO \nconsiders and takes action behind closed doors. And anyway, it is \nlikely not to take much action at all; if it does, it will be years in \nthe future.\n  I have talked about the steel dispute and the wheat dispute. In both \ncases, our producers have been told that those who are competing \nagainst us, foreign producers, are doing so unfairly, injuring our \nworkers and our farmers. Yet it is very hard to get relief, to get this \ncountry to stand up for its producers.\n  There are some real storm clouds on the horizon. Our trade deficit \nkeeps rising year after year. The more trade agreements we have, the \nhigher the trade deficit.\n  This chart shows what has happened. We have the GATT Tokyo Round, and \nthen we have the Uruguay Round, the WTO agreement, and then the NAFTA. \nWe can see what has happened to the trade deficit--up, up, up, over a \nlong period of time.\n  The U.S. Constitution has something to say about international trade. \nArticle I, section 8, says: The Congress shall have the power to \nregulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several States, \nand with the Indian tribes.\n  That means the authority vested by the U.S. Constitution on matters \naffecting international trade rests here--not at the White House, but \nin the Congress, and only here. Yet to listen to Republican and \nDemocratic administrations over the last 30 or 40 years, you realize \nthat, by and large, they think they are the ones in control of trade. \nAdministrations empower negotiators to go out and work out trade \nagreements that they bring back to the Congress under a provision \ncalled fast track. Fast track allows administrations to tie the hands \nof Members of Congress behind their backs and say: Here is the trade \nagreement we negotiated--mostly in secret--and you have no right to \noffer any amendment to change any of it at any time. That is fast \ntrack.\n  Fast track is fundamentally undemocratic. I voted against it in the \npast. I would not support giving it to President Clinton; I will not \nsupport giving it to President Bush. Go negotiate treaties, if you \nwish--but good ones. If you do, the Congress will approve them. If you \ndon't, they deserve to be changed or killed.\n  Let me talk for a bit about some of these treaties. We've had fast \ntrack in the past; fast track was something given to previous \nPresidents, including President Reagan and the first President Bush. We \nnegotiated an agreement with Canada, and the agreement with Canada went \nthrough the House Ways and Means Committee. I was serving in the House \nat the time. The vote for the United States-Canada trade agreement was \n34 to 1. I cast the lone vote against it. There were 34 for it, 1 \nagainst.\n  I believed I was right at the time, and events certainly demonstrated \nthat was the case. We took a small deficit with Canada and doubled it \nvery quickly. They dumped grain into this country, injuring our \nfarmers, and we have had trouble ever since. Do you know why we could \nnot do anything about the provisions in that agreement that traded away \nthe interests of family farmers? Because you can't offer amendments to \ntrade agreements with fast track. So the administration said: Here it \nis. We negotiated it and, by the way, we had secret side agreements we \nwill not tell you about. You accept it, yes or no. If you don't like \nit, there can be no amendments because fast track ties your hands \nbehind your back. That is what happened with that trade agreement.\n  Not long after that, I drove up to Canada with a man named Earl in a \n12-year-old, orange, 2-ton truck. The truck was carrying 150 bushels of \nU.S. durum wheat. All the way to the Canadian border, we saw Canadian \n18-wheelers coming into this country, hauling Canadian wheat into this \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S1339]]\n\n There was 18-wheeler after 18-wheeler. In fact, it was a windy day, \nand even though they had tarps on their trucks, the grain kept spilling \noff, and it was hitting our windshield all the way to the border. We \nhad that 12-year-old, little, 2-ton orange truck. We arrived at the \nborder having seen dozens of Canadian trucks hauling grain into this \ncountry. We were stopped at the border and told: You can't take that \n150 bushels of U.S. durum wheat into Canada. We asked: Why not? They \nsaid: Because we won't let you in.\n  All the way to the border, we saw them coming into our country, but \nwe could not take the product of one little orange truck into Canada. \nIs that fair trade? I don't think so.\n  The administration turned from Canada to Mexico and did a trade \nagreement with Mexico called NAFTA. We wrapped Canada and Mexico \ntogether. NAFTA sure didn't work. I voted against that as well. We had \na very small trade surplus before NAFTA, and we turned that into a very \nbig deficit. Now we are up to our neck in troubles with NAFTA. We have \ntroubles trying to get high-fructose corn syrup in, we have unfair \ntrade with potatoes--you name it.\n  After we negotiated to reduce tariffs from United States goods going \ninto Mexico, the Mexicans devalued their peso 50 percent, which meant \nthat all the work done to get rid of the 10- or 15-percent tariffs \ndidn't mean anything. They obliterated that by simply devaluing the \npeso.\n  What else are we facing? I will give you some examples. Automobiles. \nWe don't make automobiles in North Dakota, but this is a national \nissue. Let me show you this chart. Absurdities in trade. Last year, we \nhad automobiles coming into the United States from Korea. Last year, we \nimported into the United States 570,000 automobiles from the country of \nKorea--570,000 cars. Do you know how many cars the United States sent \nto Korea? One thousand, seven hundred. I will say that again. We had \n570,000 Korean cars driven off boats to be sold in the United States. \nGoing the other way, we had 1,700 United States cars into Korea. Do you \nknow why? If you try to sell an American car in Korea, they will find \nall kinds of ways to stop you. Not just tariffs, but all kinds of non-\ntariff barriers, like intimidation of potential buyers with the threat \nof a tax audit. They want to just ship their cars to our country, and \nmake it one-way trade. If you are somebody working for a car company in \nthis country, you have a right to ask: Who on Earth is minding the \nstore if you let this go on? Is this fair trade? Clearly, no. Somebody \nought to stand up on behalf of workers in this country and say we are \nnot going to let that happen.\n\n  What about beef to Japan? Every pound of American beef going to Japan \nhas a 38.5-percent tariff on it, and that is 12 years after a beef \nagreement with Japan. Every pound of T-bone steak going to Tokyo has a \n38.5-percent tariff. That is absurd.\n  Right now, we are fighting and trying to get soybeans into China \nbecause they are trying to squeeze the neck of the bottle, just after \nwe had a bilateral trade agreement with China. The list goes on and on \nand on.\n  We have a trade agreement with Canada, as I mentioned. Do you know \nwhat happens with Canada? They move sugar from Brazil into this \ncountry, in contravention of American law, in what they call stuffed \nmolasses. Then they take the sugar out of the molasses and send the \nmolasses back, and they do it again and call it stuffed molasses. It is \ndone every day. That is fundamentally wrong. Yet nobody is willing to \nstand up on behalf of producers.\n  Winston Churchill said that when he was a kid, he got into a debate \nwith Atlee in Parliament. As the story went--it was an aggressive \ndebate--he told Atlee: When I was a child, my parents took me to the \ncarnival, and they had a sideshow. At the sideshow, they had these \ncanvas flaps that described what wonderful, extraordinary, outrageous \nthings you were going to see in the sideshow. One of them advertised \nthe boneless wonder--a man apparently born without bones, if you can \nimagine.\n  Churchill said: My parents felt I was far too tender in age to be \ntaken into a sideshow to see the boneless wonder. Then, standing on the \nfloor of the Parliament when he was in this debate with Atlee, he said: \nIt has taken 50 years, but I can finally put my eyes on another \nboneless wonder.\n  When I think about the boneless wonder, I think about the people who \nare supposed to be negotiating trade for us and enforcing it and \nstanding up for American interests. They should be working hard on \nbehalf of farmers, steelworkers, auto workers, and so many others in \nthis country, who are part now of a global economy, demanding on their \nbehalf that the rules of trade be fair.\n  We had a hearing in Congress in which we heard about conditions under \nwhich carpets or rugs were made for export to this country. We heard \nabout warehouses where young children, 9, 10, 11, and 12 years old, are \nusing needles to make these carpets that will be sent to Pittsburgh, \nLos Angeles, and Denver--into the American marketplace. Locked in these \nwarehouses, the children had gunpowder put on the tips of their \nfingers, and it was lit with a match; their fingertips were burned so \nthey would scar, and these 10- and 12-year-old kids, with scarred \nfingertips, could then use these needles with impunity, making these \ncarpets, and it would never hurt their fingers because they were now \nscarred sufficiently to be able to resist the needle's sting. That is \nhow they got more productivity out of 10- and 12-year-old kids. They \nwere making carpets that were being sent to this country.\n  The question is: Is that something we ought to allow? Is that fair \ntrade? Is that a product we want on American markets? The answer is no, \nit is not fair trade. We have the marketplace being flooded with \nproducts--the products of forced child labor anywhere in the world. It \nis not fair trade for someone to be paid 16 cents an hour to make shoes \nin a factory somewhere, and ship it to Pittsburgh, and compete with \nsomebody working in a factory in this country who would be required to \nbe paid some sort of a living wage--and to work in a factory that will \nnot pollute the water and air.\n  We fought 75 years in this country for those basic conditions. Now we \nhave people saying, let's pole-vault over those issues, and we will go \nto Bangladesh, or to Indonesia--we will go someplace where we don't \nhave to worry so much about those restrictions, and we will ship the \nproduct back in to Toledo, or Buffalo, or Los Angeles.\n  The global economy needs to define fair trade. We in the U.S. \nGovernment need to define for ourselves when and under what conditions \nwe will stand up for American producers. Or is there not a case at all \nwhere our Government is willing to stand up for American producers and \ndemand fair trade?\n  This is an issue that is not going to go away. We will have the \ndebate over so-called trade protection authority. That is a euphemism. \nYou know, in this town, when something becomes controversial, you just \nchange the name.\n  Fast track became TPA, trade promotion authority. But a hog by any \nother name is a hog. We are talking about fast track.\n  In the coming weeks, the President will ask for fast track. I keep \ncoming back to article I, section 8, which says that:\n\n       The Congress shall have Power To . . . regulate Commerce \n     with foreign Nations. . . .\n\n  I just ask all of those who are concerned about the decision being \nmade next Wednesday on steel, to ask whether the next group of trade \nnegotiators should go out, lock the door, keep the American public out, \nnegotiate a deal, and then come back to the Congress and say: you have \nno business suggesting any change under any circumstance to the deal we \nmade.\n  My hope is we could just once find an administration, Democrat or \nRepublican--it does not matter to me--who would hire trade negotiators \nand have the will and the backbone and the strength to stand up on \nbehalf of American producers and demand fair trade.\n  I am so tired of these mountains of Jell-O that serve in public \noffice and negotiate incompetent agreements, sell away the interests of \nAmerican producers, and then say to us: Oh, by the way, you are \ncorrect; this trade is unfair, but we elect not to do anything about \nit. That is just wrong. I guess on every occasion I have spoken about \nthis, I have suggested--mostly in jest--we ought to have jerseys for \nour trade negotiators. We have them for the\n\n[[Page S1340]]\n\nOlympians and they can look down and know they are for the USA. What \nabout jerseys for trade negotiators so that occasionally when they are \nin meetings, behind those locked doors, they can look down and say: Oh, \nyes, that's right, now I remember for whom I am negotiating.\n  Most of our trade policy has been negotiated as foreign policy. Most \nof it has been eggheaded foreign policy now almost a quarter of a \ncentury. For the first quarter century after the Second World War, it \nwas all foreign policy. We just granted trade concessions everywhere, \nand it did not matter because we were bigger, tougher, and we could \ncompete with anybody around the world with one hand tied behind our \nback. So our trade policy was almost exclusively foreign policy. Then \nwe had competitors who developed into shrewd, tough, international \ncompetitors in the global economy, and we are still running around \ngiving away concessions, tying our hands behind our back, negotiating \nagreements we will not enforce, and shame on us for doing that.\n  This country needs an economy with a manufacturing base. We cannot \nremain a world-class economy unless we have a manufacturing base. We \nneed good jobs that pay well, that sustain a strong manufacturing base \nin our country.\n  There are those in this town who divide the trade debate into two \nthoughtless categories: You are either a smart, incisive person who can \nsee over the horizon and understand that global trade is benefitting \nour country, or if you say anything at all on the other side of the \nissue, you are some xenophobic stooge who does not get it, has never \ngotten it, and wants to build walls around America to keep foreign \nproducts out. Of course, that is a thoughtless way to describe relative \npositions on trade. There is a much better way to describe this \ncountry's trade interests, in my judgment, and that is to say this \ncountry ought to be willing, ready, and able to compete anywhere in the \nworld with any product as long as the competition is fair.\n  The doctrine of comparative advantage is a fair doctrine, in my \njudgment. If someone can make a product better than we can, then by all \nmeans let's find a way to acquire that product from a country that has \na natural advantage. But the impediments to fair trade have very little \nto do with comparative advantage; they have to do with political \nadvantage. They have to do with countries that decided they do not want \nminimum wages; that think it is fine to have 16-year-old kids working \n16 hours a day being paid 16 cents an hour; they think that is fine.\n\n  This country fought 75 years to say it is not fine, and the American \nmarketplace ought not be open to any and all schemes of production \naround the globe, regardless of how inhumane and unjust they might be. \nIt is not acceptable to us as consumers and ought not be acceptable to \nus as public officials who have an obligation to stand up for American \nproducers, for fair trade.\n  Mr. President, that is a long meandering road to describe the \ndecision next Wednesday that this administration has to make on the \nsubject of steel. My hope is that the administration will make the \nright decision. I have not seen an administration in some 20 years that \nhas a record in international trade that I think benefits this country \nand its producers in a way that is fair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/28/senate-section/article/S1340-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1340-S1341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 94\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

The fact is, the Congress ended \nits year and its work without having extended the tax extenders--there \nare some half dozen of them--one of which is the tax credit for wind \nenergy.\n  In my judgment, it is just fundamentally wrong for us not to take the \naction we need to take right now to extend that production tax credit \nfor wind energy.\n  I had a conference in Grand Forks, ND, last week when the Senate was \nnot in session. The conference was on wind energy. Over 700 people \nshowed up. There is great interest in this from all over the country. \nNorth Dakota is No. 1 in wind energy potential. The new technology wind \nturbines are remarkable. To be able to take energy from the wind, put \nit in a transmission line and move it around the country is remarkable.\n  There are plans on the books right now. A CEO from one of the largest \ncompanies came to see me 3 weeks ago. He said: I have plans for 150 \nmegawatts, 150 one-megawatt towers. It is going to cost $130 million to \n$150 million. The plans are done. He said: They are ready; I have the \nmoney. That is already developed. But it had to be put on the shelf \nuntil Congress extends the production tax credit.\n  We do not seem to think it is urgent. I believe it is urgent.\n\n  My colleague, Senator Reid, asked he be remembered on this issue \nbecause he supports this. He has companies in Nevada with plans on the \nshelf. They are ready to go, but they are held up. The same is true in \nmany other States in the country.\n  For that reason, I ask unanimous consent that the Finance Committee \nbe discharged from further consideration of S. 94, a bill to extend tax \ncredits for wind energy; that the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration; that the bill be read a third time and passed; and that \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understood there would be an objection. \nI want to demonstrate again--and I hope I can do this in the coming \ndays--there are many Republicans and Democrats serving in the Senate \nwho know we ought to pass this bill, who want to get this done. We need \nto find a way to make this happen. This is urgent. Yet we are sort of \nat a parade rest on a range of areas.\n  We can talk about who is at fault. I do not intend to do that. I am \nmuch more interested in trying to get this started than I am in trying \nto figure out why it stalled. Let's see if we can work together to \naccomplish this goal. We know it needs doing. We are going to turn to \nthe energy bill next. We know having this production tax credit \nextended is important. It ought to be done now, not later.\n  Mr. President, I understand my colleague from Wyoming was required to \nobject to this. I will not go beyond that except to say I hope he joins \nme and others as we find a way to extend these tax credits and that we \ndo so soon.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I, too, am supportive of wind energy and \nthe alternatives, of course, but we have been waiting--talk about \nwaiting, we have been waiting for months to get to an energy bill, \nwhich has been objected to and held up by the folks on the other side \nof the aisle. We are finally going to get to it, and certainly this \nissue ought to be part of an overall energy policy, not a stand-alone \nbill.\n  So hopefully next week we will have a chance to get to energy. I do \nnot think there is anything more important before this Congress than to \nhave an energy policy in this country. We have talked about it now for \nmonths. I am on the Energy Committee, as well as the Finance Committee. \nWe have talked about energy for a very long time. We did not have a \nchance to put it together in the committee but, rather, the majority \nleader took it away from the committee and brought it to the floor.\n  So now we find ourselves in a very difficult position by putting \ntogether a very complex bill, but hopefully starting in the next day or \ntwo we will have an opportunity to do that. I hope my friend from North \nDakota will have an opportunity to talk about wind energy and the \nopportunities to do something with it at that time. It seems to me that \nis the appropriate time to do it.\n\n[[Page S1341]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/28/senate-section/article/S1340-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1340-S1341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 94\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I will now talk a little bit about \nelection reform. Of course, that is the bill that is before us now, but \nwe have not been able to move it forward in the last day and a half or \nso. Whether we will be able to or not, I do not know. No one disagrees, \nof course, with seeking to do something to make elections fair; to make \nthe changes, if there need to be changes made, to make elections \navailable to everyone on a free basis, an open basis, and a legal \nbasis.\n  I am glad the Senate has taken up this bill. I happen to believe the \nmajor responsibility for voting, whether it be in Florida or whether it \nbe in Wyoming, lies with the State. Where there are problems with \nvoting, the State election officers, it seems to me, have the primary \nresponsibility to do that.\n  One of the issues that has come up--not unusually, I suppose; it \ncomes up in many areas such as health care, education--there is a \ndifference between how you do things in New York City and Meeteetsi, \nWY. That has kind of become an interesting issue with regard to setting \nup voting standards and the requirements that need to be made for \nvoting precincts. When one has a precinct that has thousands of people \nin it, that is one thing. Go to Wapiti, WY, with a precinct that may \nonly have 30 to 40 people in it; that is quite different.\n  When I went home last weekend, we were talking about the proposal \ninitially that there had to be a paved parking lot and access for the \ndisabled. Everyone wants the disabled to be able to vote, and they were \nsaying sometimes we have to look hard to find a place that has a \ntoilet, so we need to do something about that.\n  I have talked with the chairman, and certainly we could, I think, \ncome to some kind of an agreement. This bill currently requires each \npolling place to have a machine that is adaptable for ADA. I am a great \nsupporter of ADA, as a matter of fact, and have worked very hard on \nthat, but I think we have to be realistic about how it is dealt with. \nWe have curbside voting, for example. We can do that for people who are \ndisabled. We have these certain kinds of machines in every county seat, \nbut to require that in some 400 rural polling places, as we have in \nWyoming, would be extremely difficult. Even though the return sometimes \nis, ``Well, the Government is going to pay for it,'' regardless of who \npays for it, some of it is not good use of taxpayer dollars.\n\n  I do not know exactly how it will end up. Perhaps we will not be \nhaving a bill if we cannot move it any more than we have. Perhaps we \ncan continue to talk to the chairman, who seems to be receptive, \nknowing there are differences in how it is dealt with in one place or \nanother.\n  I do want to say we have talked with the elected officials in \nWyoming. As I said, our voting has been very satisfactory. We have a \ngood many registered voters. We had more voters last time than we had \nregistered before the election who came in and could register on \nelection day. It is really quite simple.\n  We are concerned, if we were required to have very complicated \nmachines in every polling place, that that would not be appropriate. \nInstead, if we could offer the flexibility to where they could make \nproposals as to how to deal with voting for disabled and other voters, \nthose could be viewed, and if they were acceptable, then they could do \nit the way they wanted to do it in that community.\n  In any event, I do not know whether we will have an amendment. If \nthat becomes necessary--or perhaps we could have a colloquy with the \nchairman to deal with this in the conference committee--we can do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/28/senate-section/article/S1341-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TRADE AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I have to respond just a little bit to my \nfriend from North Dakota who talked about trade. Obviously, trade is \nvery important for all of us. I am a little interested in how he thinks \n435 people could negotiate a trade agreement. The idea is that the \ntrade agreement needs to be negotiated and then brought to the Congress \nfor approval. If it is not approved, it is not approved. I cannot \nimagine us trying to set up a trade bill and 435 folks trying to deal \nwith that.\n  So I am not in agreement entirely that we ought to take away the \ntrade authority to negotiate and then bring it to the Congress. \nPresidents have had that, and hopefully they will continue to have \nthat.\n  The main constituency of the Senator from North Dakota, of course, is \nagriculture. Forty percent of agricultural products go into foreign \ntrade. Obviously, we all want trade agreements to be fair and \nadvantageous.\n  I also have to respond a little bit to the molasses issue. We worked \non that for several months, and it has been cured, as a matter of fact. \nThe idea that nobody stood up to it is not accurate. The court has \nruled, and that is no longer being done. It was being done, and it was \nwrong, but we brought it up through the court, and it is no longer the \ncase.\n  So trade is always difficult, and certainly I feel strongly about it \nfrom time to time, too. We are in a world where billions of dollars \nmove around the world every day. We are going to have to trade. We are \nbehind other countries in making trade agreements in South America, for \nexample. So hopefully we can find a way to come up with agreements that \nwill allow us to trade with other countries and, at the same time, of \ncourse, be as fair as possible.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on a \nmeeting which has been held with President Bush and Members of Congress \nfrom steel States concerning the plight of the steel industry and the \ndecision which the President is scheduled to make on or before March 6, \n2002. The President has initiated proceedings under Section 201, which \nactivated an inquiry by the International Trade Commission. The \nInternational Trade Commission has made a recommendation that there be \nremedies to stop subsidized and dumped steel from coming\n\n[[Page S1342]]\n\ninto the United States in violation of U.S. law and international trade \nlaw. The President granted our request for a meeting so that we could \nstate to him our views on this important subject.\n  The Senate Steel Caucus has 34 members from 24 States. The House \nSteel Caucus has 133 members. I was Chairman of the Senate Steel Caucus \nuntil Senator Jeffords made his famous declaration. Now I am Vice \nChairman with Senator Jay Rockefeller serving as Chairman.\n  Senator Rockefeller and I were at the meeting with the President, as \nwere Senator Santorum, Senator Durbin, Senator Sessions, and \nCongressman English, Chairman of the House Steel Caucus. We presented \nthe case to the President that this is really the critical stage, that \nit is not inaccurate to say at this time that it is a do-or-die \nsituation.\n  There have been tens of thousands--really hundreds of thousands--of \njobs lost in the steel industry. There have been bankruptcies literally \ntoo numerous to count from the steel companies, and there has been an \nonslaught of steel coming into the United States which is subsidized \nand dumped.\n\n  When the term ``dumping'' is used, it means that steel is sold in the \nUnited States at a price lower than it is sold, for example, in Brazil \nwhere it is manufactured. So it is a calculated effort to sell at a \ncost so low that it undercuts the legitimate costs of American steel, \nand the costs are customarily calculated at the cost of production, \nplus a reasonable profit. The steel which comes into the United States, \nin addition to being dumped, is subsidized very heavily by foreign \ngovernments, so an American steel company is compelled to compete \nagainst a foreign government. That is something you cannot compete \nwith, leading to the characterization of the playing field, which is \nnot level.\n  We presented to the President the consideration that it really \nrequire what Commissioners on the International Trade Commission have \nrecommended. The President said: Where did you come up with the idea of \na 40 percent tariff for 4 years? The response was: Well, that is what \nthe Republican members of the International Trade Commission said. That \nis necessary in order to give the American steel industry an \nopportunity to restructure itself.\n  There have been very extensive conversations with Mr. Leo Gerard, \nPresident of the United Steelworkers of America, and Mr. Tom Usher, \nPresident of USX, regarding the steel tariffs. In discussing the \nremedy, one of the critical parts about imposing a tariff is that it \nwill call upon the foreign steel companies to restructure their steel. \nThere is excess capacity in the world at the present time, and it comes \nto the United States where it is dumped because we are a great market. \nWe have an open market. We believe in free trade, and I believe in free \ntrade. An essential ingredient of free trade is to not allow subsidies \nor dumping, which is illegal. Free trade also has the critical \ncomponent of fair trade, which is a part of free trade.\n  These considerations were presented. The issue arose as to what the \nimpact would be upon the American consumer. It has been carefully \ncalculated. A tariff of 40 percent would lead to a price increase on \nsteel to around 8.4 percent, a negligible cost on the purchase of an \nautomobile or a refrigerator. It is not going to change the American \neconomy, but it is shortsighted for consumers to seek that kind of \ncheaper steel because we know for sure that if, as, or when the \nAmerican steel industry is unable to meet domestic demands, we are at \nthe mercy of foreign steel prices, which are going to go up. It is a \nboomerang consideration. It is not in the consumers' interest in the \nlong run to have that kind of illegal competition come in and drive the \nAmerican steel industry out of business.\n  All of these arguments were presented to the President, a meeting \nwhich lasted for the better part of an hour. The President was \nnoncommittal, subjective as to how he was regarding the arguments. He \nmade a number of comments. I think it is fair to say that he was \nsympathetic to the arguments. He made the point that he was prepared to \nmake the tough decision without regard to political costs or whether \nEurope was going to be mad over what the decision would be.\n  President Bush has shown a remarkable tendency to be willing to make \nhis own judgment, to go his own way. He has shown that in the War on \nTerrorism. He has sometimes been criticized for unilateralism by the \nUnited States, but he is a person who studies a situation very \ncarefully, a very good listener who makes up his mind and then is \nprepared to make a judgment, in accordance with what his conscience \nsays is in the national interest.\n  Overall, I thought it was a very good meeting, and I am optimistic. \nIt is hard to say much more than that without creating false hope or \nfalse impressions.\n  Earlier in the day there was a rally on the Ellipse, which was \ncalculated to be within earshot of the President. The speaker's stand \nwas set up. The Chair was there, as were many of our colleagues in the \nSenate. We heard quite a number of speeches, and an enormous number of \nsteelworkers, men and women, were there. The crowd was estimated to be \nat 25,000. I think that was a conservative estimate. Mr. Leo Gerard, \nPresident of the United Steelworkers of America, said they gave out \n18,000 tokens. They had to bus people into RFK Stadium--there was no \nplace to park the buses--and have them take the subway. Even when the \nrally had run for almost an hour, there were still people streaming in.\n  As I was on the speaker's podium and looked over at the South \nPortico, I could not tell if the President was there listening or \nnot. However, I think he was within earshot. One of the great things \nabout America is our right to assemble, even within earshot of the \nWhite House, as well as the right to freedom of speech and the right to \npetition the Government.\n\n  This whole issue has had a very thorough hearing. It is a matter of \ngreat importance. It is a matter of importance to America to have a \nsteel industry. Without a steel industry, what do you do for national \ndefense in time of a national emergency? Without a steel industry, what \ndo you do if you are at the mercy of foreign suppliers? We have laws to \nstop dumping in subsidy. They are not enforced.\n  Years ago, I introduced legislation for a private right of action. It \nhas been very difficult to get enforcement proceedings. Through the \nInternational Trade Commission, they are laborious. They can be upset \neasily. By the time they take effect, the critical period has passed. \nThey have not been adequate.\n  Now, that the President has introduced, to his credit, the Section \n201 proceedings, there is a chance for real action. Under the law, the \ndecision has to be made by March 6, 2002, which is next Wednesday. To \nrepeat, I am optimistic there will be a good result.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have sought again recognition to \ncomment on the pending nomination of District Court Judge Charles \nPickering who is up for consideration for the Court of Appeals for the \nFifth Circuit. I had spoken briefly on this subject yesterday and had \nstated my intention to support Judge Pickering because he is a \ndifferent man in 2002 than he was in the early 1970s when he was a \nMississippi State senator.\n  The world has come a long way in the intervening 30 years. Attitudes \nhave evolved. Judge Pickering has evidenced his sensitivity to civil \nrights issues. He has been praised broadly by people who know him from \nLaurel, MS, for taking on the leader of the Ku Klux Klan in a way which \nwas physically endangering to Judge Pickering himself.\n  I noted yesterday, and I think it worth commenting today, the votes \nprobably will not be there to send Judge Pickering from the Judiciary \nCommittee with an affirmative vote. It looks to me as if it will be a \nparty-line vote of 10 to 9. Regrettably, there is a great deal of \npartisan politics in the way judges are confirmed by the Senate. \nRegrettably, that is a practice regardless of which party is in control \nof\n\n[[Page S1343]]\n\nthe White House and which party has control of the Senate.\n  When President Clinton, a Democrat, was in the White House, sending \nover nominations, I expressed my personal dissatisfaction at the way \nthey were handled by the Republican-controlled Senate, Republican-\ncontrolled Judiciary Committee. I crossed party lines and voted for \nJudge Paez, Judge Berzon, Judge Gregory, and the nomination of Bill \nLann Lee. Now we have the situation reversed: A Republican President, \nPresident George W. Bush, and a Judiciary Committee controlled by \nthe Democrats.\n\n  It is time for a truce. It is time for an armistice. We ought to sign \na declaration if necessary to set forth a procedure to take partisan \npolitics out of judicial confirmations. That is present very decisively \nwith Judge Pickering. There is an element expressed by some members of \nthe Judiciary Committee on the so-called litmus test, with some people \nbelieving that unless a judicial nominee is willing to endorse Roe v. \nWade on a woman's right to choose, that individual should not be \nconfirmed to the Supreme Court--really, an effort to place Roe v. Wade \non a level with Brown v. Board of Education. But it is clear no one can \nbe confirmed today who said Brown v. Board of Education should be \nreversed.\n  When the nominees are questioned before the Judiciary Committee, they \nfrequently will say: I won't answer that question; it is a matter which \nmay come before the court. That is customarily accepted. If someone \nwere to say that about Brown v. Board of Education, not affirming that \nconclusion--that the decision ending segregation is a vital part of \nAmerica--I think that person could not be confirmed. To establish that \nstandard for Roe v. Wade I think is very contentious, but that awaits \nanother day.\n  The issue of taking partisan politics out of judicial selection is \none with us right now. Earlier this week, Judge D. Brooks Smith, who is \na chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of \nPennsylvania, a person recommended for that position by Senator Heinz \nand myself back in 1988, was confirmed and is now up for the Court of \nAppeals for the Third Circuit. Although not as heavily overlaid as \nJudge Pickering's confirmation was, there is an element of partisanship \nas to Judge Smith. I believe he has answered the questions adequately, \nand I am cautiously confident he will be confirmed.\n  It is my hope that if I am right--hopefully, I am not right and Judge \nPickering will be confirmed by a majority here--if it turns out to be a \nvote along party lines, I am hopeful the Judiciary Committee will send \nJudge Pickering for action by the full Senate. There is precedence for \nthat. Judge Thomas was not recommended by the committee and received a \ntie, 7-to-7, vote. That meant it failed. But by a 13-to-1 vote, the \nJudiciary Committee sent Judge Thomas, who was then a circuit judge, to \nthe Senate, where they voted 13-to-1 that the full Senate should \nconsider him. The full Senate confirmed him 52 to 48.\n  Judge Bork received a negative vote of 5 in favor and 9 against, and \nthen on a motion to send to the floor, Judge Bork got 9 votes that the \nfull Senate should consider him, with 5 members of the Judiciary \nCommittee dissenting.\n  In the old days, we used to have the Judiciary Committee bottleneck \ncivil rights litigation, stopping it from coming to the floor.\n  I believe on the judicial nominations with the overtones of \npartisanship, this is a matter which ought to be decided by the full \nSenate. I urge my colleagues to give consideration that in the event \nthere is not an affirmative vote in committee, at least Judge Pickering \nought to have standing to have the full Senate consider his nomination.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I would like to express my strong \nsupport for the Schumer-Wyden amendment to S. 565, the Martin Luther \nKing Jr., Equal Protection of Voting Rights Act of 2001. While one of \nthe important goals of this legislation is to prevent voter fraud, we \nmust be careful that we do not go so far that we keep eligible voters \nout of the electoral process.\n  This bill currently requires first-time voters who registered by mail \nto provide either a photo ID or a copy of a utility bill, bank \nstatement, a Government paycheck or other government document that \nshows the name or address of the voter when they go to cast their vote. \nWhile this may sound like a reasonable requirement on the surface, the \npractical consequences of this requirement could easily prevent \ncountless eligible voters from voting.\n  For example, senior citizens, who vote in large numbers, often do not \ndrive and therefore, do not have a driver's license to use as a photo \nID. Voting age high school and college students, a group that we need \nto encourage to vote and participate in the democratic process, may not \nhave a photo ID, and certainly will not have a Government paycheck or a \nutility bill in their name. A photo ID requirement also would place a \nheavy burden on the millions of Americans with disabilities who do not \ndrive or do not live independently so that their name would be listed \non a bank statement or utility bill.\n  Finally, a photo ID requirement could have an adverse impact on \nminority voters. Immigrants who have newly become U.S. citizens and \ncome\n\n[[Page S1344]]\n\nfrom countries where governments instill fear instead of trust, could \nbe intimidated by these requirements and might be afraid to vote.\n  The Schumer-Wyden amendment allows States to use signature \nverification and attestation, in addition to a photo ID and government \nchecks, to verify voters; or a State can opt to use only a signature \nverification system. This amendment will allow us to be just as tough \non voter fraud without turning away eligible voters.\n  In Michigan, we have several laws that effectively prevent voter \nfraud, without disenfranchising eligible voters. First-time voters who \nregistered by mail are required to vote in person the first time they \ncast a ballot. Michigan also requires a voter signature for all voters \nat the polls, and has a signature verification system to confirm a \nvoter's identity. These measures protect our electoral system against \nfraud, without undermining voter participation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Schumer-Wyden amendment that \nprotects our electoral system, without preventing eligible voters from \nexercising their right to vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/28/senate-section/article/S1344-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1344-S1346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, today, I join the many Americans who this \nmonth reflect on the rich and extraordinary achievements of African \nAmericans. We do so in keeping with the spirit and the vision of Dr. \nCarter G. Woodson, son of a former slave, who in 1926, proposed such a \nrecognition as a way of preserving the history of the Negro. Each year, \nduring the month of February, we celebrate African American History \nMonth.\n  Dr. Woodson was, himself, an extraordinary individual and I would \nlike to pay tribute to him, as well as several courageous and \naccomplished individuals claimed by my state of Michigan, all of whom \nhave earned a unique place in African American history.\n  Dr. Woodson overcame seemingly insurmountable challenges in his rise \nfrom the coal mines of West Virginia to one of the highest levels of \nacademic achievement of his time. Author Lerone Bennett, writes of the \nstruggles and successes of Carter G. Woodson, who was an untutored coal \nminer at the age of 17; and at the age of 19, after teaching himself \nthe fundamentals of English and arithmetic, entered high school and \nmastered the four-year curriculum in less than two years. At 22, after \ntwo-thirds of a year at Berea College in Kentucky, Woodson returned to \nthe coal mines and studied Latin and Greek between trips to the mine \nshafts. He then went on to the University of Chicago, where he received \nbachelor's and master's degrees, and Harvard University, where be \nbecame the second African American to receive a doctorate in history. \nThe rest, of course, is history.\n  Dr. Benjamin Solomon Carson, Sr., who was born and raised in Detroit, \nhad a childhood dream of becoming a physician. In his books, Gifted \nHands. THINK BIG, and The Big Picture he reveals how growing up in dire \npoverty with horrible grades and being called ``dummy'' as well as \nhaving a horrible temper, and low self-esteem,'' appeared to preclude \nthe realization of that dream. He writes about an inspiring mother, \nwith a third grade education, who worked two and sometimes three jobs \nas a domestic to care for her two sons, determined that they would \nsucceed. Carson remembers, ``we had to read two books a week from the \nDetroit Public Library, and submit to her written book reports, which \nshe could not read, but we didn't know that . . . my mother was one of \ntwenty four children, went through the foster care system and married \nat the age of 13--a marriage that rapidly deteriorated.''\n  Today, despite all of the odds stacked against her and him, Sonya \nCarson's son is one of the world's most gifted surgeons, performing \nover 500 critical operations on children in dire need each year, over \ntriple the average neurosurgeon's caseload. Dr. Ben Carson is Director \nof Pediatric Neurosurgery at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, a \nposition he had held since 1984 when he was 32 years old, then the \nyoungest surgeon in the nation to hold this distinguished title. He is \nalso a professor of neurosurgery, oncology, plastic surgery, and \npediatrics. On the occasion of its 200th anniversary the Library of \nCongress named him one of the 89 ``Living Legends.'' In 2001, he was \nchosen by CNN and Time Magazine as one of America's top 20 physicians \nand scientists. After graduating with honors from high school, Ben \nCarson was accepted to Yale University on a scholarship. He received \nhis M.D. from the University of Michigan.\n  In 1987, he gained worldwide recognition as the principal surgeon in \nthe 22-hour separation of the Binder Siamese twins from Germany. This \nwas the first time occipital craniopagus twins had been separated with \nboth surviving. In 1997, Dr. Carson was the primary surgeon in the team \nof South African and Zambian surgeons that separated type-2 vertical \ncarniopagus twins (joined at the top of the head) in a 28-hour \noperation. It represents the first time such complexly joined siamese \ntwins have been separated with both remaining neurologically normal. He \nis noted for his use of cerebral hemispherectomy to control intractable \nseizures as well as for his work in craniofacial reconstructive \nsurgery, achondroplasia (human dwarfism), and pediatric neuro-oncology \n(brain tumors).\n  Dr. Carson is the president and co-founder of the Carson's Scholars \nFund, which recognizes young people of all backgrounds for exceptional \nacademic and humanitarian accomplishments, which he hopes will \npositively change the perception of high academic achievers among their \npeers across our nation.\n  Madam President, I would also like to pay tribute to two women who \nplayed a pivotal role in addressing American injustice and inequality. \nThey are Sojourner Truth, who helped lead our country out of the dark \ndays of slavery, and Rosa Parks, whose dignified leadership sparked the \nMontgomery Bus Boycott and the start of the Civil Rights movement.\n  Sojourner Truth, though unable to read or write, was considered one \nof the most eloquent and noted spokespersons of her day, on the \ninhumanity and immorality of slavery. She was a leader in the \nabolitionist movement, and a ground breaking speaker on behalf of \nquality for women. Michigan honored her several years ago with the \ndedication of the Sojourner Truth Memorial Monument, which was unveiled \nin Battle Creek, Michigan on September 25, 1999.\n  Sojourner Truth had an extraordinary life. She was born Isabella \nBaumfree in 1797, served as a slave under several different masters, \nand was eventually freed in 1828 when New York state outlawed slavery. \nIn 1851, Sojourner Truth delivered her famous ``Ain't I a Woman?'' \nspeech at the Women's Convention in Akron, Ohio. In the speech, Truth \nattacked both racism and sexism. Truth made her case for equality in \nplain-spoken English when she said, ``Then that little man in black \nthere, he says women can't have as much rights as men, cause Christ \nwasn't a woman? Where did your Christ come from? Where did your Christ \ncome from? From God and a woman! Man had nothing to do with Him''\n\n  By the mid-1850s, Truth had settled in Battle Creek, Michigan. She \ncontinued to travel and speak out for equality. During the Civil War, \nTruth traveled throughout Michigan, gathering food and clothing for \nNegro volunteer regiments. Truth's travels during the war eventually \nled her to a meeting with President Abraham Lincoln in 1864, at which \nshe presented her ideas on assisting freed slaves. Truth remained in \nWashington, DC for several years, helping slaves who had fled from the \nSouth and appearing at women's suffrage gatherings. Due to bad health, \nSojourner Truth returned to Battle Creek in 1875, and remained there \nuntil her death in 1883. Sojourner Truth spoke from her heart about the \nmost troubling issues of her time. A testament to Truth's convictions \nis that her words continue to speak to us today.\n  On May 4, 1999 legislation was enacted which authorized the President \nof the United States to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Rosa \nParks. The Congressional Gold Medal was presented to Rosa Parks on June \n15, 1999 during an elaborate ceremony in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. I \nwas pleased to cosponsor this fitting tribute to Rosa Parks--the gentle \nwarrior who decided that she would no longer tolerate the humiliation \nand demoralization of racial segregation on a bus. Her personal\n\n[[Page S1345]]\n\nbravery and self-sacrifice are remembered with reverence and respect by \nus all.\n  Forty six years ago in Montgomery, Alabama the modern civil rights \nmovement began when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat and move to \nthe back of the bus. The strength and spirit of this courageous woman \ncaptured the consciousness of not only the American people, but the \nentire world. My home state of Michigan proudly claims Rosa Parks as \none of our own. Rosa Parks and her husband made the journey to Michigan \nin 1957. Unceasing threats on their lives and persistent harassment by \nphone prompted the move to Detroit where Rosa Parks' brother resided.\n  Rosa Parks' arrest for violating the city's segregation laws was the \ncatalyst for the Montgomery bus boycott. Her stand on that December day \nin 1955 was not an isolated incident but part of a lifetime of struggle \nfor equality and justice. For instance, twelve years earlier, in 1943, \nRosa Parks had been arrested for violating another one of the city's \nbus related segregation laws, which required African Americans to pay \ntheir fares at the front of the bus then get off of the bus and re-\nboard from the rear of the bus. The driver of that bus was the same \ndriver with whom Rosa Parks would have her confrontation 12 years \nlater.\n  The rest is history. The boycott which Rosa Parks began was the \nbeginning of an American revolution that elevated the status of African \nAmericans nationwide and introduced to the world a young leader who \nwould one day have a national holiday declared in his honor, the \nReverend Martin Luther King Jr.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Madam President, Thomas Carlyle once said, ``a mystic \nbond of brotherhood makes all men one.'' In light of the events of \nSeptember 11, this statement has never rung truer. To see the \nfirefighters, police, and rescue teams working side by side in the \nrecovery effort at the World Trade Center, seeking peace for their \nfallen comrades whether black, white, Hispanic or Asian reminds us just \nhow far we have come in only a few short decades.\n  And yet there is still a great distance to travel. This month, as we \ncelebrate Black History and the contributions made by members of the \nAfrican American community, we must remember that work still remains to \nbe done. Senior leadership at Fortune 500 companies and even our own \nCongress fails to reflect America's racial demographics. But we are \ncertainly moving in the right direction.\n  Less than 50 years ago, it was unthinkable that a black man or woman \nbe an elected official, or university president, or hold any number of \nother prestigious positions across our Nation. That started to change, \nthough, with the bravery of men like Doctors Martin Luther King, Jr. \nand Benjamin E. Mays.\n  While most everyone has heard of the former, Dr. Mays' name is not as \neasily recognized by most Americans, but he is every bit as important \nin the annals of history. Born in South Carolina in 1895, Benjamin Mays \ndistinguished himself as a dean at Howard University and president of \nMorehouse College. Throughout his life, he served his community, \nspeaking early and often against segregation and on behalf of \neducation.\n  Mays urged his students to strive for academic excellence, fight for \nracial justice, and introduced his students to Gandhi's philosophy of \nnon-violence. Years after graduating from Morehouse College, Dr. Martin \nLuther King, Jr. called Mays his most important ``spiritual and \nintellectual mentor.''\n  Dr. Mays was Martin Luther King, Jr.'s teacher, inspiration, and \nfriend. He stood beside Dr. King as during the struggle for racial \nequality, and walked behind his casket during one of the darkest times \nin our Nation's history.\n  The son of former slaves, Dr. Mays had to fight every day of his life \nfor many of the advantages Americans today take for granted. Mays was a \ncivil and human rights leader, noted theologian, educator, and the \nrecipient of 56 honorary degrees.\n  It was with great pleasure that I submitted, and witnessed the \npassage of a resolution encouraging President Bush to award the \nPresidential Medal of Freedom, the highest honor the U.S. government \ncan bestow upon a civilian, posthumously to Dr. Mays. It is an honor \nthat is well overdue, and rightfully deserved.\n  Benjamin Mays understood disappointment and pain, and dealt with both \nduring his long life of public service, but he never lost site of his \nultimate goals. He explained why when he said, ``The tragedy in life \ndoesn't lie in not reaching your goal. The tragedy lies in having no \ngoal to reach. It isn't a calamity to die with dreams unfulfilled, but \nit is a calamity not to dream. . . . It is not a disgrace not to reach \nthe stars, but it is a disgrace to have no stars to reach for. Not \nfailure, but low aim, is sin.''\n  It is with those words in mind that we must continue to fight for \nmore equity in our society. Certainly we have come a long way in a \nrelatively short period of time, but let us not lose site of how far \naway the horizon still lies.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, as we conclude Black History Month, I rise \nto join in the celebration of the achievements of African Americans \nthroughout our Nation's history, and especially in my home State of \nRhode Island. Indeed, African Americans have contributed a great deal \nto my State, and I am honored to be able to acknowledge two such \nindividuals today, the late Reverend Mahlon Van Horne of Newport, and \nthe late John Hope of Brown University.\n  Reverend Van Horne was one of Newport's most prominent African \nAmericans in the late 1800's. He was an avid civil rights activist, a \nthree term State representative, and was also one of the Nations first \nblack diplomats. Reverend Van Horne came to Newport, RI, in 1868 after \nbeing ordained, and graduating from Lincoln University in Pennsylvania. \nHe began his ministry in Rhode Island as the Acting Pastor of the \nColored Union Congregational Church of Newport. Despite the times in \nwhich he lived, due to his charismatic leadership and scholarly \nsermons, his congregation was made up of both black and white Rhode \nIslanders, and the many black professionals from New York, Washington, \nD.C., and Philadelphia who would come to Newport during the summer \nmonths. By 1871, his congregation had grown to the point where they had \nto tear down the old church to make way for a larger building which was \nrenamed the Union Congregational Church. Despite his success as a \nminister, Reverend Van Horne did not stop there, in 1871 he was able to \nsuccessfully draw votes from both blacks and whites to win election to \nthe Newport School Committee, the first African American ever to serve \nin this capacity. As a member of the school committee, he used his \nposition to continue his civil rights movement and pressed for \nintegration and better education for Newport's black children. In 1885, \nhe was elected to the Rhode Island General Assembly, becoming the first \nAfrican American to ever serve in the State legislature. He was re-\nelected in 1886, and 1887, and after his last term he continued in his \nrole as pastor of the Union Congregational Church. His service did not \nend there. In 1896, President William McKinley appointed Reverend Van \nHorne as the United States Counsel to the Danish West Indies, in where \nhe served his Nation honorably for 12 more years.\n  Another great Rhode Islander that I would like to bring attention to \nwas a champion of education; John Hope. Mr. Hope first came to Rhode \nIsland in 1890 when he enrolled as a freshmen at Brown. While in school \nhe became very involved in the African-American community, and later \njoined the Second Free Will Baptist Church in Providence. While a \nmember of the Church, he started a literary club with the help of other \nprominent African Americans in the community. In honor of his work in \nProvidence, in 1944, the community center on Burgess street was renamed \nthe John Hope Settlement House and continues to be a vital resource for \nmany of the residents of Providence today. In addition to his community \ninvolvement and dedication to the education of blacks in Providence, \nJohn Hope was a founding editorial board member of the Daily Herald and \na campus correspondent for the New York Tribune, and wrote many \narticles for the Providence Journal and the Chicago Tribune. After his \ngraduation from Brown, John Hope continued his mission of improving \neducational opportunities for blacks by taking a position teaching \nGreek and Latin at the\n\n[[Page S1346]]\n\nRoger Williams University in Nashville, Tennessee an all black \ninstitution. From there, he moved on to become the President of one of \nthe most prestigious historically black institutions of higher \neducation Morehouse College, from 1906 to 1929. He culminated his \ncareer in education as the President of Atlanta University, which was \nthe only black graduate school in the Nation at the time, where he \nserved until his death in 1936. John Hope's vision that education is \nthe key to improving the quality of life for not only African \nAmericans, but for all Americans, is one I share.\n  It is truly my honor and privilege to acknowledge such great Rhode \nIslander's during Black History Month, and it is my hope that these and \nother African American leaders from both past and present will continue \nto inspire our Nation's youth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/28/senate-section/article/S1346-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SONNY MONTGOMERY AWARD TO SENATOR ROBERTS\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, on Monday night Senator Pat Roberts was \nrecognized as the 2002 recipient of the National Guard Bureau's ``Sonny \nMontgomery'' Award.\n  Senator Roberts' comments upon receiving this award highlight, in a \nmost thoughtful and eloquent manner, the absolutely critical role our \nNation's National Guard plays in the defense of our homeland and our \nown strategic defense in critical areas beyond our shores--an example \nbeing the 29th Division, with elements from Virginia, now serving in \nBosnia.\n  This vital role is nowhere more evident than in Virginia where our \nNational Guard men and women patrol the skies over our Nation's Capital \nand help defend key military posts and bases across the State.\n  I would like to highlight my colleague's wise admonition that we must \n``preserve our founding fathers intent with respect to the National \nGuard, specifically preserving the connection between military forces \nand the States, between our national defense and America's local cities \nand towns.'' Excellent advice, we in the Congress must be very careful \nto heed it.\n  As America is continuing its preparations to defend our homeland \nagainst territorial threats, we owe a debt of gratitude to our \nrespected colleague, from the great State of Kansas, as he, serving as \nchairman of the ``Subcommittee on Emerging Threats'' of the Armed \nServices Committee during the 106th Congress, laid foundations--at \ntimes in the face of skepticism and resistance--before the attacks of \nSeptember 11, foundations we are rapidly building on today to \nstrengthen our Homeland Defense.\n  As Americans reflect, with deep gratitude, on the proud history of \nAmerica's military, let us never forget that the Guard was our first, \nbeing founded in 1636.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Roberts' remarks be printed in \nthe Record along with introductory comments by the distinguished Chief \nof the National Guard Bureau, Lieutenant General Russell C. Davis.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Remarks by Chief of the National Guard Bureau (General Russ Davis) \nPresenting the Sonny Montgomery Award to Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas, \n                            Monday, 25, 2002\n\n       This evening we gather to bestow the 6th Annual Major \n     General G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery Award. This award was \n     established in 1996 to honor an outstanding individual whose \n     accomplishments were of major significance to the National \n     Guard of the United States. Specifically, it is presented to \n     an individual: who has demonstrated exemplary service to the \n     National Guard at the national level; whose performance \n     exceeded the normal scope of public or private service in \n     support to the Nation's defense; who demonstrated skill and \n     initiative to introduce new policies or procedures that \n     significantly advance the mission of the National Guard; and \n     who exhibited integrity, competence, and the ability to \n     inspire others.\n       This year we are very pleased to present this Award to \n     Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas. Throughout his career, Senator \n     Roberts has been an industrious and effective advocate for a \n     robust national security posture for the United States. Today \n     he is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He \n     plays a key, forward-thinking role in making certain that \n     America is ready to counter post-Cold War and terrorist \n     threats. He was the first chairman and today is the ranking \n     member of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee.\n       Senator Roberts has led the way in strengthening America's \n     ability to meet the threat posed by Weapons of Mass \n     Destruction. Years before the events of September 11, Senator \n     Roberts was at the forefront of the debate on increasing the \n     security of the United States homeland.\n       His strong support for the creation, expansion and \n     sustainment of the National Guard's Weapons of Mass \n     Destruction Civil Support Teams is but one example of the \n     demonstrated leadership, wisdom and foresight of Senator \n     Roberts.\n       We are joined tonight by a number of other highly \n     distinguished Kansans including the Nation's Chairman of the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Richard Meyers and the \n     Adjutant General of Kansas, Major General Greg Gardner. I \n     would ask the Honorable Sonny Montgomery to come forward to \n     make the presentation of the award that bears his name.\n                                  ____\n\n\nStatement of Senator Pat Roberts, Recipient, the National Guard Bureau \n                    G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery Award\n\n       Thank you General Myers, General Davis, General Rees, \n     General Gardner, the Kansas Guard, and distinguished visitors \n     to the Capitol. It is truly an honor to receive the Sonny \n     Montgomery Award from the National Guard Bureau and from the \n     Guardsman and women currently serving our Nation here at home \n     as well as around the world.\n       2001 was a challenging year for America and her National \n     Guard. Determined enemies attacked America and our way of \n     life, killing thousands, but the Guard sprung into action. \n     Army Guard personnel were tasked to secure our airports, \n     harbors, military bases and other critical infrastructure \n     while Air Guard personnel, along with their active brothers \n     and sisters, were tasked to secure our airspace and yes, if \n     need be, take out the threat of another hijacked jetliner \n     bearing down on an America city.\n       Guard personnel are participating in the ongoing mission in \n     Afghanistan to kill or capture remaining al Qaeda. On top \n     of that, the Guard continues to develop its primary role \n     in the evolving Homeland security mission area.\n       Indeed, the National Guard was deployed and in action well \n     before September 11: Southwest Asia, Former Yugoslavia, South \n     America, disaster relief and other missions here at home. The \n     list goes on.\n       However, I wanted to specifically mention your performance \n     since the attacks: outstanding and inspiring. Your country \n     needs you now more than ever. Keep up the good work and know \n     there are those in Congress who will champion your mission \n     and cause.\n       It is a privilege to receive an award for ``exceptional \n     support to the nation's defense for significantly advancing \n     the mission of the National Guard.'' I hope I have indeed \n     done so and can live up to Sonny's namesake in the months and \n     years ahead.\n       And, what a privilege it is to receive and award so \n     deservedly named after the veteran's all time champion Sonny \n     Montgomery: successful businessman; decorated Veteran of \n     World War II & Korea; champion of the Guard; congressman; \n     general; chairman; and colleague, Southern Gentleman.\n       I don't want to leave the podium tonight without discussing \n     an issue of great importance to the Guard and to our Nation.\n       This past year I was a part of the dialogue between the \n     Department of Defense and the Air Guard on the future of the \n     active component-National Guard relationship.\n       Indeed, we can and ought to discuss new missions for \n     various units be they active component, Army Guard, or Air \n     Guard.\n       Any changes, however, must preserve our founding fathers \n     intent with respect to the National Guard, specifically \n     preserving the connection between military forces and the \n     states, between our national defense and America's local \n     cities and towns.\n       This relationship serves a critical practical purpose \n     today: when America goes to war, which we are doing often, so \n     to do America's States, cities, and towns.\n       That kind of connection between the people and their \n     military helps to ensure our forces are not used without at \n     least the knowledge, if not consent and support, of the \n     American people.\n       So let us have a discussion on transformation, the weapons \n     and tactics of the future, and the future of the active \n     component, National Guard relationship.\n       But let us not consider severing a critical link between \n     the American people and their military. Let us not make the \n     mistake of taking down flags, consolidating all authority and \n     control in Washington, DC, and broadening whatever gap \n     already exists between the military and civilian sectors.\n       America needs her Guard now more than ever but not just \n     your outstanding skills, capability and dedication.\n       For the current international obligations, the War Against \n     Terrorism, and the wars of the future, America must bring to \n     the fight every state, city, town, and community.\n       Thank you again for this honor and I look forward to \n     working with you in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/28/senate-section/article/S1346-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1346-S1347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred November 11, \n1993 in New Orleans, LA. A group of attackers stabbed a gay man to \ndeath and injured his friend. The assailants, several men, chased the \nvictims, beat them, and yelled anti-gay slurs.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/28/senate-section/article/S1347-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ABDUCTION AND DEATH OF DANIEL PEARL\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, the shock of September 11 has been \nreplaced with a focus on rebuilding and recovery, but the abduction and \ndeath of Daniel Pearl remind us that cold-blooded terrorism continues \nand that its casualties are too often innocent individuals: moms, dads, \nsisters, brothers, husbands, wives, and children.\n  A writer for The Wall Street Journal since 1990, Daniel Pearl, was \nabducted in Karachi, Pakistan on January 23, while going, he thought, \nto conduct an interview about the Islamic militant underground. Instead \nof being granted that interview, Mr. Pearl was abducted, and it is now \nclear that his kidnappers intended all along to kill him, in the most \nhorrifying fashion.\n  Born in Princeton, NJ, Daniel Pearl moved as a young man with his \nfamily to California's San Fernando Valley, where his parents still \nreside. He attended Birmingham High School in Van Nuys, and went onto \nStanford University where he graduated with a degree in Communications.\n  Journalism was clearly his calling, and he returned to the northeast \nto begin his career. Following a stint with a newspaper in \nMassachusetts, he joined the staff of The Wall Street Journal. Over the \nnext decade, he would see the world, beginning with postings in Atlanta \nand Washington, and later in London and Paris.\n  Wherever he went, people were drawn to and delighted by Daniel Pearl. \nHis warmth and wit, his kindness and intelligence, defined him as a \nperson and were gifts that he shared generally with those around him.\n  I offer my deepest condolences to Daniel Pearl's wife Mariane, 7 \nmonths pregnant with their first child; to his parents Dr. Yehuda and \nRuth Pearl, and to his sisters Tamara and Michelle, who describe their \nbrother, son and husband as ``such a gentle soul . . . the musician, \nthe writer, the storyteller, the bridge builder.''\n  Their courage and dignity in the face of this tragic loss is nothing \nshort of inspirational, and my heart goes out to them.\n  It is time for the terrorism to stop. In the name of Daniel Pearl and \nthe other innocent victims, we must seek to understand the roots of \nterrorism in the world and bring to an end the ever-escalating cycle of \nviolence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/28/senate-section/article/S1347-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 U2'S CONTRIBUTION TO A LOST GENERATION\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I would like to take this time to \ncongratulate Bono and the band U2 on receiving four Grammy Awards at \nlast night's ceremony. While music listeners across the globe recognize \nBono's music is well deserving of such accolades, I believe that \nanother aspect of his career is also deserving of recognition.\n  I was first introduced to Bono when he came by my office to talk \nabout Africa and the struggles many third world countries face, \nincluding the issues of debt relief and the global HIV/AIDS epidemic. \nAs chair of the Senate subcommittee on African Affairs and an active \nparticipant in medical missionary work in Africa, I was interested in \nlearning how a rock star could contribute to international policy. I \nquickly found out that Bono was much more than a music icon. He is a \nserious person, well versed in the many issues that plague third world \ncountries. More importantly, I found a person who was willing to use \nhis time and talent to champion issues that will help end poverty and \ndisease throughout the world.\n  In January, Bono joined me on my trip to Uganda, where we visited \nhealth centers and AIDS clinics to learn how countries are coping with \nwhat's become the world's greatest health crisis. In a region where \nover half the population is under 15, Bono was able to carefully \nbalance compassion and pragmatism. He asked the hard questions that \ncountries like Uganda now face and how we, as a world, can aid in the \nfight. His interest was genuine. His commitment to making a difference \nwas concrete. And because of his efforts, countries like Uganda and \nmany others have a viable spokesperson committed to ending their \nstrife.\n  U2's music has always been one of compassion and humanity, committed \nas much to what their lyrics say as to how the music sounds. But this \nhigher level of political consciousness goes far beyond U2's music. \nIt's a part of their advocacy efforts and apparent in their ability to \nstay committed to the issues they support. Just as U2 is still being \nhonored for their music after 25 years, I fully expect them to also be \nremembered for their efforts to improve international policy 25 years \nfrom now.\n  Taking home four of music's most prestigious honors is, in itself, an \ninspiring feat. But it's Bono and U2's ability to be a voice for a lost \ngeneration that deserves the real honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/28/senate-section/article/S1347-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1347-S1348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WATER INVESTMENT ACT OF 2002\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, I am pleased to join my \ncolleagues on the Environment & Public Works Committee in introducing \nthe Water Investment Act of 2002. The introduction of this bill to \nprovide clean water for our nation comes in the year that we are \ncelebrating the 30th anniversary of the Clean Water Act. When I became \nchairman of the committee in 1999, one of my top priorities was a \nrenewed commitment to our nation's water systems and the Americans \nserved by them. Since that time, the committee has held a number of \nhearings, both at the subcommittee level, chaired by my good friend \nfrom Idaho, Senator Crapo, and at the full committee level. I am \npleased that Senators Jeffords and Graham have continued to make this a \npriority in their new roles as full committee and subcommittee \nchairmen. Today that effort culminates with the introduction of this \nbipartisan piece of legislation that will address the many water \ninfrastructure problems facing our local communities.\n  So much of our nation's water infrastructure is aging and in \ndesperate need of replacement. Coupled with the aging problem is the \ncost burden that local communities face in order to comply with ever \nincreasing State and Federal clean water mandates. This bill addresses \nthese problems and makes structural changes to ensure that we avoid a \nnational crisis now and in the future.\n  I am a strong advocate of limited government and when it comes to \nwater infrastructure, I do not believe the primary responsibility of \nfinancing local water needs lies with the Federal government. I am \nequally adamant, however, that the Federal government shouldn't place \nunfunded mandates on our local communities. This bill recognizes both \nof these principles and strikes a responsible balance. The legislation \nauthorizes $35 billion over the next five years in Federal contribution \nto the total water infrastructure need to help defray the cost of the \nmandates placed on communities. This is a substantial increase in \nFederal commitment, but not nearly as high as some would have \npreferred. Even so, this commitment does not come without additional \nresponsibilities. When the Clean Water Act was amended by Congress in \n1987, a debate I remember well, we set up a revolving fund so more \nfederal money would not be required. The fund would continually revolve \nproviding a continual pool of money for water needs. Unfortunately, \nmany officials did not meet their commitment to properly plan for \nfuture needs and what was not to be Federal responsibility became a \nFederal necessity. Now we are faced with a near crisis situation. This \nbill makes certain that we do not go down that road again. The Federal \ngovernment will help to defray the costs of Federal mandates, but with \nthe new money comes a new requirement that all utilities do a better \njob of managing their funds and plan for future costs. The Federal \ntrough\n\n[[Page S1348]]\n\nwill not continue to be filled up every so many years because there is \na dereliction of responsibility--so that 15 years from now, these \nutilities will not be coming back to Congress looking for an additional \n$57 billion. The bill requires utilities to assess the condition of \ntheir facility and pipes and develop a plan to pay for the long-term \nrepair and replacement of these assets. That plan will include Federal \nassistance, but it will be limited assistance.\n  We also make additional structural changes to the law both to address \nfinancial concerns and to help achieve improved management of these \nwater systems. One such change to the Clean Water Act is to incorporate \na Drinking Water Act provision that allows States, at their discretion, \nto provide principal forgiveness on loans and to extend the repayment \nperiod for loans to disadvantaged communities. This flexibility will \nprovide help to communities struggling with high combined sewer \noverflow cost to secure additional financial help. This bill also \npromotes other important cost saving measures that many communities are \nready experimenting with throughout the country.\n  Finally Madam President, New Hampshire is the midst of our worst \ndrought in 50 years. In an effort to help communities facing water \nshortages, this bill directs the U.S. Geological survey to assess the \nstate of water resources. The USGS is then to share with localities \ninformation on water shortages and surplus, planning models and \nstreamlined procedures for local interaction with federal agencies \nresponsible for water resources. This type of information will be \nhelpful to New Hampshire communities facing a severe water shortage.\n  I am pleased that Republicans and Democrats worked together to \nintroduce this bipartisan bill to address one of the very urgent needs \nof the nation. It will be a tremendous help to many struggling \ncommunities in New Hampshire and across the country. It is my hope that \nwe can move it through the committee process and see it passed by the \nSenate in short order. Madam President, I want to express my \nappreciation to Senator Crapo, who has been my partner in this for over \ntwo years. I also want to thank Senators Jeffords and Graham for their \nwork in getting us to this point--their leadership will be crucial in \ngetting this bill to the President's desk.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/28/senate-section/article/S1348-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN BIG TEN CONFERENCE CHAMPIONS\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, it is with great pride that I rise today \nto honor the University of Wisconsin's men's basketball team. On \nWednesday, the Badgers beat Michigan, 74-54, in Madison to finish 11-5 \nand clinch at least a share of the Big Ten Conference Championship and \na No. 1 seed in next week's Conference Tournament. The players and \ncoaches on the University of Wisconsin men's basketball team provide an \nexample of commitment, skill and sportsmanship as they bring the school \nits first Big Ten Conference title in men's basketball since 1947.\n  Not too many people gave this young team a chance to succeed before \nthe season began. Based on the preseason consensus, this was to be a \nrebuilding year and the Badgers would finish near or at the bottom of \nthe league standings. However, in the spirit of the Wisconsin faithful \nwho have supported the men's basketball program both in times of glory \nand moments of frustration, the Badgers proved themselves to be a \nhardworking, highly motivated and resilient team.\n  I especially want to recognize the phenomenal job of first-year UW \ncoach Bo Ryan, who, from day one, brought a winning atmosphere. \nLikewise, the close-knit group of players committed themselves to \nimproving throughout the season. It all culminated with the team \nwinning its last six Big Ten games. Coach Ryan and his players have \ngiven the State of Wisconsin a lot of great basketball to look forward \nto in the years to come.\n  Winning the Big Ten is an impressive achievement, one that the \nplayers, coaches, and fans should be proud of for as long as they live. \nThe Badgers' season, however, is not done yet. I look forward to \ncheering the team on during ``March Madness,'' and hope to watch this \nhard-working team make it all the way to Atlanta for the Final Four.

With \nthe motto, ``To make the best better,'' the organization has grown from \nan agriculture based institution into a well balanced mix of 7 million \nurban and rural members.\n  4-H encourages service; it promotes civility; broadens life \nexperiences; and pushes a better way of life through a healthy spirit \nand healthy living. After 100 years of existence, the organization has \ngrown to more than 50 million alumni, of which 55 are Members of \nCongress.\n  In an interview with Roll Call Daily, I had the chance to reflect on \nmy 4-H experience. I remember well how 4-H taught me how to be a \nleader, how to prioritize and organize, as well as running meetings \nwith efficiency and purpose. 4-H projects paid for nearly all of my \ntuition to become a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine.\n  The value of 4-H to America's youth can be measured in the \naccomplishments of its members--both past and present, and in the hours \nand hours of service the many 4-H clubs across the country have \ndedicated to service projects and personal development. \nCongratulations, and, I wish the organization many more successful \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/28/senate-section/article/S1348-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO DREW HENDERSON OF HENRY CLAY HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Madam President, I have the distinct honor today \nof recognizing the recent accomplishments of Sarah Conn and Jewell, \nboth residents of Winchester, KY.\n  At this year's 126th Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show held in New \nYork City, 12-year-old Sarah Conn and her graceful Boston Terrier, \nJewell, put on quite a performance, taking Best in Breed and winning \nthe prestigious Open Junior Handler title. In winning Best in Breed, \nSarah amazingly bested a woman who has been showing Boston Terriers for \nan astonishing 50 years and a man who is rated the top handler in the \nBoston Terrier category. Sarah and Jewell rose to the occasion, \novercoming all obstacles to prove that they do indeed belong at the \ntop.\n  Sarah and Jewell have obviously worked extremely hard to earn this \nhonorable distinction and deserve our praise for their diligent \nefforts. I know that the people of Winchester as well as the people of \nthe Commonwealth of Kentucky are proud of their achievements. I finally \nask my colleagues to join me in thanking Sarah and Jewell for proudly \nrepresenting the Commonwealth of Kentucky in this year's Westminster \nDog Show.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/28/senate-section/article/S1349-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/28/senate-section/article/S1349-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/28/senate-section/article/S1349-4", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1542.

A bill to make needed reforms in the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, and for other purposes; to the committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I rise today, joined by my good friend \nSenator Grassley, to introduce the FBI Reform Act of 2002. This bill \nstems from the lessons learned during a series of Judiciary Committee \nhearings on oversight of the FBI that I chaired beginning last June. \nEven more recently, the important changes which are being made under \nthe FBI's new leadership after the September 11 attacks and the new \npowers granted the FBI by the USA PATRIOT Act have resulted in FBI \nreform becoming an pressing matter of national importance.\n  Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, and the anthrax attacks last \nfall, we have relied on the FBI to detect and prevent acts of \ncatastrophic terrorism that endanger the lives of the American people \nand the institutions of our country. The men and women of the FBI are \nperforming this task with great professionalism at home and abroad. I \nthink that we have all felt safer as a result of the full mobilization \nof the FBI's dedicated Special Agents, its expert support personnel, \nand its exceptional technical capabilities. We owe the men and women of \nthe FBI our thanks.\n  For decades the FBI has been an outstanding law enforcement agency \nand a vital member of the United States intelligence community. As our \nhearings and recent events have shown, however, there is room for \nimprovement at\n\n[[Page S1353]]\n\nthe FBI. We must face the mistakes of the past, and make the changes \nneeded to ensure that they are not repeated. In meeting the \ninternational terrorist challenge, the Congress has an opportunity and \nobligation to strengthen the institutional fibre of the FBI based on \nlessons learned from recent problems the Bureau has experienced.\n  This view is not mine alone. When Director Bob Mueller testified at \nhis confirmation hearings last July, he forthrightly acknowledged \n``that the Bureau's remarkable legacy of service and accomplishment has \nbeen tarnished by some serious and highly publicized problems in recent \nyears. Waco, Ruby Ridge, the FBI lab, Wen Ho Lee, Robert Hanssen, and \nthe McVeigh documents--these familiar names and events remind us all \nthat the FBI is far from perfect and that the next director faces \nsignificant management and administrative challenges.'' Since then, the \nJudiciary Committee has forged a constructive partnership with Director \nMueller to get the FBI back on track.\n  Congress sometimes has followed a hands-off approach about the FBI. \nBut with the FBI's new increased powers, with our increased reliance on \nthem to stop terrorism, and with the increased funding requested in the \nPresident's budget will come increased scrutiny. Until the Bureau's \nproblems are resolved and new challenges overcome, we have to take a \nhands-on approach.\n  Indeed our hearings and other oversight activities have highlighted \ntangible steps the Congress should take in an FBI reform bill as part \nof this hands-on approach. Last year's hearings demonstrated the need \nto improve FBI internal accountability, extend whistleblower \nprotection, end the double-standard for discipline of senior FBI \nexecutives, enhance the FBI's internal security program to protect \nagainst espionage as occurred in the Hanssen case, and modernize the \nFBI's information technology systems. Since last year's oversight \nhearings, the committee has explored additional management issues that \nare reflected in the FBI Reform Act. Senator Grassley called attention \nto concerns about the practices of the FBI and other Federal criminal \ninvestigative agencies in reporting and using statistics on their \ninvestigations. In addition, FBI officials responsible for protecting \nits facilities informed us of difficulties in retaining the most \nqualified people on the FBI's own police force to protect some of our \nnation's most important and, unfortunately, most targeted facilities.\n\n  When Director Mueller announced the first stage of his FBI \nreorganization last December, he stressed the importance of taking a \ncomprehensive look at the FBI's missions for the future, and Deputy \nAttorney General Thompson's office has told us that the Attorney \nGeneral's management review of the FBI is considering this matter. \nDirector Mueller has stated that the second phase of FBI reorganization \nwill be part of a ``comprehensive plan to address not only the new \nchallenges of terrorism, but to modernize and streamline the Bureau's \nmore traditional functions. . . .'' Thus, through our hearings, our \nother oversight efforts, and the statements and efforts of the new \nmanagement team at the FBI, an initial list of challenges facing the \nFBI has been developed.\n  The provisions in the FBI Reform Act address each of these \nchallenges.\n  Titles I, II, and VII of the FBI Reform Act strengthen the system for \nuncovering and reviewing FBI misconduct and imposing appropriate \ndiscipline, so that there is appropriate accountability. Title I \ncreates statutory jurisdiction for the DOJ Inspector General over \nallegations of misconduct in the FBI. It brings the statutory \nauthorities of the Justice Department's Inspector General into line \nwith the administrative regulations adopted by the Attorney General on \nJuly 11, 2001, ensuring that there will be no return to a system in \nwhich the FBI enjoyed unique exemption for scrutiny by an independent \nInspector General. Title II strengthens whistleblower protection for \nFBI employees and protects them from retaliation for reporting \nwrongdoing. Title VII eliminates statutory disparities in disciplinary \npenalties for Senior Executive Service and non-SES personnel.\n  The committee received testimony in our oversight hearings showing \nthat, too often, the independence that is part of the FBI's culture \ncrossed the line into arrogance. Senator Danforth expressed concern to \nthe committee about entrenched executives at the FBI who had created a \nclosed and insular culture resistant to disclosure of mistakes and to \nreforms. His concern was echoed in testimony the committee heard from \nexperienced FBI Special Agents, including a unit chief in the FBI's own \nOffice of Professional Responsibility, who told us of a ``club'' \nmentality among some Bureau executives who viewed any criticism or \nchange as a threat to their careers.\n  If there was one message from these witnesses, it was that FBI \nexecutives needed to be more willing to admit their mistakes. Too often \ntheir response was to shield the Bureau from embarrassment by \nsacrificing accountability and needed reform. For example, Senator \nDanforth testified that the FBI helped fan the flames of conspiracy \ntheories at Waco by covering up evidence that it used pyrotechnic \nrounds, even though they had nothing to do with starting the fire. The \nFBI culture demanded covering up rather than admitting a mistake. Of \ncourse, as the FBI painfully discovered, the price for circling the \nwagons in this way can be the loss of public confidence.\n\n  The Justice Department Inspector General is in a position to conduct \nan independent investigation that enables the Attorney General and the \nFBI Director to hold FBI personnel accountable and learn the necessary \nlessons from mistakes. When Director Mueller was asked at his \nconfirmation hearing about a separate FBI Inspector General, he \nreplied, ``If I were the Attorney General I might have some concern \nabout a separate Inspector General feeding the perception that the FBI \nwas a separate institution accountable only to itself. And I'm not \ncertain in my own mind whether or not what the accountability you seek \ncannot be discharged by an Inspector General with appropriate personnel \nin the Department of Justice, as opposed to establishing another \nInspector General in the FBI.'' Attorney General Ashcroft decided to \nfollow this route, and Title I of the FBI Reform Act codifies his \naction.\n  The committee also heard disturbing testimony about retaliation \nagainst FBI Agents who are tasked to investigate their colleagues or \nwho discuss issues with the Congress, either directly or through \ncooperation with the General Accounting Office, which assists in \ncongressional oversight. Therefore, Title II is important to ensure \nthat the Federal whistleblower protection laws protect FBI personnel to \nthe greatest extent possible. Senator Grassley deserves great credit \nfor stressing the need for this provision and developing the language \nin the bill. The bill extends whistleblower protections to employees \nwho report wrongdoing to their supervisors or to Congress, and ensures \nthat whistleblowers will enjoy basic procedural protections, including \nthe normal procedures and judicial review provided under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, if they are subjected to retaliation. It \nalso ensures that those who report wrongdoing to the Office of the \nSpecial Counsel have access to the normal Merit System Protection Board \nrights if retaliated against.\n  Title VII addresses the issue of a double standard for discipline of \nsenior executives. Internal investigations must lead to fair and just \ndiscipline. A troubling internal FBI study that was released at the \ncommittee's July hearing documented a double standard at work, with \nsenior FBI executives receiving a slap on the wrist for the same kind \nof conduct that would result in serious discipline for lower level \nemployees. At his confirmation hearing, Director Mueller said it is \n``very important that there be no double standards in accountability. I \nknow there have been allegations that senior FBI officials are \nsometimes treated more leniently than more junior employees. Any such \ndouble standard would be fundamentally unfair and enormously \ndestructive to employee morale.'' Title VII embodies that principle by \neliminating the disparity in authorized punishments between Senior \nExecutive Service members and other Federal employees.\n  The Hanssen espionage case was a tremendous shock to the nation and \nto the FBI. A trusted and experienced FBI Supervisory Special Agent was \nfound\n\n[[Page S1354]]\n\nto have sold many of the nation's most sensitive national security \nsecrets to the Soviet Union and to Russia. Just as the Ames case forced \nthe CIA to revamp its security program after 1994, the Hanssen case \nrequires major changes in FBI security. Former FBI and CIA Director \nWilliam Webster chairs a commission that is completing its review of \nlessons learned from the Hanssen case for the Attorney General and the \nFBI Director. It is my hope that Judge Webster will testify before \nthe Judiciary Committee when his report is complete to present his \nunclassified findings and recommendations. The FBI Reform Act includes \nprovisions that are based on the Judiciary Committee's initial \noversight hearings and we remain open to incorporating the considered \nrecommendations and reforms for which the Webster Commission may call.\n\n  Title III of the FBI Reform Act would establish a Career Security \nProgram in the FBI and Title IV would establish an FBI \nCounterintelligence Polygraph Program for screening personnel in \nexceptionally sensitive positions with specific safeguards. In \naddition, as a result of concerns about terrorist attacks against FBI \ntargets, Title V would authorize an FBI police force as part of \ncomprehensive security enhancements.\n  The FBI Career Security Program would bring the FBI into line with \nother U.S. intelligence agencies that have strong career security \nprofessional cadres whose skills and leadership are dedicated to the \nprotection of agency information, personnel, and facilities. The \nchallenges of espionage, information technology vulnerability, and the \nFBI's high profile as a target of terrorist attack require that the FBI \nmatch or exceed the best security programs in the intelligence and \nnational security community. This can only be achieved by a fundamental \nchange that reverses the tendency, found too often in civilian \nagencies, to treat security as a secondary mission and security \nassignments as obstacles to career advancement. Before the Hanssen \ncase, an FBI Special Agent experienced as a criminal investigator might \nbe assigned for a few years to a security position and then move on \nwithout building continuity of security expertise. Turnover in FBI \nsecurity work was high, the top rank was Headquarters Section Chief.\n  Director Mueller has changed direction by creating a Assistant \nDirector position to head a new Security Division and supporting the \nprinciple of a Security Career Program. I support this change. Title II \nof the FBI Reform Act provides the statutory mandate and tools to \nachieve this goal based on the experience of the Defense Department in \nreforming its acquisition career program. The key requirements are \nleadership and accountability in a Security Director, creation of \nsecurity career program boards, designation of security positions, \nidentification of security career paths requiring appropriate training \nand experience, and development of education programs for security \nprofessionals. To help ensure that security professionals gain stature \ncomparable to Special Agents, the program would limit the preference \nfor Special Agents in considering persons for security positions. FBI \nsecurity managers would complete a security management course \naccredited by the Joint Security Training Consortium recently formed by \nthe Intelligence Community and the Department of Defense.\n  The FBI Counterintelligence Polygraph Program that would be \nestablished under Title III of the Act also addresses the security \nissue. Title III recognizes the security value of polygraph screening, \nbut provides specific safeguards for those who may be subject to \nadverse action based on polygraph exams. Screening procedures must \naddress the problems of ``false positive'' responses, limit adverse \nactions taken solely by reason of physiological reactions in an \nexamination, ensure quality assurance and control, and allow subjects \nto have prompt access to unclassified reports on examinations that \nrelate to adverse actions against them. Title III is based upon the \nsimple conviction that increased security and protection of employee \nrights can and must coexist at the FBI.\n  Title IV of the Act provides long overdue statutory authorization for \na permanent FBI Police force, to protect critical FBI facilities. It \nwould provide the men and women who currently guard the highest risk \ntargets with the same pay and benefits as members of the Uniformed \nDivision of the United States Secret Service. Today the FBI police \nforce operating under delegated authority from the General Services \nAdministration has been unable to retain skilled personnel at a rate \ncommensurate with the threat and the need for experienced leadership. \nThe FBI Reform Act would bring the FBI police force generally into line \nnot only with the Uniformed Division of the Secret Service, but also \nwith the Capitol Police and the Supreme Court police. It is intended to \nbe consistent with the current Memorandum of Agreement between the FBI \nand the Metropolitan Police Force of the District of Columbia with \nrespect to FBI buildings and grounds covered in Washington, D.C..\n  The Attorney General has directed Deputy Attorney General Thompson to \nlead a management review of the FBI, while Director Mueller has already \nbegun reorganizing the Bureau. Congress must participate in reviewing \nthe FBI's structure and identifying its future priorities. The FBI is \nbeing called on today to protect the national security from terrorist \nand intelligence threats mounted from abroad. FBI investigations now \nextend overseas far more often because of our government's decision to \nuse law enforcement as an instrument of national security along with \ndiplomacy, military deployments, and intelligence operations. At the \nsame time, it must continue with other uniquely Federal areas of \nenforcement. Title VI requires a set of reports that would enable \nCongress to engage the Executive branch in a constructive dialogue \nbuilding a more effective FBI for the future.\n  To help Congress participate in charting the FBI's course, Title VI \ndirects the Attorney General to submit a comprehensive report on the \nlegal authorities for FBI programs and activities. In the late 1970s \nthe Judiciary Committee considered enactment of a legislative charter \nfor the FBI that would spell out its authorities and responsibilities. \nThat proposal was set aside in 1980 despite determined efforts by then-\nJudiciary Committee Chairman Kennedy, Judge Webster and Attorney \nGeneral Civiletti to reach agreement. The time is ripe to revive \nconsideration of this effort.\n  In addition to a comprehensive charter, Congress should consider \nwhether the FBI should continue to have responsibility for the broad \nrange of investigations that it is currently expected to conduct. I \nbelieve we have gone too far in federalizing criminal law enforcement \nand that more responsibilities which are not uniquely federal can be \ntransferred back to the states. In addition, even within the Federal \nlaw enforcement family, numerous agencies perform redundant functions. \nThe Attorney General's report would recommend whether the FBI should \ncontinue to have all its current investigative responsibilities, \nwhether existing legal authority for any FBI program or activity should \nbe modified or repealed, and whether the FBI must or should have \nexpress statutory authority for new or existing programs or activities.\n  Title VI also recognizes that the task of modernizing FBI's \ninformation technology and management is as important as setting the \nFBI's future missions. Judiciary Committee oversight hearings have \ndocumented, and Director Mueller has acknowledged, that the FBI must \novercome years of neglect in this regard. Congress is providing the \nfunds, especially in the FY 2002 Counterterrorim Supplemental for \ntechnology assistance. We must ensure, however, that the FBI can and \ndoes use these funds effectively. There is concern that the FBI may \nneed greater flexibility than is allowed under current law to procure \nnew technologies. Congress also needs to see detailed plans as to how \nthe FBI plans to update its information technology systems. \nUnfortunately, the Department of Justice and the FBI have not provided \nquarterly status reports on the principal FBI computer upgrade program, \nknown as TRILOGY, as requested in the Appropriations act for FY 2001. \nTitle VI directs the Attorney General to address these concerns in a \ncomprehensive report on FBI information management and technology.\n\n[[Page S1355]]\n\n  Finally, Title VI requires the Comptroller General to investigate and \ncomplete a report on how statistics are reported and used by Federal \nlaw enforcement agencies, including the FBI. Senator Grassley has \nfocused attention on the question whether the FBI and other agencies \nmay be double-counting criminal investigations and arrests in the \nreporting of accomplishments. We also need to ascertain whether the FBI \nand other agencies properly use the statistics which they compile in \nmaking management decisions. It is important to get the facts and \nrecommendations that put the FBI into the context of the full spectrum \nof Federal law enforcement agencies. Title VI ensures that the GAO can \ncomplete this important task by requiring agencies to comply with its \nrequests for the information that is necessary to assist in preparing \nthis report.\n  The legislation which Senator Grassley and I introduce today is just \none part of a bipartisan, hands-on approach to FBI reform. The \ncommittee plans additional oversight hearings to consider the Justice \nDepartment Inspector General's report on the belated production of \ndocuments in the Oklahoma City bombing case and the report of Judge \nWebster's Commission on the security lessons of the Robert Hanssen \nespionage case. The committee also intends to hear from Director \nMueller and Deputy Attorney General Thompson on their response to these \nreports and on their actions and goals in reorganizing the FBI and \ncharting its management course for the future.\n  At the same time, we are focusing oversight attention on key aspects \nof FBI and law enforcement performance in connection with the September \n11 terrorist attacks and the lessons learned for developing an \neffective counterterrorism and homeland security program. As \ncontemplated by the sunset provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act, we must \nmonitor the implementation of new surveillance and investigative powers \nprovided to strengthen counterterrorism efforts and, in some \nprovisions, law enforcement and counterintelligence generally.\n  The FBI Reform Act is designed to strengthen the FBI as an \ninstitution that has a unique role as both a law enforcement agency and \na member of the intelligence community. As the Judiciary Committee \ncontinues its oversight work and more is learned about recent FBI \nperformance, additional legislation may prove necessary. Especially \nimportant will be the lessons from the attacks of September 11, 2001, \nthe anthrax attacks, and implementation of the USA PATRIOT Act and \nother counterterrorism measures. Strengthening the FBI cannot be \naccomplished overnight, but today, with the introduction of FBI Reform \nAct, we take an important step into the future.\n  For all of these reasons, I am pleased to introduce this legislation \nwith Senator Grassley. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record along with the sectional analysis.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1974\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

GAO REPORT ON CRIME STATISTICS REPORTING.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 9 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United \n     States shall submit to the Committees on the Judiciary of the \n     Senate and the House of Representatives a report on the issue \n     of how statistics are reported and used by Federal law \n     enforcement agencies.\n       (b) Contents.--The report submitted under subsection (a) \n     shall--\n       (1) identify the current regulations, procedures, internal \n     policies, or other conditions that allow the investigation or \n     arrest of an individual to be claimed or reported by more \n     than 1 Federal or State agency charged with law enforcement \n     responsibility;\n       (2) identify and examine the conditions that allow the \n     investigation or arrest of an individual to be claimed or \n     reported by the Offices of Inspectors General and any other \n     Federal agency charged with law enforcement responsibility;\n       (3) examine the statistics reported by Federal law \n     enforcement agencies, and document those instances in which \n     more than 1 agency, bureau, or office claimed or reported the \n     same investigation or arrest during the years 1998 through \n     2001;\n       (4) examine the issue of Federal agencies simultaneously \n     claiming arrest credit for in-custody situations that have \n     already occurred pursuant to a State or local agency arrest \n     situation during the years 1998 through 2001;\n       (5) examine the issue of how such statistics are used for \n     administrative and management purposes;\n       (6) set forth a comprehensive definition of the terms \n     ``investigation'' and ``arrest'' as those terms apply to \n     Federal agencies charged with law enforcement \n     responsibilities; and\n       (7) include recommendations, that when implemented, would \n     eliminate unwarranted and duplicative reporting of \n     investigation and arrest statistics by all Federal agencies \n     charged with law enforcement responsibilities.\n       (c) Federal Agency Compliance.--Federal law enforcement \n     agencies shall comply with requests made by the General \n     Accounting Office for information that is necessary to assist \n     in preparing the report required by this section.\n\n                  TITLE VII--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n\n     SEC. 701. ALLOWING DISCIPLINARY SUSPENSIONS OF MEMBERS OF THE \n                   SENIOR EXECUTIVE SERVICE FOR 14 DAYS OR LESS.\n\n       Section 7542 of title 5, United States Code, is amended by \n     striking ``for more than 14 days''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  S. 1974--Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n\n                                title i\n\n       Title I of this bill provides for improved Department of \n     Justice and Congressional oversight of the FBI by ensuring \n     that the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector \n     General, ``OIG'', is authorized to investigate allegations of \n     misconduct at the FBI and requiring a report to the Judiciary \n     Committees on how the OIG carries out this new authority. \n     This title is consistent with provisions in the DOJ \n     Authorization Act, S. 1319/H.R. 2215, which have passed the \n     Senate by unanimous consent.\n     Section 101. Authority of Department of Justice Inspector \n         General\n       This section would amend Section 8E of the Inspector \n     General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.) to provide explicit \n     statutory authority for the OIG to investigate all \n     allegations of criminal or administrative misconduct by DOJ \n     employees, including FBI personnel. The OIG is also \n     authorized to refer certain matters to the FBI Office of \n     Professional Responsibility or to the internal affairs office \n     of the appropriate component of the Department. The Attorney \n     General is directed to promulgate regulations implementing \n     this OIG authority.\n       For many years, the FBI was excluded from OIG jurisdiction \n     and the FBI's own internal Office of Professional \n     Responsibility had sole authority to investigate FBI \n     personnel misconduct, unless the Attorney General made an \n     exception. The FBI's exclusive domain to investigate its own \n     misconduct was unique in the Department and created the \n     appearance of a conflict of interest. On July 11, 2001, \n     Attorney General Ashcroft issued a new rule expanding the \n     OIG's jurisdiction over the FBI. This section is consistent \n     with, and codifies, the Attorney General's new rule.\n     Section 102. Review of the Department of Justice\n       To ensure that the OIG has the necessary structure and \n     resources to effectively assume its new jurisdiction over the \n     FBI and that the Congress is fully informed of such needs, \n     this subsection requires the Inspector General to: 1. appoint \n     an official to help supervise and coordinate oversight \n     operations and programs of the FBI during the transition \n     period; 2. conduct a comprehensive study of the FBI and \n     report back to the Judiciary Committees with a plan for \n     auditing and evaluating various parts of FBI, including \n     information technology, and for effective continued OIG \n     oversight; and 3. report back to the Judiciary Committee on \n     whether an Inspector General for the FBI should be \n     established.\n\n\n                                title ii\n\n       This title of the bill amends Title 5, U.S.C. Sec. 2303, to \n     enhance the whistle blower protection provided to FBI \n     employees and protect them from retaliation.\n     Section 201. Providing whistle blower protection for FBI \n         employees\n       Section 2303 of title 5, United States Code, is amended to \n     expand the types of disclosures that trigger whistle blower \n     protections by protecting disclosures, which the employee \n     ``reasonably believes'' evidences misconduct, to the OIG, the \n     Congress, a supervisor of the employee, or the Special \n     Counsel (an office of the Merit Systems Protection Board, \n     ``MSPB'', provided for by 5 U.S.C. Sec. 1214). The amendment \n     would also ensure that the procedural protections of the \n     Administrative Procedure Act, including but not limited to 5 \n     U.S.C. sections 554-57 and 701-706, would be followed in \n     cases where a complaint of retaliation was made by an FBI \n     employee. These procedural protections include, among other \n     things, an impartial decision maker and decision based on the \n     ``record'' of any proceedings without ex parte contacts and \n     judicial review as provided. Current laws and regulations \n     which allow for the protection of classified material would \n     also be available for such proceedings in appropriate \n     situations. The amendment, in new subsection (c), provides an \n     individual right of action as provided under Chapter 12 of \n     Title 5 before the MSPB. The amendment, in new subsection \n     (d), requires the Attorney General to prescribe regulations \n     to ensure that the title is enforced at the FBI.\n\n\n                               title iii\n\n       Title III requires the FBI to establish a career security \n     program to enhance the internal security of the FBI and \n     ensure that appropriate management tools and resources are \n     devoted to that task. Security professional career \n     development requirements would be modeled generally on the \n     statutory Department of Defense Acquisition Career Program.\n     Sections 301-305. Establishing and defining career security \n         program\n       Section 301 requires the Attorney General to establish \n     policies and procedures for career management of FBI security \n     personnel. Section 302 authorizes the Attorney General to \n     delegate to the FBI Director the Attorney General's duties \n     with respect to the FBI security workforce. Section 303 \n     directs the FBI Director to appoint a Security Director, who, \n     under Section 304, would chair a security career program \n     board to advise in managing hiring, training, education, and \n     career development. Section 305 directs the FBI Director to \n     designate certain positions as security positions, with \n     responsibility for personnel security and access control, \n     information systems security, information assurance, physical \n     security, technical surveillance countermeasures, \n     operational, program and industrial security, and information \n     security and classification management.\n     Sections 306-309. Career development and training\n       Section 306 requires that career paths to senior positions \n     would be published. FBI Special Agents would not have \n     preference for a security position, and no positions would be \n     restricted to Special Agents unless the Attorney General \n     makes a special determination. All FBI personnel would have \n     the opportunity to acquire the education, training and \n     experience needed for senior security positions. The Attorney \n     General would ensure that policies are designed to select the \n     best qualified individuals, consistent with other applicable \n     law. Consideration would also be given to the need for a \n     balanced workforce.\n       Section 307 would direct that education, training, and \n     experience requirements would be established for each \n     position. Before assignment as manager or deputy manager of a\n\n[[Page S1359]]\n\n     significant security program, a person would have to complete \n     a security program management course accredited by the Joint \n     DoD-Intelligence Security Training Consortium or determined \n     to be comparable by the Director, and have 6 years security \n     experience including 2 years in a similar program. Section \n     308 directs the Director, in consultation with the DCI and \n     Secretary of Defense, to establish education and training \n     programs for FBI security personnel that are, to the maximum \n     extent practical, uniform with Intelligence and DoD programs. \n     Section 309 sets forth the process for approval of \n     requirements set forth under section 307.\n\n\n                                title iv\n\n       This title would require the Attorney General to establish \n     an FBI Counterintelligence Polygraph Program for personnel in \n     exceptionally sensitive positions that reflects the results \n     of a pending National Academy of Sciences review of the \n     validity of the polygraph, within 6 months after publication \n     of that review. The regulations would be prescribed in \n     accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act. A similar \n     requirement for the Department of Energy was passed in the \n     latest Defense Authorization Act.\n     Sections 401-404. Definitions, establishment of program, \n         regulations, report\n       Section 402 requires the establishment of a \n     counterintelligence screening polygraph program consisting of \n     periodic polygraph examinations of employees and contractors \n     with access to sensitive compartmented information, special \n     access program information, on restricted data. This program \n     shall be established within 6 months of the publication of \n     the results of the report of the Committee to Review the \n     Scientific Evidence on the Polygraph of the National Academy \n     of Sciences. Section 403 directs that the program have \n     procedures that address ``false positive'' results and ensure \n     quality assurance and control in accordance with guidance \n     from the DoD Polygraph Institute and the DCI. No adverse \n     personnel action could be taken solely by reason of \n     physiological reactions on an exam without further \n     investigation and personal decision by the Director. \n     Employees could have prompt access to unclassified reports on \n     their exams that relate to adverse personnel action. Section \n     404 requires a report within 9 months of the enactment of the \n     Act on any further legislative action appropriate in the \n     personnel security area.\n\n\n                                title v\n\n       This title provides statutory authorization for an already \n     existing FBI police force that protects FBI buildings and \n     adjacent streets. Currently, the FBI police suffers from a \n     high rate of turnover due to lower pay and fewer benefits \n     than the Uniformed Division of Secret Service or Capitol and \n     Supreme Court police. This title would close the disparity.\n     Sections 501-503. Definitions; establishment; authority of \n         metropolitan police\n       Section 501 defines the terms ``Director,'' ``FBI buildings \n     and grounds,'' and ``FBI police'' as used in the title. \n     Section 502 authorizes the FBI Director to establish the FBI \n     police, subject to the Attorney General's supervision, to \n     protect persons and property within FBI buildings and \n     grounds, including adjacent streets and sidewalks within 500 \n     feet. FBI buildings and grounds would include any building \n     occupied by the FBI and subject to FBI supervision and \n     control, the land on which such building is situated, and \n     enclosed passageways connecting such buildings. FBI police \n     would be uniformed representatives of the FBI with authority \n     to make arrests and otherwise enforce federal and D.C. laws, \n     carry firearms, prevent breaches of the peace, suppress \n     unlawful affrays and unlawful assemblies, and hold the same \n     powers as sheriffs and constables. FBI police would not have \n     authority to serve civil process. Pay and benefits would be \n     equivalent to pay and benefits for the Secret Service \n     Uniformed Division. Section 503 provides that the authority \n     of the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police would not be \n     affected by this title.\n\n\n                                title vi\n\n       This title requires two separate reports by the Attorney \n     General and one by the General Accounting Office.\n     Section 601. FBI authority and mission\n       Section 601 requires the Attorney General to submit a \n     report to Congress on the legal authority for FBI programs \n     and activities, identifying those that have express statutory \n     authority and those that do not. The FBI does not have a \n     statutory charter. One was proposed in 1979 but never \n     enacted. Many FBI functions including its national \n     intelligence and counterintelligence activities are \n     authorized by Executive order rather than by statute. This \n     section also requires the Attorney General to recommend the \n     criminal statutes for which the FBI should have investigative \n     responsibility, whether the authority for any FBI program or \n     activity should be modified or repealed, whether the FBI \n     should have express statutory authority for any program or \n     activity for which it does not currently have such authority, \n     and whether the FBI should have authority for any new program \n     or activity.\n     Section 602. FBI information management\n       Section 602 requires the Attorney General to submit a \n     report on FBI information management and technology, \n     including whether the authority is needed to waive normal \n     procurement regulations. The report would provide the results \n     of pending Justice Management Council studies and Inspector \n     General audits and submitting a 10-point plan for improving \n     FBI information management and technology to ensure that 1. \n     appropriate FBI technology management positions are filled by \n     personnel with commercial sector experience, 2. access to the \n     most sensitive information is audited so that suspicious \n     activity is subject to near contemporaneous review, 3. \n     critical information systems employ a public key \n     infrastructure, 4. security features are tested by the \n     National Security Agency, 5. FBI employees receive annual \n     instruction in records and information management, 6. a \n     research and development reserve is established, 7. undue \n     requirements for less costly software purchases are \n     eliminated, 8. contracting with an expert technology partner \n     is considered, 9. procedures are instituted to procure \n     through contracts of other agencies as necessary, and 10. \n     system upgrades are tested before operational deployment.\n     Section 603. GAO report on crime statistics reporting\n       Section 603 requires the General Accounting Office to \n     report on how crime statistics are reported and used by \n     Federal law enforcement agencies. Specifically, the report \n     would identify policies that allow a case to be claimed or \n     reported by more than one law enforcement agency, the \n     conditions that allow such reporting to occur, the number of \n     such cases reported during a 4-year period, similar multiple \n     claims of credit for arrests, the use of such statistics for \n     administrative and management purposes, and relevant \n     definitions. The report would include recommendations for how \n     to eliminate unwarranted and duplicative reporting. Federal \n     law enforcement agencies would be required to comply with GAO \n     requests for information necessary to prepare the report.\n\n\n                               title vii\n\n       This title would address the issue of the ``double \n     standard'' in the FBI, to prevent lower level employees from \n     being more harshly disciplined than senior FBI officials. \n     Section 7542 of title 5, United States Code, would be amended \n     to allow disciplinary suspensions of SES members for 14 days \n     or less, as is the case for other federal personnel. Current \n     law provides only for suspension ``for more than 14 days.''\n     Section 702. Allowing disciplinary suspensions of members of \n         the senior executive service for 14 days or less\n       This section would lift the minimum of 14 days suspension \n     that applies in the FBI's SES disciplinary cases and thereby \n     provide additional options for discipline in SES cases and \n     encourage equality of treatment. The current inflexibility of \n     disciplinary options applicable to SES officials was cited at \n     a Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing in July, 2001, \n     as one underlying reason for the ``double standard'' in FBI \n     discipline. In effect, those deciding the discipline of SES \n     employees are often left with the choice of an overly harsh \n     penalty or no penalty at all--so they decide not to impose \n     any meaningful disciplinary action.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I am pleased to introduce with Senator \nLeahy a bill to reform the FBI. For almost a decade I have been engaged \nin FBI oversight and during that time I have seen numerous scandals and \ncoverups. While Director Mueller is working to address these problems, \nCongress also has a role to play in the overhaul of the FBI. The FBI \nreform bill is designed to address the accountability problems that \nhave plagued the FBI for years. The bill expands the Department of \nJustice Inspector General's jurisdiction, protects FBI whistleblowers, \ncreates an FBI Security Career program and a Counterintelligence \nPolygraph program, enhances the FBI police force, and mandates various \nreports by the Attorney General.\n  I have advocated some of these measures, particularly those dealing \nwith protecting whistleblowers and expanding the jurisdiction of the \nDOJ Inspector General's Office to include the FBI. Let me provide some \nmore detail about the most important provisions in the bill.\n  In the past the FBI's own internal Office of Professional \nResponsibility was tasked with the sole authority to investigate the \nmisconduct of FBI personnel. Clearly this constitutes a conflict of \ninterest. In fact, no other area of the Department of Justice maintains \nthis type of accountability system.\n  Last summer, Attorney General Ashcroft issued an order which changed \nthat situation by expanding the jurisdiction of the Department of \nJustice Office of Inspector General to encompass both the FBI and the \nDEA. Specifically, the order gave the DOJ Inspector General primary \njurisdiction over allegations of misconduct against employees of the \nFBI and DEA. Previously, the Inspector General could not initiate an \ninvestigation within the FBI or the DEA, without receiving permission \nfrom the Deputy Attorney General. I commended Attorney General \nAshcroft's order because I had been saying for many years that the FBI \nshould not be allowed to police\n\n[[Page S1360]]\n\nitself. I was encouraged that the establishment of a free and \nindependent oversight entity would have a beneficial impact on the \nFBI's management culture.\n  The bill codifies the Attorney General's order making it a permanent \nfixture in the plan to reform the FBI. Specifically, the bill provides \nstatutory authority for the DOJ Office of Inspector General to \ninvestigate all allegations of criminal and administrative misconduct \nby DOJ employees, including those in the FBI and the DEA. However, it \ndoes not abolish the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility, OPR, \nbut rather gives the DOJ Inspector General discretion to refer certain \ninvestigations to the FBI OPR. Because the FBI OPR is particularly good \nat investigating certain types of low level offenses, it is good that \nthe Inspector General will have this discretion.\n  The bill also contains much needed protections for \nFBI whistleblowers. As many of you know, I believe that good government \nrequires that the brave men and women who blow the whistle on \nwrongdoing be protected. I have been an active champion of the rights \nof federal whistleblowers since 1983. This is because of my strong \nbelief that disclosures of wrongdoing by whistleblowers are an integral \npart of our system of checks and balances. Whistleblowers ensure that \nwaste, fraud, and abuse are brought to light. Whistleblowers play a \ncritical role in ensuring that public health and safety problems are \nexposed.\n\n  I truly believe that reform at the FBI will only occur when FBI \nemployees feel free to blow the whistle on wrongdoing. Since the FBI \nwas excluded from the Whistleblower Protection Act I have been \nconcerned about the retaliation that is often perpetrated against \nwhistleblowers at the FBI, such as Dr. Fred Whitehurst, who speak out \nabout abuses and problems with the system.\n  So, the bill gives FBI whistleblowers the same rights and protections \nthat other Federal employees currently possess. When FBI employees are \nretaliated against for blowing the whistle, they can avail themselves \nof all the protections afforded them by the Whistleblower Protection \nAct.\n  Since the FBI has made the fight against terrorism its top priority, \nmany would be FBI whistleblowers may blow the whistle on wrongdoing \nthat involves national security issues. Because of the need to keep \nthat information secure, the bill directs the Attorney General to \nformulate regulations to provide specific protections for these \nemployees consistent with the relevant portions of the WPA and the \nAdministrative Procedures Act.\n  Our FBI reform bill addresses several other issues that contribute to \nthe FBI's culture of arrogance. I have believed for a long time that \none of the biggest contributors to this culture is the cumbersome and \nunwieldy jurisdiction of the FBI. The Bureau currently investigates \nover 300 different federal offenses, which are divided between violent \ncrime, white collar crime, organized crime, drugs, national security, \nand civil rights. Contained within these areas are numerous instances \nof concurrent or overlapping jurisdiction with other Federal law \nenforcement agencies.\n\n  Despite having what many would describe as an already overburdened \narray of jurisdiction, the FBI has established a campaign of \njurisdictional encroachment. This ``Pacman'' philosophy of the Bureau's \npast has only served to feed the culture of arrogance. I pointed this \nproblem out to the DOJ and was pleased to hear of the Attorney General \nand the FBI Director's intention to put a stop to that ``Pacman'' \nmentality and limit the FBI's investigatory scope.\n  But, this will be a complex issue. Just as Congress has been \ncomplicit in the FBI's expansion, we will need to be involved in the \ndivestiture. The Department of Justice's Strategic Plan states that the \nFBI will focus on building and maintaining its utmost capacity to \ndetect, deter, counter, and prevent terrorist activity. The plan also \nencourages the FBI to promote and, when available, use new legislation \nand authorities to conduct investigations of terrorist incidents.\n  It is ironic that in light of this, the FBI continues to view many \nviolations that it has traditionally investigated as being of strategic \nimportance. Why are environmental crimes, health care fraud, bank \nrobbery, telemarketing and financial institution fraud, computer \nintrusions, intellectual property crimes, and credit card fraud still \nviewed by the FBI as of strategic importance? I understand that \nterrorism investigations could potentially involve any one, or a \nnumber, of the above violations, but there are many other Federal \nregulatory and investigative agencies that have established historic \nexpertise in these same program areas.\n  In its reorganization, the FBI needs to scale back on some of its law \nenforcement activities which are duplicated by other Federal and state \nagencies. The Bureau needs to completely jettison some of these areas, \nbut in other areas the Bureau could simply take a secondary role, \nallowing another agency to take the lead. It is my hope that by scaling \nback on certain FBI investigative activities, the FBI will send a \npositive signal in dealing with its counterparts in state, local, and \nfederal government.\n  To assist in cutting back on the FBI's jurisdiction, the bill directs \nthe Attorney General to report to Congress on the legal authority for \nFBI programs and activities, identifying those that have express \nstatutory authority and those that don't. The bill also requires the \nAttorney General to recommend what criminal statutes he believes the \nFBI should have investigative responsibility for. This report will help \nCongress, as we continue to address the FBI's culture of arrogance.\n  Another issue that contributes to the FBI's culture of arrogance is \nthe collection, use, and reporting of crime statistics. It is often the \ncase in Federal law enforcement that several agencies will claim credit \nfor a single arrest. This double and triple counting of arrests leads \nto an inflation of statistics that often misrepresents the actual work \nload of the various agencies. This is a problem because these \nstatistics are used by federal law enforcement agencies, including the \nFBI, to justify increases in their funding.\n\n  To get a handle on the exact nature and extent of this problem, our \nbill directs the GAO to conduct a review of how crime and investigation \nstatistics are reported and used by Federal law enforcement agencies. \nThis report will assist us in future legislation on this issue.\n  There are many more reforms contained in our FBI reform bill, but \nthere is just one more that I want to focus on today. This reform is a \nchange in the way employees of the Senior Executive Service are \npunished.\n  Last summer, four exceptional and courageous FBI agents alerted the \nJudiciary Committee to the fact that there exists a gross inequality in \nthe way Senior Executive Service (SES) employees of the FBI and rank \nand file agents are disciplined. SES employees are given a slap on the \nwrist for their infractions, while the rank and file agents are often \npunished to the letter of the law. This issue was further exposed by a \nGAO report on the investigation of the Larry Potts Retirement Dinner \nscandal. That report reemphasized what had been reveled in the FBI Law \nEnforcement Ethics Unit's position paper, ``FBI SES Accountability, a \nHigher Standard or a Double Standard.'' These two reports document the \nexistence of a double standard.\n  I was glad to see that former Director Freeh abolished the SES Review \nBoard, but I'm not sure it was a sufficient change for a culture that \nhas historically treated SES employees with kid gloves.\n  So our FBI Reform bill attempts to address this problem by providing \nsome flexibility in how SES employees can be punished. The Senate \nJudiciary Committee has heard repeatedly that this inflexibility is one \nof the main causes for the inequality in punishment at the FBI. \nCurrently, the minimum suspension that SES employees can receive is 14 \ndays, to the Bureau's management is often left with the choice of an \noverly harsh penalty or no penalty at all--so often they decide not to \nimpose any meaningful disciplinary action.\n  Specifically, our bill would lift the 14-day minimum suspension for \nSES disciplinary cases to provide for additional options in \ndisciplining senior executive employees. Hopefully, this change will \nhelp to remedy this double standard.\n\n[[Page S1361]]\n\n  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to support this bill to foster \nreform in the FBI. The Bureau is crucial in the war on terrorism. Let's \nfix the problems we have helped to create, so that the FBI can again be \nhe best at what it does.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Daschle, \n        Mr. Jeffords, Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Hutchison, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. \n        Snowe, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Collins, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Chafee, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mrs. Lincoln, Ms. Stabenow, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. \n        Carnahan, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, \n        Mr. Johnson, Mr. Reed, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        Reid, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Graham, and Mr. \n        Dodd):\n  S. 1976. A bill to provide for a comprehensive Federal effort \nrelating to treatments for, and the prevention of cancer, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the \nNational Cancer Act of 2002. This bill is co-sponsored by Senators \nGordon Smith, Daschle, Jeffords, Clinton, Hutchison, Mikulski, Snowe, \nBoxer, Collins, Landrieu, Chafee, Murray, Lincoln, Stabenow, Cantwell, \nCarnahan, Schumer, Torricelli, Ben Nelson, Johnson, Reed, Breaux, \nCorzine, Leahy, Reid, Kerry, and Bill Nelson.\n  Today, cancer is the Nation's second cause of death, trailing heart \ndisease. Over the next 30 years, cancer will surpass heart disease and \nbecome the leading cause of death as the baby boomers age.\n  This bill represents a comprehensive national battle plan to \nreenergize the Nation's war on cancer, a war begun when President \nRichard Nixon on January 22, 1971 proposed to Congress that we launch a \nwar on cancer.\n  That commitment was a critical first step. But it is clear that we \nmust take further steps to address the scourge of cancer in every \nrespect.\n  The bill we are introducing today is the product of more than 3 years \nand hundreds of hours of work.\n  I am the vice-chair of the National Dialogue on Cancer. In \ndiscussions with cancer experts from this group, it became clear to me \nthat the National Cancer Act of 1971 was out of date.\n  We are now in the genomic era, on the cusp of discoveries and cures \nthat we could only have dreamed about in 1971. The science of cancer \nhas advanced dramatically with the revolution in molecular and cellular \nbiology creating unprecedented opportunities for understanding how \ngenetics, environmental risk factors, and lifestyle factors relate to \ncancer. The explosion in knowledge about the human genome and molecular \nbiology will enable scientists to better target cancer drugs.\n  I believe the opportunity for new drugs is so bright, we might well \nfind a cure for cancer in my lifetime.\n  With these advances, I thought it was time to update the National \nCancer Act of 1971 to reflect these advances in science.\n  I asked John Seffrin, CEO of the American Cancer Society, and Dr. \nVincent DeVita, Director of the Yale Cancer Center, to form a special \ncommittee of cancer experts to provide recommendations on a battle plan \nto conquer cancer.\n  The committee produced an ambitious plan and what I tried to do was \ntake the most important components, given the current budget situation, \nand develop a piece of legislation that could pass the Senate.\n  On November 7, 2001, President George Bush commended the work of the \ncommittee when he wrote, ``The journey ahead will not be easy. But 30 \nyears ago, no one would have imagined coming as far as we have. Working \ntogether, we will take the next steps necessary to defeat this deadly \ndisease.'' I invite him today to join me in taking these steps.\n  Finding a cure for cancer is a very personal goal. I lost both my \nfather, Leon Goldman, and my husband, Bert Feinstein, to cancer. I saw \nits ravages firsthand, and I experienced the frustrations, the \ndifficulties, and the loneliness that people suffer when a loved-one \nhas cancer. I determined that I would do all I could to reduce the \nnumber of people who go through this devastating experience.\n  And it is my great hope that this legislation will help do just that, \nand enable us to find a cure for cancer in my lifetime.\n  This may in fact be the most important thing I do in the Senate.\n  There are several reasons we need a major attack on cancer. Much has \nchanged since 1971. The way we prevent, diagnose, treat, conduct \nresearch, and understand cancer has changed dramatically.\n  Cancer is a disease of aging and as the American population ages, \ncancer incidence will grow by 29 percent by 2010 and cancer deaths by \n25 percent. The number of Americans over age 65 will double in the next \n30 years.\n  Since 1971, survival rates for some cancers have improved, while \nothers have not. More and more people live with cancer. Compared to \n1971, twice as many people, 8.9 million in 1997, are living with a \nhistory of cancer.\n  Since 1971, more cancer care has moved from inpatient to outpatient \nsettings. Some families find themselves virtually becoming nurses to \ntheir loved ones in their homes.\n  Since 1971, more research is collaborative, between the public and \nprivate sectors, and more cancer research requires a multi-disciplinary \napproach.\n  Since 1971, the biotechnology industry has blossomed and provided a \nbroad array of new treatment options, promising even more innovations \nin cancer care.\n  Since 1971, computer technology and communications have expanded and \nincreased in complexity, making the accessing and transmitting of \ninformation more widespread, more readily available and transforming \nresearch methodologies.\n  While the science of cancer has seen revolutionary change, there are \nstill many gaps in the system, especially from the patient's \nperspective.\n  Just three months ago, the President's Cancer Panel in their report \ntitled, Voices of a Broken System: Real People, Real Problems, told us \nthat cancer is an ``equal opportunity'' killer, but if you are poor, \nuneducated, or isolated you are doubly disadvantaged in America. They \nsaid, ``Access to appropriate cancer care is the crucial fundamental \nstep needed to relieve the desperate physical suffering, financial \ndevastation, and loss of dignity so many people endure when cancer is \ndiagnosed.''\n  Take cancer screening, for example. Cancer screening can reduce \ncancer mortality. While many screening tools have been developed, \nscreening rates are still low, especially for colorectal cancer. \nScreening technologies have improved, but cancer screening rates vary \nby cancer site, by population group, and by health insurance coverage.\n  Another ``hole'' in the system: Fewer than 5 percent of adult cancer \npatients participate in cancer trials. Among the elderly, the \npopulation most likely to get cancer, only 3-4 percent participate. \nDrugs cannot be brought to patients without clinical trials.\n  The quality of cancer care is uneven and often based on the pure \ncoincidence of where one lives. According to the President's Cancer \nPanel, ``People living in rural, frontier, geographically isolated and \nimpoverished inner city areas suffer the most from the uneven \ndistribution of cancer care resources and providers. . . .'' Many \nstudies show that many cancer patients do not receive optimal care.\n  Additionally, the cancer care workforce will face severe shortages, \nparticularly in long-term care settings.\n  The pipeline of medical researchers is threatened with, the number of \nyoung physicians entering medical research declining.\n  Over 44 million Americans have no health care insurance and those \nthat do have uneven coverage. The President's Cancer Panel says that at \nleast 31 million Americans have inadequate coverage.\n  The National Cancer Act of 2002 takes a multi-pronged approach to \nwinning the war against cancer. Here's what the bill will do:\n  The advances in science that I spoke of earlier on the human genome \nand molecular biology have thus far produced medications that can \ntarget cancer cells and leave in tack healthy cells.\n  This legislation would enable the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to \nfund\n\n[[Page S1362]]\n\nup to 40 percent of grants over 5 years, up from the current level of \n28 percent. Why is this important? The research is what will bring the \ncure.\n  NCI now funds 4,500 research project grants at nearly 600 \ninstitutions every year. This represents 28 percent of the 16,000 grant \nproposals NCI receives. NCI scientists think funding 40 percent will \nallow them to fund the most promising grants. At 28 percent, it does \nnot happen.\n  Funding basic research is a full frontal assault on cancer, which \nwill lead to more breakthroughs, more treatments, and ultimately, I \nbelieve, to a cure.\n  We now have drugs, like Gleevec for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia and \nHerceptin for breast cancer, that can target and destroy cancer cells \nwhile leaving healthy cells unharmed.\n  Patients, who were considered terminal, have taken Gleevec and were \nable to get out of their beds and leave the hospice within days of \ntreatment. After one-year of clinical trials for Gleevec, 51 out of 54 \npatients were still doing well. With 4,500 Americans diagnosed with \nChronic Myeloid Leukemia a year, the potential for this drug is \ntremendous.\n  And just this month, Gleevec was approved by the FDA to treat another \ncancer Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors, suggesting that the potential \nfor this drug may be even greater than we hope.\n\n  The bill authorizes funds for new and existing research centers to \nconduct translational, multidisciplinary cancer research, and to \nestablish networks linking translational research centers to community \ncancer providers, hospitals, clinics, doctors' practices, particularly \nin underserved areas.\n  The purpose of this provision is to greatly accelerate the movement \nof basic research to the patient, from the ``bench to the bedside,'' so \nthat we can conduct more clinical trials.\n  Clinical trials test the safety and efficacy of drugs, devices or new \nmedical techniques. They are required for FDA approval. These trials \nrequire thousands of participating people to help determine if drugs \nare safe and effective.\n  But clinical trials are expensive. They involve many people, who \noften have to travel to a cancer center; they involve staff time and \ncareful monitoring and recordkeeping. The drug industry says it costs \non average $500 million to develop a drug; a November 2001 Tufts \nUniversity study puts the cost at $800 million. Whatever it is, it is \nexpensive.\n  The bill includes several steps to expand clinical trials, those \nresearch projects that require thousands of people to determine whether \nnew drugs are safe and effective.\n  First, the bill will provide $100 million per year for new grants for \nwhat is called ``translational'' research, work that moves promising \ndrugs from the ``bench to the bedside.''\n  Right now, there are many new drugs under development that are stuck, \nas though in a funnel, because we have not put the resources into \nhaving the people-based research to test those drugs. There are \napproximately 400 new drugs that are held up in the development process \nbecause the resources are not available to fund clinical research to \ntest those drugs.\n  For every one drug approved, 5,000 to 10,000 were initially \nconsidered. The entire process can take as long as 15 years. NCLAC said \nit takes 12 to 14 years to bring one drug from discovery to patients.\n  Second, the bill will require insurers to pay the routine or non-\nresearch costs for people to participate in clinical trials, while the \ndrug sponsor would continue to pay the research costs. California \nalready requires this coverage by private insurers.\n  Third, the bill requires the National Cancer Institute to establish a \nprogram to recruit patients and doctors to participate in clinical \ntrials. Dr. Robert Comis, President of the Coalition of National Cancer \nCooperative Groups, has said that eight out of ten cancer patients do \nnot consider participating in a clinical trial. They are unaware that \nthey might have the option. He also has found that physician \ninvolvement is key.\n  We must work all we can to make both physicians and patients more \naware of the importance of participating.\n  Currently, only 4 to 5 percent of adult cancer patients participate \nin clinical cancer trials. But Research America polls found that 61 \npercent of Americans would participate in a clinical trial.\n  We should heed the example of what is called the ``pediatric model.'' \nOver 60 percent of children with cancer participate in clinical trials. \nChildren in these trials get optimal care, with an overall physician \nmanager or ``quarterback.'' The five-year survival rates for children \nwith cancer have increased significantly.\n  In the 1960s, childhood leukemia could not be cured. It was a death \nsentence. Today, 70 percent of children with acute lymphoblastic \nleukemia enter remission. This is but one example of the power and \nimportance of clinical trials. An investigational treatment yesterday \nis standard treatment today.\n  Only by injecting new funding into cancer research will we enable \ncancer researchers to conduct the trials that are necessary to bring \npromising new drugs to market.\n  Scientists say we will stop defining cancer by body part, like breast \ncancer or prostate cancer. Because everyday we are understanding better \nthe genetic basis of cancer and can focus drugs on molecular targets, \nwe may have, for example, 50 different kinds of breast cancer, defined \nby their genetic basis. As NCI's Dr. Rabson has said, ``As we've come \nto understand the molecular signatures of cancer cells, we can classify \ntumors according to their genetic characteristics.''\n  This means that we need to create incentives to encourage companies \nto make these targeted drugs because as we redefine cancer, we will \nhave smaller numbers of people who have that particular kind of breast \ncancer. Companies are often reluctant to make drugs for small patient \npopulations.\n  This legislation would provide tax and marketing incentives to \nencourage pharmaceutical companies to produce ``orphan drugs,'' or \ndrugs targeted to small patient populations.\n  Beginning with Gleevec and continuing into the future, drugs will \ntarget a narrow genetic or cellular mutation.\n  While this holds great promise for patients, it also means that the \nnumber of treatments will proliferate, thereby segmenting cancer \npatients into smaller and smaller populations. In some cases, this will \nmean that pharmaceutical companies--for strictly financial reasons--may \nnot want to produce a given drug.\n  This provision would create incentives for those companies to produce \nand market the drugs targeted to patient populations of less than \n200,000.\n  The impact: This will help to ensure that patients receive the \nhighest quality care, even when the number of people faced with a \nparticular type of cancer is small.\n  The bill will create a new initiative to train more cancer \nresearchers. Specifically, it will (1) pay off the medical school loans \nof 100 physicians who commit to spend at least 3 years doing cancer \nresearch; and (2) boost the salaries of postdoctoral fellows from \n$28,000 to $45,000 per year over 5 years.\n  Every year, young physicians and researchers avoid the field of \ncancer research because, frankly, they feel they can make more money \nelsewhere. This provision will help reverse that trend and add \nthousands of men and women on the front lines of the fight.\n  The physician-scientist is endangered and essential, concluded a \nJanuary 1999 study, showing that the number of first-time M.D. \napplicants for NIH research projects has been declining. The study, \npublished in Science, said, ``. . . fewer young M.D.'s are interested \nin or perhaps prepared for careers as independent NIH-supported \ninvestigators.''\n  Young doctors and Ph.Ds do not want to go into cancer research \nbecause they can make more money elsewhere. Graduating physicians have \nmedical school debt averaging $75,000 to $80,000. Because of the low \npay to be a physician-scientist, these doctors cannot afford to go into \nresearch.\n  Postdoctoral fellows, who conduct the bulk of day-to-day research, \nreceive pay that is neither commensurate with their education and \nskills nor adequate. To attract the best and the brightest to the field \nof cancer research, we need to pay them more than $28,000 to start.\n\n[[Page S1363]]\n\n  The National Academy of Sciences in September 2000 called for \nincreasing their compensation.\n  All too often having cancer is a lonely and frightening experience. \nCancer patients have a team of doctors, from the primary care physician \nto the radiologist to the oncologist. Patients need one doctor to be in \ncharge.\n  The Institute of Medicine told the Senate Cancer Coalition in our \nJune 16, 1999 hearing that the care that cancer patients get is all too \noften just a matter of circumstance: ``. . . for many Americans with \ncancer, there is a wide gulf between what could be construed as the \nideal and the reality of Americans' experience with cancer care . . . \nThe ad hoc and fragmented cancer care system does not ensure access to \ncare, lacks coordination, and is inefficient in its use of resources.'' \nThe Institute of Medicine study on the uneven quality of health care \nsays, ``Health care today is characterized by more to know, more to \nmanage, more to watch, more to do, and more people involved in doing it \nthan at any time in the nation's history.''\n  The bill will require plans to pay doctors, preferably oncologists, \nto become the overall managers of patients' care, what I call a \n``quarterback physician,'' to be with the patient from diagnosis \nthrough treatment to prevent the patient from being forced to navigate \nthe medical system alone.\n  I developed this concept after meeting Dr. Judy Schmidt, a solo-\npracticing oncologist from Montana. Dr. Schmidt cares for her patients \nfrom diagnosis to treatment, and she is really a model for doctors \nacross the nation to emulate.\n  This ``quarterback physician'' would provide overall management of \nthe patient's care among all the providers. Someone would be in charge. \nThis provision could save money because good coordination can reduce \nhospitalization costs.\n  The bill also authorizes $8 million to the Agency for Health Care \nResearch and Quality to convene cancer experts, providers, patients and \nother relevant experts to coordinate the development of practice \nguidelines for optimal cancer care, prevention, palliation, symptom \nmanagement and end-of-life care.\n  People cannot get good health care if they have no way to pay for it, \nif insurance plans, public and private, do not cover the basics like \nscreenings for cancer.\n  My bill will require public plans, like Medicare and Medicaid, and \nprivate insurance plans to cover five services important to good cancer \ncare: (1) cancer screenings; (2) genetic testing and counseling for \npeople at risk; (3) smoking cessation; and (4) nutrition counseling.\n  The coverage added by this bill is important to preventing cancer. \nHere's an example: On January 31, we read reports of a promising new \nscreening test for colon cancer that can find extremely small traces of \ncancer in patients' stool, offering an entirely new approach to finding \ncolon cancer, which kills 48,000 Americans annually and is often found \ntoo late to cure.\n  Mammograms, pelvic exams, reducing fat in the diet and stopping \nsmoking--all of which could be enhanced by this bill--can stop cancer \nbefore it is too late.\n  Because too many Americans have no way to pay for their health care \nwhen cancer strikes and because seven percent of cancer patients are \nuninsured, the bill also requires the Institute of Medicine of the \nNational Academy of Sciences to conduct a study of the feasibility and \ncost of providing Medicare coverage to individuals at any age who are \ndiagnosed with cancer and have no other way to pay for their health \ncare.\n  Medicare already covers care for people of any age who have End Stage \nRenal Disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Lou Gehrig's Disease. \nThis study could provide helpful guidance to the Congress.\n  Because no assault on cancer is complete without a strong cancer \nprevention component, the bill provides funds and requires the Centers \nand Disease Control and Prevention to prepare a model state cancer \ncontrol and prevention program; expand the National Program of \nComprehensive Cancer Control plans and to assist every state to develop \na cancer prevention and control program.\n  The bill also authorizes $250 million to expand the Center for \nDisease Control and Prevention's breast and cervical cancer screening \nprogram and authorizes $50 million for CDC to begin screening programs \nfor colorectal cancer.\n  Today, 16 states now have cancer plans and 16 states are creating or \nupdating their plans. States could use these funds to promote cancer \neducation and prevention, improve registries, study disparities and \nother uses.\n  Because of the aging of the American population, we face a virtual \nexplosion of cancer in the coming 30 years. The number of cases will \ndouble. But the sad fact is that we do not have enough nurses and other \nhealth care professionals to take care of this expected rise in cancer \npatients.\n  My bill will provide $100 million for loans, grants and fellowships \nto train for the full range of cancer care providers, including nurses \nfor all settings, allied health professionals, and physicians. The bill \nrequires that these applicants have the intention to get a certificate, \ndegree, or license and demonstrate a commitment to working in cancer \ncare.\n  In nursing alone, those critical people on the front line of care, we \nface a national nursing shortage in virtually every setting, say many \nexperts, which will peak in the next 10 to 15 years unless steps are \ntaken. By 2020, the RN workforce will be 20 percent short of what is \nneeded. My home state of California ranks 50th among registered nurses \nper capita.\n  And it's not just nurses. The Health Resources Services \nAdministration says that the demand of health care professionals will \ngrow at twice the rate of other occupations.\n  Cancer is primarily a disease of aging. As the baby boomers age, \nthere will be more cancer. Cancer care is becoming more and more \ncomplex as technology improves. Skilled providers, from the nurse \nassistant to the oncologist are needed to administer the complex \ntherapies. This bill should provide some help.\n  Cancer cannot be conquered without addressing smoking and the use of \ntobacco products. Smoking causes one-third of all cancers, and is the \ncause of approximately 165,000 deaths annually.\n  Over the past two decades, we have learned that tobacco companies \nhave manipulated the level of nicotine in cigarettes to increase the \nnumber of people addicted to their product.\n  There are more than 40 chemicals in tobacco smoke that cause cancer \nin humans and animals, according to the CDC. Tobacco smoke has toxic \ncomponents, as well as tar, carbon monoxide and other dangerous \nadditives.\n  The cancer community is united in the belief that the single most \nimportant preventive measure is to place tobacco products under the \nregulatory control of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n  It is long past time to reduce the addictive nature of cigarettes and \ncurtail the marketing of these products to young people--I believe that \nempowering the FDA to regulate tobacco will help do that.\n  The U.S. Surgeon General and the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention have unequivocally demonstrated that, for example, anti-\nsmoking campaigns can reduce smoking, a major cause of cancer.\n  California is a good example: My state started an aggressive tobacco \ncontrol program in 1989 and throughout the 1990s, tobacco use dropped \nat two to three times faster than the rest of the country.\n  Ninety percent of adult smokers being before age 18 and every day, \n3,000 young people become smokers.\n  This bill will provide meaningful regulation by the Food and Drug \nAdministration of the content and marketing of tobacco products, \nespecially the addicting and carcinogenic components. Dr. C. Everett \nKoop, former U.S. Surgeon General, and Dr. David Kessler, former \nCommissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, wrote in their 1997 \nreport, cited FDA and other studies and said: ``Nicotine in cigarettes \nand smokeless tobacco has the same pharmacological effects as other \ndrugs that FDA has traditionally regulated . . . nicotine is extremely \naddictive . . . and the vast majority of people who use nicotine-\ncontaining cigarettes and smokeless tobacco do so to satisfy their \ncraving for the pharmacological effects of nicotine; that is, to \nsatisfy their drug-dependence or addiction.''\n\n[[Page S1364]]\n\n  They recommended: ``FDA should continue to have authority to regulate \nall areas of nicotine, as well as other constituents and ingredients, \nand that authority should be made completely explicit.''\n  I am pleased that to note that even the Philip Morris Companies has \nacknowledged the need for FDA to regulate tobacco. On their website, \nthey say:\n\n       We believe federal legislation that includes granting FDA \n     authority to regulate tobacco products could effectively \n     address many of the complex tobacco issues that concern the \n     public, the public health community and us.\n\n  It is long past time to reduce the addictive nature of cigarettes and \ncurtail the marketing of these products to young people. This bill \ngives FDA the power to regulate tobacco products' content, design, \nsale, and marketing.\n  The bill requires the NCI and the National Institute for \nEnvironmental Health Sciences to one or more strategic plans to \nintensify research in the following areas: quality of life for cancer \npatients and survivors; symptom management for patients and survivors; \npalliative care and pain management; health disparities for racial and \nethnic minorities; cancer prevention; behavioral research associated \nwith causing and preventing cancer; environmental risk factors for \ncancer and gene-environment interactions; new imaging and early \ndetection technologies and methods; and cancer survivorship.\n  Patient advocates and others have called on NCI and other institutes \nto develop a broad and responsive portfolio.\n  Experts say we need to learn more about cancer survivorship. People \nused to die quickly of cancer, but today, more and more are living with \ncancer, as many as nine million Americans. Kathleen Foley of Memorial \nSloan-Kettering Cancer Center said, ``While we work to cure the many \ntypes of cancer, nothing would have greater impact on the daily lives \nof cancer patients and their families than good symptom control and \nsupportive therapy.'' Charles S. Cleeland, of the M.D. Anderson Cancer \nCenter, said in the June 20, 2001 Washington Post, ``We need a new \nresearch agenda that focuses on alleviation of disease-related \ndistress.'' The National Cancer Policy Board of the Institute of \nMedicine last year recommended that NCI conduct more research on \npalliative care.\n  This is an example of an area that needs more emphasis. While NCI's \nwork has brought huge advances in understanding, preventing and \ntreating cancer, there is no question that we could do more.\n  For eight years I have co-chaired the Senate Cancer Coalition. We \nhave held eight hearings on cancer. With each hearing, I become more \nand more convinced that we can conquer cancer in my lifetime.\n  Polls by Research America show that the public wants their tax \ndollars spent on medical research and that in fact people will pay more \nin taxes for more medical research.\n  When Beatle George Harrison died in December of cancer, a Maryland \nnursery school teacher, Jennifer DeBernardis, said: ``All the fame and \nfortune and talent doesn't save you from something like cancer.'' \nCancer impacts everyone. Everyone knows someone who has had cancer or \nwill have cancer.\n  I am thoroughly convinced that if we just marshal the resources, we \ncan conquer cancer in the 21st century. Let's begin. The road ahead is \nlong and treacherous. But if we all work together, I honestly believe \nwe can do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I am very pleased and honored \nto join Senator Feinstein today to introduce this very important piece \nof legislation. Our country is very good at waging a winning war, but \nthere is one more that we need to wage and win and that is the war on \ncancer.\n  I joined Senator Feinstein as an original cosponsor of this for three \nreasons: First of all, because she asked me to. She is a person of \nremarkable leadership on this issue and so many more. Second, it was \nimportant to her and to me that the other cosponsor be a Republican \nbecause cancer is not a partisan issue. It attacks us both equally no \nmatter how we register at the polls. This is one of those issues where \ntruly we ought to be walking in lockstep together as Americans.\n  Finally, I know something of the pain that families experience \nthrough the contraction of cancer. As an honor and a tribute to my own \nmother, whom I recently lost to cancer, I cosponsor this legislation.\n  Oregon is a small State relatively--large geographically, but not in \npopulation--but cancer knows no boundaries as to States or as to \ncountries. As we consider the statistics I can give, they apply to my \nState. In percentage terms, they would apply equally to every State. \nTruly, cancer is the second biggest killer in the State of Oregon, \nsecond only to heart disease. And at current rates, it will soon \nsurpass that. This is a war we have to win.\n  There are 18,000 new cases of cancer diagnosed among Oregonians every \nyear. That is about 50 a day. On average, 19 Oregonians die from cancer \nevery day. Breast cancer is the most common form of diagnosed cancer in \nmy State. Nine women every day hear the dreaded words: You have breast \ncancer. And every day, one family in Oregon will lose a family member \nto breast cancer. Every 3 days, a child in Oregon is told that he or \nshe has cancer. I could go on. The statistics become rather numbing. \nBut they are not unique to my State. That makes it all the more tragic \nthat this is such a large and growing problem.\n  There is something we can do about it. I am proud to say that Senator \nFeinstein has mentioned Dr. Druker of the Oregon Health Sciences \nUniversity. He has, through his study of the genome, the genomic field, \ndeveloped a promising new oral treatment for patients with chronic \nmyeloid leukemia, a rare and life-threatening form of cancer. We met a \nwonderful woman yesterday who has been apparently cured on the basis of \nthis drug. Gleevec is a target therapy based on new knowledge in this \nimportant area of research. It is hoped that future advances in cancer \ntreatment will be equally as successful at targeting abnormalities with \ncurative or less toxic drugs for cancer patients. This legislation will \nhelp us on this path.\n  In the interests of time, I will not review the details of our bill \nthat Senator Feinstein has so very ably and eloquently laid out. This \nis a good bill. This is a bill that should pass. It is expensive in \ndollar terms, but how can we put a pricetag on the health of the \nAmerican people, on an issue as painful as this one?\n  Again, cancer is not a partisan disease.\n  I am proud today to cosponsor the National Cancer Act of 2002. I do \nso as a Republican, but more I do so as an American, and even more I do \nso as a member of the human family.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I rise today on behalf of legislation \nI am introducing along with Senator Feinstein and others to help \npatients and their families around the country who are struggling \nagainst cancer.\n  It has been three decades since we declared war on cancer, and passed \nthe National Cancer Act of 1971. And while we have many new weapons in \nour arsenal, new surgical techniques, new drugs like Gleevec, and new \ndiagnostic tests to catch cancer in its early stages, the burden of \nthis disease on our Nation is still devastating. One out of every two \nAmericans will hear these devastating words sometime in their lives: \n``you have cancer.'' It is the second leading cause of death in our \ncountry--surpassed only by heart disease, and it not only devastates \nthe patient; it brings immeasurable pain into the lives of that \nperson's family and friends.\n  Consider the statistic that 1,500 Americans die of cancer each day--\nthat's 1 out of every 4 deaths attributable to cancer. And the new \ncases continue to mount. Last year in New York alone there were an \nestimated 83,200 new cases of cancer--including 14,200 cases of breast \ncancer and nearly 4,000 cases of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.\n  Sadly, cancer has become a part of life for all American families. \nThanks to research, early detection and treatment, cancer is not \nautomatically a death sentence. It can be beaten. And it is even better \nto keep it from occurring in the first place. Our hope for this and \nfuture generations is this simple dream--that in the long fight against\n\n[[Page S1365]]\n\nthis disease, some day we will ultimately win--that keeps so many \npatients and families going.\n  This bill we're introducing today can move us closer to making the \ndream a reality. It calls for: Recruiting talented medical experts by \noffering to cover the student loan payments of 100 physicians a year \nwho agree to become cancer researchers; supporting the work of NCI \nCancer centers like Memorial Sloan Kettering and Roswell Park in New \nYork; improving cancer care by attracting and training health \nprofessionals to provide cancer care, to encourage cancer quarterbacks \nthat can coordinate a patients care, and improving access to important \ncancer services such as screenings, smoking cessation therapy, genetic \ntesting, and counseling about whether to undertake genetic testing.\n  While this legislation goes a long way to strengthening the \nbiomedical research efforts, we will also be continuing to work with \nthe States, communities, and public health institutions to educate the \npublic about cancer prevention, to address the risk factors, and \npromote early intervention.\n  In the past, the phrase ``public health'' conjured up battles against \ninfectious diseases like malaria or tuberculosis. Now with chronic \ndiseases, such as heart disease and cancer, as the leading killers, we \nmust think about ``public health'' in a new light, and fight \ncarcinogens as well as pathogens.\n  For instance, this bill affirms FDA's authority over tobacco, the \ncarcinogen that is responsible for 1 out of every 3 cancer deaths. Next \nweek I will be chairing a hearing in the Subcommittee on Public Health \nto explore the need for better tracking of chronic disease and \nenvironmental exposure, so that we can identify and understand the \nconnections between the environment and diseases like cancer.\n  I am a big believer in patient access to clinical trials. In the \nprevious administration Medicare and Medicaid began covering the \nroutine medical costs of participating in clinical trials, and I \nsupport extending that coverage to patients who have private insurance \nas well. The Senate-passed Patients' Bill of rights and the legislation \nwe're introducing today takes steps toward allowing more cancer \npatients to participate in clinical trials that just might save their \nlives. I will continue fighting to strengthen this important \ncornerstone of patient care and scientific progress.\n  Our hope for this legislation and America's war on cancer is simple: \nto move cancer from the medical books to the history books. And to live \nin a world where no one has to hear the words, ``you have cancer,'' \never, ever again.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THURMOND:\n  S. 1977. A bill to amend chapter 37 of title 28, United States Code, \nto provide for appointment of United States marshals by the Attorney \nGeneral; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. THRUMOND. Madam President; I rise to introduce legislation that \nwould improve the U.S. Marshals Service by making the U.S. Marshal at \nthe district level a career position rather than a political one. This \nreform is long overdue and would create an improved management \nstructure for the Marshal Service. This legislation would bring the \nService in line with other Federal agencies that choose their top \ndistrict and field officers by professional advancement, such as the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \nFirearms, and the Drug Enforcement Administration. As a result of this \nchange, we will ensure that highly qualified and experienced \nindividuals become U.S. Marshals. I encourage my colleagues to support \nthis important reform, which would greatly improve the efficiency and \neffectiveness of the U.S. Marshals Service.\n  The U.S. Marshals Service is the oldest Federal law enforcement \nagency. While its most traditional role is assisting the Federal judges \nand witnesses and by transporting prisoners, it also plays a critical \nrole in Federal law enforcement in other ways. For example, it is the \nprimary Federal agency responsible for apprehending dangerous fugitives \nfrom justice, and it conducts many special operations for the Attorney \nGeneral.\n  The management of the Marshals Service is unlike any other Federal \nlaw enforcement agency. While there is a national Director of the \nMarshals Service located in Arlington, VA, each judicial district has a \nU.S. Marshal that is appointed by the President and confirmed by the \nSenate. Consequently, the district U.S. Marshals are in reality \nindependent and accountable only to the President. Eduardo Gonzalez, \npast Director of the U.S. Marshals Service, testified before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee in 1998 that neither the Director of the Marshals \nService nor the Attorney General can directly discipline a U.S. \nMarshal. Rather, the President must specifically authorize the \ndisciplinary action. Additionally, a House report that accompanied a \nsimilar reform bill from the 106th Congress stated that the Director of \nthe Marshals Service is powerless to demote, suspend, or transfer a \nU.S. Marshal. The current system, therefore, undercuts the leadership \ncapacity of the Director of the Marshals Service due to the political \nindependence of the U.S. Marshals.\n  Each district also has the position of Chief Deputy Marshal, which is \noccupied by a career professional. The Chief Deputy Marshal assists the \npolitically-appointed U.S. Marshal, who may have little or no \nexperience in law enforcement, and provides continuity and leadership \nin the district offices. The Chief Deputy Marshals are vital to the \noperation of the field offices, providing stability during the comings \nand goings of U.S. Marshals. Due to the inexperience of many U.S. \nMarshals, the Chief Deputy Marshals have assumed critical roles in the \noperation of the field offices. In fact, the Marshals Service website \nstates, ``The backbone of the Marshals Service has always been the \nindividual Deputy Marshal.'' It is significant that the politically-\nappointed U.S. Marshal is not the ``backbone'' of the Service. Rather, \nthe Deputy Marshal, who arrives at the position through career \nadvancement, is the mainstay of the Marshals Service.\n  The Chief Deputies in turn have Supervisory Deputy U.S. Marshals to \nassist them with day-to-day activities. Due to the heavy turnover in \nleadership at the district level, there must be significant support for \nnew and inexperienced U.S. Marshals. Therefore, the district level \noffices are heavily staffed. This situation results in an agency that \nis top heavy in management.\n  In an excellent book about the U.S. Marshals Service called ``The \nLawmen'' by Frederick Calhoun, the author asserts that the Marshals \nService is harmed by the process of appointing district marshals. He \nwrites, ``The service remained too politicized. The presidential \nappointment of the U.S. marshals haunted the organization. It could \nnever escape the taint of politics as long as its top district manager \nowed their appointments to political favors, not professional \nadvancement.'' Mr. Calhoun recognized that because of the political \nappointment of the top field officers, career employees must walk a \nfine line between balancing their allegiances to the temporary U.S. \nMarshal and to headquarters. He goes on to say, ``The deputies dealt \ndaily with their political supervisors, who controlled their work \nassignments and annual personnel evaluations, while they looked to \nheadquarters for careers and promotions.''\n  The current organization of the Marshals Service not only causes \npolitical strains, but it is also structurally unsound. Wayne Colburn, \nDirector of the U.S. Marshals Service in the early 1970s, argued that \nthe agency functioned as a ``loosely organized group of ninety-four \njudicial districts'' due to the weakness of the Director. Mr. Colburn \nrecognized that the management structure was flawed because the agency \nin effect had ninety-four directors who owed little allegiance to the \nnational director. While Mr. Colburn's concerns were alleviated \nsomewhat by the Marshals Service Act of 1988, which strengthened the \npolicy-making powers of the Director, the Act did not go far enough. \nThe Director has centralized authority, yet he is still extremely \nlimited in his ability to make personnel and disciplinary decisions \nregarding the politically appointed U.S. Marshals. This situation is \nunacceptable in such an important Federal agency. We owe it to our \nNation's oldest law enforcement organization to improve its structure \nand to make its operations more efficient.\n\n  I would like to point out that the U.S. Marshals Service has already\n\n[[Page S1366]]\n\nplaced some of its most crucial functions under the management of the \nnational office, thereby avoiding some of the problems that I have \ndiscussed so far. For example, the Witness Security Program, which \nensures the safety of witnesses who testify for the government, is \nadministered centrally by the Marshals Service. According to former \nDirector Gonzalez's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nthe Witness Security Program's operation was changed because it was not \nfunctioning correctly at the district level. He said, ``Witness \nSecurity Inspectors assigned to the districts found they were \nattempting to serve two masters, the headquarters' Witness Security \nProgram and the U.S. Marshal.'' This example of internal restructuring \nby the Service demonstrates the need for Congress to enact fundamental \nreform.\n  This reform legislation also has the potential to save taxpayer \nmoney. Mr. Gonzalez testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee \nthat if the political selection of U.S. Marshals were ended, the \nService would eliminate many field office positions. There would no \nlonger be a need to provide the kind of support that is currently \nnecessary to assist the political appointees, who often do not have the \nproper experience and expertise. A more streamlined management \nstructure would save money and make operations more efficient. \nAccording to Mr. Gonzalez, the Marshals Service has estimated that this \nchange would save over $10 million in the first three years.\n  Legislation to change the appointment process for district Marshals \npassed the house in 1997 but did not pass the Senate. That bill, as \nthis one, essentially makes the change effective at the start of the \nupcoming four-year term for the President. This bill would be effective \nin January 2005, so that U.S. Marshals appointed by President Bush \ncould complete the current four-year term of the Bush Administration.\n  It is important to recognize that many district U.S. Marshals who \nhave served over the years have been distinguished public servants and \nare fine people. However, others had no experience in law enforcement \nand were not qualified to serve in these important positions.\n  For the benefit of the Marshals Service, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important reform measure. It is long overdue. Similar \nreforms have been supported by Presidential commissions under \nPresidents Howard Taft, Herbert Hoover, and Franklin Roosevelt.

Madam President, I rise today once again to draw \nattention to the suffering of people in\n\n[[Page S1367]]\n\nChechnya. On behalf of myself and Senator Brownback, I am submitting a \nresolution urging the Russian government to seek a negotiated \nsettlement to the conflict there, to end human rights violations by \nRussian soldiers there, to investigate and initiate prosecutions \nagainst those accused, and to ensure that refugees receive the \nassistance they need. The resolution also urges President Bush to \npromote peace negotiations between the parties, to obtain assurances \nfrom the Russian government that no security forces who are recipients \nof U.S. assistance are implicated in human rights abuses and to seek \nspecific information on the status of investigations into reported \nabuses.\n  The war in Chechnya has raged too long, and reports of egregious \nhuman rights violations by Russian soldiers continue to increase. \nToday, Human Rights Watch is releasing yet another report of such \nabuses, Swept Under: Torture, Forced Disappearances, and Extrajudicial \nKillings During Sweep Operations in Chechnya. Year after year we \nreceive reports telling the same stories, yet nothing seems to change. \nSince September 11, Russian officials have argued more vigorously that \nthey are fighting terrorism in Chechnya. Whether the Russian government \nbelieves this to be true or not is not the issue. What is clear is that \nRussia is acting illegally and immorally in Chechnya, and it must stop.\n  I want to talk briefly about the United States and our relationship \nto this war. As we increase our cooperation with various governments in \nthe war on terrorism, we cannot condone some of the actions these \nfriends are taking in the name of fighting terrorism.\n  Russia has been a key member of the anti-terrorist coalition since \nSeptember 11. It has played a crucial role in our success in \nAfghanistan. I applaud and support this U.S.-Russian cooperation. But \nwhat is happening in Chechnya cannot be justified by the war on \nterrorism. Russian forces in Chechnya have acted illegally and with \nunspeakable brutality against the civilian population there. There \ncontinue to be credible reports of summary execution, mass detention, \nrape, torture, forced disappearance, arbitrary arrest and looting. The \nRussian government has so far refused to investigate such reports.\n  The Russian government believes it is fighting terrorism in Chechnya. \nIn fact, it frequently compares the U.S. war on terrorism to its own \nefforts in Chechnya. But the world community must remind Russia's \nleaders that even in a war on terrorism, ends do not necessarily \njustify any means. A war against terrorism does not permit abuses \nagainst civilians. We must remind Russia that the war against terrorism \nis a struggle for freedom and democracy. Free and democratic nations do \nnot round up boys and beat them so badly that they have to be carried \nhome when the are finally released. They do not torture and rape women. \nToday as I read the reports of intensified human rights violations on a \nmassive scale in Chechnya, as well as of Russia's refusal to \ninvestigate such reports and hold responsible individuals accountable, \nI have to question Russia's commitment to democratic norms and to \ninternationally recognized human rights standards.\n  We have a moral duty not only to speak out against Russian atrocities \nin Chechnya, but also to ensure that we aren't unintentionally allowing \nthem to continue. We must ensure that no security forces that are the \nrecipients of U.S. assistance or participants in joint operations with \nthe U.S. are implicated in human rights abuses in Chechnya. This \nresolution urges the President to provide that assurance.\n  It saddens me to speak once again about a war that has now entered \nits third year. It is a war that has been conducted with such brutality \nthat it has been hard at times to imagine the situation getting worse. \nUnfortunately, it has gotten worse. The Russian government apparently \nhas intensified its campaign against civilians in the name of fighting \nterrorism. When I met recently with the Chechen Foreign Minister, he \nmade it clear to me that he believes the post-September 11 period will \nbe remembered as one of the most savage times in Chechen history.\n  The New York Times reported recently that, according to Chechen \npolice officials, Russian troops are killing civilians in a campaign of \nexecutions and looting that takes place alongside military operations \naimed at destroying rebel forces. According to the article, Russian \nunits roll into a town during the day to scout neighborhoods for \nresidents who appear to have money or property worth stealing. Then, at \nnight, the soldiers return in their tanks and burst into houses, \nstealing goods and killing witnesses. In one of the largest of Grozny's \nfour districts, Chechen investigators have documented 17 cases in the \nlast 12 months implicating Russian Interior Ministry troops in killing \ncivilians during such looting.\n  Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have both documented \naccounts of terrible human rights violations in Chechnya. Our own State \nDepartment Country Reports on Human Rights Practices reports the \nexecution of at least 60 civilians last February in the suburbs of \nGrozny. It reports torture by police officers using electric shocks. It \nreports the rape of Chechen women by Russian soldiers. These are \nreports from 2000. The new report for 2001 will be released soon, and, \nsadly, no one expects it to be better.\n  There have been credible reports of human rights violations on both \nsides of the conflict in Chechnya. I condemn human rights violations by \nall parties, as does the resolution we offer today. Chechen rebel \nfighters have increasingly targeted for murder Chechen civilians they \nbelieve are cooperating with the Russian government. Human Rights Watch \nWorld Report for 2002 reports that Chechen fighters murdered at least \n18 leaders of district and town administrations and at least five \nreligious leaders, as well as numerous Chechen police officers, \nteachers and low ranking officials. There are extremist groups in \nChechnya--some with ties to Arab extremist groups and possibly to al-\nQaeda. I condemn all acts of terrorism, but what is happening in \nChechnya is a human tragedy, and nothing justifies the often brutal use \nof violence by Russian soldiers there.\n  Credible reports estimate that the war in Chechnya from 1994-1996 \nleft over 80,000 civilians dead. The State Department cities evidence \nthat the current war has resulted in the deaths of thousands of \ninnocent civilians. There is credible evidence of the displacement of \nnearly 40 percent of the civilian population, or close to 400,000 \npeople. According to the American Committee for Peace in Chechnya, a \ngroup committed to finding a political solution to this conflict, a \nsignificant portion of the male population between the ages of 16-55 is \nsimply gone.\n  Doctors without Borders reports that the humanitarian situation for \nan estimated 180,000 refugees in camps in the neighboring Republic of \nIngushetia is deteriorating. The majority of the refugees are living \nwith families, but over 60,000 people remain in tents, empty schools, \nand factory buildings. Shelter and sanitation facilities are poor, worn \nout and far below acceptable standards. Sometimes one latrine serves \n100 people or more. The government of Russia also refuses to register \nthe refugees, arguing they are economic migrants. Since these refugees \nare being accorded no legitimate status, they are often unable to get \nthe humanitarian assistance they need. The resolution we offer today \nurges the Russian government to secure the distribution of humanitarian \nassistance and to register refugees as required by both Russian and \ninternational law.\n  The government of Russia must work to find a political solution to \nend the war in Chechnya. In must put a stop to human rights violations \nby its soldiers, hold those who are responsible accountable for their \nactions and ensure that refugees get the assistance they need. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this resolution.\n  Again, this resolution, which Senator Brownback from Kansas and I \nsubmit, urges the Russian Government to seek to negotiate a settlement \nto the conflict there. This deals with the suffering of the people in \nChechnya, and it calls on the Russian Government to end human rights \nviolations by Russian soldiers there, to investigate and initiate \nprosecution against those who are accused, and to ensure that refugees \nreceive the assistance they need.\n\n[[Page S1368]]\n\n  The resolution also urges President Bush to promote peace \nnegotiations between the parties, to obtain assurances from the Russian \nGovernment that no security forces that are recipients of United States \nassistance are implicated in human rights abuses, and to seek specific \ninformation on the status of investigations into reported abuses.\n  Senator Brownback and I submit this resolution timed with a report \nthat Human Rights Watch is releasing today, which deals with these \nabuses. The title of the report is ``Swept Under: Torture, Forced \nDisappearances, and Extrajudicial Killings During Sweep Operations in \nChechnya.''\n  I recommend that my colleagues and their staffs look at this report, \nwhich is deeply troubling.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a piece in the New York Times, written \nby Patrick Tyler, on January 25, 2002, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 25, 2002]\n\n          Police in Chechnya Accuse Russia's Troops of Murder\n\n                         (By Patrick E. Tyler)\n\n       Rozny, Russia, Jan. 22.--Nearly two years after major \n     hostilities ended here in Chechnya, the devastated republic \n     in the Caucasus, Russian troops are killing civilians in a \n     campaign of executions and looting that takes place alongside \n     military operations aimed at destroying rebel forces, \n     according to Chechen police officials.\n       Chechen police authorities working under the republic's \n     pro-Russian government said in interviews over the past week \n     that Russian Interior Ministry units, known by their acronym, \n     Obron, have been scouting neighborhoods during mine-sweeping \n     operations for residents who appear to have money or property \n     worth stealing.\n       At night, the soldiers return in armored personnel \n     carriers, some with identifying markings, and burst into the \n     houses, stealing household goods and killing witnesses. \n     Chechen police investigators say.\n       In the central Leninsky district of Grozny, skeletal shards \n     of buildings teeter above a landscape of debris that evokes \n     scenes from European cities destroyed in World War II. The \n     rubble now lies sealed under a winter blanket of snow as \n     thousands of Chechen families eke out an isolated existence \n     in bomb-damaged homes.\n       In Leninsky, the largest of Grozny's four districts, \n     Chechen investigators have documented 17 cases in the last 12 \n     months implicating Interior Ministry troops in killing \n     civilians during looting. One of the most notorious of the \n     units is known as Obron-22, the Chechens say.\n       But in each case, military and civilian prosecutors have \n     refused to bring criminal cases, the police said. Instead, \n     the prosecutors set aside files as inactive or return them \n     with demands to provide the names of soldiers involved.\n       ``These units burst into people's houses on the pretext of \n     `mopping up' operations and commit murders,'' said Alvi \n     Magomed-Mirzoyev, a police lieutenant colonel who returned to \n     Grozny from Moscow a year ago to lead a criminal \n     investigation department in Leninsky.\n       In Moscow, the Interior Ministry, the Defense Ministry and \n     prosecutors were asked to comment on these allegations, but \n     declined.\n       Chechen police authorities are drawing up a republic-wide \n     list of unsolved killings of civilians in which federal \n     forces have been implicated by witnesses, but which \n     prosecutors have refused to pursue. One senior member of the \n     Chechen administration in Grozny, taking a significant \n     risk, provided documents on 163 such cases compiled under \n     the heading, ``Some cases of detention by representatives \n     of the federal forces of civilians who subsequently \n     disappeared or were found dead.''\n       ``These are the conditions we are living under,'' he said \n     he handed over the document and disappeared into a police \n     headquarters building where Chechen recruits are certified \n     and inducted into a new force.\n       A typical case in the file is that of Magomed H. Vakhidov, \n     57, once mayor of Urus-Martan, just south of Grozny. He fled \n     Chechnya when the second war with Russia broke out in \n     September 1999; a year later he sought and received an \n     amnesty to return home.\n       But at 3 a.m. on July 20, 2001, a squad of Russia soldiers \n     fired smoke grenades into his home and then burst in and \n     arrested him, according to the documents. Russian military \n     authorities denied taking him into custody. On July 31, his \n     body was found in the gardens of a state farm, badly \n     mutilated from torture, electric shock, knife wounds and \n     burns from a blow torch.\n       Russian officials routinely attribute such killings to \n     ``rebels.'' But, as one Chechen police official noted, ``the \n     rebels do not travel in armored personnel carriers.''\n       A number of unsolved cases relate to Chechen rebels who \n     took advantage of amnesties issued by Moscow and by Russian \n     military commanders.\n       In March 2000, after Russian forces had driven rebel forces \n     from Grozny, Roman S. Bersanukayev, 19, turned himself in to \n     the commander of Russia's 245th Rifle Regiment near Martan-\n     Chu, near Urus-Martan.\n       When his relatives asked the local office of the Federal \n     Security Service about his status, they were given a document \n     showing that no criminal proceedings would be lodged against \n     him. They also received an amnesty certificate signed by the \n     Russian military commandant for the district, Y.A. Naumov. \n     But Mr. Bersanukayev then disappeared from federal custody \n     and is feared dead.\n       ``I am an officer and I took an oath to Russia to uphold \n     the law,'' said Colonel Magomed-Mirzoyev, the policeman, \n     ``but I am sick and tired of being afraid and I hate the \n     lawlessness that is going on here, and I want to do \n     everything I can to bring it to an end.''\n       On a visit to Paris this month, President Vladimir V. Putin \n     asserted that Russian troops committing acts of violence \n     against Chechen civilians were being held accountable and \n     that judicial and law enforcement organs were functioning \n     normally. ``About 20 servicemen have already been brought to \n     justice,'' he said.\n       By lending strong support to President Bush's war against \n     terrorism, Mr. Putin has successfully blunted Western \n     criticism of Russian conduct in Chechnya. Several governments \n     have suggested that Russia had more justification for its \n     actions than had been acknowledged.\n       But the situation on the ground has continued to fester.\n       Chechnya's top prosecutor, Vsevolod Chernov, said this week \n     that 212 criminal cases based on reports of missing people \n     had been opened in the last year. ``In some cases, the \n     disappearance of people can be connected to special \n     operations conducted by federal units,'' he said, but \n     ``sufficient legally substantiated evidence'' was necessary \n     to bring the cases to court.\n       Local police officials tell a different story. They say \n     criminal cases sent to Mr. Chernov are technically open but \n     are frozen by the inability of criminal investigators to \n     interview Russian soldiers who may be witnesses or suspects \n     involved in crimes against civilians.\n       The police investigators say that they have tried to gain \n     access to Russian military units, but that they are afraid to \n     approach Russian military prosecutors, who must approve any \n     contact with federal soldiers.\n       The military prosecutors are housed at Russia's main \n     military base, at Khankala, on the southeast edge of Grozny. \n     The base is known to Chechens as a place where detainees are \n     taken and sometimes never return.\n       ``If the shelling of a civilian neighborhood involved \n     federal servicemen, I wouldn't be able to send my \n     investigator because he might not come back,'' Colonel \n     Magomed-Mirzoyev said.\n       Earlier this month, a senior official of the new Chechen \n     administration, Ruslan Yunusov, deputy minister of the \n     Chechen Emergencies Ministry and a veteran of the Soviet \n     military campaign in Afghanistan, was shot dead by federal \n     troops in front of the Russian military police headquarters \n     here when he tried to arrest Russian soldiers in an armored \n     personnel carrier. The soldiers were suspected of wounding \n     one of Mr. Yunusov's officers on Dec. 29.\n       Several high-profile cases against federal troops have been \n     brought to court in the past year, like the murder trial of \n     Col. Yuri Budanov, accused of the rape and murder of an 18-\n     year-old Chechen woman in March 2000. The trial began nearly \n     a year ago and has suffered numerous delays over demands for \n     psychiatric evaluations by military officials to determine \n     whether Colonel Budanov was temporarily insane when he \n     strangled the woman in a fit of rage over the deaths of his \n     comrades at the hands of rebels.\n       Chechen officials also point out that there appear to be no \n     active investigations of reports of civilian massacres during \n     the intense Russian military campaign that was begun in \n     Chechnya by Mr. Putin after he became prime minister in 1999. \n     That campaign followed incursions by armed men--Russia called \n     them Islamic extremists--and terrorist attacks that left \n     more than 300 dead in Moscow and other Russian cities.\n       A martial-style curfew is enforced so strictly here that \n     ambulance service is halted at night, when lethal mayhem \n     takes over. Russian forces hide in their fortified \n     checkpoints as rebels creep into the city to shoot at them or \n     to lay mines to blow up military convoys the next day.\n       In addition to reported abuses by Interior Ministry forces, \n     regular Russian Army troops continue to inflict punitive \n     raids on Chechen towns and villages, as they did earlier this \n     month in Tsotsin-Yurt, just southeast of Grozny, after two \n     suspected rebels fleeing federal forces took refuge in a \n     house there on Dec. 30. The rebels were killed, and a large \n     column of Russian armored forces surrounded the town.\n       Town residents said that over the next several days, \n     soldiers seized young and middle-aged men from their homes \n     and looted a number of houses, all in violation of military \n     pledges made last year calling for Chechen authorities to be \n     present to observe such ``mopping up'' operations.\n       Seven civilians died during the initial gun battle, town \n     officials said, two of them after they were used as human \n     shields by soldiers attacking the house where the suspected \n     rebels holed up.\n       One of the men used as a shield was Idris Zakiyev, a 42-\n     year-old tractor driver with four daughters. The other was \n     Musa Ismailov, 43, an elder of the mosque who performed a \n     traditional dance at Chechen funerals; he had five children.\n\n[[Page S1369]]\n\n       ``They were shot at short distance and their bodies showed \n     signs of mutilation,'' said Ilyas Zakiyev, a brother of \n     Idris.\n       Even now, weeks later, Russian units have blocked all roads \n     into Tsotsin-Yurt and more than 15,000 residents are being \n     held virtually as prisoners, forced to pay a bribe--amounting \n     to a day's wages in many cases--to enter or leave. Entering \n     Tsotsin-Yurt on Monday, this reporter saw Russian soldiers \n     collecting these tolls from Chechen drivers passing the \n     checkpoints.\n       Turko Aliev, 51, the chairman of the town elders' council, \n     was among the first to meet with the Russian commander who \n     ordered the assault on the town. The commander threatened to \n     open an artillery attack in 30 minutes unless the elders sent \n     the mayor out to meet him and to identify the seven corpses \n     laid out before Russian news reporters as ``rebels.''\n       ``I told him that was impossible because the mayor was in \n     Grozny, but he replied, `You now have 28 minutes,''' said \n     Ilyas Zakiyev, who accompanied the elders.\n       At that moment, Mr. Aliev stepped forward as chairman of \n     the council and identified the bodies of Idris Zakiyev and \n     Mr. Ismailov, the mosque elder.\n       The town officials were allowed to take the two bodies away \n     in a car, which Mr. Aliev said he drove through a gantlet of \n     checkpoints where one Russian soldier stopped him and \n     threatened to kill him.\n       ``Where can we complain?'' asked Mr. Aliev, as he stood in \n     a makeshift morgue at the town mosque to make the final grim \n     accounting from the raid on the village: three bundles of \n     tattered clothing that belonged to unidentified men blown up \n     in a field on the edge of town.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I will read 2 paragraphs:\n\n       In Leninsky, the largest of Grozny's four districts, \n     Chechen investigators have documented 17 cases in the last 12 \n     months implicating Interior Ministry troops in killing \n     civilians during looting. One of the most notorious of the \n     units is known as Obron-22, the Chechens say.\n       In the central Leninsky district of Grozny, skeletal shards \n     of buildings teeter above the landscape of debris that evokes \n     scenes from European cities destroyed in World War II. The \n     rubble now lies sealed under a winter blanket of snow as \n     thousands of Chechen families eke out an isolated existence \n     in bomb-damaged homes.'\n\n  Let me summarize. The conclusions are as follows: It is the sense of \nthe Senate that the war on terrorism does not excuse and is ultimately \nundermined by abuses by Russian security forces against civilians in \nChechnya. It also is the sense of the Senate that Russia and Chechen \nleadership should seek a negotiated settlement. It is the sense of the \nSenate that Russian President Putin should: 1, end human rights \nviolations, investigate them, and prosecute them; 2, provide secure \naccess to international monitors and humanitarian organizations; and 3, \nensure the registration of refugees and not force them to return \nagainst their will.\n  Finally, the sense of the Senate says President Bush should: 1, \nensure no United States assistance goes to Russian units implicated in \nthese abuses; 2, seek specific information on the status of \ninvestigations, or lack of investigations, of the human rights abuses; \n3, promote peace negotiations; and 4, reexamine the status of Chechen \nrefugees in regard to possible resettlement in the United States.\n  The reason we introduce this resolution today is, again, this very \npowerful report that came out by Human Rights Watch. I want the Russian \nGovernment to know, and I want the people in Chechnya and in Russia to \nknow, that here on the floor of the Senate we are paying attention to \nwhat is happening.\n  I will send this resolution to the desk, and we will take steps to \npass it, and I think there is strong support for this resolution in the \nForeign Relations Committee. Most important is the message. The message \nis that we want to see an end to the terrorism, to the murder of \ninnocent civilians. But, quite frankly, much of what the Russian \nGovernment is trying to excuse--all in the name of a war against \nterrorism--is, unfortunately, rape, torture, and murder of innocent \npeople. That is not acceptable. That needs to be settled before the \nSenate and we need to pass this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/28/senate-section/article/S1369-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1369-S1370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 99--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE CONGRESS \n  THAT A COMMEMORATIVE STAMP SHOULD BE ISSUED HONORING FELIX OCTAVIUS \n                              CARR DARLEY\n\n  Mr. BIDEN (for himself and Mr. Carper) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs:\n\n                            S.

In fact, for the last 29 years of \nDarling's life he lived in my hometown of Claymont, DE, where he \nproduced many of his most famous and renowned drawings.
