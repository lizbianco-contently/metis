Mr. President, I have come to the Chamber today to talk \nabout an issue about which I have spoken before and will continue to do \nso until we turn around the current climate we are facing, which is a \nrollback of environmental protections for the American people.\n  It is stunning to see what has happened to environmental regulations \nsince administrations have changed. We have, fortunately, a group \ncalled the NRDC. I have a list of all the actions that have been taken \nby this administration since they took over. We have seen the average \nof one anti-environmental action every week since this administration \ntook over.\n  This chart is way too small for people to read, but it gives a sense \nof the situation. I have two charts like this. These are 100 rollbacks. \nOur Nation certainly is in a situation where we are so focused on \nmeeting the challenges that hit us on September 11--and it is very \nunderstandable; we are so united on that--but what has happened in the \ncourse of that time is that without very much publicity, a lot of these \nregulations have moved forward.\n  We face the circumstance where if we in the Senate and those in the \nHouse who care about the environment do not speak out, I fear for the \nfuture of our country.\n  Why do I say that? Because when one says the word ``environment,'' it \nmeans many things, and one meaning is health and safety. For example, \nwhen this administration believed it was not so important that arsenic \nwas in the water, finally the people woke up to what they were doing. \nThen when they said it was not so important to test poor kids for lead \nin their blood--even though we know if a child has elevated levels of \nlead in his or her blood, there is going to be a serious learning \nproblem and illness problem, even problems of death--they went too far.\n  It does not seem to stop them. In my State, they are against us as we \nare trying to protect the coastline. They are against us. They said to \nFlorida: We will help you. But as to California, it is unbelievable. \nInterior Secretary Norton said people in California do not care about \ntheir coasts. Mr. President, I am here to say that is an insane \nstatement if you look at the record.\n  Since the seventies, when under the Carter administration they \nthought they would drill, we convinced Carter not to drill. We thought \nthat problem was over. The State has a moratorium on drilling off our \nshores. The fact is, we have set up sanctuaries all along the ocean. \nThis is a terrible statement and an example of how the Bush \nadministration is so blinded by this idea that the environment does not \nmatter, they will say things that do not make sense.\n  My colleague from Illinois is in the Chamber, and I know he wants to \nadd to this debate. First, I want to cover one more issue before I \nyield to him. I want to talk about one issue. It is called the \nSuperfund.\n  I think it is very interesting that the Presiding Officer, as well as \nSenator Torricelli, are two leading proponents for doing something \nabout Superfund sites.\n  The word ``super'' is a good word: You look super fine. The word \n``Superfund'' is not a good word because what it means is that we have \nsites all over this country that are filled with poison and toxins, and \nwe need to clean up these sites.\n  This chart shows there are national priority list sites in every \nsingle State but one. North Dakota is the only State. New Jersey \nhappens to have the most. Pennsylvania is third. My own State has about \n104 sites, and we are second on the list.\n  What I want to show my colleagues--and I hope the Senator from \nIllinois will pick up on this--is what is happening specifically to the \nSuperfund program, which is such a popular program in this country. It \ncleans up these toxic sites. A lot of people live near these sites. \nChildren live near these sites. It makes the sites safe, and it goes \nafter the responsible parties, the polluters, and says the polluter \npays, which is the basic premise of the Superfund program.\n  Under Bill Clinton's administration, we saw a ratcheting up of the \ncleanup: 88, 87, 85, 87 sites in the last 4 years. We were all set to \ncontinue. We were a little disheartened when President Bush said he is \nonly going to clean up 75 sites, but worse than that happened. Now they \nare saying they are only going to clean up 47 sites, and then 40. We \nare going back down. We are going back down to a level, frankly, that \nwe have not seen in more than a decade.\n  This is a horrible situation. I am proud that Senator Chafee has \njoined us, and we have bipartisan legislation to reinstate the \nSuperfund fee so polluters will pay.\n  I am going to show one last chart because this is so important. This \nidea of ``polluter pays to clean up their mess'' has been basic to this \ncountry for many years, since Superfund was set up in the 1980s, and it \nled us to a situation where the industry and the polluters were paying \n82 percent of the cleanup and taxpayers only 18 percent. That was where \nwe could not find a party or we did not have enough funds in the \nSuperfund trust fund.\n  This is where we are headed under President Bush. I consider this \nadministration the most anti-environmental that I have ever seen, \nfrankly. I have been in Congress since 1982, with Senator Durbin, who \nis about to speak. In 2003, 54 percent of the cleanup in Superfund will \nbe paid for by taxpayers; 46 percent by the industry that polluted. \nThis is not a good trend for the American people, for the taxpayers, \nand that is why we have so much support for turning this around.\n  I am proud to be the chair of the environmental team that Senator \nDaschle has appointed to point out the environmental record of this \nadministration and how it is hurting the health, safety, and well-being \nof the American people.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield to my friend for as long as he would \nlike.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my friend for her leadership on the environmental \nissue, and I would like to get back to it, but I would like to ask the \nSenator to reflect with me for a minute on the larger issue, an issue \nof corporate responsibility, whether U.S. businesses will accept their \nresponsibilities as part of America, their responsibility not only to \ntheir workers, their investors, and shareholders, but the consumers and \nAmerica at large.\n\n  Time and time again, what we find with the Bush administration is \nthey turn their back and ignore this issue of corporate responsibility. \nWe now have a ``Bermuda Triangle.'' This Bermuda Triangle is sucking in \nAmerican jobs and American tax dollars as more and more corporations \nare moving their headquarters overseas. As they move their headquarters \nto Bermuda to avoid paying America's taxes, they are shirking their \ncorporate responsibility to the United States.\n  When the Stanley Tool Company decided to move from the United States \nand put their corporate headquarters in Bermuda, did we hear any \nprotests from this administration that they were shirking corporate \nresponsibility? Not at all.\n  We saw in the paper yesterday that we now have the Norquist black \nlist. Grover Norquist, one of the leading gurus of the Republican \nParty, has said he is creating a black list of those entities, \norganizations, and people in Washington who will not be acceptable and \nwelcome in the Bush administration. They want their close circle of \ncorporate friends to have entre to persuade this administration to move \nin the worst directions. They do not want to hear both points of view, \nthe Norquist black list, part of this Bush administration philosophy.\n  It really comes through graphically on this issue of the Superfund. \nWho should pay for the toxic mess? The people who created the toxic \nmess or the taxpayers, the families of America?\n  What we are saying basically is if this burden is shifted to the \ntaxpayers of America, corporate responsibility is abandoned. The \ncorporations and businesses that create the mess should bear the burden \nof cleaning it up.\n  The Senator from California has made this point: In my State of \nIllinois, we have 39 sites on the Superfund list and 6 that have been \nformally proposed. Several others ultimately filled\n\n[[Page S5321]]\n\nwith PCBs, arsenic chlorinated solvents, and other harmful compounds \nwill qualify. The Bush administration says the corporations and \nindustries responsible for this mess should not pay for it; American \nfamilies, workers, and taxpayers ought to pay for it. Where is \ncorporate responsibility in this administration?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am really pleased my friend has tied this into the \nbigger picture, because this particular chart shows it all. The Bush \nadministration is moving away from corporate responsibility when it \ncomes to cleaning up the worst toxic sites in America. They are \ncleaning up half the number of sites. We do not know. We cannot tell.\n  I am the chair of the Superfund Committee and the Environment \nCommittee. The bottom line is, I cannot even tell whether the sites of \nthe Senator from Illinois are going to be cleaned up because this \nadministration is keeping that information secret.\n  To get to the point about corporate responsibility, having faced the \nEnron scandal, and continuing to face it in California, let me state \nwhat this means. It means corporations could care less about the people \nthey serve. They tell their own employees to buy Enron stock while the \ninsiders sell out. The shareholders were the last people they thought \nabout. It is a lack of a corporate ethics.\n  When this administration writes an energy plan, they talk to these \nvery same corporations that essentially turn their back on the American \npeople. As my friend, Senator Mikulski, brought up at a meeting we both \nattended today, some of these corporate executives renounced their \ncitizenship in order to get away with not paying any taxes. They leave \nthe greatest country in the world, which gave them every opportunity to \nfulfill the American dream, and they throw it all away for dollars and \ncents.\n  There is little corporate ethic in America. There are some very good \ncorporations. Why not say to those good corporations: We appreciate \nwhat you are doing; join with us. Let us get back a corporate ethic.\n  On the Norquist black list that my colleague referred to, I thought \nit was interesting when Ari Fleischer was asked about it in his press \nconference. He said: I have no comment because we have nothing to do \nwith it. I found that amazing. Does he have no comment on terrorism? He \nhas nothing to do with that. Does he have no comment when something \nhorrible happens around the world that we have nothing to do with? \nSince when is it that there is suddenly silence when it comes to a \nblack list? I think it is a political embarrassment to them.\n  More than that, what worries me is they are not distancing themselves \nfrom this issue. I hope in America there is room for all kinds of \nviews. When Vice President Cheney put together the energy plan, they \ndid not want any views from people who had what I would call the public \ninterest versus the special interest. I worry about this small circle \naround this President that does not hear from people who may have a \ndifferent view.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield for another question, I think \nwe should make it clear what this Norquist black list is all about. \nGrover Norquist is one of the conservative gurus in the Republican \nParty. He is now joining in what he calls his ``K Street Project'' with \nother conservatives. They are really creating a black list of people \nwith which this administration will not deal. People who are fighting \nfor the environment, people who are fighting for human rights, people \nwho are trying to protect the rights of individuals to have health \ncare, people who are trying to protect consumers will be part of the \nNorquist black list.\n  Now what the Bush administration is saying is that they really do not \nknow that they want to comment on this. They should comment on it \nimmediately and reject it. They ought to denounce it. This is \nunacceptable, whether the President is a Democratic or Republican. \nEvery President should be open to every point of view. They may come \ndown and reach a different conclusion, but to create a black list, as \nGrover Norquist has for those who are standing up and fighting and \nbasically representing the families of America, is plain wrong.\n  I ask the Senator from California, do we not see this coming back at \nus in so many different ways? The Senator mentioned Enron, the weak \nstock market, and the lack of confidence in corporate America. Should \nwe not have leadership from the White House saying we demand corporate \nresponsibility? We do not find that, do we, in this administration \nresponse?\n  Mrs. BOXER. No, we do not find it. As a matter of fact, I am waiting \nfor some indictments on the Enron case, to be honest.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Not one so far.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Not one so far. We now know because other whistleblowers \nare telling us that they set the pace for the energy industry. This was \nthe biggest transfer of wealth from ordinary American families to the \npockets of these people. It is extraordinary.\n\n  Overlay the whole Enron scandal and anyone can see that California \nwas used as a cash cow to keep Enron afloat while the insiders sold \ntheir stock. I have seen videotapes of the highest executives at Enron \ntelling the poor employees--as these top executives were unloading \ntheir stock--buy more stock. They wanted to see that the stock was \nartificially held up and have more people and more employees buying so \nthey could sell out.\n  I look at the word ``patriotism'' perhaps in a different way than \nothers. Patriotism extends to a very broad range. When I say this, I \nmean if you are truly patriotic and love this country, yes, you stand \nwith this President in the war against terror. But it extends to the \nway you treat people in your life, Americans who get up in the morning \nand work hard, single moms, people with illness who want prescription \ndrugs. To make this the greatest country is making sure we have a \nstrong middle class to buy the products that business makes, to be able \nto educate their children so this country continues to be the greatest \nin the world.\n  When you put greed ahead of the American families in this country and \ntheir rights and forget your responsibilities, where is the patriotism \nthere?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  I have met with business leaders in Chicago from good businesses, \nfrom across Illinois, and they are saying the same thing. They are \nashamed of what has happened with Enron. They are ashamed of what they \nare seeing in this area of corporate irresponsibility. They believe \nthey are good Americans creating profit for their shareholders and job \nopportunities and good products. They are looking for leadership from \nWashington. Usually business says, Washington, hands off, stay away \nfrom us.\n  Many times they are asking, What are you going to do to help us clean \nup the mess when it comes to accounting standards and energy \nregulation? We need leadership from Washington. Yet there is little or \nnothing coming from this administration when it comes to corporate \nresponsibility. For the sake of this country, for the sake of the good \ncompanies in this country, those that are responsible, we need an \nadministration that will speak out now to restore confidence to the \nAmerican people in our economy, in our business structure, in our stock \nmarket. Yet the only thing we hear is the Norquist blacklist. They are \ngoing to blacklist certain people from having access to this \nadministration if they deign to speak on behalf of consumers and \naverage people. That sort of thing is totally unacceptable. It is an \nethic we should not accept from either political party in this Nation.\n  I ask the Senator from California if she has heard the same thing \nfrom responsible business leaders in her State.\n  Mrs. BOXER. There is no doubt about it. They are embarrassed by what \nhas happened--the corporate executives who take home millions and \nmillions of dollars and then do not pay their taxes, corporate \nexecutives who do not care about their employees and destroy not only \ntheir employees' jobs but their pensions. It is a moment in our history \nwhere they are looking to us for leadership.\n  The way I tie it into the environment and health and safety is this: \nI showed on the floor the environmental record for 2001. This is the \nrecord for 2002. Each week, there is another plan to weaken \nenvironmental laws and protect the people. It is a terrible message to \ncorporate America.\n\n[[Page S5322]]\n\n  This chart shows the EPA budget. They eliminated the budget for \ngraduate student research in the environmental sciences.\n  Look at enforcement. Good businesses welcome enforcement. If you are \ndoing it right and the enforcers come in, you are in good shape. They \ncut it back, and the bad apples do not get caught.\n  Look at air quality, nuclear waste, endangered species, mining public \nlands, something my colleague is involved in, oil and gas drilling, \nurban sprawl.\n  This administration zeroed out the funding for urban parks. I would \nlove my friend to comment on this point: 70 percent of our people live \nwithin reach of an urban park. Unbelievably, 2 weeks ago the \nadministration sent out a press release bragging about all the grants \nthey made from last year's money, not mentioning in this press release \nthey have now zeroed out the funding for urban parks.\n  This lack of caring for the people of this country, as I see it, in \nterms of the environment and this kind of a record set a poor example \nfor everyone, for business leaders. If business leaders see this \nadministration does not really care, when it comes to the environment, \nabout the health and safety of the people, what is the subtle message \nto a corporate executive? I guess: I don't have to care. I guess the \nbottom line is my profit.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from California to reflect on this. It \nis not as if this administration cannot find money. When it comes to \ntax breaks for the wealthiest people in our country, they can find \nplenty of money. When it comes to an urban park--which is what many \nworking families look forward to on a Sunday afternoon, whether it is \nin San Francisco, Los Angeles, or Chicago, a place to go with your \nfamily and enjoy yourself on Sunday afternoon--the administration says \nwe cannot afford urban parks but we can afford a tax break so that the \nmultimillionaires in this country can go to private clubs and can enjoy \na lifestyle that involves a lot of privacy.\n  For the average working-class family, their lifestyle involves fun \nperhaps on a Sunday afternoon on the Lake Michigan shoreline or going \nto an urban park in and around the city of Chicago.\n  It really is a choice. It is not as if the Bush administration is \nsaying there is just no money for anything. They found money when it \ncame to tax breaks for the wealthiest people in America. When it comes \nto putting money into America to protect our environment, to protect \nfor prescription drugs under Medicare, for a tax deduction for college \neducation expenses, to give a tax break to small businesses to offer \nhealth insurance, this administration cannot see it. It casts a blind \neye.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The point is the message it is sending, subtle or not so \nsubtle, to corporate America, about what is important. There is a \nrelationship between the two.\n  This chart shows the clean water rule. The administration reverses a \n25-year-old Clean Water Act rule that flatly prohibits disposal of \nmining and other industrial wastes into the Nation's waters. The EPA \nissued new regulations making it legal for coal companies to dump fill \nmaterial--dirt, rock, and waste--from mountaintops, moving mining into \nrivers, streams, lakes, and wetlands.\n  My point is, if this administration that is charged with protecting \nthe environment, as we are, is so callous about the quality of the \nwater for the people of this country, the not so subtle message to \ncorporate America is: People don't matter that much; just make your \nprofit because we really don't care.\n  It is stunning. That is why I am glad my friend was here. This \nconnection between this record, which I think is so unmindful of the \nneeds of the American people, does translate over to short-term \nthinking in corporate America, to thinking that it really is not \nimportant to care about the environment, your people, or their health \nand their welfare reform.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Did we not go through this same debate on the energy bill \na few weeks ago? The Senator and I were coming to the floor and saying, \nif you want to lessen America's dependence on foreign oil, if you want \nmore energy security, take a look at the No. 1 consumer of oil in this \ncountry--the cars and trucks we drive. Have more fuel efficiency and \nfuel economy. Forty-six percent of the oil we import goes into our cars \nand trucks. A number of Members came to the floor and said let's \nimprove fuel economy of cars and trucks in America to lessen our \ndependence on foreign oil. The corporate interests came in and said no, \nno change, no improvement.\n  What it means is, we passed an energy bill which fails to address the \nmost basic element of developing energy security, energy independence, \nand a cleaner environment for America. It literally has been 17 years \nsince we improved the fuel economy of cars and trucks. When we look at \nthis, time and again, it is corporate irresponsibility that turns its \nback on the environment and energy security for this country.\n  As the Senator from California has pointed out, this is a pattern \nwhich is emerging through this administration. Instead of leading us \ntoward more responsible conduct, as individuals, as families, and as \nbusinesses, they are turning their back on corporate responsibility.\n  I think it all comes together. I think the environmental issue plays \ninto the energy issue and, frankly, the vote we had on the floor where, \n67 to 32, the Senate rejected improving fuel efficiency in cars and \ntrucks across America was a shameful vote. It is a vote which, frankly, \nwe are going to have to answer for decades to come.\n  I ask the Senator from California, whose State has led when it comes \nto fuel standards and clean air and fuel efficiency, whether she \nbelieves this is all part of the same issue?\n  (Ms. STABENOW assumed the chair.)\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, it is. It is short-term thinking. It \nis not good for this country. If you want to talk about patriotism, the \nmost patriotic thing you can do, it seems to me, is drive a car that \ndoesn't use all that foreign oil. It is very hard to get such a car, an \nAmerican car particularly.\n  It is interesting my friend raised this because he is right. The \nSenate was weak on this, shamefully weak. But we did not get any help \nfrom Vice President Cheney when, on June 18, 2001, he announced to \nGeneral Motors executives that the Bush administration has no plans to \npursue higher fuel efficiency standards. That set the tone.\n  When this administration came in, many of us did say there were so \nmany ties to energy, so many ties to oil companies, that we were very \nworried. But some of us thought maybe, because of that, the \nadministration would bend over backwards to be fair, to lean on this \nissue. We were sorely disappointed.\n  If one could sit down and really think it through, we are talking \nabout a very unwise strategy on the part of this administration to not \nlook ahead, to not plan for the future, to not care about your \ngrandchildren or my grandchildren having the opportunity to see the \nbeauty of this country; to not worry that much if the quality of the \nair goes down or the quality of the water; to convince yourself the \nenvironmental laws are a burden on industry. That is disproven and \nuntrue.\n  My friend talks about California. We have been the leader on \nenvironmental protection. We have found when you clean up the \nenvironment you create jobs. There has been study after study. One of \nour best exports happens to be environmental technologies. So by \nturning away from a clean and healthy environment as a goal to help our \npeople, you are also blocking a very important piece of our economy, a \nplace where we are way ahead.\n  I remember when the wall fell in eastern Europe, one of my friends \nwho went there said: The trouble is, now you can actually see the air. \nThey had not done anything about air pollution.\n  I know my friend is leaving. I am about to end what I am saying. But \nI thank him so much for tying together this horrific anti-environmental \nrecord, the anti-environmental record of this administration, to the \nwhole issue of corporate greed, of corporate irresponsibility. We are \nseeing more and more of the big corporations really turning their back \non the people they are supposed to serve, frankly--their customers; the \npeople they are supposed to help, their employees; their shareholders, \njust using this very shortsighted type of reasoning that this \nadministration uses, which is get it all now and don't worry about the \nfuture.\n\n[[Page S5323]]\n\n  If you take the issue of CO2 emissions, we had a President \nwho promised that, although he was against Kyoto, he would come up with \na plan to cut those emissions back. That is the problem that causes \nglobal warming. I don't know of any respected scientists today who say \nglobal warming is not a dreadful problem. What it could do to our \nagricultural products, what it could do to our Nation, what it would \nmean for the world, is devastating.\n  It is not a question of panicking about it. It is a question of doing \nsomething about it. It is not that hard to do, if we set our mind to \nit.\n  This administration's Environmental Protection Agency sent a report \nto the United Nations where they admitted, yes, there is global warming \nand, yes, it is caused by human beings, and, yes, it is bad. Now this \nadministration, this President, is backing away from his own \nadministration, what they said. He said: Gee, I really don't agree with \nthat ``bureaucracy.''\n  I don't get it. This is his Environmental Protection Agency. And the \nthrust of the report, even though it admitted there were problems, \nbasically said there are these problems but we have to learn to live \nwith them.\n  I do not understand why people go into Government, would join the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, would run for President or the Senate \nor the House to say: ``You know, it's a problem.'' And throw up their \nhands.\n  That is not what we are about. Our job is to find solutions to \nproblems, to lay those problems out. I know the Senator who is in the \nChair is taking the lead in finding solutions to the problem of the \nhigh cost of prescription drugs, not only for our seniors but for all \nof our citizens. She is working long and hard on that, day in and day \nout, and with her leadership and that of others in the Senate, we are \ngoing to come up with a good plan.\n  I know our leader, Tom Daschle, is going to come up with a very good \nplan that we can all back, on all fronts, dealing with Medicare but \nalso dealing with the pricing of prescription drugs.\n  You could throw up your hands and just say, ``Isn't this awful, \nprices are going up,'' and walk away. Why would we deserve to be here \nif we took that attitude? Why do we deserve to be here if we do not \nprotect people's health--by getting them prescription drugs, but also \npreventing the health problems that you get when you have dirty air and \nwater and high levels of arsenic and high levels of lead in children's \nblood.\n  It is one thing to react at the end of it when they have these \nillnesses. We need these pharmaceuticals. It is another thing to \nprevent these problems because many come from a very unhealthy \nenvironment.\n  I am sorry to say that this administration's record in 2001--and \nlet's show 2002--an average of once a week, coming up with an anti-\nenvironmental rule, rolling back a pro-environmental, prohealth rule. \nThis record is shameful. I think it is only because we have been so \nfocused, as we have to be, on other issues, that we have not, as \nAmericans, stood up to say this is a terrible circumstance.\n  I will show the Superfund. I will leave with that one more time, to \nshow the number of sites they are cutting back on the Superfund. \nRemember, in California 40 percent of Californians live within 4 miles \nof a Superfund site. I am sure, Madam President, if you examine the \nSuperfund sites in your State--you have many, as unfortunately many of \nus do, and we will give the exact number later--you will see what is \nhappening. There is a walking away from the responsibility to clean up \nthese sites, which means these sites will remain very dangerous.\n  We have a site in New Jersey that has become infamous because the \nwildlife there is turning bright colors from the dioxin that is in the \nsoil, the arsenic that is in the soil, the dangerous chemicals that are \nin the soil. The EPA will not tell us, Madam President, from which of \nyour sites they are walking away. We are trying desperately to get the \ninformation.\n  Senator Jeffords, who is a man of tremendous patience, I can tell \nyou, started trying to get the information in March. We sent a letter \nand said that we now see you promised to clean up 75 sites. Now you say \nit is only 47. That is down from 87 sites under the last \nadministration. Tell us, pray tell, which sites are you abandoning? Our \npeople have a right to know. It impacts their lives; it impacts the \nlives of their children; it impacts the property values in the \ncommunity. Just tell us which sites you are not going to clean up.\n  We found in the hearing we held that, in fact, a message went out to \nall the employees at EPA not to talk to anyone. Don't tell Senators \nwhich sites are off the list; don't tell newspapers; refer all the \ncalls to our communications people.\n  The penchant for secrecy in this administration is growing to be \nalarming. We couldn't find out who sat in on Vice President Cheney's \nmeeting when they drew up this energy bill. We had to go to court to \nfind out. Now we know. It was the special interests that wrote that. We \nknow what happens then.\n  That is not the kind of America we want. We want an America where \neveryone sits around the table--people from the environmental \ncommunity, people from the business community, people from the labor \ncommunity, people from the management community. That is the way we are \ngoing to have an America that works for everyone--not when we leave out \npeople with whom we don't agree.\n  I represent a State which is very diverse in thinking. We go from \nvery liberal to very conservative and everything in between. If I just \nsat with the people who voted for me, that would be a huge mistake for \nme; plus, it would be unfair and wrong.\n  We need to sit with people with whom we don't always agree. That is \nwhy this Norquist blacklist is so upsetting, as Senator Durbin said. If \nwe put a little X on the forehead of people who do not agree with us, \nand we put them on a blacklist and we never talk to them, what kind of \nAmerica is this going to be? It is going to be an extremist America--an \nAmerica that doesn't reflect the values of the American people.\n  One of the values of the American people is a clean and healthy \nenvironment. I hope people will educate themselves to the fact that we \ncannot find out which Superfund sites are not going to be cleaned. I \nhope people will understand the danger they face if this continues.\n  I pledge today to continue to come to the Chamber to talk about this \nenvironmental issue, to fight for the Superfund Program, and to fight \nfor clean air and clean water. We are going to take this case to the \nAmerican people.\n  I thank the Chair very much. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time controlled by the majority has \nexpired. The remaining time until 10:45 is controlled by the minority \nleader.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. THOMAS.

Madam President, we always have different kinds of things \nto talk about and issues that are before us. That is our job, of \ncourse, to deal with the issues. There is no end to the number of \nissues that come here. We focus on them, as we should. In addition to \nthat, however, it seems to me that it is appropriate from time to time \nthat we focus a little bit on the appropriate role of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  What is the appropriate role of Government spending? I understand the \npressures that come from wanting to do something about every problem, \npartly because we do want to do something about every problem, and \npartly because of the politics of it. Now we find ourselves getting \nmore and more into the kind of setting, a kind of culture, if you \nplease, where, as the Federal Government continues to grow, every issue \nthat arises--at whatever the level--the first request is let us get\n\n[[Page S5324]]\n\nthe Federal Government involved; let us get some money from the Federal \nGovernment; let us get some programs from the Federal Government. So \ncontinuously we get larger.\n  If you walk down the street and ask in general terms if you think the \nFederal Government ought to be larger, if you think it ought to be less \nlarge, if the issues ought to be considered more close to the people \nwhere they have more input at the State and local level, the answer is \nyes.\n  I believe we need to stand back from time to time and take a look at \nwhat we are doing in terms of the future, and maybe try to get some \nvision of where we want to be in the next 10 years or 15 years.\n  What do we want our society to look like in terms of government? Do \nwe want a national government for everyone? I don't think so. That is \nnot what we are. This is the United States of America. We are a \nfederation of States. The Federal Government's role is fairly well \ndefined in the Constitution, and those things not there are to be left \nto the States. But we move the other way.\n  I am not anti-Federal Government. I think there is obviously a very \nserious role for the Federal Government. One of them we are exercising \nnow is defense. That, obviously, is a Federal role, and one that we \nshould and are pursuing.\n  But take a look at all the things we are in. Take a look at all of \nthe little things in the supplemental budget which we passed last week, \nand tell me that those are Federal responsibilities--all of those \nlittle items in there that we are funding. I am sorry, they are clearly \nnot.\n  It seems to me that we have to take a look at the concept. I think \nsome of the things we are looking at now are very important. One of \nthem is Medicare. Obviously, Medicare is a Federal program. But we need \nto take a look at it and see where it is going over time to be other \nthan just patching here or patching there or putting a little more \nmoney in there, and then come to the Chamber and complain about not \nhaving enough money. But we never seem to look at where we might be.\n  I am a little frustrated at the feeding frenzy at the public trough \nof the Federal Government that we have been engaged in over the past \nseveral decades. As a matter of fact, I think that is going to be more \ndifficult as we go forward.\n  First of all, of course, we need to debate and pass a responsible \nbipartisan budget resolution. To most people, the budget means you have \na budget which hopefully you can stay within. If you can't, you can't. \nIt means more than that here. A budget, of course, is some limitation \non what you are spending. That is what your plan is, and that is what \nyou are doing. But, in addition to that, there are some restraints that \ncan be used here on the floor of the Senate.\n\n  If an appropriations or spending bill goes beyond the budget that we \nhave established, then it becomes more difficult. You have to have more \nvotes to pass it.\n  It is a very important thing. Here we are without one, I think, for \nthe first time in 27 years. Certainly, we need one. We need to take a \nlong look at some of these appropriations bills that are coming up. We \nneed to do that very soon. We will be talking about hundreds of \nbillions of dollars in expenditures.\n  Of course, we should be helping to strengthen education. What is the \nrole of the Federal Government in education? Now it contributes about 7 \npercent to elementary secondary education--most of it in special \neducation. But we continue to look there for more and more money. There \nare all kinds of recommendations to do that.\n  I think one of the interesting ones that I run into--and the \nPresiding Officer does as well--in terms of the Finance Committee is \ntaxes, tax changes, tax credits--tax this and tax that. Every day \nsomething comes up that someone wants to give a tax credit for some \ncertain kind of behavior. Then the next day we come to the Chamber and \nsay the tax system is too complicated. It is complicated because every \nday we use it more to affect behavior than we do for raising money. \nThere is just no end to it. Let us give a tax credit to do this or give \na tax credit to do that or we will give a tax credit to help build \nsmall communities or give a tax credit for charitable giving or \nwhatever, all of which on their face are nice ideas. But if you step \nback and say what the role of the Federal Government is in that, then I \nthink maybe you would have to take a closer look at what is really \nhappening. It is one that I believe is very important.\n  There is constitutional direction, as I mentioned. Some people \ninterpret that in different ways. But, nevertheless, it does indicate \nthat there is a limit to what the Federal Government should do. I don't \nknow. I suppose different States have different things. A good deal of \nWyoming belongs to the Federal Government. So one of the things I hear \nthe most is there is too much Government regulation--Federal \nregulations that impact everybody--probably more than anything else.\n\n  The Senator from California was talking about environmental \nrestrictions. That is all I hear--an excessive amount of non-use \nrestrictions on public property--and the idea that you don't have \naccess to the Federal lands that belong to the people. The access, \nobviously, ought to be limited so that you preserve the environment. \nBut the idea that you have to have roadless areas so you cannot access \nthe property, the idea you cannot go to Yellowstone Park in a snow \nmachine, even though the snow machine can probably be made cleaner than \nan automobile--these kinds of things are constantly there. At the same \ntime, we want the Federal Government to get bigger, with more \nregulations. It is quite a frustrating thing. I know it is difficult, \nbut we need to take a look at really where we want to be.\n  Last summer in Wyoming, I had a series of meetings, two in almost \nevery county; we called it Vision 20/20. We asked people to share with \nus what they saw in the future for their families, their town, their \ncounty, and their State. It was interesting. Of course, it was \ndifferent in different parts of the State, but several things were \npretty unanimous. It would be fun to have this body sit down for a day \nand say: What do you see as the role of the Federal Government? What do \nyou see the Senate doing in terms of spending, in terms of programs 15 \nyears from now? Do we want to continue to spend the way we have over \nthe last several years? If so, what would be the totals?\n  A couple years ago, we tried pretty much to have some limitations and \nheld the general budget to about 3 percent, which was basically \ninflation. This year, notwithstanding terrorism and the necessary \nemergency spending, it is probably 8 percent--probably more than that, \nclose to a 10-percent increase in Government spending.\n  Of course, we will hear from our friends on the other side of the \naisle that the problem is because of tax reductions. I don't agree with \nthat. Tax reductions are necessary when you have a slow economy, to get \nthings going. Tax reductions help us plan to see the kind of Federal \nGovernment we really want--perhaps one with a smaller role--and \nidentifying those things that are clearly the role and responsibility \nof the Federal Government; perhaps reducing Federal taxes so locals can \nhave more taxes, to do with it what they want.\n  One of the things I think most of us, I suppose from every State, \nwork on more than anything else is what a bill or a proposal means in \nterms of our States. For instance, health care. I come from a rural \nState. Health care delivery in Wyoming is quite different than it is in \nNew York City, so a Federal program that is designed for metropolitan \nareas doesn't fit at all. There has to be enough flexibility. The same \nis true with education and most everything else we do. But we don't \nalways give that flexibility. So we find ourselves with programs \ndesigned to go nationwide which don't fit nationwide. Yet because we \nconstantly have these Federal programs going, it is most difficult.\n  I mentioned to you that we are always saying we need to simplify \ntaxes. Yet we use them to affect behavior more than almost anything. \nThe size of the Government continues to grow. We worked very hard last \nyear to get the bill passed that required agencies to look at their \nactivities, and those that are not totally governmental could be put \nout into the private sector for private contracting. I think it is an \nexcellent idea to try to keep the Government as small as possible. Some \nof our\n\n[[Page S5325]]\n\nfolks are opposed to that idea; they want more and more Government and \nmore and more Government employees. Those things that are not certified \nGovernment things ought to be dealt with in the private sector.\n\n  So I know these are general comments and you don't have an answer for \nall these issues, but there is a frustration that builds as you go \nthrough everything we look at every day, and more and more bills being \ntalked about.\n  As an example, we are going to have hearings this afternoon on the \nPark Subcommittee, which I used to chair. I love parks. But there need \nto be some criteria as to what a national park should be. Failing \nhaving criteria, what they say in every community that has an area they \nwould like to develop and set aside is, let's get the Federal \nGovernment to take it over and let it be some kind of a Federal park. \nIt is not a Federal park just by its definition. But I understand when \nwe are working for something in our States--some call it pork, and some \ncall it other things, but it doesn't matter--we don't look at the broad \npicture, we just look at that. It is difficult.\n  So I am hopeful we can take a long look at what we are doing and, as \nopposed to simply dedicating ourselves to an election in 2002--to which \nI think you will find many of these things are very related--let's take \na little longer look at where we are going to be. That is really our \njob for the future. These young pages sitting here, where are they \ngoing to be 20 years from now? We have some responsibility to look at \nthat. I think it is a very strong responsibility.\n  So I hope we can put our emphasis a little more on our responsibility \nas the Federal Government, how we can best do that, what it means in \nthe future, how we can help build the strength of local and State \ngovernments so that it will be close to the people and the people can \nindeed have a real role in what is being managed in their area.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, as I understand it, the time between \nnow and 11:45 a.m. is equally divided, and at 11:45 a.m., we will vote \non the cloture motion on the hate crimes legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Under the previous order, the Senate will now resume consideration of \nS. 625, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 625) to provide Federal assistance to States and \n     local jurisdictions to prosecute hate crimes, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Hatch amendment No. 3824, to amend the penalty section to \n     include the possibility of the death penalty.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I wish to briefly review where we are \non this issue involving releasing the other arm of the Federal \nGovernment to fight hate crimes.\n  This is an issue that has been before the Congress since 1997. We \nreported the legislation out of the committee in 1999. It is the year \n2002, and we still, in this body and in the House of Representatives, \nhave been unwilling, unable to pass legislation that is going to permit \nthe Federal Government to fight terrorism at home. That is what hate \ncrimes are all about.\n  I am always surprised that we are unable to break the logjams. This \nlegislation has been before the Senate. We voted on this legislation \nabout a year ago as an amendment to the Defense authorization bill. The \nvote was 57 to 42.\n  So we had strong bipartisan support for that legislation. Then we get \nto the conference and the Republican leadership in the House of \nRepresentatives said no.\n  What we really need is to have the legislation passed free and clear, \nmeaning no amendments attached to the legislation, in spite of the fact \nthat 232 Members of the House of Representatives, Republicans and \nDemocrats, understood as well that we ought to be fighting hate and \nterror at home. That is what this is all about, whether we are going to \ndeal with the insidious hate crimes that continue to exist in this \ncountry and which, in too many instances, are not prosecuted.\n  We have the strong support of those in the law enforcement area. \nTwenty-two State attorneys general support it; 175 law enforcement, \ncivil rights, civic, and religious organizations; and 500 diverse \nreligious leaders from across the Nation.\n  We have to ask ourselves: Why are we really being blocked from \npermitting the Senate to address an issue which we have already \naddressed and which is in great need at home? And that is the hate \ncrime issue.\n  It is an outrage that Congress continues to be AWOL in the fight \nagainst hate crimes. Hate crimes are terrorist acts. They are modern-\nday lynchings designed to intimidate and terrorize whole communities.\n  Our Attorney General in this past year has said:\n\n       Just as the United States will pursue, prosecute and punish \n     terrorists who attack America out of hatred for what we \n     believe, we will pursue, prosecute and punish those who \n     attack law abiding Americans out of hatred for who they are. \n     Hatred is the enemy of justice, regardless of its source.\n\n  In the same speech:\n\n       Criminal acts of hate run counter to what is best in \n     America, our belief in equality and freedom. The Department \n     of Justice will aggressively investigate, prosecute and \n     punish criminal acts of violence and vigilantism motivated by \n     hate and intolerance.\n       Our message this morning is unambiguous and clear. The \n     volatile poisonous mixture of hatred and violence will not go \n     unchallenged in the American system of justice.\n\n  That is what this legislation is all about, to try to make sure we \nare going to prosecute these acts of violence that are based upon \nbigotry and hatred and that affect not only the individuals who are \ninvolved but also affect the whole community.\n  Many of us thought, after September 11 and after the extraordinary \nloss of lives, after the extraordinary acts of heroism, there was a new \nspirit in America. I believe that to be so. I think it is true. It is \nreflected in so many different areas. We are reaching out to understand \nour communities. We are reaching out to understand our neighbors and \nfriends. We have a strong understanding that America, in many respects, \nis closer, bonded together in order to try to resist the acts of terror \nthat are at home but also understand the values which are important to \neach other.\n  Within that spirit, it is amazing to me that we as a country are so \nprepared to assault those cells of hatred as they exist in other parts \nof the world and refuse to address them at home. That is what this \nlegislation is really all about. That is why we need this legislation. \nIt is very simple.\n  I see my friend and colleague. I reserve the remainder of my time, \nand I yield such time as he may consume to the Senator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, each day I have detailed in the \nSenate Record another hate crime. Again, these are always violent, they \nare always sickening, but they always happen to an American citizen. \nThese citizens are not different from you and me. They are Americans. \nThey may be black, they may be gay, they may be disabled, female or of \nMiddle Eastern descent, and yet they are all Americans. We are all, in \nthat important aspect, the same.\n  I will detail a heinous crime that occurred in the State of Oregon in \n1995. I have spoken about this horrible crime before in this Chamber. A \n27-year-old Stockton, CA, man murdered a Medford, OR, couple: Roxanne \nEllis, 53, and Michelle Abdill, 42. The women, who ran a property \nmanagement business together, disappeared on December 4, 1995, after \nshowing a man an apartment for rent. He shot them both in the head. The \nbodies were left bound and gagged in the truck bed. The Stockton man \nlater confessed, saying he had targeted the women because they were \nlesbians, and he figured they would not have families that would miss \nthem.\n  I believe the government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them\n\n[[Page S5326]]\n\nagainst the harm that comes out of hate. The Local Law Enforcement \nEnhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become substantive. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation we can change hearts and we \ncan change minds.\n  I have noted, starting Friday, continuing most of the day Monday and \ntoday as well, that the opponents of this bill, I think, truly have an \nargument against the larger category of hate crimes. Their argument \nshould not be the inclusion of these new categories of Americans whose \nminority subjects them to greater vulnerability. This is easy to \ndemonstrate in crime statistics. An argument can be made that hate \ncrimes are inappropriate, that all crime is hateful. This is an \nargument that has been made many times and in several cases that have \nreached the U.S. Supreme Court, but the Supreme Court has upheld the \ncategory of hate crimes.\n  So the question for us then becomes: Why not extend them to new \ncategories of Americans who are demonstrably more vulnerable to crime? \nI argue once again that we should vote in the affirmative to include \nthese new categories. I call on my colleagues to support it.\n  I have heard many arguments being propounded as to why we should not \nproceed. I believe we should proceed. I believe we should invoke \ncloture and get on with a final vote on this bill.\n  I will say, in defense of my colleagues, particularly our Republican \nleader, Trent Lott, in the rare case when he would invoke cloture early \non a bill, he was roundly criticized by our friends on the other side. \nI wish cloture had not been invoked as quickly in this case so we might \nhave a better chance of winning this vote. I say to my colleagues, this \nmay be their only vote. I am given to understand that this bill will be \npulled down if cloture is not invoked, and I think that is a very \nunfortunate development, because the time to do this is now, and the \ntime to have effectively argued this is beginning Friday, Monday, \ntoday, and this week.\n  So I will be very disappointed, as one who has been present each of \nthese days making this case, if this bill is pulled down because \ncloture is not invoked.\n  There may well be some good ideas that could be brought forward, but \nI think personally it is easy to distinguish between the meritorious \narguments that can be made, such as some that Senator Hatch has been \nmaking, versus those that are designed to create political TV ads and \nto pull down this bill. It takes courage in the Senate to push the \ncase, to make the case, and to stay with the case until this body has \nhad time to work its will, but I fear that may not be allowed to occur \nnow, which I regret. I wish more Senators had come the last 3 days to \nargue on the merits of this bill.\n  Every day I have entered a hate crime in the Congressional Record to \ndemonstrate the need for this legislation. If by having a hate crimes \nlaw that covered James Byrd, the Federal Government was able to be \nhelpful to the officials of Texas, why not have a hate crimes law that \ncould have helped the police officers of Wyoming to pursue and \nprosecute the case against Matthew Shepard? This is about permitting \nthe Federal Government to show up to work. This is about the Federal \nGovernment standing with the American people and saying, as to these \nvalues, as to opposing crimes so horrible and callous, we will stand \nunited with law enforcement at every level, locally and federally.\n\n  This is not an effort on the part of the Federal Government to \nsubvert State law or local police processes. This is an ability to \nenhance them, to backstop them, to make sure we get the job done. It is \na law that is 30 years old. It is a law that ought to be expanded \nbecause of our experience. It is a law that we ought to vote on in its \nfinal form when this week's work comes to an end.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I am happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator makes a very good point that Congress went \non record 32 years ago that we were going to have a Justice Department \nthat was going to prosecute hate crimes. We have addressed that \nparticular issue. We have made the decision.\n  During the more than 30 years since the current hate crimes law was \npassed, the Federal Government on average, has prosecuted only four \nhate crimes per year. By working cooperatively, state and federal law \nenforcement officials have the best chance of bringing the perpetrators \nof hate crimes swiftly to justice.\n  Now, as the Senator points out, another frequent argument we hear \nagainst the hate crimes bill. Opponents argue that the law is \nunnecessary because these crimes already are prosecuted at the State \nlevel. In the past thirty years, Congress has enacted dozens of federal \ndrug and gun laws that criminalize conduct that already is illegal \nunder state law. We didn't pass these laws because States were failing \nto their job, but rather because we believed that the Federal \ngovernment had an important role to play in helping States combat \nviolent crime. Our motivation in passing the hate crimes bill is no \ndifferent.\n  The most important benefit of both state and federal criminal \njurisdiction is the ability of state and federal law enforcement \nofficials to work together as partners in the investigation and \nprosecution of serious hate crimes. When federal jurisdiction has \nexisted in the limited areas authorized by current law, the federal \ngovernment's resources, forensic expertise, and experience in the \nidentification and proof of hate-based motivations have often provided \nvaluable investigative assistance to local authorities without usurping \nthe traditional role of states in prosecuting crimes.\n  We made a judgment, and even though there were State laws, we were \ngoing to pass this because there was an important interest in doing it.\n  Can the Senator find anything more important than trying to attack \nthe basic core, the bias and hatred that motivates people to commit \nthese crimes and make sure that we have a Justice Department that will \nbe able to fight this with both arms, rather than one arm tied behind \nits back?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I agree with the Senator. We are in a war on \nterrorism in this world. It is entirely appropriate to focus on the war \non terrorism at home. President Bush has proposed a more seamless \nprocess by which we backstop as a Federal Government local and State \npolice and all law enforcement in our ability to protect the American \npeople.\n  I believe government should help Americans as it finds them. Where \nthere is a clearly demonstrated need, particularly as to gays and \nlesbians, we should show up to help. I believe the Senator would agree \nwith me that in the case of James Byrd, where this African-American \nbrother was dragged to death in a hate crime, the Federal Government, \nbecause the statute permits the category of race, was helpful. It did \nnot subvert the local pursuit and prosecution of the murderers of James \nByrd. We backstopped it. We brought the good offices and the resources \nand the expertise to be helpful to Texas in that case.\n\n  Come with me to Wyoming, sir, and you will talk to officers that \nintroduced themselves to me as Republican police officers. They did not \nneed to identity their party but their point to this Republican Senator \nwas that this is not a partisan issue. They could have used the help. \nThis became a case that so consumed Laramie, WY, that their limited \nresources were simply exhausted by one case. They would love to have \nhad the Federal Government show up to work but the Federal Government \nwas statutorily prohibited from coming to help.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask the Senator one additional question, and we will \nhold our time with the agreement of the Senator to have the last 10 \nminutes. Does the Senator believe the Federal Government has less of an \ninterest in combating hate violence against gays and lesbians than hate \nviolence based on race?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. It has the same interest in defending the \nAmerican people regardless of their minority, their race, religion, \ntheir culture, their sexual orientation, their disability, their \nagenda.\n  It seems to me the government's business is not to pick between who \namong its citizens it will defend, but\n\n[[Page S5327]]\n\nthat under the banner of equal protection and due process we defend all \ncitizens. As our founding documents make clear, we are created equally.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator makes a point on race, religion, on gender, \nsexual orientation, on disability. This legislation goes to the core of \nthe bias and hatred and addresses that. It gives the Justice Department \nthe tools to be able to prosecute those. I thank the Senator.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 11 minutes remaining and the other \nside has 2 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, last Friday, immediately after calling up \nS. 625, the hate crimes bill, the Democratic leadership filed for \ncloture, I believe within 15 minutes after they called it up.\n  No one is filibustering this bill. In fact, there have only been 20 \namendments filed to be considered.\n  I expected this bill to be debated. We hoped the minority or anyone \nin the majority, who so chooses, who wants to try to modify this bill \nand make it better, would have the opportunity to do so. We all know, \nif cloture is invoked, for the most part, all we can do is make motions \nto strike. Almost everything will be held to be nongermane and \ntherefore not debatable, unless we get a supermajority to overcome the \npoint of order.\n  All we are asking is for our side to be given an opportunity to \npresent amendments that may improve this bill.\n  It is astonishing to me that cloture would be filed on a bill of this \nmagnitude, a bill that has been hotly contested for very legitimate \nreasons, basically for the purpose of foreclosing any amendments on one \nside, including my substitute amendment, which I think almost anyone \nwould have to admit is a reasonable amendment. I don't know whether it \nwould be accepted as a substitute or not, but it ought to at least be \ndebated and voted up or down.\n  I filed an amendment yesterday that preserves the death penalty as an \noption in hate crime cases. It seems to me that is an option we would \nnot want to deny law enforcement. One would think you would want to \ngive them that additional prosecutorial tool in hate crime cases that \nresult in death of the victim.\n  We can cite countless cases where, because of the threat of the death \npenalty, because it is a statutory option, people have pled guilty, \naccepted life imprisonment, and the matter was solved prior to trial, \nwhich preserves judicial resources.\n  We also know, that when the death penalty is an option, in many cases \nlaw enforcement officials can break down one of the conspirators to \nplead guilty and to become a witness, and an effective witness at that, \nagainst the other perpetrators of the heinous murders.\n  But, if this bill passes, it specifically excludes the death penalty. \nIt specifically takes away those powers of the Federal Government as a \ntool to resolve some of these matters.\n  As everybody knows, I am not a big fan of the death penalty. I think \nit should be used very, very narrowly and only under the most stringent \nof circumstances. I think it is too widely used today. But it at least \nought to be an option that a prosecutor can use to obtain confessions, \ncooperation from witnesses and, of course, use as a penalty for those \nwho commit really heinous crimes that are proven beyond a reasonable \ndoubt.\n  On Friday, immediately after calling up S. 625, the Democratic bill, \nthe Democratic leadership immediately filed for cloture, as though \nanybody wants to filibuster this. I doubt seriously that all 20 \namendments would be called up, but with a limited amount of amendments \nwe could finish this bill by Thursday, 2 days from now.\n  It is an important bill. Everybody admits it. Why would you foreclose \nto me, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, the right to \ndebate an effective substitute that may improve this bill and at least \nhave a vote so those who agree with me can have their vote.\n  I point out to my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts that it \nwas he and I who passed the Hate Crimes Statistics Act in the early \n1990s. I was the Republican Senator who came forward and helped to get \nthat done.\n  This bill has proved effective in showing there are hate crimes in \nour society. We know that if the two of us got together, along with the \ndistinguished Senator from Oregon, we could probably resolve the \nconflicts so we would not have to wait another 5 or 6 years to have \nhate crimes legislation pass. But, no, there is no desire to try to \nresolve these matters. There is a desire to invoke cloture, cut off \nbasically all effective debate and all amendments including the \namendment of the ranking member, cut off the amendment with regard to \nimposing or at least requiring the death penalty, and any number of \nother relevant amendments. For what? Because they want this bill at all \ncosts, when they know that the House leadership will not accept it \nwithout further amendment.\n  So it makes you wonder if this is not done primarily for political \nreasons instead of working together to try to come up with legislation \nthat literally would work to resolve these problems.\n  I agree with the distinguished Senator from Oregon. There is no \nexcuse for anybody to abuse, mutilate, kill, or otherwise commit \nviolent conduct against anybody in our society, let alone gays and \nlesbians. I do not think that is justified, that anybody could get away \nwith that. And we ought to do whatever we can to stop it.\n  The fact remains that State and local law enforcement are dealing \nwith the problem. We have challenged the other sides to give us \nexamples, if they know any, where local law enforcement, local \nprosecution has not done the job. I am sure they may be able to come up \nwith a few isolated examples, but I have not heard any yet.\n  We have had only 1 day of debate on this very important subject \nyesterday, and it was only a matter of a couple of hours. This is a \nbill that seeks completely to overhaul and vastly expand the role of \nthe Federal Government in law enforcement. The attempt to prematurely \ncut off debate on a bill of this magnitude makes a mockery of the role \nof the Senate as a deliberative body.\n  If the distinguished Senator from Oregon is correct, if cloture is \nnot invoked today--and I do not believe it should be--that this bill \nwill be brought down, that would be a travesty because we could pass \nthis bill by Thursday. There is not a soul in this body who is \nfilibustering this bill, as far as I know. It just makes a mockery of \nthe Senate as a deliberative body. I think the rush to ward off \namendments can only lead to the conclusion it was done for sole purpose \nof thwarting any meaningful debate and avoiding some tough amendments \nbecause there is a wide disparity of viewpoint here with regard to the \ndeath penalty. But even if you are against the death penalty, you ought \nto realize the efficacy of having it there as a threat to criminals \nagainst hate crimes--yes, against gays and lesbians, to select that \ncategory--they might have to suffer the ultimate penalty because of \nwhat they have done.\n\n  In most cases the death penalty will not be imposed, but it will be \nused to obtain confessions, pleas, and cooperation from witnesses.\n  Again, I want to talk about the television show Law and Order. \nAlthough it is a fictional show, it really does portray how law \nenforcement uses the death penalty to obtain cooperation and \nconfessions, to get people to testify against others, including their \ncoconspirators. If you really want to do something about hate crimes, \nlet's do it the right way and do it by amendment, amending this bill so \nthe House will have to consider it. They are not going to accept this \nbill in its current form and Senator Kennedy knows that. I know that. \nThe distinguished Senator from Oregon knows that.\n  I think Senator Kennedy would agree with me that this bill deserves \nmore than a single day of debate--or I should say 2 hours or so \nyesterday--before Senators are precluded from filing amendments.\n  I agree wholeheartedly that Senator Kennedy's bill, S. 625, is an \nimportant piece of legislation and should be given consideration in the \nSenate.\n  In the past I, too, have introduced legislation addressing hate \ncrimes and I intend to offer a viable substitute amendment.\n  As someone who has remained interested in this issue, as Senator \nKennedy\n\n[[Page S5328]]\n\nis and I am, I believe at a minimum I should have the opportunity to \noffer amendments relative to the discussion of hate crimes and to this \nbill. This opportunity, of course, can only be ensured if today's \ncloture vote fails and the leadership then agrees to work this out. \nLet's get a time agreement. Let's have limited amendments, and I think \nwe can get our side to agree to that.\n  I believe my amendments will in fact improve this bill as it reads \ncurrently. Moreover, I believe the majority of my colleagues not only \nwant to consider my amendments but would also approve my amendments. \nProtecting the safety and rights of all Americans is the paramount \nconcern to all Senators. To not have a vote on the death penalty? For \nthe first time, remove that as a consideration in these tough cases? If \nyou really want to do something about hate crimes you ought at least to \nhave the death penalty on the books.\n  There are, however, many differing thoughts about how to best provide \nthe protection. No one is threatening to filibuster this bill. Relying \non unsubstantiated rumors of machinations to file numerous irrelevant \namendments is insufficient justification to cut off debate. The fact \nis, only 20 amendments were filed yesterday.\n  My colleagues and I are trying to engage in a sincere debate on this \nissue that affects all Americans. It is curious to me why the Senate \nDemocrats are trying to block a substantive debate on hate crimes. By \npreventing relevant amendments from being offered and considered, the \nDemocrats are shutting the door on any Republican ideas or \nalternatives, however constructive they may be. At least we should be \nentitled to a vote on a limited number of amendments. We could agree to \nthat. Every Senator has the right to consider, thoughtfully, \nlegislation that will have a significant impact on the way serious \ncrimes are prosecuted in this country. By filing for cloture \nprematurely, the leadership is denying all Senators the right to debate \nand have a vote on issues that are important to them and the \nconstituents of their States. Simply stated, it is wrong to foreclose \ndebate on this very important bill.\n  I ask the Democratic leadership to rethink their strategy and \nunreasonable position. I strongly urge Senators to oppose cloture on \nthis bill. I agree with my colleague from Massachusetts, every hate \ncrime is a tragic reflection on our society and we need to address the \nproblem. But no one has made the case to me that the local authorities \nare not effectively prosecuting these cases. We have asked them to. I \nbelieve the proper role of the Federal Government is to assist, not \nsupplant, local law enforcement authorities. That is the approach I \nhave taken in my alternative, which will not even be able to be \nconsidered if cloture is invoked today.\n  Let me just take a moment to review some of these cases that we have \nbeen talking about. Take the Roxanne Ellis and Michelle Abdill case \nhere. This is the one that the distinguished Senator from Oregon, if I \nremember correctly, was referring to. Roxanne Ellis and Michelle \nAbdill. The defendant was Robert Acremant, the jurisdiction was Oregon. \nAcremant, shot Ellis and Abdill, a homosexual couple, to death as they \nlay gagged in the back of his truck--truly a heinous, vicious, \nreprehensible act.\n  What happened to this defendant? Was he let go because the Federal \nlaw enforcement authorities and prosecutors did not have this hate \ncrimes bill? Not at all. The local law enforcement brought him to trial \nand he received--guess what--the death penalty. That doesn't sound to \nme like he is getting away with a hate crime.\n  Let's go down through a few more. James Byrd--we have heard a lot of \nabout James Byrd and we ought to hear a lot about it. It was a \nterrible, heinous act that was committed in Texas by three defendants, \nLawrence Russell Brewer, John William King, Shawn Allen Berry.\n  They beat Mr. Byrd, an African-American, unconscious. They chained \nhim to the back of a pickup truck and dragged him for miles down rural \nroads. That is what all three of these heinous criminals did. What \nhappened to them? Let me tell you. Because the death penalty was \navailable, Shawn Allen Berry pled guilty and became a witness against \nthe other two, who both received the death penalty. That doesn't sound \nto me like the Federal Government was needed in that case.\n  The fact of the matter is, the State and local officials said: Enough \nis enough. We are not going to tolerate this kind of activity, this \ntype of action. The death penalty, because it was available for these \ncrimes--a defendant pled guilty and was sentenced to life in prison \nwithout parole. The other two defendants received the death penalty. \nAll we ask is that we be permitted to offer my substitute amendment \nwhich preserves the death penalty. I can't imagine that amendment would \nfail on this bill and it would improve this bill by leaps and bounds.\n  Matthew Shepard, we have heard a lot of talk about Matthew Shepard \nand yes, State prosecutors and law enforcement, who believe, as we do, \nthat hate crimes should be prosecuted. In the Shepard case, the two \ndefendants were Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson. They kidnapped \nShepard, a homosexual college student, beat him so severely that his \nskull was fractured a half dozen times, tied him to a fence post and \nleft him to die. The defendant Henderson drove the truck into which \nShepard, a homosexual college student was lured, helped tie him to a \nfence--and at least stood by while Shepard was beaten senseless.\n  What happened? Henderson pled guilty in order to avoid the death \npenalty. He was sentenced to two consecutive life terms with no \npossibility of parole. Aaron McKinney was sentenced to two consecutive \nlife terms. He avoided the death penalty by agreeing not to appeal the \nlife sentences. Had the death penalty not been there, who knows what \nwould have happened? I think they had the defendants dead to rights, \nbut it certainly did help in both of these cases to have the death \npenalty available.\n\n  Another case involved the homosexual couple, Gary Matson and Winfield \nMowder. The defendants, Benjamin Williams and James Williams, shot Mr. \nMatson and Mr. Mowder to death. The death penalty was available and the \nprosecution is ongoing in both cases.\n  In another Texas case, the defendant Mark Stroman was tried for \nshooting Vasudev Patel, an Indian man, after 9/11, because Stroman \nthought Patel looked middle eastern. The local officials prosecuted the \ncase and he received the death penalty.\n  In the case of Sasezley Richardson, an African-American, Jason Powell \nand Alex Witmer fired 12 shots at him in an attempt to ``earn'' a \nspider web tattoo from the Aryan brotherhood. The defendant Witmer \ndrove the truck from which Powell fired 12 shoot at Richardson. Because \nthe death penalty was available, Powell pled guilty and testified for \nthe State in order to avoid the death penalty. He was sentenced to life \nin prison without parole. In the case of Alex Witmer, the death penalty \nwas available, and he pled guilty and was sentenced to 85 years in \nprison. What if that death penalty had not been available? Who knows \nwhether they could have convinced one defendant to testify against the \nother.\n  The next chart begins with the case of Amanda Milan, who was stabbed \nto death for being a transgender woman. The defendants in this case \nwere Duayne McCuller and Eugene Celestine in New York.\n  In this case Eugene Celestine gave McCuller the knife with which to \nkill Milan. The prosecution is currently ongoing, and both are facing \nthe possibility of life in prison.\n  In another case, the victim, Billy Jack Gaither was bludgeoned to \ndeath because he was homosexual. The two defendants, Mullins and \nButler, attacked Gaither with an ax handle, slit his throat, threw him \non the top of a pile of tires, and set him on fire.\n  Because the death penalty was available, Mullins pled guilty prior to \ntrial and was sentenced to life in prison without parole. Butler was \nsentenced to life in prison without parole only because the victim's \nparents requested that the prosecution not seek the death penalty. But \nbecause it was available, they were able to bring these cases to \nconclusion and these two heinous criminals were sentenced to life \nbecause neither wanted to go through a trial where they knew they could \nget the death penalty. By obtaining pleas prior to trial, the \nprosecutors saved scarce taxpayer dollars.\n\n[[Page S5329]]\n\n  In a Virginia case, Danny Lee Overstreet, was killed by the \ndefendant, Ronald E. Gay when Gay went on a shooting rampage in a gay \nbar, killing Overstreet and wounding six others. Because the death \npenalty was available, he was sentenced to four life terms.\n  I have a lot of empathy for those on the other side of this issue at \nthis time who want to pass legislation to address some of these hate \ncrimes. They would like to give the Federal Government more authority. \nI am not against that. But I would like to have a bill that will pass \nboth Houses. I would like to have a bill that will go to work tomorrow, \nor the next day, or 2 months from now, when it passes both Houses and \nis signed by the President, which will really do something about these \ncrimes. I want a bill where there is a threat of the death penalty so \nwe can get pleas and save the taxpayers' money.\n\n  Frankly, these cases are important cases. In almost every case that \nthe proponents of this piece of legislation bring up--in almost every \ncase--the State and local law enforcement--in fact, in every case, to \nmy knowledge--they have done the job. My substitute amendment would \ngive them the tools, the money, and so forth to do the job even better.\n  I would like the opportunity as ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee to be able to offer some amendments that should have votes. \nIf I lose, I lose. If I win, I win. But the fact of the matter is that \nwe ought to at least have this opportunity to debate it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  With regard to the procedure, there have been two occasions when the \nmajority leader has requested that we have a debate on this legislation \nand have relevant amendments. That process and that procedure were \nobjected to by the other side.\n  First of all, during the more than 30 years that the existing hate \ncrimes statute has been on the books, the federal government has never \ntried a hate crime case in which it sought the death penalty. There is \nnothing in our bill that prohibits a State with the death penalty from \nseeking that punishment if the State decides to prosecute the hate \ncrime. The fact remains that nothing in our bill would allow the \nfederal government to take jurisdiction away from a State that wants to \nprosecute a hate crime and seek the death penalty.\n  It is interesting. During this debate, we know exactly what our \nsituation is. If you talk about race, national origin, and religion, \nthey are protected, if they fall within the six categories. But sexual \norientation is not. Disability is not protected. Neither is gender. \nEven in the amendment offered by the Senator from Utah, he excludes \ngender. The Republican leadership of the House of Representatives will \nnot take protection of sexual orientation. Those are the facts. \nSometime, some day, we have to deal with the realities.\n\n  This has been out there for 5 years. We have the support of 22 \nattorneys general. We have the support of the former Attorney General \nof the United States, Dick Thornburgh, who understands the importance \nof this legislation. There is a need out there. You are not going to \nget that kind of inclusion, those kinds of protections, in terms of \ngender, under the amendment of the Senator from Utah, and you will not \nget it under the Republican leadership.\n  Those are the facts. We have the list of the amendments. We have an \nanti-abortion amendment by the Senator from Pennsylvania here. Relevant \namendments. The list goes on. The leader asked for the ability to do \nthat. At some time we have to take action.\n  We know what this is really all about. We have had this for 5 years. \nWe passed it 57 to 42 last year and were denied the opportunity to get \nthis out of the conference because of the Republican leadership in the \nHouse.\n  The real question is, Are we going to take the action now? How long \ndo people have to wait to get this protection? They have waited 5 \nyears. We have a lot of pious statements here about the need for \nprotection for American citizens on the basis of sexual orientation and \ndisability and gender. Yet we refuse to address it or pass it.\n  That is the question and the issue. It is domestic terrorism. These \nare crimes based upon hate and prejudice that ruin not only the \nindividual but the community and the Nation. That is what we are \ntalking about. Trying to dismiss this as routine kinds of \ninvestigations isn't what this is about. The Senator from Utah \nunderstands that. That is the question--whether we are going to be \nprepared to take those steps to provide the limited but extremely \nimportant opportunity to make sure we are going to do something.\n  How about sending a message to those people out there in terms of the \npotential of hate-motivated crimes? We sent them a message when we \npassed the church burning legislation. We sent a powerful message, and \nthat virtually stopped. How about doing the same thing with regard to \nhate crimes because of sexual orientation or gender or disability? What \nis the other side scared of?\n  They say we are going to federalize another thing. Well, they found \n37 other provisions they are glad to federalize, but not this kind of \nprotection.\n  As the Senator from Oregon said, this protection is rooted in animus, \nthe basic hatred that motivates these kinds of crimes. The question is, \nAre we going to do something about it?\n  This is the time. Twice Republicans rejected the opportunity for \ndebate on relevant amendments. We know what is happening. This is the \nvote. This is the time. We want to make it very clear, and I am hopeful \nthat we get cloture. If we do not, I want to give the assurance to the \nSenator from Utah that we are going to be back again and again.\n  So have no fear about not addressing this issue because this is just \nthe beginning, and we are going to continue the battle through this \nsession.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have heard all this rhetoric before. We \nhave been working on this for 5 years. The distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts knows that we put together some of the most important \nlegislation in history--he and I. He knows darn well that this bill \nisn't going anywhere if it passes in its current form. He knows darn \nwell that it sounds good to make all these political points, but I \nwould like to pass something. I would like to do something. I would \nlike to have something that works. I am willing to do it in a Federal \nway.\n  The Senator seems to be saying, take his viewpoint about this or take \nnothing, which is what we have done for the last 5 or 6 years. He knows \ndarn well that I will work on the bill with him. We have discussed this \nin private.\n  I don't like what is going on in our society any better than he does, \nbut I challenge him to show me where State and local law enforcement \nare not doing the job. Explain to me why he would not have the death \npenalty to help law enforcement and the prosecutors to obtain pleas, \ncooperation from witnesses, and to have witnesses testify against their \ncoconspirators, which conserves judicial resources.\n  He says that if the States want to prosecute hate crimes, they can \nseek the death penalty. The fact is, we are taking these matters away \nfrom the States and saying the Federal Government ought to prosecute \nthese crimes where there will be no death penalty. I feel embarrassed \nto have to talk about the death penalty because I am not real enthused \nabout it. I don't want it applied, except in the most stringent of \ncircumstances. There has to be absolute guilt, and the crime has to be \nso heinous as to justify it.\n  Look, I would be willing to put sexual orientation in my bill. I \ndon't want every rape to be considered a federal hate crime. I don't \nwant every criminal sexual act to be considered a federal hate crime, \nleading to the possibility of being brought before the Federal courts. \nOn the other hand, I am certainly willing to talk about compromises.\n  The charts we just went through show that the criminals are being \nprosecuted. The crimes against gays and lesbians are being prosecuted. \nState and local law enforcement are bringing the appropriate \nprosecutions. The distinguished Senator said ``let's send a\n\n[[Page S5330]]\n\nmessage through this legislation'' if nothing more. I would like to do \nthat. I would like to get a bill that we can pass. I would like to get \na bill that the House will accept--instead of accusing the House of not \nhaving the same interests at heart than the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  No one is arguing that hate crimes are not a problem. We have never \ndenied that hate crimes are occurring. Nobody can deny that. I want to \nget rid of them as much as anybody. No one feels more strongly on this \nissue than I do, whether they support S. 625 or not. No one--least of \nall me--is suggesting that hate crimes are not a problem, or that we as \nan institution should stand by and do nothing about hate crimes. That \nis why I intend to offer an amendment to S. 625 that provides an \nalternative approach to helping in the fight against hate crimes. I am \nwilling to sit down with the Senator and see if we can work out \nsomething that will pass both bodies. The tremendous record of State \nand local prosecutions of hate crimes suggest to me, however, that \nStates are doing a great job policing these types of cases.\n  In my view, a measured, appropriate, and constitutional Federal \nresponse should be directed at helping States that ask for our \nassistance. Nobody is arguing that existing Federal law is adequate. No \none contends that we should rest on the existing Federal hate crimes \nstatute. We can all agree that the Federal Government should do more \nthan what 18 U.S.C. 245 currently provides.\n  That is why I will offer an amendment to S. 625 that provides for an \nalternative approach to help in the fight against hate crimes. The \nrecord is clear. I have always been open to fixing 18 U.S.C. section \n245 through amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time controlled by the Senator from Utah \nhas expired.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the amendment \noffered by my colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, to amend the penalty \nsection of this bill to include the possibility of a death sentence.\n  This amendment is a step in the wrong direction.\n  Let me be clear. Those who commit crimes, including acts of violence \nthat are motivated by hate, should be punished and punished severely. \nFederal law enforcement has an important role to ensure that hate \ncrimes are investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the \nlaw. And if death results from a hate crime, Senator Kennedy's bill \nprovides for the full weight of the law to be brought to bear on that \nindividual. It does so by providing for a maximum sentence of life in \nprison without the possibility of parole.\n  At a time when Americans are increasingly recognizing that the \ncurrent death penalty system is broken, this is not the time to expand \nthe Federal death penalty.\n  We know that justice should be blind. But, unfortunately, in the \nFederal death penalty system, it appears that justice is not always \nblind. A report released by the Justice Department in September 2000 \nshowed troubling racial and geographic disparities in the \nadministration of the Federal death penalty. The color of a defendant's \nskin or the Federal district in which the prosecution takes place can \naffect whether a defendant lives or dies in the Federal system. Former \nAttorney General Janet Reno ordered a further analysis of why these \ndisparities exist. And Attorney General Ashcroft has agreed to continue \nthis study.\n  We have not yet seen the results of this study, nor have we had the \nopportunity to review and understand what the results might mean for \nthe fairness and integrity of our Federal justice system. While this \nimportant study is underway, Congress should not create even more \ndeath-eligible crimes.\n  I also strongly disagree with Senator Hatch's claim that the \navailability of the death penalty ensures efficient and reliable \nprosecution and conviction of those who commit hate crimes.\n  We know that levying death has an immensely coercive effect on the \naccused. The accused who wants to live and does not have the resources \nto mount a ``dream team'' defense may feel little choice but to accept \nwhatever deal for less than death that the prosecution offers. This can \nhappen in situations where the accused is less culpable than other \ndefendants, or worse yet, innocent of the charges altogether.\n  I am very troubled by the practice of some prosecutors who may use \nthe prospect of the death penalty to coerce a defendant, including a \ndefendant who may be innocent, to accept guilt and a plea bargain.\n  A case involving defense representation from my state illustrates how \nthis coercive tactic undermines the integrity of the justice system. It \ninvolves Christopher Ochoa, who confessed to a rape and murder out of \nfear of facing the death penalty in Texas. Mr. Ochoa was released a \nlittle over a year ago after serving 12 years of a life term in Texas. \nMr. Ochoa won his freedom as a result of the persistence, hard work, \nand skill of students and professors at the Innocence Project at the \nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison Law School.\n  According to the Wisconsin State Journal, police arrived to question \nMr. Ochoa in November 1988. Mr. Ochoa, who was 22 years old at the \ntime, was ``harangued with grisly details of the crime, many of them \nfalse. A burly sergeant told him he would be `fresh meat' in prison, \npounded tables and demonstrated where the death needle would pierce his \narm. Ochoa confessed.'' In a forum at the University of Wisconsin after \nhe was released, he said, ``I don't think people can say what they \nwould have done until they're in that situation.'' He said, \n``Basically, I was terrified.''\n  The Federal system is not immune from the use of this coercive tactic \nor the other flaws that result in the risk of executing the innocent in \nthe state systems. According to the Federal Death Penalty Resource \nCounsel Project, since the death penalty was re-enacted in 1988, \napproximately 3 percent of persons the Justice Department has attempted \nto execute may have been factually or legally innocent.\n  In one case, David Ronald Chandler claimed his innocence throughout \nthe trial and the appellate process. Chandler believes that the real \ntriggerman made a deal with the government to testify against Chandler, \nand in return the government would not seek the Federal death penalty \nagainst the triggerman. But the triggerman later recanted his \ntestimony. Luckily for Chandler, President Clinton commuted his death \nsentence to life. But how many other defendants who have claims of \ninnocence will not be so lucky, or feel forced to accept a life \nsentence? I don't know the answer to that question. None of us do. And \nthat is why a thorough, top-to-bottom review of the death penalty \nsystem at the State and Federal levels is needed.\n  Until such a comprehensive review has been undertaken, and the \nnecessary work has been done to ensure fairness and justice, Congress \nshould refrain from expanding the Federal death penalty. Congress can \nensure that perpetrators of crime are effectively punished without \nresorting to capital punishment.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing Senator Hatch's \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use leader time to make my remarks \nthis morning.\n  I appreciate the debate we have had on this issue now for the last \ncouple of days. I am struck by a couple of issues. First, I am struck \nby the number of hate crimes that occur every day. We are told there \nare over 20 hate crimes committed in the United States every day--every \nday. The Southern Poverty Law Center estimates the real number may be \n50,000 a year. That comes out to five an hour.\n  In the time we have had the debate just this morning, according to \nthose statistics, 15 to 20 hate crimes have been committed in this \ncountry--in just the time the Senate has been in session this morning.\n  If there is such a good job being done across this country as we deal \nwith that volume, I would not be able to say that with any authority \nthis morning, but the volume is there. That leads me to the second \npoint.\n  The second point is that behind each one of those statistics is a \nhuman being, a face, a story, a tragedy. That is, in essence, what this \ndebate is all about--to end the tragedy in this country.\n  As I consider the options we have available to us legislatively, I \nconsider\n\n[[Page S5331]]\n\nthose options as they must have existed during the civil rights debates \nof the fifties and sixties, and I am sure when we considered the civil \nrights issues in the fifties and sixties there were all kinds of \nreasons it was not the time to deal with civil rights laws; it was not \nthe time to come to closure on how to address the rampant racism that \nexisted in the country at that time.\n  Finally, it took leadership, it took resolve, it took bipartisan \nconsensus and, ultimately, it took a willingness to commit to a bill. \nWe passed the civil rights acts of the fifties and sixties, and today \nwe are the better for it.\n\n  Who today would say we are going to repeal those laws? They have been \non the books, they have worked, and we take credit for the fact they \nhave.\n  This is our moment when it comes to hate crimes. This is our time to \ntell the Matthew Shepards of the world that we are not going to \ntolerate that anymore; that we are better than that; we are bigger than \nthat.\n  Just as we addressed racism in the past, we have to address the \nprejudice against sexual orientation today. This is our chance. This is \nour moment. This is our Civil Rights Act for the year 2002. We are not \ngoing to have many more. Let's seize this opportunity. Let's seize this \nmoment. Let's send a clear message. Let's end those terrible \nstatistics. We can do it when we vote on cloture in a matter of moments \nthis morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield myself time under my leader time \nthat has been reserved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The leader has that right.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do not intend to get into the details now \nand a discussion on the substance of the bill except to say this: The \ngreatest hate crime of all that we should be dealing with right now is \nthe hate crime of terrorism against America and free and innocent \npeoples all over the world who have been attacked by terrorists--3,000 \napproximately killed on 1 day, September 11. There is where our focus \nshould be.\n  I am disappointed at the timing of this legislation, to say the \nleast. We should be focused on the war on terror. We should be taking \nup the Defense authorization bill. We should have already taken it up. \nNormally we deal with the Defense authorization bill in May; certainly \nthe early part of June. Now it appears to me there will be no way to \nget to the Defense authorization bill before probably next Tuesday at \nthe earliest, and maybe later. Until we do that, we cannot begin on the \nregular appropriations bills, the first of which should be the Defense \nappropriations bill. We need to make sure our men and women in uniform \nand our law enforcement officials all over this country and all over \nthe world who are fighting against this hate crime, terrorism, have \nwhat they need in terms of pay, quality of life, weapons, and \nsophisticated equipment they need to do the job.\n  While, obviously, this issue can be scheduled at some point--and I \nassume it will be scheduled--it certainly is one in which there is not \nan emergency facing us right now. I wanted to raise that point.\n  We do not even have a budget resolution. We are 2 months behind \ngetting a budget resolution this year. It is just being ignored: No \nbudget resolution. No 2003 numbers to which we have agreed. No \npolicies. No enforcement mechanisms. How are we going to do the \nappropriations bills? What possible restraint can be provided for the \nranking members and the chairmen of the subcommittees on \nappropriations?\n  The law requires we do the budget resolution by April 15. We do not \nhave it. We do not know when we are going to have it. Apparently, we \nare never going to have it.\n  The Defense authorization bill was reported out of the committee May \n15. While there were votes against it, it was a bipartisan vote. What \nis the problem? There is obviously a weapons system that is causing \nsome consternation. Sooner or later we are going to have to address \nthat issue--sooner rather than later, I hope.\n  With regard to this particular issue, I know how tough it is being \nmajority leader and dealing with protracted debate and amendments. We \nsaw last week what happens when we have a prematurely filed cloture \nmotion. Tactically, one may think: I have to do it because I have to \nbring this to a conclusion.\n  We saw last Thursday night what happens when cloture is invoked and \nwe cut off debate and amendments. Unless it is very tightly germane, it \nis not in order. So at midnight last Thursday night, we were trying to \nfigure out how do we conclude the supplemental appropriations bill, \nagain, for defense and homeland security. Amendments were being knocked \nout right and left, probably amendments that were worthy and should \nhave been taken but were not germane.\n  We are about to do that here. We made the mistake last week, and now \nwe are about to make the mistake again this week. We are going to cut \noff amendments. As a matter of fact, a substitute amendment by the \nranking member of the committee of jurisdiction, Senator Hatch, would \nbe nongermane postcloture. It is not a question of trying to stop \nunrelated amendments. This is an amendment that even deals with the \nsubstance of the issue. Why are we doing that?\n  I used to file cloture motions perhaps prematurely, and I was royally \npilloried by the other side of the aisle: Why did you file a cloture \nmotion so prematurely? You shouldn't do that.\n  Most of the time I realized it was probably a mistake, and on \noccasion, I backed off and we vitiated the cloture vote.\n  Even at the beginning of the last Congress when it was 50-50, under \nS. Res. 8, the organizing resolution, we agreed specifically in the \nrule that cloture motions could not be filed before 12 hours of debate \nhad taken place. When the majority changed, that rule went by the \nboard, but the principle was there. Why was it good when we were 50-50 \nbut not good when it is 50-49 and 1? This is not partisan. I have made \nthis mistake. I think it is a mistake. We should not do this.\n  This cloture motion was filed after 12 minutes, not 12 hours. This \nbill was called up and within 12 minutes a cloture motion was filed. \nThis is not the way to do business. We are prepared to debate this \nissue, consider legitimate, substantive amendments, and any other \namendment for certainly a reasonable period of time. This is cutting \noff members of committees of jurisdiction. This is cutting off all \nSenators. It is a mistake. We made the mistake last week. We should not \nmake the mistake now.\n  On my side of the aisle, it would be a message that we are not going \nto prematurely cut off debate. Give it a little time. It works on both \nsides of the aisle. I urge my colleagues to vote against this cloture \nmotion. Let's have some amendments offered. Let's spend some time \nmaking sure we do not get ourselves trapped in the same situation we \ndid last Thursday night, which was not pretty for this institution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts controls the \ntime.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the Senator from Minnesota 2 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I disagree with my colleague, the minority leader. It \nis always an emergency when brutal crimes are committed against people \nbecause of their sexual orientation or gender or because of disability.\n  I think it is an emergency for our country when someone such as \nMatthew Shepard is brutally murdered. I think it is an emergency for \nour country when what we say to people is not just that they are a \nvictim or that we dehumanize people but, rather, we say to many \ncitizens in our country, by gender or sexual orientation, because they \nare a gay or because they are a lesbian, they are next. Hate crimes \nviolate not only our Constitution but they destroy our oneness as a \npeople. They diminish us as a country. They take away from what is best \nin our Nation.\n  I insist, as a Senator from Minnesota, that this is an emergency and \nthat we should pass this legislation and that this legislation must not \nbe blocked. If it were your loved one who had been murdered, if it were \nyour\n\n[[Page S5332]]\n\nloved one who were a target of these hate crimes, you would consider it \nan emergency and you would want us to pass this very important \nlegislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act of 2001, and my \ndisappointment that the Senate failed to invoke cloture on this \nimportant legislation today. As a cosponsor of Senator Kennedy's bill, \nI believe it is crucial that we pass hate crimes legislation in an \nexpeditious manner in order to provide the government with the tools it \nneeds to prosecute the many senseless bias-motivated crimes that occur \nin our country each year. In the past several decades we have made \nsignificant progress in reducing discrimination, yet more needs to be \ndone. This legislation is an important step toward ending the scourge \nof hate crimes that continues to plague our Nation.\n  Data gathered under the Federal Hate Crime Statistics Act about the \nprevalence of these crimes is sobering. Beginning in 1991, the Act \nrequires the Justice Department to collect information from law \nenforcement agencies across the country on crimes motivated by a \nvictim's race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity. Congress \nexpanded the Act in 1994 to also require the collection of data for \ncrimes based upon the victim's disability. For the year 2000, 11,690 \nlaw enforcement agencies in 48 states and the District of Columbia \nreported 8,063 bias-motivated criminal incidents (8,055 single-bias and \n8 multiple-bias incidents) to the FBI. The incidents consisted of 9,430 \nseparate offenses, 9,924 victims, and 7,530 distinguishable offenders. \nAccording to the data collected, 53.8 percent of the 8,055 single-bias \nincidents were motivated by racial bias, 18.3 percent by religious \nbias, 16.1 percent by sexual-orientation bias, 11.3 percent by \nethnicity/national origin bias, and 0.5 percent by disability and \nmultiple biases.\n  The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act is carefully tailored to \nensure a state's ability to prosecute hate crimes, but it provides the \nFederal government with additional tools to prosecute hate crimes \nshould a state be unable to do so. The legislation extends the Federal \nlaw to prohibit hate crimes against victims because of their gender, \nsexual orientation or disability. In addition, the legislation allows \nFederal prosecution of hate crimes wherever they occur and under \nwhatever circumstances, thus broadening the previous requirement that \nthe hate crime occur while the victim is engaged in a ``federally \nprotected activity.''\n  The need for these limited changes in existing Federal hate crimes \nlaws is clear. For example, according to the Justice Department, 16.1 \npercent of the hate crimes committed in 2000 were motivated by the \nvictim's sexual orientation. The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act \nwould expand the definition of hate crimes to include those committed \nbecause of the victim's sexual orientation--in addition to a victim's \ngender or disability.\n  A hate crime may meet the federal definition of ``hate crime'' yet \nthe federal government is still powerless to aid in its prosecution. \nFor example, in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11th, \nour Nation has struggled to prevent discrimination and acts of violence \nagainst Arab-Americans. Despite the resolve that most Americans have \nshown in that regard, tragically, crimes have occurred. On September \n15, 2001, Balbir Singh Sodhi, a Sikh-American, was shot and killed at \nhis gas station in Mesa, Arizona. This tragic incident was the most \nserious of several attacks against people of Middle Eastern and South \nAsian descent who were targeted in the aftermath of the terrorist \nattacks. Although religion and national identity are already protected \nunder current law, the hate crimes legislation before us would give the \nFederal government enhanced authority to investigate and prosecute \nthese types of crimes.\n  Despite the progress towards ending discrimination over the past \ndecades, it is undeniably clear that raw hatred and its tragic \nconsequences continue to exist in our Nation. Strengthening the Federal \ngovernment's ability to prosecute hate crimes is an important step \ntowards the eradication of hate crimes in our country. Mr. President, I \nurge my Senate colleagues to bring the Local Law Enforcement \nEnhancement Act back to the floor of the Senate and to join me in \nsupporting this important hate crimes legislation. We have an \ninvaluable opportunity to make a statement that the United States \ngovernment will not tolerate crimes motivated by bigotry and prejudice, \nand I look forward to the day when there is no longer a need in our \nNation to legislate such changes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nexpress my strong support of the Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001, the \n``Hate Crimes Act.'' The Hate Crimes Act is a bill whose time has come. \nI would like to commend Senator Kennedy for his long, hard work to pass \nthis important legislation, and I am happy to have the opportunity to \nvote for it today.\n  The Hate Crimes Act creates an intergovernmental assistance program \nwhich would provide technical, forensic, prosecutorial and other forms \nof assistance to state and local law enforcement officials for hate \ncrimes based on race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual \norientation and disability. The bill authorizes the Justice Department \nto award grants of up to $100,000 to state, local, and Indian law \nenforcement officials who have incurred extraordinary expenses \nassociated with investigating and prosecuting hate crimes. This \nlegislation requires grant applicants to coordinate with affected \ncommunity groups, schools, and colleges and universities. In addition, \nthis bill gives the Justice Department jurisdiction over crimes of \nviolence involving bodily injury, if motivated by a person's actual or \nperceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual \norientation, or disability, if it meets both the interstate commerce \nand certification requirements in the underlying statute. Lastly, the \nbill amends the Hate Crimes Statistics Act to include gender and \nrequires the FBI to collect data from states on gender-based hate \ncrimes in the same manner that it currently collects data for race, \nreligion, sexual orientation, disability, and ethnicity.\n  The number of reported hate crimes has grown by almost 90 percent \nover the past decade and we cannot afford to ignore this growing \nproblem. The recent hate-motivated crimes in my state of Washington \ndemonstrate the destructive and devastating impact hate crimes have on \nindividual victims and entire communities. On May 9th, 2002, Patrick \nCunningham pled guilty to the September 13, 2001 attack of an Islamic \nIdriss Mosque in Seattle. Mr. Cunningham doused two cars with gasoline \nin the mosque parking lot in an attempt to destroy the mosque and harm \nworshipers inside. Cunningham also shot at the worshipers after being \ndiscovered. Just a few days later, on September 18, 2001, Kulwinder \nSingh, a Sikh cabdriver in Seatac, Washington, was harassed and \nphysically assaulted by a passenger.\n  This legislation takes important steps to ensure that crimes \nmotivated by the victim's race, gender, sexual orientation, disability \nor religion can be prosecuted to the full extent of the law, and it \nremoves the artificial limitations that currently keep local law \nenforcement from getting needed assistance. The Hate Crimes Act \nprovides the necessary complement between state and federal law \nenforcement officials in order to ensure that perpetrators of hate \ncrimes are brought swiftly to justice. The federal government's \nresources, forensic expertise, and experience in the identification and \nproof of hate-based motivations have often provided invaluable addition \nto the important work conducted by local investigators. One need only \nremember the brutal killing of James Byrd in Jasper County, Texas to \nunderstand the benefits of an effective hate crimes investigative \npartnership between state and federal authorities. This partnership is \nalso crucial to the work of the National Church Arson Task Force and to \nthe increase in the number of hate crimes solved by arrests and \nprosecutions.\n\n  I believe that the Hate Crimes Act is necessary to ensure that \nviolent hate crimes based on sexual orientation, gender, or disability \ndo not go unpunished. Every year, a significant number of hate crimes \nare perpetrated\n\n[[Page S5333]]\n\nacross our nation based on anti-gay bias. Current law, however, leaves \nthe federal government without the authority to work in partnership \nwith local law enforcement officials or to bring federal prosecutions \nwhen gay men or lesbians are the victims of murder or other violent \nassaults because of bias based on their sexual orientation.\n  This Act would fix the inadequacies in pre-existing federal law, \nwhich became painfully apparent in the vicious murder of Matthew \nShepard in Laramie, Wyoming, and the subsequent investigation and \nprosecution of his assailants. The lack of federal funding caused \nsignificant financial hardships on the local sheriff's department in \nits efforts to bring Matthew's killers to justice, and, as a result, \nfive law enforcement staff members were laid off. In response, this \nbill amends the criminal code to cover hate crimes based on sexual \norientation and authorizes grants for state and local programs designed \nto combat and prevent hate crimes.\n  This legislation would have a measurable impact in my state of \nWashington and help prosecute the growing string of hate-based attacks \ntargeting individuals' sexual orientation. On April 6, 1995 in Olympia, \nWashington, four young adults brutally assaulted Bill Clayton, an \nopenly bisexual high school student, and his friends who happened to be \nwalking with him. Just two months after the assault, the seventeen-\nyear-old committed suicide. Prior to his suicide he had explained to \nhis mother that he was just tired of coping, and that it was the \nconstant knowledge that any time he could be attacked because he was \nbisexual, that despite the love of his family and friends, all he could \nsee ahead of him was a lifetime of facing a world filled with hate and \nviolence, going from one assault to another. We cannot let our citizens \nlive in fear for their safety, knowing that their attackers will not be \nprosecuted to the full extent of the law. This legislation is necessary \nto fill the current void to ensure vigorous prosecution of individuals \nwho perpetrate a hate crime. The extra federal resources that this Act \nwould make available in the investigations and prosecutions of hate-\nmotivated crimes would serve as both a significant deterrent and \npunishment, and would likely bring a greater number of cases to \nsuccessful resolution through arrest and prosecution. We must do all we \ncan to prevent the incidents that led to Bill Clayton's tragic death.\n  I believe it is important that we recognize from the beginning that \nnot all crimes are hate crimes. The reason behind this is simple. All \ncrimes are not created equal and mental states, in addition to acts, \nhave always played an important role in determining the severity and \nsubsequent punishment of a crime. Recognizing this, it is well \nestablished that a legislature can properly determine that crimes \ncommitted against certain classes of individuals are different or \nwarrant a stiffer response. Moreover, the U.S. Supreme Court had \nunanimously ruled that bias-inspired conduct inflicts greater \nindividual and societal harm.\n  I share Senator Kennedy's concerns regarding hate crimes, and I have \nconsistently supported hate crimes legislation, from the time I was in \nthe Washington state House of Representatives to now. There are nearly \n8,000 hate crime incidents reported annually each year. The Hate Crimes \nAct sends a clear message that violence against a person based on skin \ncolor, sexual orientation, or religion will not be tolerated anywhere \nin this country. The bill will provide broader federal jurisdiction to \nprosecute hate crimes, including crimes motivated by race, color, \nreligion, gender, sexual orientation, and disability. Broadening \nfederal jurisdiction will allow effective prosecution even when hate \ncrimes are committed in states that lack hate crime statutes, or where \nlocal law enforcement lacks the resources for this type of prosecution. \nAdditionally, the bill will provide federal grant money to states to \nbetter enable these jurisdictions to successfully prosecute hate crime \noffenders. We cannot afford to wait any longer to pass this vital \nlegislation. Our sons and daughters, brothers and sister, mothers and \nfathers depend upon this Act to ensure full protection of their right \nto be free from hate-motivated crimes. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in \nexpressing my strong support for The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001, \nlegislation of which I am an original cosponsor.\n  Popularly known as The Hate Crimes Prevention Act, this legislation \nwould: expand current federal protections against hate crimes based on \nrace, religion, and national origin; amend the criminal code to cover \nhate crimes based on gender, sexual orientation, and disability; \nauthorize grants for State and local programs designed to combat and \nprevent hate crimes; and enable the federal government to assist State \nand local law enforcement in investigating and prosecuting hate crimes.\n  While past efforts to enact this legislation have received strong \nbipartisan support, we have not been able to get it to the President's \ndesk for his consideration. We must now work to ensure that this \nlegislation is not simply supported, but actually passed and signed \ninto law by the President.\n  In the aftermath of the tragic events of September 11th, we saw a \nterrible rise in hate crimes in the United States. California was not \nimmune to the violence.\n  In San Gabriel, CA, Adel Karas, an Egyptian-American grocer, was shot \nto death while he worked in his store. It is believed that he was a \nvictim of an attack motivated by the September 11 attacks, not a \nrobbery, because all the cash was left in his register.\n  In Palmdale, CA, a public high school found a notice threatening a \n``massacre'' to avenge the terrorist attacks, complete with the names \nof five Muslim students who would be targeted.\n  In Lancaster, CA, Gerald Pimentel, a Hispanic man, was attacked after \nhe was mistaken for being Iranian. Two men bumped his car three times \nwhile he was driving. His car was then blocked, and the men began \nyelling and running toward him. They chased him through his yard and \ninto his home. When he tried to defend his family, they beat him. \n``They'd been calling him an Iranian,'' Gerald's daughter later said. \n``I couldn't understand why. You know, my dad is not Iranian. They just \nkept hitting and hitting my dad,'' she said.\n  The FBI has investigated over 300 incidents since September 11 in \nwhich individuals perceived to be Muslim or of Middle Eastern decent \nhave been attacked or threatened because of their religion or national \norigin.\n  President Bush moved swiftly to protect Muslims and Arab-Americans \nfrom hate crimes and sent out a message that this nation will not \ntolerate such attacks against any Americans.\n  The President implored, ``In our anger and emotion, our fellow \nAmericans must treat each other with respect . . . Those who feel like \nthey can intimidate our fellow citizens to take out their anger don't \nrepresent the best of America, they represent the worst of humankind . \n. . ''\n  Attorney General John Ashcroft reiterated the President's message by \nwarning that, ``We must not descend to the level of those who \nperpetrated [September 11th] violence by targeting individuals based on \nrace, religion or national origin.''\n  Now, it is the Senate's turn to speak out. We can, and must, do more \nto prevent these types of hateful threats and acts of violence, and \npassing The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act would do just that.\n  I have seen, first-hand, the devastating impact hate crimes have on \nvictims, their families and their communities. A hate crime divides \nneighborhoods and breeds a sense of mistrust and fear within a \ncommunity.\n  I am an original cosponsor of The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement \nAct because it is aimed at protecting citizens from crimes based on \ntheir real or perceived race, ethnicity, religion, gender, disability, \nor sexual orientation.\n  The current hate crimes law simply does not go far enough. It covers \nonly crimes motivated by bias on the basis of race, color, religion or \nnational origin, and it only covers instances in which the victim was \ntargeted because he or she was engaged in a federally-protected \nactivity, such as voting, attending a public school, or if the crime \noccurred on federal property.\n  The limitations of current Federal law prevent it from reaching many \nhate crimes where individuals are\n\n[[Page S5334]]\n\nkilled or injured by just walking down the street or, in the case of \nClint Risetter, where he was sleeping in his own home.\n  On February 24, 2002, Clint Risetter awoke in his Santa Barbara \napartment engulfed in flames and then tried to escape as he was \nburning. When firefighters arrived, they found him dead on his patio. \nTwo days later, Martin Hartmann walked into the Santa Barbara Police \nDepartment and admitted to entering Clint's apartment, pouring gasoline \non him as he slept, and then setting him on fire.\n  Hartmann had known Clint for several months but had learned just \nrecently that Clint was gay. He told police about his hatred toward \ngays and how he `` . . . decided to put [Clint] out of his misery,'' \nbecause he was gay. He believed that he was doing the right thing and \nthat Clint deserved to die.\n  Clint's murder is being prosecuted as a hate crime because it took \nplace in California which has its own hate crimes law that includes \nsexual orientation. However, had it taken place in one of the 27 states \nthat do not have hate crimes laws that include sexual orientation, \nClint's family might not receive the justice they are entitled to.\n  Gay men and lesbians are the third-largest hate-crime victim group in \nthe country, the second-largest in California. They were the targets of \nmore than 16 percent, or almost 1,300, of all hate crimes in 2000. Yet, \ncurrent Federal hate crimes law does not include crimes against \nindividuals because of their real or perceived sexual orientation.\n  Current law does not extend basic civil rights protections to every \nAmerican, only to a few and under certain circumstances.\n  The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act would expand current \nFederal protections against hate crimes based on race, color, religion, \nand national origin, and amend the criminal code to cover hate crimes \nbased on gender, disability, and sexual orientation.\n  Extending the law would not provide special rights, it would ensure \nequal protection.\n  In the past, we have made some progress in the sentencing and \nprosecution of hate crimes, but more needs to be done. I am proud to \nhave sponsored The Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhancement Act which was \nsigned into law in 1994, and has just recently been invoked for the \nfirst time.\n  In 1996, Julianne Marie Williams and Laura Winans were discovered \ndead in Virginia's Shenandoah National Park, bound and gagged with \ntheir throats slit.\n  In April of this year, Attorney General John Ashcroft announced that \nThe Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhancement Act would be invoked in the \nmurder indictment against the perpetrator of this horrific crime, \nDarrell Rice, ``to ensure justice for victims of hate crimes.''\n  Rice chose his victims based on their gender and sexual orientation. \nHe even stated that he intentionally selected women to intimidate and \nassault ``because they are more vulnerable than men'' and that these \ntwo women ``deserved to die because they were lesbian whores.''\n  With this indictment, the Federal Government has recognized the \nhorrendous nature of this hate crime and that it should be prosecuted \nto the fullest extent of the law.\n  However, prosecutors were only able to use The Hate Crimes Sentencing \nEnhancement Act because the two women were killed in a national park. \nIf these murders had occurred in almost any other place in America, The \nHate Crimes Sentencing Enhancement Act could not have been invoked and, \nagain, justice might not have been ensured for the victims and their \nfamilies.\n  Enacting The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act would ensure that \nall hate crimes can be investigated and prosecuted no matter what the \nvictims are doing when they are targeted and no matter where the crime \nis perpetrated.\n  It would also significantly increase the ability of State and Federal \nlaw enforcement agencies to work together to solve and prevent hate \ncrime.\n  Until we enact this legislation, many hate crime victims and their \nfamilies may not receive the justice they deserve.\n  Those who are opposed to this legislation would say that we should \nleave it up to the states to legislate, enforce and prosecute hate \ncrimes laws.\n  To those, I would refer you to a May 3rd, 2002, New York Times \neditorial which put it best. It read:\n\n       Congress has long recognized that the Federal Government \n     should play a role in pursuing certain crimes, like bank \n     robbery, kidnapping and racketeering, where the national \n     interest is great and where federal law enforcement is in a \n     good position to offer help to local police and prosecutors. \n     Crimes in which individuals are singled out because of their \n     race, religion or membership in other protected groups strike \n     directly at this nation's commitment to equality, and are \n     worthy of this sort of special federal involvement.\n\n  Other opponents of this legislation often argue that any crime of \nviolence is a hate crime and that the motives behind and harms caused \nby a hate crime are not relevant or distinguishable from other crimes. \nI disagree.\n  The crimes perpetrated against Gerald Pimentel, Julianne Williams and \nLaura Winans, and Clint Risetter were carried out with a different \nintent and motive than other violent crimes.\n  Unfortunately, they are characteristic of many hate crimes in \nAmerica; where an attacker repeatedly beats, stabs or severely burns \nhis victim as if he is removing whatever it is he hates out of the \nperson.\n  And the attacker feels justified in doing so, as if he is doing a \ngreat service to humanity by killing the person.\n  Congress should expand the ability of the Federal Government to \ninvestigate these heinous crimes, and it should expand the ability to \nprosecute anyone who would target victims because of hate.\n  Final passage of the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act is long \noverdue. It is necessary for the safety and well being of millions of \nAmericans.\n  No American should be afraid to go to work or school because of his \nor her religion or national origin.\n  No American should be afraid to go hiking for fear of a gender-\nmotivated attack.\n  And certainly, no American should be afraid to sleep in their own \nhome because of his or her sexual orientation.\n  We have had strong bipartisan support for this legislation in the \npast, and it continues to receive bipartisan support. It now has 50 \ncosponsors in the Senate and 206 cosponsors in the House.\n  Today, I urge my colleagues to invoke cloture and vote in favor of \nthis legislation. Let us now send a message to all Americans, that we \nwill no longer turn a blind eye to hate crimes in this country.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I speak today because it is time for \nCongress to send its own message to those who would perpetrate hate \ncrimes. That message should be that Federal law will no longer tolerate \nintolerance. Hate crimes are a stain on our national greatness, and it \nis time to stop that stain from spreading.\n  Fighting hate crimes should not be a partisan issue. This is not \nabout giving preferences to one group of people or another. I am \ntalking about opposing violence. I am talking about opposing brutal \ncrimes.\n  When the fight for a hate crimes law first began in the early 1990s, \nmany Americans questioned whether the problem was serious enough to \nwarrant a specific law. But during the past decade, from one coast of \nthe United States to the other, tragic events have proven that a law is \nbadly needed.\n  These crimes are so unspeakably ugly that the names of the victims \nare seared in our minds. James Byrd, Jr., dragged to his death because \nhe was black. Matthew Shepard, beaten and left for dead because he was \ngay.\n  My home State has been wounded by hate crimes, too. Oregonians will \nnot forget Roxanne Ellis and her partner, Michelle Abdill, who were \ntaped up and shot twice in the head in the back of their own pickup \ntruck in Medford, Oregon in December 1995. Or Loni Okaruru, who was \nfound last August bludgeoned to death in a field in Washington County, \njust outside Portland. Loni was a transsexual planning to undergo \nsurgery. She had been beaten multiple times prior to that night.\n  The Senate has passed hate crimes legislation unanimously several \ntimes, only to see it jettisoned in Conference with the other body. The \nconsequences of all this legislative wrangling are\n\n[[Page S5335]]\n\nreal. Each time Congress delays, more brutal, hate-driven deaths go \nunpunished. Each time Congress delays, more hate crimes happen, because \nthe perpetrators have no fear of being punished for the true nature of \ntheir acts.\n  The legislation before this body today will close the loopholes in \nFederal hate crimes law. It will give local law enforcement the full \nforce of Federal resources in investigating and prosecuting crimes \nmotivated by bias against sexual orientation, gender or disability.\n  This legislation will not preempt State and local laws or \nauthorities. But it will provide Federal backup to important local \nefforts. Based on testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, it \nis likely that Federal help will be sought by local authorities in a \ndozen cases a year.\n  The message Congress sends in passing this bill is as important as \nthe resources that will be made available to local law enforcement. It \nis time to limit the lengths to which people can go to infect our \nsociety with diseases like racism, and homophobia, and religious \nintolerance.\n  Hate crimes are intentionally directed at victims because of who they \nare. They strike not just at a person but at the heart of a community, \nbe it a black community, a gay community, or a disabled community. And \nwhen any one group is targeted, the entire American community feels the \nblow.\n  The scourge of hate crimes must be confronted and eradicated. This \nlegislation gives Congress the means to do so. I urge my colleagues to \nvote for cloture on the bill so that it can be enacted swiftly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I understand we have 3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining. I yield 2 \nminutes to the Senator from Oregon, and I will take the last minute and \na half.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. As I contemplate the conclusion of this debate, \nmy own judgment is that it has been one of the poorer debates I have \nwitnessed in the Senate. Until this moment, there has been very little \nparticipation in it. Frankly, I find that disappointing because, as the \nSenator from Minnesota pointed out, this is an emergency.\n  I have to think of all of our gay brothers and sisters who may be \nwatching, who cannot follow the confusion of Senate procedure, who will \nbe very disappointed that once again we are thwarted from proceeding on \na matter that is, in fact, very important. This is about domestic \nterrorism and about the Federal Government showing up to work.\n  On a positive note, I say, as Senator Kennedy has said, we will be \nback and we will find another vehicle and another opportunity to \nproceed. I hope in the meantime we will reach out to Senator Hatch and \nothers who have legitimate concerns to find ways to incorporate their \nconcerns in an even better bill, and I hope we will do that in the \nspirit of the great example set in the New Testament. When confronted \nwith a woman who had committed adultery, Christ himself was able to say \nin the public square he did not condemn, he did not endorse the \nlifestyle, but he did save a life. I think we ought to do the same as \nthe Federal Government. It is in that spirit I intend to vote to invoke \ncloture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the most fundamental right we have as \ncitizens is to be able to live in a peaceful country without the fear \nof violence in our society. We have seen so many different instances \nwhere violence has come in our society based on race, religion, and \nnational origin. We have, over a period of years, tried to free \nourselves from that form of discrimination. That is what this is about: \nMaking sure that every American, regardless of their race, religion, \nnational origin, sexual orientation, disability, or gender, is going to \nhave the full support and weight of the Justice Department to ensure \nthey will be able to live in this country in peace and dignity and some \nsecurity. That should be a responsibility of the Justice Department, \nand it should be a common responsibility for all Americans.\n  That is not the state of affairs today, but this legislation will \nguarantee that. That is why it is so important. We are not prepared to \nexclude any different group. We want to include all Americans. That is \nwhy this legislation includes all of those groups. It is broadly \nsupported by the law enforcement community, 22 attorneys general, \nformer attorneys general from the United States, Republicans, and by \nvirtually all the diverse religious leaders. They understand the moral \nissues, the moral compulsion, as well as the issues of liberty that are \nincluded. I hope we would now invoke cloture.\n  So all Members know, obviously if the amendments are germane, they \nwill be considered after cloture. But let us give this message to all \nAmericans that they will live in a secure nation.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I enter a motion to reconsider the vote \nby which cloture was not invoked on S. 625, the hate crimes \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is entered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my severe \ndisappointment in the Senate's failure to invoke cloture on the Local \nLaw Enforcement Enhancement Act--also known as the\n\n[[Page S5336]]\n\nHate Crimes bill. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill, but I am \nnot proud of what the Senate did to that bill today.\n  One of the things we try to do in this Chamber, as lawmakers, is to \nadopt laws that express and encode our values as a society--to, in some \nsense, put into law our aspirations for the kind of people we want to \nbe. Clearly, one of the bedrock values, one of the fundamental values, \nof America is equality--equality of treatment before the law, equality \nof opportunity but, beyond that, a broader notion of tolerance in our \nsociety. It is part of what brought generations of immigrants to this \ncountry--the idea that they would be judged on their personal merit, \nnot on anything related to their personal status or characteristics.\n  Starting with our Declaration of Independence--our nation's \ndocumentary explication of the values underpinning our experiment in \nself-government--our country's leaders have laid out a vision of a \nnation born and bred in notions of tolerance and equality. We know for \na certainty that our nation did not live up to that vision when it was \nfirst articulated, but in each successive generation we have tried hard \nto meet the ideals we set out for ourselves. And in each successive \ngeneration we have come a bit closer to meeting that goal. Sometimes, \nobviously, we do not achieve those aspirations and we are intolerant \ntoward one another. Then the law has not only the opportunity but the \nobligation to step in and to try to create incentives or deterrents \ntoward the worst forms of intolerance, even hatred. That is what this \nbill is about.\n  Clearly, over the decades our Nation has built a strong and proud \nhistory of protecting the civil rights of Americans who are subject to \nracial, religious, gender-based, or disability-based discrimination in \nthe workplace, in housing, in life. In more recent times, many of us \nhere in the Chamber have worked to try to extend some of those \nprotections to cover discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n  This bill stands solidly in that tradition and is just one more step \non our nation's path to make its vision of itself a reality. Like the \ncivil rights laws of which we are all so proud, this bill proclaims \nthat there is certain conduct that is unacceptable to us as a nation. \nThis bill takes Federal criminal jurisdiction and extends it to the \nprosecution and punishment of those who are accused of having caused \nbodily injury or death based on an animus, a hatred that comes from \nfeelings about the victim's race, religion, nationality, gender, \ndisability, or sexual orientation. In other words, this is another way \nfor our society to express our disdain, to put it mildly, at acts of \nviolence committed based on a person's race, religion, nationality, \ngender, disability, or sexual orientation.\n  It is also a way, as is traditionally the province of criminal law, \nnot just to speak to the common moral consensus of our society about \nwhat is right and what is wrong--that, after all, is what the law is \nall about--but also by punishing those who are proven to have committed \nthe wrongs and to deter others in the future from committing those same \nacts that society generally finds abhorrent.\n  Current law expresses this but in a way that is limited. It permits \nFederal prosecutions of hate crimes resulting from death or bodily \ninjury if two conditions are met: First, the crime must be motivated by \nthe victim's race, religion, national origin, or color. Second, the \nperpetrator must have intended to prevent the victim from exercising \ncertain specific federally protected rights. Of course, I support this \nlaw and the goals that it embraces: The Federal prosecution of people \nwho inflict serious harm on others because of the color of the victim's \nskin, the sound of the victim's voice, a foreign accent, or the \nparticular place in which the victim worships God. In short, these are \ncrimes committed because the victim is different in some way from the \nperpetrator. Such crimes, I conclude, should be eligible for federal \nprosecution.\n  But the current federal law is too limited to address many of the \nhate crimes that are deserving of federal prosecution, and we need for \nthe law to more fully express some of the principles I talked about at \nthe outset: equality, tolerance, doing everything we can to stop the \nmost abhorrent acts of violence against people based on their \ncharacteristics. I think we ought to add to the list of prohibited \nbases of these crimes, crimes committed against someone because of \ngender, because of sexual orientation, and because of disability. \nAdding these categories--gender, sexual orientation, disability--seems \nto me to be an appropriate extension of the basic concept of equal \nprotection under the law. As the law now stands, it also imposes a \nrequirement, a bar to prosecution relating to race, color, religion, \nand national origin that we ought to change, which is that the law is \nonly triggered if the victim is prevented from exercising a specific \ntype of federally protected activity.\n  There are obviously crimes that are committed based on hatred that \nare triggered in cases other than the prevention of the exercise of a \nspecific federally protected activity, thus, the provision of this bill \nthat would eliminate this obstacle and, therefore, broaden the ability \nof Federal prosecutors to pursue crimes motivated by racial or \nreligious hatred. It would still, however, require prosecutors to show \na connection to interstate commerce.\n  Just as importantly for those concerned that this bill unnecessarily \nintrudes upon State prerogatives, the bill also includes language \nrequiring the Justice Department, prior to indicting a defendant for a \nhate crime, to certify not just that there is reasonable cause to \nbelieve that the crime was motivated by improper bias, but also that \nthe U.S. Attorney has consulted with local law enforcement officials \nand determined one of four things--that the state doesn't have or won't \nexercise jurisdiction to prosecute the crime, that the State has asked \nfor federal prosecution, that the State does not object to federal \nprosecution or that the State has completed its prosecution and the \nJustice Department wants to initiate a subsequent prosecution. This \nprocess ensures both that we will avoid an unnecessary overlap between \nthe exercise of State and federal jurisdiction and that those in local \nlaw enforcement, closest to the alleged crime, will have the first \nopportunity to pursue those committing these heinous crimes.\n  At the same time, it makes clear that in cases where federal \nprosecutors determine that federal prosecution is essential to \nvindicate federal values, this statute will be available to them. This \ncertification process should lay to rest the concerns some of my \ncolleagues have who fear that Federal prosecutors will interfere with \nState efforts to bring perpetrators of hate crimes to justice.\n  At a time when so much else is going on here in the Capitol with the \nhigh profile issues of this session, this bill brings us back to \nAmerica's first principles of equality and tolerance and challenges \neach of us to think about the appropriate and constructive role that \nthe law can play, understanding that the law can't control the hearts \nof people in this country.\n  Ultimately, we have to count on people's own sense of judgment and \ntolerance and, hopefully, the effect that other forces in their lives \nwill have on them to make them fair and tolerant, such as their \nfamilies, their schools, their religions, their faith. But this bill is \nhere to say in the cases when all of those other sources of good \njudgment and values in society fail to stifle the hatred that sometimes \ndoes live in people's hearts and souls, to say that this is \nunacceptable in America and to attach to that statement the sanction of \nlaw, hoping that we thereby express the higher aspirations we have for \nthis great country of ours as it continues over the generations to try \nto realize the noble ideals expressed by our founders in the \nDeclaration of Independence, but also to put clearly into the force of \nlaw the punishment that comes with law when one goes so far over the \nline to commit an act of violence based on hatred, hoping thereby that \nwe will deter such heinous acts from occurring again in the future.\n  The Senate had a chance today to bring us one step closer to making \nthe law more closely reflect our founding vision. The Senate should \nhave taken that step. It is a truly deep disappointment that it did not \ndo so. This will not, though, be our last chance. The bill's opponents \nwill not be able to hide behind procedural posturing forever. This bill \nwill come back again this\n\n[[Page S5337]]\n\nyear to the Senate and when it does, I believe that we have no choice \nbut to pass it. Our values as a nation will allow for no less.\n  I thank the distinguished Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/11/senate-section/article/S5337-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5337-S5338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    INCREASING THE PUBLIC DEBT LIMIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

INCREASE IN PUBLIC DEBT LIMIT.\n\n       Subsection (b) of section 3101 of title 31, United States \n     Code, is amended by striking ``$5,950,000,000,000'' and \n     inserting ``$6,400,000,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise today to offer my support for \nincreasing the federal debt ceiling by $450 million. This is a \ndifficult issue and I well understand that we need to raise the debt \nceiling. We have troops conducting military operations overseas. We are \nworking here at home to address critical national security needs. But \nif we hadn't acted today, the United States would have been on the \nverge of defaulting on its debt for the first time in history. This is \nunacceptable.\n  However, now that we have voted to raise our debt limit, we must \nbegin an honest and open debate about why we are having this vote. I \nwant to make it crystal clear that I believe we need to extend the \nbudget enforcement procedures and establish reasonable discretionary \nspending caps as soon as possible.\n  At the beginning of last year, the Congressional Budget Office \nprojected a ten-year surplus of $5.6 trillion and the debt ceiling \nseemed to be high enough to last through fiscal year 2008. That all \nchanged, however, as the projected big surpluses first started to \ndecline last year and then dramatically changed into a $2.7 trillion \ndeficit. We know that the current deficit is the result of last year's \ntax cut, the recession, and the tragic events of September 11, 2001.\n  One of the most important actions we can take for the nation's future \neconomic stability is to pay down the national debt. According to \nChairman of the Federal Research Board, Alan Greenspan, paying down the \nnational debt lowers interest rates and keeps the capital markets and \ninvestment going. In January, he told the Senate Budget Committee that \none of the reasons long-term rates have not come down is the sharp \ndecrease in the surplus and the diminishing prospects for paying down \nthe debt.\n  I want to make it clear that the change in our fiscal situation has \ndriven estimated federal interest costs higher: CBO has boosted its \nprojection of federal interest costs in 2002 through 2011 from just \nover $600 billion a year ago to $1.6 trillion. The dramatic downturn in \nthe federal budget will force taxpayers to pay $1.2 trillion more in \ndebt payments, money that could have been used to invest in additional \ndefense, homeland security, education, and job training.\n  Our total budget must be crafted within the need to maintain fiscal \ndiscipline, and stimulate economic growth through continued federal \ninvestment in education and job training, while also protecting the \nenvironment. Furthermore, we need to invest in our nation's economic \nfuture by making a commitment to public research and development in \nscience and technology--maintaining our status as a global leader.\n  It is a balance. We must make these investments to secure our \ncountry. But we must do so within a framework that ensures we don't \nspend beyond our means. If we want our economy to be strong, if we want \nrevenues, and if we want to make the right decisions, we need to keep \npaying down the debt.\n  Having spent time in the private sector, I can tell you this: No \nprivate sector organization thinks it can spend its way out of \nprograms; nor can we as a country. This is why I supported and \ncosponsored the Gregg-Feingold Budget Enforcement Amendment last week--\nand why I will continue to work with my colleagues on extending the \npay-as-you-go budget enforcement procedures as well as setting up \nreasonable discretionary spending limits.\n  Some voted against this debt limit increase today because it had not \nbeen paired with procedures for a fiscally disciplined framework. I \ncertainly empathize with that position. We are in tough times. And \ntough times force us to make tough decisions. Today's vote was one of \nthem.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I voted against S. 2578, a bill that \nwould increase the public debt limit by $450 billion.\n  I support taking action to increase the debt limit, in order to \nprotect the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Frankly, we \nhave no choice but to raise the limit. The United States must pay its \nbills. What I cannot support, however, is increasing the limit without \nalso putting in place procedures for arresting this dramatic downturn \nin our nation's fiscal health.\n  I want to provide a little background on how we arrive at this \njuncture. You might remember that a little over a year ago, when the \nBush administration submitted its first budget, we were told that, even \nwith the enactment of the President's proposed tax cut, we would not \nhit the Federal debt limit until 2008. By August, with the tax cut \nenacted, the administration acknowledged it was wrong and that we would \nactually hit the debt limit in 2004. By December, that estimate was \nmoved up again, with the Treasury Secretary admitting the debt limit \nwould be reached within months and pleading with Congress to raise the \nlimit so that the United States wouldn't default on its financial \nobligations.\n  And, I should not, the administration didn't just request a small \ndebt limit increase. It requested a $750 billion increase, which would \nconstitute the second largest one-time increase ever-surpassed only by \nthe $915 billion increase\n\n[[Page S5338]]\n\nsigned into law by the President's father during his term in office, in \nNovember 1990.\n  That dramatic turnaround in events followed a period of rapidly \nfalling deficits in the 1990s and 4 years of surpluses. In total, as a \nresult of the fiscal discipline put in place in the 1990s, we paid down \n$400 billion of publicly-held debt and were on the path to eliminate \nour debt in preparation for the retirement of the baby boom generation. \nWhat a sad turn of events we now face today.\n  It is imperative that we find a way out of this mess. Last week, we \nwere close in the Senate on adopting a bipartisan deal to restore \nbudget discipline and prevent us from digging the hole any deeper. That \ndeal would have extended PAYGO and the Budget Act points of orders, and \nset a cap on discretionary spending for 2003. Unfortunately, our \nRepublican colleagues blocked its consideration. It seems that many in \nthis chamber are still in denial about the dire position we find \nourselves in today as a result of last year's tax cut, the brutal \nattacks on this nation last September, and the slowdown in the economy.\n  Let me state again that the Congress has an obligation to ensure that \nthe government avoids default, an event that would have severe \nconsequences for our financial markets and for the government's cost of \nborrowing funds. However, I feel just as strongly that we should either \nhave passed a much smaller increase--in the range of $100 billion to \n$200 billion--or passed the current bill in conjunction with the \nadoption of bipartisan budget measures that would help us stop the \nfiscal bleeding and return the budget to a path of balance. Simply \nincreasing the debt limit does nothing to force the President and this \nCongress to deal with the very real fiscal problems we now face today, \nproblems that will only worsen as the baby boomers begin retiring over \nthe next decade. I feel we missed a great opportunity today to adopt \nthose measures as part of the increase in the public debt limit.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, today the Senate voted to increase the \ndebt limit by $450 billion. I agree with many of my colleagues that \nraising the debt limit is the responsible thing to do. We must protect \nthe full faith and credit of the United States government and we are \ndangerously close to debt limit. The Department of Treasury has already \nused extraordinary measures to avoid a default. The time for action is \nnow.\n  However, I also believe that we must put pressure on the Congress and \nthe Administration to find solutions to our budget problem. We must \nwork together to restore fiscal discipline to the Federal government. \nThe bill approved by the Senate would raise the debt limit by $450 \nbillion which will provide sufficient funds for the government to \noperate through next spring. I opposed this increase. I would have \nsupported a smaller increase in the debt limit--$150 billion, for \nexample--that would prevent a default but would force an agreement on \nour budget issues this fall. It would have given us leverage to force a \nsolution to our budget problems.\n  The debt limit must be raised. It is the responsible thing to do. \nHowever, a smaller increase would have kept the pressure on the \nCongress and the Administration to come to agreement on a long term \nsolution to put our fiscal policy back in touch and develop a plan to \neliminate our budget deficits.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, as a longtime proponent of a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution, I rise to speak concerning S. \n2578. While we are told that this bill will increase the Nation's debt \nlimit, what we really voted on today was whether to keep the statutory \ncommitment that Congress has made to the Social Security trust fund.\n  Social Security's current surplus is the main reason we need to raise \nthe debt limit. Every single dollar of that surplus goes into the \nSocial Security trust fund, and by law, every single dollar of the \ntrust fund counts as part of the total Federal debt. Social Security is \nexpected to run a $160 billion surplus this year, with an even higher \nsurplus next year. Ironically, in order to place that surplus in the \nSocial Security trust fund, the law requires us to increase the debt \nlimit. Only in Washington, DC, can running a surplus increase your \nlevel of debt.\n  Of course, the debt that is included in the Social Security trust \nfund is just money that the Treasury owes to itself. What really \nmatters for the Government's budget and for the U.S. economy as a whole \nis the amount of debt held by the general public. Over the last few \nyears, as a Republican Congress put the brakes on spending, debt held \nby the public actually fell, lowering the amount of money our \nGovernment had to spend on interest payments. However, the war on \nterrorism, our current recession, and Congress's recent extravagant \nspending have combined to increase the public debt over the past year. \nWhile it is important for Congress to meet its statutory \nresponsibilities to the Social Security trust fund by increasing the \ndebt limit, it is even more important that Congress get its fiscal \nhouse in order by working to cut discretionary spending and restore the \neconomy's health.\n  Time to act on the debt limit is running out. In fact, the Secretary \nof the Treasury says that the main reason he has called June 28 the \n``drop-dead'' date for raising the debt limit is because on that day, \nTreasury is scheduled to make a large payment into the Social Security \ntrust fund. I am pleased that the Senate voted to raise the debt limit \ntoday, and we can get a final bill to the President for his signature.\n  Finally, now that we have voted on this wartime increase in the debt \nlimit, I hope that Congress enacts tough budget caps, strong limits on \ndiscretionary spending, and productivity-enhancing legislation so we \ncan bring our budget back into balance and restore the American economy \nto its full potential.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/11/senate-section/article/S5338-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5338-S5339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:15 p.m. \ntoday, the Senate proceed to a period for morning business until 3:15 \np.m., with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each; that \nat 3:15 p.m., the Senate proceed to the consideration of H.R. 8 under \nthe parameters of the unanimous consent agreement of April 23, 2002.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. And I will not object, although I have an inquiry I need to \nmake and I will probably ask consent as a result of that.\n  We need to go to the Defense authorization bill. That should be our \nfirst issue before anything else. I have made the points that we have \nnot done a budget resolution and there is nothing more important than \nthe defense of our country and that we need to go to the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  I know there was an agreement entered into on this death tax issue, \nand I think we should go to it as soon as possible. But I inquire about \nwhat is the plan with regard to the Defense authorization bill. I note \nthat S. 2514, the Defense authorization bill, is on the calendar and \nwas reported May 15.\n  Under my reservation, can I get some information about what is the \nplan with regard to the Defense authorization bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, as the distinguished Republican leader \nand I discussed a few minutes ago, the plan is certainly to take up the \nDefense authorization bill prior to the time we leave for the July 4 \nrecess. That has always been my intention. I have indicated that on \nseveral occasions to the Republican leader and to others, and that \ncertainly is my intention again today. We know it will take some time. \nSenators have expressed an interest in offering some amendments to the \nbill, and they are in some cases not quite ready yet to go to the bill \nas they are examining amendment options.\n  In the meantime, we want to also fulfill our obligation to Senators \non the estate tax. We made that commitment some time ago, and we are \nhoping to do that. We are also talking to the Senator from Kansas, the \nSenator from California, and others about the cloning-stem cell \nresearch debate. We are hoping we can get a unanimous consent agreement \nto do that on Friday of this week and Monday.\n\n[[Page S5339]]\n\n  In addition to that, we are working on terrorism insurance, and we \nare hoping to get its passage before we leave. I would like to get a \nunanimous consent agreement on that matter.\n  Senator Lott mentioned we were not able to get the budget language \nresolved. Unfortunately, our Republican colleagues objected to doing \nthat last week during the debate on the supplemental, so we were \nprecluded from doing that last week, but we will continue to work to \nfind a way, hopefully without the objections of our Republican \ncolleagues, on the budget as well.\n  I will reiterate my commitment to the distinguished Republican leader \nthat the Defense authorization bill is legislation we will finish prior \nto the time we leave for the July 4 recess.\n  Mr. LOTT. Under my reservation, I note there is a great deal of \ndifference between going to the budget resolution and having full \nconsideration, and agreeing to a number and enforcement numbers on \nsupplemental appropriations. I am prepared to try to help find a \nsolution, to have some limits and some enforcement mechanisms, but \nobviously the way it has been done for the past 25 years is to have a \nbudget resolution. I do think it is the right thing to do, to go to \nthis death tax issue, and I do want us to continue to work on that.\n  We are going to get an agreement on how to proceed to the cloning \nissue because I made that commitment some time ago, as did Senator \nDaschle, to Members on both sides of the issue and on both sides of the \naisle. I think we are very close.\n  I ask to be added to this unanimous consent agreement that following \nthe disposition of this death tax issue, H.R. 8, the next order of \nbusiness be the Defense authorization bill, which is S. 2514.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, of course we will object to that. Let \nme reiterate, because the Senator has noted his desire as well to deal \nwith cloning, to deal with terrorism insurance, to deal with a number \nof other issues, that I know he will be prepared to cooperate in \nscheduling. We have to take this a step at a time. We may not be ready \nto deal with Defense tomorrow, but we are going to be ready to deal \nwith it before the end of this work period. So we will continue to do \nthat.\n  I look forward to working with him to find that date when we can \naccomplish all we need to accomplish in a very short period of time.\n  Mr. LOTT. With that assurance then, I withdraw my further \nreservation, but I again express my concern that if we wait too late on \nbringing up the Defense authorization bill, being able to complete it \nbefore the recess could be a problem. We need to get it done so we can \ngo to the Defense appropriations bill and the military construction \nappropriations bill.\n\n  In view of the objection and the assurances, I withdraw my \nreservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request to \npropose. This unanimous consent is to pass a badly needed permanent \nextension of the adoption tax credit. If we do not pass this extension \nthat was part of President Bush's tax relief bill of last year, it will \nsunset.\n  If the adoption tax credit is allowed to sunset, the following things \nwill happen: The adoption tax credit will be cut overnight from a \nmaximum of $10,000 to $5,000. Families adopting special needs children \nwill no longer receive a flat $10,000 credit; instead, they will be \nlimited to a maximum of $6,000. The tax credit no longer will be \npermitted if we have to extend it each year. Families claiming the tax \ncredit may be pushed into AMT, alternative minimum taxes. The income \ncaps will fall from $150,000 to $75,000 so that fewer families will be \neligible for the credit.\n  There are over 500,000 kids in foster care right now. Let's help them \nfind loving homes. Let's make it easier for families to adopt, not \nthrow up barriers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. BUNNING. May I carry on a colloquy with the Senator from \nMassachusetts?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has made a request to engage in a \ncolloquy with the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would be more than glad to engage in a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I ask the Senator from Massachusetts, does he have a \nspecific objection to the permanent extension of the adoption tax \ncredit at this time for some specific reason?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am doing it on behalf of the leadership \nbecause I understand we have Members who want to offer amendments and \nhave a somewhat different view than the Senator from Kentucky and want \nthe opportunity to do so and have that determined by the Senate.\n  For that reason, I object.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I understand the objection. I hope when the other \nobjectors come forward, we will have an opportunity to discuss this \npermanent extension of the adoption tax credit and to try to work with \nwhoever the objectors are on that side to make it possible that we have \nthis extension made permanent so families can adopt and continue to get \nthe permanent $10,000 tax credit under which they are now operating. My \nfear is that will expire and then we will have all kinds of bad \nconsequences.\n  I thank the Senator and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Kentucky, I \nthink the objective of the Senator is enormously worthwhile. I may very \nwell come out and support the proposal of the Senator from Kentucky. I \nhave been notified by the leadership there are those who have a \nproposal that may have some different features and they would like to \nbe heard on that particular proposal, but I thank the Senator. I think \nthe issues on adoption are enormously important. I think the idea of \ntrying to provide assistance to those families is incredibly valuable.\n  I have had the opportunity, for example, to have hearings on families \nfrom Canada with grown children who have adopted children with special \nneeds. They adopted these children who had special needs even though \nthey had younger children because, under the Canadian health care \nsystem, they offset the medical aspects of the special needs children.\n  I asked the mother why she adopted special needs children when she \nhad three or four children of her own. Her response was she wanted her \nchildren to understand what love was really all about.\n  I may very well support the Senator and try to go even further than \nthe Senator from Kentucky. I admire him for raising the issue on the \nfloor, and I only object because of what I have been notified by the \nleadership.\n  Mr. BUNNING. If the Senator will yield, my personal interest goes \nbeyond just the permanent credit. I have a daughter who had four \nchildren and adopted a special needs child, and then had seven more \nchildren after that. So I am very familiar with the change in life and \nthe loving care that comes with adopting a special needs child. I am \njust fearful the Senate will not act in a reasonable manner to make \nsure this credit becomes permanent. That is my reason for bringing it \nup at this time.\n  I understand the objection of the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Since I am the one who objected, I say I will bring it \nup with the chairman of the Finance Committee and ask him if he would \ntalk to the Senator from Kentucky about what their plans are and urge \nhim to give us an opportunity to address this issue.\n\n[[Page S5340]]\n\n  Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, it was a Republican President, \nTheodore Roosevelt, who, in the early 1900s, established our Nation's \nfirst national forests and refuges, and his fifth cousin, President \nFranklin D. Roosevelt, who, during the Great Depression of the 1930s, \nlaunched the Civilian Conservation Corps. Then, under Dwight Eisenhower \nin 1960, our country set aside the first part of Alaska's Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge. Under Richard Nixon, in 1970, we enacted the \nClean Air Act to limit air pollution from cars, utilities, and \nindustries.\n  Then, 20 years later, a major expansion of that act was signed into \nlaw by President George H.W. Bush, the father of now-President Bush.\n  For 100 years, Republican and Democratic Presidents alike saw that \nsaving America's natural wonders ought not be a partisan political \nissue. Yet today we see the present Bush administration, time and \nagain, side, with corporate political interests trying to roll back the \ntime-tested and bipartisan measures aimed at protecting our land, our \nair, and our water.\n  Let me give some examples. The Federal Superfund Program for cleaning \nup toxic waste sites is running out of money. It was set up in 1980. It \nwas sponsored, fostered and encouraged under several Presidents. It was \nset up under President Carter, and continued by President Reagan, then \nPresident H.W. Bush, and President Clinton. They all encouraged the use \nof the Superfund and the concept of the polluter pays.\n  In 1980, an agreement was struck with the oil companies and the \nchemical companies. The oil and chemical companies would pay into a \ntrust fund, and when a toxic waste site was found--and this happened \nafter the Love Canal situation had riveted the Nation's attention--\nthere would be money in the trust fund if they could not find the \npolluter to pay. If the polluter had fled town or had gone bankrupt, \nthere was a fund from which you could then get the toxic waste site \ncleaned up.\n  I just toured one of these toxic waste sites about 12 miles west of \nOrlando, a site that has been there for several decades, a site where \nat one point what I call a witch's brew of boiling DDT, which formed \nanother chemical compound, had flowed into a holding pond. Why was it a \nholding pond? Because it was a depression in the ground. And where did \nthat go? It was a sinkhole that went into the Floridian aquifer.\n  At one point it spilled out of this holding pond into this creek that \nran into Lake Apopka, a lake of thousands of acres that used to have \n4,000 alligators, and which has 400 now--and you know how sturdy a \nbeast an alligator is.\n  Yet what the present Bush administration has said is we do not want \nto continue the polluter pay concept. We want the taxpayer to pay for \ncleaning up toxic waste sites instead of the polluter. As short as we \nare on money, with the surplus having evaporated, with the war \nrequiring more and more money, an appropriation from the general fund \nof taxpayer money for the Superfund may not happen. So sites such as \nthe one 12 miles west of Orlando, are not going to get cleaned up. If \nwe do not re-authorize the polluter pays provisions--which have had \nbipartisan Presidential support--then we are going to have a serious \nproblem. The site west of Orlando will continue to jeopardize the water \nsupply for all of that part of Florida. That is how serious it is.\n  Let's take another case. We had the matter of arsenic.\n  First, the administration was not going to lower the parts per \nbillion in drinking water. It would remain at 50 parts per billion, a \nstandard set before we knew arsenic caused cancer. Based on years of \nstudy, the previous Administration had recommended it go down to 10 \nparts per billion. There was such an outcry that the public was finally \nheard. And, before the Congress had to act, the administration, \nrelented and adopted the 10 parts per billion standard.\n  In the Senate 2 months ago, we defeated the administration's attempt \nto permit oil and gas drilling in the pristine Alaska Wildlife Refuge. \nUnfortunately, we were unable to overcome the administration's \nopposition to improving automobile fuel economy standards.\n  If we are going to get serious about weaning ourselves from our \ndependence on foreign oil supplies, we are simply going to have to go \nto where we consume the most energy. The most energy is consumed in the \ntransportation sector. If we don't get serious about increasing the \nmiles per gallon on our automobiles and trucks, we are simply not going \nto be able to address our dependence on foreign oil. We should follow a \nbalanced approach on the energy question. It should be part production, \npart conservation, part alternative fuels, part increased use of \ntechnology and part renewable fuels. We can use our technology--we have \nit today--to increase significantly the miles per gallon fuel economy \nof our transportation sector.\n  It is so hard, because of all the special interests involved, to pass \ngood public policy. A good example is the defeat of our effort to \nincrease corporate average fuel efficiency standards. But mind you--it \nis going to take a crisis, such as a terrorist sinking a supertanker in \nthe 19-mile-wide, Strait of Hormuz which suddenly stops the flow of oil \ntraffic out of the Persian Gulf to the industrialized world, to give us \na major disruption of energy supplies.\n  We will rue the day that we did not increase the corporate average \nfuel efficiency standards of our cars and trucks because the \ntransportation sector accounts for 42 percent of the oil we consume in \nthis country.\n  Here, again, is another example of where this administration has not \nfaced up to the reality of the environment and of energy. By the way, \nwe have cars today--particularly Hondas and Toyotas--that can get over \n50 miles per gallon. These are the hybrid vehicles that shift from \ngasoline to electric. Because of the computer, the driver and the \npassengers do not even notice the shift. There is no dimunition of the \nelectrical output of the automobile.\n  Again, it is another example of where we are just on the wrong course \nwith regard to our energy and to our environmental policies.\n  If our energy legislation stalls and the environment remains under \nsiege, is it all lost? I don't think it is. Our citizens and their \nelected representatives can demand and get better.\n  In the past, we saw an outcry regarding arsenic levels in our \ndrinking water and arsenic used to treat wood. We won on both counts. \nThe arsenic standard for drinking water was dramatically decreased and \nthe wood preserving industry agreed to cease the manufacture of arsenic \ntreated wood for residential uses by the end of 2003. Children's \nplayground equipment will no longer be manufactured with wood treated \nwith arsenic. More needs to be learned about the dangers of arsenic-\ntreated wood but, I will continue to seek answers from the \nAdministration.\n  Last year we were able, fortunately, to scale back the sale of new \noil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico right off of the coast of \nFlorida--keeping the drilling more than 100 miles from the Florida \nshores, preventing the spoiling of our coastal environment and \nprotecting the $60 billion a year tourism industry in Florida.\n\n  Senator Graham and I tried to block that sale altogether and we will \ncontinue to battle exploration off Florida's coasts.

Mr. President, it was a Republican President, \nTheodore Roosevelt, who, in the early 1900s, established our Nation's \nfirst national forests and refuges, and his fifth cousin, President \nFranklin D. Roosevelt, who, during the Great Depression of the 1930s, \nlaunched the Civilian Conservation Corps. Then, under Dwight Eisenhower \nin 1960, our country set aside the first part of Alaska's Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge. Under Richard Nixon, in 1970, we enacted the \nClean Air Act to limit air pollution from cars, utilities, and \nindustries.\n  Then, 20 years later, a major expansion of that act was signed into \nlaw by President George H.W. Bush, the father of now-President Bush.\n  For 100 years, Republican and Democratic Presidents alike saw that \nsaving America's natural wonders ought not be a partisan political \nissue. Yet today we see the present Bush administration, time and \nagain, side, with corporate political interests trying to roll back the \ntime-tested and bipartisan measures aimed at protecting our land, our \nair, and our water.\n  Let me give some examples. The Federal Superfund Program for cleaning \nup toxic waste sites is running out of money. It was set up in 1980. It \nwas sponsored, fostered and encouraged under several Presidents. It was \nset up under President Carter, and continued by President Reagan, then \nPresident H.W. Bush, and President Clinton. They all encouraged the use \nof the Superfund and the concept of the polluter pays.\n  In 1980, an agreement was struck with the oil companies and the \nchemical companies. The oil and chemical companies would pay into a \ntrust fund, and when a toxic waste site was found--and this happened \nafter the Love Canal situation had riveted the Nation's attention--\nthere would be money in the trust fund if they could not find the \npolluter to pay. If the polluter had fled town or had gone bankrupt, \nthere was a fund from which you could then get the toxic waste site \ncleaned up.\n  I just toured one of these toxic waste sites about 12 miles west of \nOrlando, a site that has been there for several decades, a site where \nat one point what I call a witch's brew of boiling DDT, which formed \nanother chemical compound, had flowed into a holding pond. Why was it a \nholding pond? Because it was a depression in the ground. And where did \nthat go? It was a sinkhole that went into the Floridian aquifer.\n  At one point it spilled out of this holding pond into this creek that \nran into Lake Apopka, a lake of thousands of acres that used to have \n4,000 alligators, and which has 400 now--and you know how sturdy a \nbeast an alligator is.\n  Yet what the present Bush administration has said is we do not want \nto continue the polluter pay concept.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an important \npart of the strategy to lower prescription drug prices for all of our \ncitizens, particularly our seniors who are using about 18 different \nmedications in a year. We have a strategy to focus on with the intent \nto do everything possible to update Medicare to cover prescription \ndrugs with a comprehensive Medicare prescription drug benefit which is \nlong overdue.\n  Medicare was set up in 1965. It covers the way health care was \nprovided in 1965. It needs to be updated to cover the primary way we \nprovide health care today, which is outpatient prescription drug \ncoverage.\n  We also know there are a number of other actions we can take to lower \nprices for everyone. I had the opportunity yesterday with the Detroit \nRegional Chamber of Commerce to hear from a number of businesspeople, \nlarge and small, who are struggling with their health care insurance \npremiums, some choosing to no longer be able to provide health care, \nand others finding they are having to cut back, and hospitals and \nnursing homes and home health agencies, all affected by the explosion \nin prescription drug prices.\n  When we look at the rising cost of health care, the majority of it is \nthe cost of prescription drugs. A number of us have looked at what it \nis we can do to bring more competition, to bring prices down, and to \nmake it more fair for Americans.\n  Americans today are underwriting the cost of research. I am very \nproud that, through the National Institutes of Health, we are providing \nbillions of dollars in basic research. We support companies then taking \nthat research, and we allow them to write off their research costs as \nwell as their advertising and other costs to be able to provide the \nnecessary research and development for new prescription drugs. We give \nthem a patent to protect their development so they can recover their \ncost. But at the end of that process, we find that Americans, even \nafter we have heavily subsidized, supported, and helped pay for the \nresearch and development, are paying the highest prices in the world.\n  One of the reasons is that there was a law passed in the late 1980s \nthat puts a fence around the border of the United States as it relates \nto prescription drugs. It says that we as Americans cannot go across \nthe border to Canada to purchase American-made, FDA-approved and safe \ndrugs that are sold to Canada, on average, at half the price. We can't \ngo to any other country as well.\n  In fact, as was shown in the Wall Street Journal last Friday in a \nfront page article, every time the European Union or Canada or some \nother country negotiates lower prices for their citizens, the drug \ncompanies make it up by raising American prices, even though we are the \nones paying for the research that creates the new miracle drugs.\n  To demonstrate this and to promote legislation, S. 2244, which \nSenator Dorgan, Senator Jeffords, myself, and many others, have \nintroduced--it is a bipartisan bill to bring down this barrier at the \nborder so Americans can get the very best prescription drugs at the \nvery best prices from Canada--a number of us have been helping to \nsponsor bus trips to Canada to make the point.\n  This is a picture of a number of us who were joining, from the House \nand Senate last week, a bus in front of the Capitol. This is a bus that \nthe Alliance for Retired Americans has been sponsoring. In fact, we \nhave over 14 different trips planned in the next several days into \nCanada. We kicked off one in Detroit yesterday where a group of \ncitizens got on the bus to go 5 minutes across the Ambassador Bridge, \nin which they were able to lower their prices on average by half, just \nby going across the bridge.\n\n  This is not about putting seniors or families on buses to go across \nbridges to get lower prices. This is about dropping the barrier at the \nborder. This is protectionist legislation that does not allow us to \nhave business relationships across the border to bring back those \nAmerican-made drugs at a reduced price.\n  We can trade with Canada on agricultural products, manufacturing \nproducts, all kinds of things. People go back and forth across the \nborder and do business every day. But when it comes to prescription \ndrugs, we have not been able to do that. That creates a situation where \nwe don't see the kind of pressure on our companies to be competitive \nand fair to Americans.\n  We want to get people off the bus. We want those prescriptions coming \nback to the United States to our neighborhood pharmacy, so a senior can \nwalk in and get the reduced price.\n  I will just share with you some of the price differences we have seen \nas we have taken the bus trips to Canada from Michigan. Zocor, for high \ncholesterol, if you need to purchase this in Michigan, the price will \nbe somewhere in the range of $109. If you drive that 5-minute bus trip \nacross the border, you can get that same Zocor for $46. If we look at \nPrilosec for heartburn and ulcer relief, $115 in Michigan; $55 across \nthe border to Canada.\n  Probably one of the most disturbing ones for me is a breast cancer \ntreatment drug. I have taken to Canada breast cancer patients, who are \nin desperate need of this lifesaving treatment and medication. \nTamoxifen is a well-known breast cancer treatment, $136.50 in Michigan; \n$15.92 across the bridge.\n  There is something wrong with this picture. There is something wrong \nwhen Americans are supporting and funding the development and \nunderwriting costs and subsidizing, through tax deductions and tax \ncredits, the development of these lifesaving medications, and we are \npaying so much more for these lifesaving drugs. It makes no sense.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our effort, to come on as cosponsors \nand support the effort to open our borders and lower prices for \nprescription drugs. We have a bipartisan bill, S. 2244. The time is \nnow. We want to get the seniors off the bus, get lower priced \nprescriptions into the local pharmacy or the hospital or into the \nclinics around the State of Michigan. It is time to do that. It is past \ntime to lower the prices for people.\n  This isn't the same as buying a new pair of tennis shoes. It is not \nthe same as buying a new car, although coming from Michigan, I want to \nsee people buy a new car every year. But if they don't, it is not going \nto threaten their life. But if a breast cancer patient does not get her \nTamoxifen, it does threaten her life. That is the difference.\n  This is medicine. It is not optional. It is time we understand that \nand get serious about lowering prices, about creating the competition \nthat will allow us to lower prices.\n  I have never seen an issue that affects more the economy of this \ncountry. It affects every businessperson trying to provide health \ninsurance for themselves and their employees. It affects our \nuniversities' health clinics. The president of Michigan State \nUniversity came to me expressing great concern about his rising health \ncare premiums and the requirement that he was going to have to lay off \npeople because they couldn't keep paying these rising costs, most of it \nfrom prescription drugs, and maintain the same number of staff at the \nuniversity. This is ridiculous.\n\n  Most importantly, this is ridiculous because of what it means to our \nfamilies and our seniors. Yesterday on the bus were a couple who are \npaying $1,300 a month for their prescriptions, people on a fixed \nincome. They were getting on that bus yesterday to go to Windsor, \nCanada, out of desperation to lower their prices so they could live \nindependently in their own home and not have to be hospitalized or go \ninto a nursing home and receive the kind of medicine they need.\n  It is wrong that we are seeing this kind of disparity. I urge my \ncolleagues, while we are working on the important issue of Medicare \nprescription drug coverage, that we do something today to lower prices. \nWe can do something right now by just simply opening the border to \nCanada and making sure that our citizens get the prices shown by these \nyellow bars on this chart, instead of paying the high prices we see \nthey are paying right now.\n  I thank you, Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to get engaged in \none of the most important issues affecting seniors and our families \ntoday. It is time to bring the prices down.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in the Washington Post today in the front\n\n[[Page S5342]]\n\nsection on page A3, there is an article titled: ``Report Urges Stricter \nTests for Teachers, Expertise Is Stressed Over Theory.''\n  This is an important report. It is one that underscores what a number \nof other reports have said, including those by the National Center on \nEducation Information, which is a report that was out earlier this \nyear, and the was a very solid report from 1996, which is most \ncomprehensive on teacher quality, called ``What Matters Most: Teaching \nfor America's Future.'' The Administration's report is very important \nbecause it outlines the challenges we face.\n  I want to give an assurance to the American people that we do not \nneed more legislation. We already have the legislation in place in the \nNo Child Left Behind Act, and in the Higher Education Act of 1998, \nthat, if fully implemented and funded, would address the real \nchallenges we are facing in the States. We know that we need to hire \nover 2 million teachers over the next ten years, we need to improve \nteacher preparation, and we need to increase professional development. \nBut we don't need new legislation. The No Child Left Behind Act \nrequires 100-highly percent qualified teachers in our classrooms in \nfour years. I believe that is the most important ingredient to have a \nwell-qualified teacher in every classroom, increase professional \ndevelopment each year, and provide funding for mentoring.\n  The Higher Education Act, title II, provides funding for States and \nuniversities to improve the teacher preparation with high-quality \nstrategies, including improving alternative routes to certification, \nand improving the quality of colleges of education.\n\n  Mr. President, what is left out of the report is the need for \nresources to help states meet these goals. We need resources to be able \nto achieve these goals for the children in this country. We need to do \nmore than just count on alternative routes to certification. \nAlternative routes to certification could provide, at best, one-third \nof all of the teachers we need in our public school systems. For \nexample, the Troops to Teachers only places about 700 teachers per \nyear. We need to hire more than 200,000 teachers per year to address \nthe shortages. Many of these new teachers need to have specialized \ntraining in special education, math and bilingual education. The \nalternative route programs can provide some assistance, but they are \nnot the core of the solution. The solution lies in improving all of the \nteacher preparation and training programs and providing all teachers \nwith the ongoing support they need once they are in the classroom.\n  Some traditional teacher preparation programs and alternative routes \nare successful. All the successful programs have the same \ncharacteristics. The recent report by the National Center on \nEducational Information said that a successful alternative route \nprogram is specifically designed to recruit individuals with college \ndegrees; that is, the emphasis is on content. Such a program has a \nrigorous screening process to attract high-quality candidates. The \nprogram is field based to give practical experience through \ninternships. New teachers receive mentoring from trained teachers. \nCandidates must meet high standards upon completion.\n  The 1996 report had similar characteristics for a high-quality \nteacher preparation program at universities: organize teacher education \naround standards for students and teachers; develop and extend year-\nlong programs with year-long internships; create and fund mentoring \nprograms; and create high-quality sources of professional development \nfor ongoing support.\n  So the Administration's report is useful and valuable today, but this \nis something we have understood now for a number of years. It really is \nnothing very new. The statistics may give us more recent information on \nparticular States, but we know what needs to be done. We outlined in \nthe No Child Left Behind legislation a series of programs to help and \nassist the States to address the teacher shortage, but the \nadministration has requested zero increase in their proposed budget for \nimproved teacher quality and reduced class size. There is an excellent \nstudy that says all these things need to be done--better training, \nrecruitment, professional development and mentoring. We have to do \nthem. But when it comes to the resources to be provided, we are just \nnot getting it from the administration. That, I think, is a matter of \nenormous importance.\n  All of us want to address the kinds of needs that are outlined in \nthis report. It is a good report. But in order to do that, it means \nfunding the various programs that we have that are out there and in \nexistence.\n  Mr. President, I want to mention several of the programs that the \nadministration failed to fund this year that cut teacher quality \nprograms by $155 million this year. They include: The elimination of \nfunding for preparing tomorrow's teachers to use technology is \nenormously important. You can get the new technology in the classroom, \nbut unless the teacher understands how to use the technology and how to \ndevelop the curriculum to use the technology, you have missed the \nopportunity for success.\n\n  This program was oversubscribed, but it was eliminated by the \nAdministration. Funding for the National Board for Professional \nTeaching Standards, which is enormously important, was eliminated. \nCertification by the National Board for Professional Teaching \nStandards, all across the country, is the key for increasing \ncompensation, increasing professionalism, and increasing success. The \nNational Board has been incredibly important and effective and yet the \nBush Administration eliminates it.\n  The Bush budget eliminates programs to prepare teachers to teach \nwriting and civics, and provides a 50-percent cut in grants to help \ntrain teachers to teach American history.\n  So the point I am making, Mr. President, is that we can have these \nstudies and they can point out what the problem is, but we know what \nthe problem is, but we already know what the problem is. What it takes \nnow is the increased investment in the No Child Left Behind Act and \nother programs that can really make a difference in terms of teacher \nquality.\n  We have to look at this in a comprehensive manner. We need to improve \nworking conditions for teachers, including increasing pay, increasing \nthe prestige of teaching, and improving schools so they are safe, \nmodern places in which teachers can work and children can learn. Many \nschools have obsolete, crumbling, and inadequate facilities. All \nteachers and students deserve safe, modern facilities with up-to-date \ntechnology. Sending teachers and children to dilapidated and \novercrowded classrooms sends an unacceptable message. It tells them \nthey don't matter. No CEO would tolerate a leaky ceiling in the \nboardroom--and no teacher should have to tolerate it in the classroom.\n  This is all part of what we have to understand if we are going to \nexpect that we are going to get quality teachers to teach in our \nschools.\n  Mr. President, this is just a final point I want to mention on the \nsubject. Despite the goals we share in the recent report, I am \nconcerned that the administration is not meeting the letter of the law \nin implementing the requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act to \nensure a high-quality teacher in every classroom.\n  In the draft guidance of the new ESEA title II Teaching Quality \nProgram, released on June 6, the Department proposes a large loophole \nfor alternative routes to certification that I believe violates the law \nand could lower teacher quality.\n  The guidance says: ``Any Teacher who has obtained full state \ncertification, whether he or she has achieved certification through \ntraditional or alternative routes, has a four-year college degree, and \nhas demonstrated subject matter competence, is considered to be highly \nqualified under the law. Teachers who are participating in an \nalternative route program may be considered to meet certification \nrequirements of the definition of a highly qualified teacher if \nparticipants in the program are permitted by the state to assume \nfunctions as regular classroom teachers and are making satisfactory \nprogress towards full certification as prescribed by the state and the \nprogram.''\n  This creates a double standard when it comes to teachers working \nthrough alternate routes compared to teachers working through the \nregular certification program--those working\n\n[[Page S5343]]\n\nthrough the regular certification program must be fully certified--no \nemergency, temporary provisional certification.\n  Alternate route teachers can be considered highly qualified while \nholding a provisional certification while they are working to obtain \nfull certification. This is inconsistent with the definition in the \nESEA which holds the same standards for all teachers.\n  I hope the draft guidance will be changed to ensure when we say all \nteachers will be highly qualified, we mean all teachers are highly \nqualified. We do not want to find on the one hand statements about the \nimportance of these findings, and then on the other hand have the \ndrafting of rules and regulations which are going to result in lower \nstandards for the teachers in the classroom.\n  We welcome this report, but it comes back again to the issue of \nwhether we are prepared to help the States, schools, parents, and \nchildren in this country by helping ensure there is a well-qualified \nteacher in every classroom. We have the legislation. We have followed \nthese various recommendations, and all we need is the investment to \nmake this happen. That is why we are going to continue to battle for \nthe children of this country by insisting that we have an adequate \nbudget invested in teacher quality.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/11/senate-section/article/S5343-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5343-S5358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DEATH TAX ELIMINATION ACT OF 2001\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Senators Gramm and \nKyl be recognized for 5 minutes each; however they want to divide up \nthe 10 minutes to speak on the general subject of the estate tax, and \nSenator Conrad be recognized for up to 10 minutes. Following that, we \nwould be, I believe, in a position to lay down the first-degree \namendment at that time pursuant to the order and the 2-hour time will \nstart running at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me take a couple of minutes to tell \npeople where we are. We worked out an agreement several weeks ago to \ndebate the permanent repeal of the death tax. I thank the majority \nleader for agreeing to allow this to happen. We now have a unanimous \nconsent agreement that dictates how the debate will occur. I will go \nover it so everyone will know exactly what we are doing.\n  Under the unanimous consent agreement, a majority member, a Democrat, \nwill be recognized to offer a first-degree amendment related to the \ndeath tax. That amendment, by a majority member, will be subject to two \nsecond-degree amendments also offered by majority members. Those two \nsecond-degree amendments will be disposed of--either with a point of \norder, a motion to table, or a vote--and will be accepted or rejected. \nThen there will be one amendment standing, whether it is amended or \nnot, and it will be voted on. Then I will be recognized to offer a \nfirst-degree amendment. It will not be subject to an amendment. I will \noffer an amendment identical to the permanent repeal of the death tax \nadopted by the House of Representatives. So if my amendment is be \nadopted, the bill would again pass the House and the President could \nsign it into law.\n  If any other amendments should be adopted, we have to have a debate \nas to whether we would name conferees and we would potentially have to \ngo to conference with the House.\n  That is basically where we are. We are now awaiting the offering of a \nfirst-degree amendment. Then that will be subject to two second-degree \namendments, offered by the majority. We will vote on each one of them, \nin order, and then we will vote on the underlying amendment. I assume \nwe would probably get through one vote this afternoon and then we would \nhave three votes tomorrow and we would finish up tomorrow sometime in \nthe mid-early afternoon if all the time is used.\n\n  I remind my colleagues there are 2 hours on the first second-degree \namendment, 2 hours on the second second-degree amendment, 2 hours on \nthe underlying first degree, and then there would be 2 hours on my \namendment which would repeal the death tax, in exactly the same form \nthe House has passed, and then there would be a vote on it and we would \nbe finished.\n  That is where we are in terms of the structure of the debate. I \nwanted everyone to understand exactly where we are. I reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this afternoon we begin a very important \ndebate on the question of the estate tax. My friends on the other side \ncharacterize it as a death tax. It is really not. There is no such \nthing as a death tax in America. Nobody pays taxes at death. There is \nan estate tax. For estates over a certain amount, they contribute to \nthe revenue of the Federal Government by paying an estate tax.\n  The problem with the current estate tax is that it cuts in at too low \na level. Currently, estates begin to be taxed at about $1 million. The \nfact is, only about 2 percent of all estates pay any tax, even under \nthat circumstance. But with what has happened in the national economy, \nmany of us believe we do need to reform the estate tax--not eliminate \nit but reform it.\n  Why? First of all, because it is not fair to have the estate tax cut \nin at that level, given the increase in assets that has occurred in the \ncountry in the last decade. At the same time, it does not make much \nsense to us to eliminate the estate tax completely because of the cost. \nWhat our friends on the other side of the aisle are proposing is a $100 \nbillion cost in this decade and a $740 billion cost in the next decade, \nright at the time the baby boom generation retires--all of this in the \ncontext of budget deficits as far as we can see.\n  I believe we ought to reform the estate tax. I believe we ought to \nincrease the level at which it cuts in on individuals and their \nfamilies. But to eliminate the estate tax and dig the deficit hole \ndeeper, put us deeper into debt and take it all out of Social Security, \nI do not think is defensible.\n  Last year, the President said this about paying down the debt:\n\n       My budget pays down a record amount of national debt. We \n     will pay off $2 trillion of debt over the next decade. That \n     will be the largest debt reduction of any country, ever. \n     Future generations should not be forced to pay back money \n     that we have borrowed. We owe this kind of responsibility to \n     our children and grandchildren.\n\n  What a difference a year makes, because just a few hours ago we \nresponded to the President's request for the biggest increase in the \ndebt--the second biggest increase in the debt in our Nation's history. \nThat is what we did just hours ago. Has this Chamber already forgotten? \nHave we already forgotten that we just responded to the President, who \nsaid he was going to pay down the biggest amount of debt in our \nNation's history, in fact he said the biggest amount of any country \never? And now, just 2 hours ago, 3 hours ago, we responded to his \nrequest for not debt paydown but the biggest expansion of the debt--the \nsecond biggest expansion in our Nation's history?\n  Here is the comparison. The only time we had a bigger increase in the \ndebt than what the President is seeking was when his father was \nPresident. When his father was President, we had to increase the debt \nby $915 billion, in November of 1990. Now this President comes and asks \nfor a $750 billion increase in the debt. That is after telling\n\n[[Page S5344]]\n\nus last year he was going to pay down the debt by the maximum amount \npossible, the biggest of any country ever.\n  Last year, the President told us it would be 7 years before we would \nhave to increase any debt. In August of last year, he told us it would \nbe 3 years before any increase in the debt. In December 2001, he told \nus 2 months. Right now, the Treasury Department is using extraordinary \nmeans to finance the debt of the United States. They are taking from \nthe retirement funds of Federal employees to cover the Federal debt.\n  Let me say this. If any private company tried that, they would be on \ntheir way to a Federal facility, but it would not be the White House of \nthe United States, it would not be the Congress of the United States, \nthey would be on their way to a Federal penitentiary because that is a \nviolation of Federal law. But that is what is going on right now.\n  You recall in the previous administration they did that for a short \ntime and in the House of Representatives our friends across the aisle \nfiled impeachment proceedings against the Secretary of the Treasury for \ndoing what this Secretary of the Treasury is now doing.\n  Can we forget what just happened a few hours ago, when there was a \nvote here to increase the debt of the United States by $450 billion? \nThe President requested $750 billion in increased debt. We increased it \n$450 billion.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 6 minutes of his 10; 4 \nminutes remain.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, remember last year? We have to put this in \ncontext. We have to think about the circumstance within which we are \nmaking decisions. Last year, we were told there was going to be $5.6 \ntrillion of surpluses over the next decade. That is what we were told \njust last year. Now we look at the budget circumstance of the United \nStates, and the surpluses are all gone. There are no surpluses. In \nfact, if we look at the President's budget and we look at the latest \nshortfall in revenues and we look at the stimulus package just passed, \nwhat we see over the next decade is not $5.6 trillion of surpluses, \nwhat we see is $600 billion of deficits. It is a pretty stunning \nturnaround. In 1 year we go from $5.6 trillion of surpluses to $600 \nbillion of deficits. And our friends on the other side want to dig the \nhole much deeper--much deeper--by adding $100 billion, and another cost \nin the next 10 years of $740 billion, right at the time the baby boom \ngeneration retires. It does not make much sense to me to eliminate this \nestate tax instead of reforming it.\n\n  Yes, let's address the problems that exist with the estate tax. Let's \nincrease the amount of the exemption in a responsible and rational way. \nBut let's not dig the hole deeper and deeper with respect to the \ndeficits and debt of this country.\n  Here is where we are, looking back to 1992, when there were deep \ndeficits, not counting Social Security. We were able, over a period of \nyears, to pull our country out of this deficit and debt morass. We were \nable to run surpluses for 3 years. But look at what happened last year. \nWe are right back in the soup. For anybody who thinks it is going to be \nshort-lived, here is the hard reality. We are poised to be back in \ndeficit for the entire next decade--billions, hundreds of billions of \ndollars of deficit and debt.\n  Again, I say our friends on the other side, in their proposal, say: \nDon't worry about that; don't worry about all this red ink; don't worry \nabout all these deficits; don't worry about piling up the debt; let's \njust go out there and cut some more taxes and not pay for it. That is \ntheir answer. They will add another $100 billion to these deficits over \nthe next decade. But what is really stunning is in the second 10-year \nperiod they would take another $740 billion right out of Social \nSecurity trust funds.\n  There is an alternative that deals both with the question of \nreforming the estate tax and making it more fair and at the same time \nreducing the cost dramatically over what our friends on the other side \nof the aisle are proposing.\n  What I am proposing is immediate relief. Take the estate tax \nexemption to $3 million next year--$1 million now, and increase that to \n$3 million next year--$6 million for a couple for 2009, and thereafter \nthe exemption would increase to $3.5 million. The maximum estate tax \nrate would be frozen at 50 percent. We retain the stepped-up basis.\n  Mr. President, I ask for an additional 3\\1/2\\ minutes and for the \nother side as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we have retained the stepped-up basis. The \nother side's proposal goes to what is called a carryover basis.\n  This is a hugely important issue that people should understand. We \nwill have a chance to go into it as we proceed.\n  Let me say at this point that in a stepped-up basis, when a relative \ndies, you inherit their property at its value at the time they die.\n  That is a very important concept to understand. Let me repeat it.\n  Under a stepped-up basis, you pay future taxes based on the value of \nthe property of the loved one that is giving you the property. You pay \non the basis of the value of the property at the time they died--not \nwhat they paid for it but the value at the time they died.\n  Under the alternative proposal offered on the other side, you are \ngoing to go to what is called a carryover basis. You are not going to \npay future taxes based on the value at the time that your relative \ndied. You are going to go back to the value of what they paid for it.\n  Let us say you inherit a farm. You don't inherit the value of the \nfarm at the time your father died or your grandfather died. You are \ngoing to pay future taxes based on what they paid for the property.\n  There is a big difference between our proposals. It is an accounting \nnightmare.\n  What our friends are proposing we tried before--the carryover basis, \ngoing back to what grandpa paid for a property. It was an \nadministrative nightmare for all concerned. And we quickly abandoned \nit. They want to go back to the bad, old days.\n  Not only does this proposal fundamentally reform the estate tax and \nmake it more fair and avoid going to carryover basis, but it also saves \nhundreds of billions of dollars in the second decade. In this decade it \nsaves $87 billion. The cost of our proposal in this decade is $12.5 \nbillion. The cost of their proposal is $99.4 billion.\n  Under the proposal I am making, by 2009, only .3 percent of estates \nwill face any estate tax liability. That means 99.7 percent of estates \nwould pay zero, nothing, have no estate tax liability.\n  We will have more to say about this as we go forward.\n  At this point, I want to yield the floor so my colleague from \nArizona, Senator Kyl, can have a chance at this initial moment to speak \non this subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in addition to the 3 minutes granted by the \nextension, I inquire about how much time remains on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Which includes the 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KYL. I will speak for 5 minutes, and our colleague from Texas \nwill speak for 5 minutes.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let me make three points.\n  First of all, I find it very interesting that our Democratic \ncolleague is worried about the debt of the United States. This does not \nseem to be much of a concern to him or his colleagues when they vote \nfor spending bills around here.\n  Just recently--I took some of the more recent ones--the railroad \nretirement bill was $15 billion in one payment. I voted against that. \nThe farm bill was $82.8 billion over the baseline, over the budgeted \namount. I voted against that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to yield for a moment--for a moment, please.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The amount that the Senator refers to is not over the \nbudget. Every penny of the money in the\n\n[[Page S5345]]\n\nfarm bill is within the budget. Does he acknowledge that?\n  Mr. KYL. No. Let me reiterate what I said. The fact is that the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota, chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, has not been able to bring a budget to the floor. So there \nis no budget. We are talking about the baseline. I believe my number is \naccurate with respect thereto. We are spending billions on this farm \nprogram above what we originally had decided to spend; under trade \nadjustment assistance, over $11 billion over the President's request--a \n10-year number; in the supplemental that we just passed--a 1-year \nnumber--about $4 billion above the President's request.\n  The highway bill is about 5.7 above the President's request.\n  My point is that it seems to be a little contradictory when some \ncolleagues are so concerned about the debt, and all of a sudden they \nare happy to spend very large sums of money above the baseline.\n  Let us get into this debt business a little bit more. With what do we \npay down debt?\n  We pay down debt with Social Security income. Under Social Security \nrevenues--the FICA tax--you pay in 7.6 percent and your employer pays \n7.6 percent. That is Social Security.\n  The death tax receipts don't pay for Social Security. Not one nickel \nof the death tax collections or estate tax collections pay for Social \nSecurity benefits--not one nickel. If we repeal the entire death tax \ntoday, Social Security wouldn't lose one nickel because that isn't \nwhere Social Security gets its money. You all know where Social \nSecurity gets its money--from the FICA tax, the Social Security \npayments. Those right now are in surplus.\n  What do we do with the surplus? We pay down the debt with it.\n  If my colleagues are worried about the need to pay down the debt, \nthen they are talking about taxes, Social Security money, and paying \ndown the debt with that. That is exactly what happens every single \nyear. We all agree to that.\n  If they are worried about taking away money for Social Security, then \nthey need to be worried about the Social Security tax collections and \nnot the estate tax collections. None of that money goes for Social \nSecurity.\n  This is a bogus argument that Social Security would in any way be \naffected by a reduction of the estate tax collections.\n  Finally, to this argument that somehow it is unfair for us to step up \nthe basis--or, rather, to carry over the basis rather than have a \nstepped-up basis, this may seem to be an arcane argument to folks who \naren't familiar with these terms. Here in practical terms is what it \nmeans.\n\n  You have a billionaire and he dies. His wife inherits the money. \nUnder the proposal of the Senator from North Dakota, if the spouse \ndecides the day after her dear loved one's departure to sell all of \nthat property, cash it in, do you know how much she pays in capital \ngains tax? Zero. Zip. Nothing. That is how much you pay under the \namendment of the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Under our proposal, you would pay the capital gains on the original \nvalue of the property.\n  If her dear loved one bought that property for $100 million way back \nwhen and sells it for $1 billion, that is a $900 million gain. She \nwould pay a capital gains tax on that again.\n  Our idea is that death should not be a taxable event. You can't \nanticipate it. It is the worst possible time to have to pay a tax. It \nis not fair. Most of the Tax Code says you pay a tax when you do \nsomething knowing what the tax consequences will be. You earn money, \nyou sell property--those are taxable events. What we are doing is \nreplacing one tax for another.\n  The estate tax is unfair, it is wrong, and it should be repealed. It \nwill be replaced by a capital gains tax.\n  The interesting thing about it is that really wealthy people will end \nup paying a tax when they sell that property; whereas, they would not \npay nearly as much tax as they would under the amendment of the Senator \nfrom North Dakota.\n  What it really boils down to is you are still paying the tax. What it \nreally boils down to is a matter of policy. You are going to pay sooner \nor later. But do you want to pay with death being the taxable event or \ndo you want to pay a tax based on an economic decision you made knowing \nwhat the tax consequences would be. That is what our Tax Code theory is \nand the death tax should comport with that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 4\\1/\n2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I don't mind yielding to my Democratic colleague.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I inquire as to the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four and one-half minutes remain to the \nSenator from Texas.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Do I have time on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, you do not.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we all understand that the death tax \nbasically says if somebody works a lifetime, they scrimp and save and \nsacrifice, they plow the money back into their business or their farm \nor their estate, they do it for their family, and then they die, then \ntheir family has to sell their business or sell their farm or sell off \ntheir estate to give the government a double taxation of 55 cents out \nof every dollar they have earned in their lives. It is an absolute \noutrage. The American people believe that.\n\n  Today and tomorrow, as we debate this issue, our Democrat colleagues \nare not going to defend the death tax as such. They are going to try to \nmake a series of points. You are going to get to hear it in the long \ndebate, but since we are waiting for them to come forward with their \namendment, I want to make some points early on. They are going to say: \nOK, it is wrong to make people sell off their life's work, but \nshouldn't we redistribute wealth? Shouldn't we say that above a certain \nlevel we are going to have a death tax? They are basically going to try \nto appeal to this old class struggle, this old Marxist idea that has \nbeen rejected everywhere else in the world but still carries currency \nin the United States of America.\n  The second thing they will do is say: Look, we wanted to repeal the \ndeath tax but we can't afford it. We just can't afford it. Let me \nremind my colleagues, we don't have to go way back to the railroad \nretirement debate of last year to see that this is not true. Let's go \nto last Thursday. Last Thursday this body, the Senate, voted \noverwhelmingly--and I think almost every Democrat Member of the Senate \nvoted for the bill--to spend $14 billion more than the President \nrequested for nonemergency items in a supplemental appropriation. \nThat's $14 billion more than the President asked for in nonemergency \nitems. That is 4 times what it costs to repeal the death tax next year.\n  So our colleagues today are brokenhearted: You would repeal the death \ntax and deny the Government that money, and we are so worried. They are \nworried about the deficit and the debt. Where were they Thursday? Where \nwere they Thursday night? I was here. I raised a point of order against \n80 amendments. Where were they? They were willing to spend four times \nas much this coming year on spending the President didn't ask for in an \nemergency bill than it would cost to repeal the death tax.\n  On the farm bill, they were willing to spend seven times as much as \nthe cost of repealing the death tax. Now they are worried about the \ndebt. They are worried about the deficit. But last month when we passed \nthis bloated, inflated farm bill, they were willing to spend seven \ntimes as much as it would cost this coming year to repeal the death \ntax. They were not worried then, but they are really worried today.\n  Then there was the energy tax incentive. They weren't worried then. \nThey were willing to spend more on energy tax incentives than it would \ncost next year to repeal the death tax.\n  Finally, just to add insult to injury, on the budget that was \nreported on a straight party-line vote out of the Budget Committee, the \nDemocrat majority increased nondefense discretionary spending by a \nwhopping $105.8 billion above the level requested by the President. In \nother words, when they cast that vote, they could afford $106 billion. \nThat is more than enough to fund the repeal of the death tax for the \nnext 10 years.\n  I know they are upset today. They are very upset about the deficit \nand the debt. But they are only upset when we\n\n[[Page S5346]]\n\nare talking about letting people keep more of what they earn. They are \nnever, ever upset when it comes to spending money.\n  They write a budget that spends more money on new discretionary \nprograms than repealing the death tax would cost, but when it is time \nto let people keep money, they are worried.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that all time has been used that was \npreviously allocated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I would now say to the Chair that under the unanimous \nconsent request before the Senate, there is an opportunity now for the \nmajority to lay down an amendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I ask that Senator Conrad be recognized for that purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3831\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3831.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to restore the \n                     estate tax with modifications)\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause, and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I have already described what my amendment \ndoes. I will use the first part of my time to answer the very creative \narguments made by my colleagues on the other side. I have never heard \nsuch imaginative arguments on the Senate floor. This is really \nintriguing.\n  They start out by justifying eliminating the estate tax by an attack \non the farm bill, saying the farm bill was over the budget and, \ntherefore, what does it matter if we take another $700 billion out of \nSocial Security in order to eliminate the estate tax. How soon they \nhave forgotten their own votes. They voted for the farm bill budget \nwhich they decry. Yes, they did. The\n\n[[Page S5347]]\n\nfarm bill budget was provided for in the last budget resolution.\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle voted aye. They voted \nfor the Republican budget resolution. The Republican budget resolution \npassed on the floor of the Senate was their resolution. Their \ncolleagues in the House passed exactly the same budget resolution. Do \nyou know what else? Their President proposed a budget with exactly that \namount of money in it for the farm bill.\n  I hate to rain on their parade, but they supported the Republican \nbudget resolution that funded the farm bill. That was their budget \nresolution. That was their proposal. They voted for it. Now they come \nout here and attack it. They should have been here voting against their \nown budget resolution because that is what provided the budget for the \nnew farm bill.\n  The Senator from Texas talks about the bill that just passed that was \nrequested by the President. He has attacked the supplemental \nappropriations bill that was requested by the President. The difference \nbetween what we passed here, which he attacks, and what the House of \nRepresentatives passed, according to the Congressional Budget Office, \nis $1.3 billion, not the $10 billion to which he referred. The $10 \nbillion he referred to is an absolute myth. There is $1.3 billion of \ndifference between what the Senate passed and the House passed.\n  By the way, the President praised what the House passed and condemned \nwhat the Senate passed. In a $30 billion bill, there was only $1 \nbillion difference. Where is the difference? The Senate bill has more \nmoney for first responders, the policemen and the firemen we expect to \nprotect this Nation, a $600 million difference there. There was $300 \nmillion more in the Senate bill than the House bill to protect our \nnuclear facilities.\n  Has anybody read the paper the last few days? Of what did the \nadministration warn us? They warned us of a ``dirty'' bomb attack on \nthe Capitol of the United States. What is a ``dirty'' bomb? It is a \nregular bomb with nuclear fissile material around it. Do you know what \nwould happen if that kind of bomb were dropped in the vicinity of the \nCapitol? The former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral \nOwens, told me in a breakfast just 2 weeks ago, it would make the \nCapitol area uninhabitable in a mile circumference for 400 years.\n  From where might that nuclear fissile material come? It might come \nfrom our own labs. That is why the Senate added $300 million to protect \nour nuclear facilities and added $650 million for our first \nresponders--our policemen and firemen--and added another $700 million \nto protect our ports, because one of the things we know is that nuclear \nfissile material might come into this country everyday in thousands of \ncontainers. And only 2 percent are checked.\n\n  So is this some big, wasteful spending program to protect our nuclear \nfacilities, to protect our ports and to provide funding to our first \nresponders? I don't think so. That is the difference between the House \nbill the President praised and the Senate bill that the President \nattacked. There is no $10 billion difference. That is total fiction.\n  Let's go back to the question of the fundamental issue before us. Is \nspending a threat to our fiscal future? Absolutely. But our fiscal \nfuture is determined not just by spending, but by the relationship \nbetween spending and revenue. Deficits are created by an imbalance \nbetween spending and revenue. You only have deficits when you spend \nmore than your income.\n  We know the circumstance we face as a nation. It has become \nabundantly clear to all of us. We face a circumstance in which we see \nin our future an ocean of red ink. Here it is. We go back to 1992 on \nthis chart. We were facing deficits, not counting Social Security, of \n$341 billion. In 1993, we passed a 5-year plan that started lifting us \nout of deficit.\n  By the way, not one of our friends on the other side voted for it. It \nwas the plan that started lifting us out of deficit.\n  Each year, we were coming out of deficit. Then in 1997, on a \nbipartisan basis, we passed a plan that finished the job. We actually \ngot back into surplus. We were there for 3 years, and then we got \nplunged back into the deficit hole by the events of last year: No. 1, \nthe tax cut advocated by our friends on the other side; No. 2, the \nattack on this country; No. 3, the economic slowdown.\n  When you wonder where the surpluses went, here is what we find: 42 \npercent went to the tax cuts that were passed last year; 23 percent \nwent to the economic slowdown; 18 percent went to the increased costs \nof the attack on our country; 17 percent are due to technical changes, \nmostly underestimations of the cost of Medicare and Medicaid.\n  We have before us a fundamental question: How are we going to deal \nwith this ocean of red ink? Our friends on the other side say: Well, \nlet's keep digging the hole deeper. It doesn't matter. We were for \neliminating the estate tax last year, and we are still for it. It \ndoesn't matter that the surpluses have evaporated. It doesn't matter \nthat the money is all gone. We are going to stay steady on this \ncourse--even if the course leads to insolvency. It doesn't matter that \njust a few hours ago this Chamber voted to increase the debt of the \nUnited States by $450 billion.\n  That is after the President and our friends on the other side \npromised us last year that they had a financial plan that was going to \nlead to the maximum paydown of our debt. That is what they said a year \nago. They had a plan that would lead to the maximum paydown of the \ndebt. Now they have asked for the second biggest increase in the debt \nin our Nation's history. They told us a year ago that we would have \nsurpluses of $5.6 trillion in the next decade. Now the money is all \ngone. Instead of surpluses, there are deficits. That is the hard \nreality.\n  So the question before us is, what do we do about the estate tax? Let \nme stipulate that they have one part of this argument right. We need to \nchange the estate tax. We should not leave it the way it is. We should \nnot let it hit people with a million dollars of assets. We ought to \nincrease it. That is what my proposal does. My proposal goes to $3 \nmillion next year, $6 million for a couple. You don't have to wait \nuntil 2007, as you do under their proposal. We go to $3 million for an \nindividual and $6 million for a couple next year. You don't have to pay \na penny of estate tax. In 2009, we go to $3.9 million.\n\n  On their side, they talk about how much they care about helping \npeople. But they want to wait. They want to wait. I don't want to wait. \nI want to go to $3 million for an individual, $6 million for a couple \nnext year. Give them the estate tax relief they deserve. Don't \neliminate it. Don't say to the wealthiest among us--the super wealthy--\nyou don't ever have to face any estate tax. Why? Because it costs too \nmuch, Mr. President. Their proposal costs $99 billion--$99 billion in \nthis decade.\n  The proposal I am making costs $12.6 billion in this decade. So it \nseems to me it is a pretty good proposal. No. 1, it gives immediate and \nsubstantial relief to estates by going from a million dollars of \nexemption to $3 million for an individual, $6 million a couple, not in \n2007 or in 2008, but next year. No. 2, it costs a lot less because you \ndon't eliminate the estate tax, you reform it. Their plan costs $99.4 \nbillion. Mine costs $12.6 billion.\n  Mine includes a stepped-up basis rather than a carryover basis. I \nknow that is confusing and I know those are words most people don't \nuse. What it means is simply this: Under my plan, you will pay future \ntaxes based on the value of the assets you inherit at the time you \ninherit them. You will not be paying taxes based on what grandpa paid \nfor the asset you inherited. Think of the difference. Not only is that \na big tax difference, that is a big difference in terms of practicality \nand simplification.\n  We tried what they are proposing, this idea of carryover basis, this \nidea that you are going to go back to the value of what grandpa paid \nfor the farm, of what grandpa paid for the stock, of what grandpa paid \nfor the real estate. Do you know what we found? Most people don't even \nhave the records. Most people don't even know what grandpa paid. Most \npeople don't have any idea, and they can't find out because it happened \n30 or 40 or 50 years ago. We tried this. We tried what they are \nproposing. It was an administrative disaster, an administrative \nnightmare.\n  We will hear the other side saying that these assets have already \nbeen\n\n[[Page S5348]]\n\ntaxed. The fact is, an analysis has been done. The vast majority of \nthese assets have never been taxed. Yet they say it is double-dipping. \nMost of these cases are assets that have never been taxed. I believe \nthe proposal that----\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator yield for a question on that?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. KYL. I am curious about the source of the statement that the \nmajority of assets has never been taxed.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes. I will get the Senator a copy of the analysis on \nthat.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The hard reality is that we have to make choices. We \nought to reform the estate tax. We ought to increase the amount of \nexemption. We should not wait for 2007 and 2008. We ought to do it now.\n  Under my proposal, we go to $3 million from $1 million today for an \nindividual, $6 million for a couple. At the same time, it costs a lot \nless. That means we do protect Social Security. We do protect the \nfinancial structure of this Government. We are fiscally responsible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from Alabama \nneed?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for his \nleadership on this issue and for yielding me time.\n  One of the issues we need to recognize as we talk about a budget--and \nwe have the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee here--is we \ndo not have a budget. One was proposed in the Budget Committee by the \nDemocratic members. It was brought up, voted on, and got zero votes. \nThe reason is that there is not sufficient discipline to make tough \nchoices in this body, and the budget that was proposed had no political \nsupport, did not balance, and did not make sense.\n  We are in trouble with spending. When the President proposes an $18 \nbillion emergency spending bill and this Senate adds $14 billion more \nto it for special projects that I do not believe are necessary, and, in \nfact, I think the President's supplemental was generous, we are losing \ndiscipline on spending.\n  The reason we had a surplus from 1994 to 1998 is we had almost no \nincrease in spending in this body. We kept our spending flat on \ndiscretionary spending. It resulted in tremendous gains in balancing \nthe budget.\n  It is time for us to deal with this estate/death tax. In 2000, we \nvoted to eliminate it. It phases out at the end of 10 years, in 2010. \nPeople do not like it. It is unfair. It disrupts the American economy. \nTo have the Federal Government reach in at the time of death of a \nfamily member and take out 55 percent of what that family has \naccumulated is a confiscation. It is an absolute decimation of a \nfamily's life and savings.\n  I had an individual tell me about their grandfather. Everybody was \nhome for Christmas. It was just after Ronald Reagan had pushed through \na modification of the estate tax. It would have saved his family a \nlittle money. The grandfather was there at Christmas. The cancer was \ntaking its toll on him. Every day, he asked what day it was. She told \nme: My grandfather died at 10 a.m. on January 1. His last act was to do \nwhat he could to keep the taxman from taking away what he had earned \nand preserve it for his family.\n  I think this is a big deal. It touches a lot of people. Some people \nsay: Oh, it is huge revenue, we cannot afford it. It is only 1 percent \nof the total income into this Government at best. That is something we \ncertainly can afford to eliminate.\n  No tax causes more gyrations, more lawyers, more accountants, CPAs, \nappraisers, and strategists to try to beat this tax than does the death \ntax.\n  In addition to that, the Federal Government spends more on trying to \ncollect the tax than on any other tax. For the 1 percent we get, we are \ngetting the heaviest cost on the economy, the heaviest cost on the \nGovernment to collect them. I think it is very unwise. It causes \nextraordinary stress on the elderly.\n  Sit down, as I have done as a practicing lawyer, and talk with a \nfamily about the tough decisions they may have to make. Do they want to \ncreate a trust? Do they want to advance gift money to children to try \nto reduce the impact of this tax? This is forcing the elderly to make \ndecisions they ought not have to make. It upsets them, makes them \nnervous, and causes them to make uneconomic decisions that reduce \noftentimes the productivity and efficiencies of their corporations and \nbusinesses.\n  It is, in my view, a huge nightmare to collect. Much of the dispute \nis in litigation over appraised values of properties. Many of these \nissues are just really a nightmare for the elderly.\n  Let me share with my colleagues briefly what I think is the most \npernicious part of this tax. My good friend's proposal to raise the \nexemption to $3 million really will not touch it. These are the \ngrowing, vibrant, midsize, local, home-based companies that are doing \nwell.\n  I know of a company that had 27 automobile parts stores. They built \nup from one. They had headquarters in Alabama. One of the members dies, \nand then what do they do? They meet, have a discussion, and the net \nresult is that this locally owned company, competing with some of the \nbiggest parts companies in America, sells out to Carquest. I have \nnothing against Carquest, but that is a national company, maybe even an \ninternational company in scope, moving millions and millions of dollars \na year in parts. As a former parts person myself and a former equipment \ndealer, I have some empathy for them.\n  I will just say this: Carquest, as a major national company, a \nbroadly held stock company, never pays the death tax. It is never \nimpacted by a death tax. But a closely held corporation is savaged by \nthe death tax.\n  It reminds me of a situation in which there are some trees growing \nup. There are some big trees and there are some little trees growing. \nThey are trying to compete with the big trees to get more sunlight and \ndevelop and expand and compete with the big trees, and somebody comes \nalong with the clippers and clips the tops off them, making it \nimpossible for them to compete.\n  If my colleagues want to know why in America today we see a collapse \nof local companies, why we see an unusual conglomeration of wealth in \nthe big stock companies, the reason is they do not pay this tax. This \nis a tax that falls only on the small companies in a way that \ndevastates them too often.\n  I am concerned about that situation. I ask you: Do GM, GE, \nDaimlerChrysler, Toyota, or Mitsubishi pay a death tax? No, they do \nnot. But I can take you back to the small bank in my hometown, the \nsmall manufacturing company, or the small chain of auto parts stores. I \ncan tell you about a young man who told me that he and his father and \nbrother owned four motels in Alabama. They would like to see their \nbusiness expand. He explained to me that he, his brother, and his \nfather were paying $5,000 a month for a life insurance policy on their \nfather's life so they could pay the estate tax in case he died. \nOtherwise, they would have to take the money out of their company--and \nthey had no money to take out of the company; they were pouring their \nmoney into the company--they would be forced to sell off maybe to a \nHoliday Inn, maybe to a Ramada, or some big company that does not pay \nthe death tax.\n  We need to quit nickel-and-diming this issue. We have voted to \neliminate this despicable, unfair, abusive tax that eliminates and \nweakens competition in America. It brings in little revenue at \nextraordinary cost to the tax collector and to the American people who \nhave to pay it. It is long overdue to get rid of it. Let's not back up \nnow. Let's go forward. Let's not let those who want more money to \nspend, spend, spend, spend, and keep us from doing the right thing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the time is controlled by the Senator from \nNorth Dakota. I wonder if the Senator will yield me time to talk about \nsome of the statements I heard this afternoon.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to do that. Maybe I will take a minute.\n  Mr. REID. Fine.\n\n[[Page S5349]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we have heard a lot from the other side \nabout spending running away.\n  If we examine the budget before us, all of the increase is in two \nareas: defense and homeland security. Both sides of the aisle have \nsupported those increases. The President proposed major increases in \ndefense spending after the attack on this country. Those of us on our \nside of the aisle immediately agreed. The President proposed major \nincreases in homeland security. Those on our side of the aisle \nimmediately agreed.\n  There are big increases in spending, but every part of that increase \nis in those two areas of defense and homeland security. That is where \nthe big increases are occurring, and I think it is understandable why \nwe have big increases in defense proposed by the President and agreed \nto by our side of the aisle. I think it is very easily understood why \nwe have a big increase in homeland security proposed by the President \nand agreed to by our side of the aisle.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I have said publicly and, of course, privately that I think \nthe Senator from North Dakota really has a grasp on numbers. The \nSenator is aware, is he not, that about a year ago at this time, it was \napproximately a $4.7 trillion surplus over 10 years? The Senator would \nagree now that that basically is gone; is not that right?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes. Actually, the Senator will recall, we were told a \nyear ago that we were going to have $5.6 trillion of surpluses over the \nnext decade. That is what we were told a year ago, January of 2001, \n$5.6 trillion of surpluses.\n  Now when we look at the President's budget proposal, plus the \nshortfall in revenue in this filing season, plus the stimulus bill that \nhas been passed, there are no surpluses, none. Remember, about half of \nthis money was Social Security money. In other words, $2.5 billion of \nthis amount of surpluses is Social Security money. It is all being used \nfor other purposes now.\n  When the Senator from Arizona says it does not matter about the \nestate tax and Social Security because estate tax money is not used for \nSocial Security, the point he misses is when money is taken out of the \nrevenue stream, and there already is not enough to meet the obligations \nand now even more money is taken, something has to give. What is the \none place that is left to give?\n  Mr. REID. Social Security.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Social Security trust fund. So he can say there is no \nconnection, but there is a very direct connection. There is a very real \nconnection. The only place there is any money is the Social Security \ntrust fund. So if he takes a big chunk more of revenue, how is it going \nto get covered?\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator answer another question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. REID. The tax cuts that were passed in this body also had some \nimpact on the future financial security of this country. Is that a fair \nstatement?\n  Mr. CONRAD. There is no question about it. If we look at, where did \nall the money go, here is where it went. Our friends on the other side \nlike to say it all went to spending. No, no, no. Forty-two percent went \nto the tax cut. That is the biggest reason for the disappearance of the \nsurplus. The second biggest reason is economic changes. That is the \neconomic slowdown. That is the second biggest reason. The third biggest \nreason is spending, and virtually all of it is defense and homeland \nsecurity.\n  The final reason was underestimations of the cost of Medicare and \nMedicaid. That is where the money went.\n\n  Mr. REID. I would like to ask the Senator another question or two. Is \nthat appropriate?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Sure.\n  Mr. REID. We passed Friday, about 1 a.m., a supplemental \nappropriations bill. I have heard statements all day from the other \nside of the aisle about this supplemental appropriation and how it \ncontains big spending. I direct the Senator's attention to a number of \nitems. First, I ask the Senator from North Dakota, the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, he realizes, does he not, that there was $14 billion \nin that bill for defense? Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is correct. Of the $31 billion, $14 billion was for \ndefense.\n  Mr. REID. That was requested by the President; is that true?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is aware also that there was approximately $5.5 \nbillion requested by the President for homeland security efforts; is \nthat true?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is also aware that Senator Byrd and Senator \nStevens held hearings over a period of 3 weeks that included seven \nCabinet officers and scores of other witnesses to find out what was \nneeded for homeland security for this next fiscal year. Is the Senator \naware of that?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am.\n  Mr. REID. After having done that on a bipartisan basis, unanimously \nout of the Committee on Appropriations, is the Senator aware that \nfigure was increased by about $3 billion?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Is it not true, I say to my friend, that of those moneys \nthat were increased, there was a billion for first responder programs? \nI say to my friend, I heard on public radio this morning a long piece \non how State and local government is being killed financially because \nof the responsibilities they have for providing security for their \npeople, and these are responsibilities they believe that the Federal \nGovernment should bear. They gave an example of a place in Florida. \nTomorrow I think they said they are going to go to Orange County, CA, \nand indicate how these entities are being decimated financially as a \nresult of their requirements, these unfunded mandates that we have \npassed on to them. Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am. I say to my colleague, I looked at the increases \nbecause, frankly, there were parts of that bill that I did not support. \nI voted against a number of the provisions in that bill. If one is fair \nand objective about what was offered, where did the increases occur?\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the difference between \nthe Senate-passed bill and the House-passed bill is $1.4 billion, not \nthe $10 billion that is being discussed on the other side; $1.4 billion \nof differences between the House bill and the Senate bill when scored \nconsistently by the Congressional Budget Office. Where were the \ndifferences? First responders, $600 million more in the Senate bill; \nnuclear facilities, $300 million more to protect our nuclear \nfacilities; port security, $700 million more.\n  If anybody has been reading the newspapers, they know there is a \ntremendous vulnerability of the United States to a so-called ``dirty'' \nbomb that would make this Capital uninhabitable for 400 years. I do not \nthink it is unreasonable to say we are going to protect the nuclear \nfacilities where that fissile material might come from, that we are \ngoing to protect the ports of America where those threats could come in \nto America.\n  Another $250 million was added for airport security to protect \nagainst these materials coming into the airports of the country in the \nholds of planes.\n  I say to my colleagues, that is spending that was designed to protect \nAmerica.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator also acknowledge that there has been in \nthis bill that we passed in the Senate last Friday morning $387 billion \nfor bioterrorism, including to improve lab capacity at our Centers for \nDisease Control and the National Institutes of Health? Does the Senator \nfrom North Dakota acknowledge the importance of studying bioterrorism \nafter the anthrax that closed down a major office building for 3 months \nin the Senate?\n  Mr. CONRAD. It not only closed down a major office building in the \nSenate but closed down post offices and closed down businesses.\n  Mr. REID. And killed people.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Killed people.\n  Now that we know a significant part of the planning by the al-Qaida \nnetwork is bioterrorism, we know that a significant part of the \nplanning of the al-Qaida network is a ``dirty'' nuclear device to be \ndropped on this Nation's\n\n[[Page S5350]]\n\nCapital, we cannot choose to turn our backs and not worry about \ndefending the country.\n  Our first obligation as United States Senators is to defend this \nNation.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator acknowledge there is $200 million in this \nbill that the President requested based on hearings held by Senators \nByrd and Stevens for food safety, including food inspectors, \nlaboratories, protections against animal and plant disease, and also to \nassess risks to rural water systems; and also aware there is $154 \nmillion for cyber-security, there is also $100 million for the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to look at assessments of water system \nsecurity?\n  We have people quibbling, and I say ``quibbling'' because I cannot \nfind another word to describe what they are talking about this \nafternoon. The Senator has shown in graphic form billions of dollars \ntaken away from the American people and given to a very small \npercentage of the people. Less than 1 percent of the American \ntaxpayers, 42 percent, is gone because of that; is that right?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I don't mean to denigrate, but I cannot come up with \nanother word other than ``quibbling.'' We are talking about billions of \ndollars that is gone--like that--and here we are talking about programs \nthat Senators Byrd and Stevens worked on for weeks, that passed in the \nSenate without any problem at all because it was good for homeland \nsecurity, good for the people of my State, good for the people of your \nState, and as I heard on Public Radio this morning, good for the people \nof Florida and even Orange County, CA, which has been devastated. I \nmight mention, Orange County, CA, is a very rich county, but they have \nbeen devastated by virtually unfunded mandates that we passed on them \nsince September 11.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask my colleague, are there times when money is spent \ninappropriately? Absolutely. Do we need to restrain spending? \nAbsolutely.\n  Under the budget proposal I made to my colleagues, we would take \nspending to the lowest level since 1966. I applaud the Senator from \nTexas and the Senator from Arizona for saying we have to restrain \nspending. There is no way out of this hole that has been dug except to \nlook at both sides of the equation--spending and revenue.\n  To eliminate the estate tax that costs $99 billion under their \nproposal, when instead we could reform the estate tax and increase the \nexemption to $3 million for an individual, $6 million for a couple, at \na cost of one-eighth as much, a cost of $12.5 billion instead of $99 \nbillion, makes no earthly sense to me. I hope we think carefully about \nthese votes and what it means for the financial future of the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-one and a half minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield to the Senator from West Virginia, 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. President, I understand there is a little bit of grousing and \ngnashing of teeth concerning the moneys that were appropriated for \nhomeland security in the supplemental appropriations bill last week. \nLet us stop, look, and listen.\n  In the last several hours, the threats against this Nation from \nterrorist attack once again were made evident with the arrest of an \nAmerican citizen who apparently has been working with the ``al-Qaida'' \nterrorist network, plotting an attack on the nation's capital.\n  Once again, our eyes have been opened to the fact that terrorists \nlive among us. The threats are real. The danger is present. We should \nnot continue to delay actions that will fund immediate steps to protect \nAmerican lives from attack.\n  Soon, the supplemental bill, which is being criticized by some today, \nwill be in conference. I will fight hard for the $8.3 billion homeland \nsecurity package that this Senate overwhelmingly approved last week. I \nhope that President Bush will match his rhetoric on homeland security \nwith support for a funding package that meets so many of the critical \nsecurity shortfalls in this country.\n  The announcement about yesterday's arrest only amplifies the concerns \nraised by administration officials within the past few weeks. The Vice \nPresident warned that a strike is ``almost certain.'' Secretary of \nDefense Donald Rumsfeld has stated that it is inevitable that \nterrorists will acquire weapons of mass destruction. Secretary of State \nColin Powell has warned that ``terrorists are trying every way they \ncan'' to get nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. And Homeland \nSecurity Director Tom Ridge said, ``While we prepare for another \nterrorist attack, we need to understand that it is not a question of \nif, but a question of when.''\n  Clearly, we know that the threat exists. We know that terrorists plan \nto strike. We do not know where or how or when, but we know that they \nwill strike again. The question remains, will we be prepared?\n  Last week, the Senate took steps to address the many gaps in our \nhomeland security network. By a vote of 71 to 22, the Senate voted very \nclearly to provide critical resources to protect American lives and to \ntry to prevent future tragedies like the one we witnessed last \nSeptember. Unfortunately, despite all of its rhetoric that homeland \nsecurity is a top priority, the administration continues to oppose this \ncritical legislation. In fact, the administration has gone so far as to \nthreaten to veto the bill.\n  The President today travels to a water treatment plant in Kansas \nCity, MO, to showcase a piece of his proposed Department of Homeland \nSecurity. This piece would create a threat analysis unit, envisioned as \npart of Mr. Bush's proposed intelligence-analyzing division, that would \nstudy the vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure such as water, \nroad, and financial systems.\n  The supplemental bill approved by the Senate and currently opposed by \nthe Bush Administration would put us several steps ahead on this threat \nassessment.\n  During Senate Appropriations Committee hearings over the last several \nweeks, Senators learned that more than $400 million is needed for local \ngovernments to conduct vulnerability assessments for our water systems. \nThe supplemental bill includes $125 million for cities to assess the \nvulnerabilities of their water systems and for vulnerability \nassessments and security improvements to protect rural water systems. \nThe administration did not request funding to help secure our drinking \nwater systems, and it is opposing the Senate-passed supplemental bill \nthat does make appropriations for our drinking water.\n  This spring, the Department of Energy sent the Office of Management \nand Budget a request for additional funds to secure America's nuclear \nweapons complex and labs, but the request was turned down. Now the \nadministration has lauded its arrest of one man linked to a ``dirty \nbomb'' plot. But instead of supporting funds to better secure our \nnuclear labs and material, the administration is opposing the Senate \nsupplemental bill that contains $200 million for that very purpose.\n  While in Kansas City today, the President is also expected to trumpet \nhis plans to address vulnerabilities within the nation's financial \nsystems. A cyber attack is a real possibility. As Senator Bennett has \npointed out, ``In the cyber-age, many of the attitudes we have had \nabout warfare, about vulnerability, about opportunity have to be \nthought through entirely differently.'' Instead of supporting our \nefforts to address this threat, the President is opposing the Senate-\npassed supplemental bill that includes $154 million for cybersecurity \nto help combat the threat to Federal and private information systems.\n  Today, the President will talk about his support for local \ncommunities in the overall homeland security effort. A major part of \nthat local effort is the actions of first responders, namely, local \npolice officers, firefighters, emergency medical teams. The Federal \nEmergency Management Agency received $3 billion worth of applications \nfrom local firefighters for new equipment and training, but FEMA only \nhad $360 million to meet the request. The administration did not ask \nfor any additional funds in its supplemental bill. But the Senate-\npassed legislation last\n\n[[Page S5351]]\n\nweek does include $300 million to continue to meet this massive gap in \nour homeland security network.\n\n  Last week, the President announced a massive governmental \nreorganization to respond to terrorist threats. I support the concept \nof a Department of Homeland Security, as do most Members of this \nCongress, I believe, but there are many details to be worked out and \nmany questions to be answered. We should not wait to address the gaps \nin our Nation's defenses while this new department is crafted. \nTerrorists will not swear off further violence until a new department \nis up and running. We should not delay our efforts to thwart that \nattack. The appropriations bill the Senate passed last week with a huge \nmargin will do just that.\n  It is time for the administration's rhetoric on homeland security to \nbe matched by action. It is time for the administration to recognize \nthat simply talking about homeland security will not save lives. It is \ntime for the administration to support investments in homeland \nsecurity, to support the Senate's work to save lives, and to help fill \nthe gaps that currently exist in our Nation's homeland security \nnetwork. The administration should support the supplemental \nappropriations bill passed by the Senate last week, and I hope the \nPresident will speak to that end.\n  I was down at the White House this morning, and I urged the President \nto support the supplemental appropriations bill that the Senate passed \nlast week. This bill will go a long way toward matching the rhetoric by \nthe administration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, Senator Conrad was going to \nyield me 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I can do it either way. I was going to speak, but if the \nSenator has a time constraint, I am happy to step aside for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If my colleague would be willing to do so, that would \nhelp me.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will be glad to do so. Let my colleague speak.\n  Mr. REID. How much time does the Senator from Minnesota desire?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Ten minutes. I will take more time tomorrow.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Conrad has how much time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remain 22.5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. On behalf of Senator Conrad, I yield 10 minutes to the \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the full repeal of \nthe estate tax for multimillionaires and billionaires. It is unfair, \nand it is unaffordable. Let's repeal it for small businesses. Let's \nrepeal it for family farmers. We all agree on that. Let's go with the \nConrad formula of $3 million individual, $6 million a couple, up to $7 \nmillion, but let's retain some modicum of fiscal sanity before we give \naway nearly $1 trillion in tax cuts to a handful of the ultrarich. That \nis what this is.\n  The timing could not be more ironic. We now immediately follow a vote \nto increase the Federal debt limit by $450 billion. That was to borrow \nanother $450 billion, which is only enough credit to last until next \nMarch.\n  Many of my colleagues voted for the tax cuts last year but they \nopposed increasing the debt limit; that is to say, in the words of the \nold Yiddish proverb, dancing at two weddings at the same time, although \nI don't think you should be able to do so.\n  It is now clear that the claims that have been made by the White \nHouse, by the President, and by too many Senators and Representatives, \nthat we can have massive tax cuts for the wealthy--Robin Hood in \nreverse--with most of the breaks going to the top 1 percent, pay down \nthe debt, and invest in critical public priorities, were completely \nfalse.\n  Of course, there is plenty of that to go around. Colleagues were out \nhere advocating nearly a $1 trillion tax cut for billionaires less than \na week after there was so much heartburn on the Senate floor over an \nextra $1 billion for homeland security. Where did the fiscal \nconservatives go? They will spend $1 trillion to protect some wealthy \nkid's inheritance, but they will not spend $1 billion to protect our \ncities and towns from terrorists.\n  Spend $1 trillion to protect some wealthy kid's inheritance but not \n$400 million for veterans' health care, with so many veterans falling \nbetween the cracks.\n  Give away almost $1 trillion over the next 20 years, erode the \nrevenue base--it is fine to do it for billionaires and \nmultimillionaires, but we don't have enough money for education, not \nfor smaller class size, not to recruit and retain good teachers, not to \nhave good, affordable prescription drugs, not to do something about \ndeplorable conditions in nursing homes, not to help elderly people stay \nat home, live at home in as near normal circumstances as possible with \ndignity, not to expand health care coverage. We will not have any of \nthe money to do that.\n  Full repeal of the estate tax would cost $104 billion over the next \n10 years, literally to protect a few thousand ultrawealthy families. \nEven worse, from 2013 to 2020 it is going to cost the taxpayers over \n$800 billion to provide this ``relief.'' This means that the full cost \nof this effort to have full repeal of the estate tax over 20 years is \nnearly $1 trillion.\n  Nationally, only 1.6 percent of all estates were made up with \nsignificant small business assets and only 1.4 percent had significant \nfarm assets. This means that virtually all the estate tax is paid by \nextremely wealthy people who do not own farms or small businesses. The \nConrad amendment really targets this.\n  In contrast, many rely on Social Security. Over 740,000 Minnesotans \ncurrently receive Social Security. Make no bones about it, what we are \ngoing to be doing here is not only not providing the investment in \neducation or health care or affordable housing, but in addition we are \njust going to basically be taking it out of the Social Security trust \nfund. That is what this is all about.\n\n  For helping multibillionaires and billionaires, refusing to target \nthis--which is what the Conrad amendment does--refusing to exclude \nsmall businesses and family farms that are handed from family to \nfamily--which is exactly what the Dorgan amendment does--instead, we \nhave this effort to erode the revenue base $1 trillion over 20 years, \nmost of the benefits going to the wealthiest Americans. And at the same \ntime, we will not even be able to live up to our commitment in Social \nSecurity.\n  I believe this is really a proposal which defies common sense. If we \nwant to do it the right way, we cap the estate tax exemption at a \nreasonable level. That is what the Conrad amendment does. If we want to \ndo it the right way, we exempt, as I said before, family farms and \nfamily-owned businesses. If we want to do it the right way, we will \nhave some balance.\n  I finish on this note. I do not fault my colleagues because I think \nfor many of them, this is their position. If you believe that when it \ncomes to the most pressing issues of people's lives--be it to make sure \nSocial Security benefits are there, to make sure we adequately fund \nMedicare reimbursement for our hospitals and nursing homes and home \nhealth care providers, to make sure people can afford prescription \ndrugs, to make sure we live up to our commitment to get the dollars \nback to our schools and our school districts, our teachers, our \nchildren, our young people from prekindergarten through higher \neducation, to make sure something is done about the lack of affordable \nhousing, to make sure we can provide some help for people who have no \nhealth care coverage, to make sure we can provide some help for small \nbusinesses that can't afford health care costs--if you believe, when it \ncomes to those pressing issues, there is nothing the Government can or \nshould do--and I believe that in some ways that is the ideological \nposition some of my colleagues take--then eliminating the estate tax, \nnot targeting it, is the perfect way to go.\n  It is win-win. You help the millionaires and the multimillionaires \nand the billionaires, you erode the revenue base, and you make it \nimpossible for the Senate and the House of Representatives and the \nFederal Government to play a positive role in helping people. You make \nit impossible for the Federal Government to play a positive role in \ndealing with some of the most pressing issues of the lives of people we \nrepresent.\n\n[[Page S5352]]\n\n  That is what this estate tax cut does. That is what this proposal to \ncompletely eliminate the estate tax accomplishes.\n  In one broad stroke of public policy, you have Robin Hood in extreme \nreverse with the benefits going to the wealthiest Americans, and at the \nsame time you make it impossible for us to make the investments in \nhealth care, in education, in affordable housing, in Social Security, \nand in Medicare.\n  From the point of view of some of my colleagues, it is win-win. From \nmy point of view, it is lose-lose.\n  I hope our colleagues will support the Conrad amendment as at least a \ncommonsense, reasonable alternative.\n  I am not sure my colleague from Texas fully agrees with my statement, \nbut I appreciate his graciousness.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I first wish to say something that I \nconsider to be positive about our colleague from Minnesota. There are \nmany people who want to take the repeal of the death tax back, but they \ndo not want to own up to why they want to do it. They want to do it \nbecause they want to spend the money. The one thing I have always \nadmired about the Senator from Minnesota is that he does not dilute his \nliberalism with the alloy of hypocrisy. He says exactly what he \nbelieves. I think in doing so he not only is true to his conscience but \nhe does the Senate a service by defining exactly what all of this is \nabout.\n  I wish to yield myself 20 minutes of the remaining 50 minutes we \nhave.\n  Let me begin by saying that I think I am a good person to be a leader \non this issue in the sense that the only thing I have ever been \nbequeathed in my life is that my grandmomma's brother, my great-uncle \nBill--who was a great checkers player and I guess in the minds of the \nworld since he worked in a cotton mill he may not have been a very \nimportant person, but he was an important person to me--but he \nbequeathed to me a cardboard suitcase full of yellow sports clips from \nthe 1950s. I have often thought that had it been baseball cards I would \nbe a rich man today. So I will never pay a death tax. I hope someday my \nchildren and grandchildren will have enough wealth that it would be an \nissue if we don't repeal it. But I am against the death tax because it \nis profoundly wrong.\n  I know it is easy to envy what another family achieves. But how can \nit be right? I am not talking about budgets, I am not talking about \ndollars, I am talking about right and wrong. People may work a \nlifetime, they scrimp, they save, they sacrifice, they plow back into \ntheir business, they work 12 and 14 hours a day, they accumulate, they \nbuild, and they build America while they are building. How can it be \nright simply because we are greedy and we want their money to make \ntheir children sell off the fruits of their life's work to give the \nGovernment a 55-percent share of everything they have accumulated \nduring their lifetime simply because they have been successful?\n\n  It is a question of right and wrong. I will say about the \nconstituents of my State--I can't speak for any other State in the \nUnion--but in my State when I am talking about this issue--whether I am \ntalking to farmhands, or railroad retirees, or rich people in North \nDallas--when I talk about it being wrong to make a man or a woman sell \noff the life's work of their parents to give the Government a double \ntaxation, people stand up and applaud because they are against it. They \nare flat against it because it is wrong and because it is un-American. \nIt is un-American to do that. By doing it, we prevent accumulation.\n  I would like to refer to two thick studies. I would put them in the \nCongressional Record, except it would cost a lot of money. So let me \nrefer to them so if people want them they can get them off the \nInternet. I will save probably $25,000 by not putting these in the \nRecord.\n  There was a study by the Joint Economic Committee, entitled ``The \nEconomics Of The Estate Tax.'' It was published in December of 1998 by \nthe Joint Economic Committee.\n  All of their analyses and numbers boil down to the conclusion that \nthe death tax has reduced by $500 billion the capital stock and the \ntotal investment that the Nation has made in job creation. They \nconclude that we are not raising net revenues by forcing people to \ndestroy small businesses, destroy family farms, and to tear up the \nbequeath of Americans who have been successful. They argue that it \ndestroys capital and that actually we are not collecting net revenue. I \ncommend this to my colleagues.\n  The second study is a private study that was done by the Institute \nfor Policy Innovation, entitled ``The Case For Burying The Estate \nTax.''\n  They conclude that there are costs to collecting the estate tax. \nThere is a decline in economic efficiency as people sell off their \nbusiness because they do not want their children to have to deal with \nthe estate tax problem. People buy insurance with money they could be \ninvesting in their business, and they do that to try to avoid the \nestate tax. When you look at all those costs, the Institute for Policy \nInnovation concludes that on net we are not even collecting any taxes \nwith the death tax.\n  Finally, even if you accept the IRS data as net data--in other words, \nthat we are really losing revenue--when you take into account what it \ncosts to collect the tax, what people spend trying to avoid it, and how \nit hurts the economy, contrary to all of the debate you have heard from \nthe Democrat side of the aisle, we collected less than one cent out of \nevery dollar of taxes collected in America last year from the death \ntax.\n  Under the best of circumstances, we are not collecting very much \nmoney. Under more likely scenarios, we are not netting any money from \nthe tax.\n  This policy of death tax is driven by collective greed. It is not \ndriven by economics. It makes no sense to make people sell off their \nbusiness, or destroy their farm, or tear up their life's work. And it \nhurts the economy to do it. But we continue to do it because of this \ncollective envy that somehow there is something wrong about people \naccumulating.\n  Let me take the richest man in the world, Bill Gates. They say he is \nworth $46 billion. But because Bill Gates has $46 billion, I am richer. \nHe changed the life of everybody on this planet with what he did in \nterms of information technology and the management of data. He created \n10 or 100 times that wealth from which we have all benefitted. He is \ngiving over 90 percent of it away.\n  You might say that is a lot of money. Many of our colleagues will \nsay, let us take it, we can spend it. But what moral right do we have \nto take it? He has already paid taxes on every dollar of it. He is the \nlargest taxpayer in the world. I am not doing this for Bill Gates, but \nhe is the extreme example.\n  The point is that this is not collecting very much money. \nInterestingly enough, one of the great paradoxes is the substitute that \nhas been offered by Senator Conrad raises the deduction immediately to \n$3 million over the next 5 years and it would cost $20 billion.\n  The way we phase out the repeal, our repeal over the next 5 years \nonly costs $6.8 billion, and the real cost comes in the 10th year. The \nincredible paradox is the substitute that is being offered takes money \nout of the Treasury exactly when we don't have it, and it doesn't take \nmoney out in 2010 when we are going to have a surplus, according to the \nestimates of the Congressional Budget Office projection I have in front \nof me, of $653 billion.\n  In other words, in trying to prevent us from making the repeal of the \ndeath tax permanent, the Senator from North Dakota offers a substitute \nthat actually drives the deficit up in the next 5 years, whereas by \nphasing out the death tax, the real large cost of our phaseout does not \noccur until a year where we have about $600 billion of surplus. Why not \ngive it back?\n  The point is, we voted to repeal the death tax. We all celebrated it. \nWe talked about it all over the country. Now we have a quirk in the \nbudget where it comes back in 10 years. Did we mean to repeal it or \ndidn't we? I believe we did. I believe we should.\n  The second line of defense in all this is: But we don't have the \nmoney. We just don't have the money. We want to make the death tax \nrepeal permanent, but we don't have the money.\n  The only point I make, and I don't want to be unkind to anybody, but \nwhy is this argument about not having money never made when we are \nspending money? Why is it only made when we are letting people keep \nmore of what they earn?\n\n[[Page S5353]]\n\n  I want to give you five examples. Whether it was good or whether it \nwas bad--and my guess is some of it was good and some of it wasn't \ngood--last Thursday we spent $14 billion more than the President \nrequested on nonemergency items. That is four times the amount it would \ncost over the next 2 years to make the death tax repeal permanent. So \nif last Thursday we had enough money to spend $14 billion that the \nPresident did not request as an emergency, how come we don't have \nenough money to make the death tax permanent today?\n  On the farm bill, I voted against the farm bill because I thought it \nwas completely larded. I thought it was abusive in its spending. But \nhow come we had enough money to spend next year on the farm bill that \nis seven times as much as it would cost next year to make the death tax \nrepeal permanent? We had seven times as much money to spend 3 months \nago when we passed that bill, but we don't have one-seventh that amount \nto be sure that people don't have to sell their farm when their dad \ndies?\n  It is a matter of priorities. On the energy bill, we had more new tax \ncuts in that bill for the next year than it would cost to repeal the \ndeath tax.\n  The trade bill contains new entitlements, and we had several times as \nmuch new spending in that bill that we passed last month as would be \nrequired to pay for repealing the death tax.\n  In railroad retirement, we had 15 times as much in the first year as \nit would take to fund repealing the death tax.\n  And finally, in the stimulus bill, in the amount we spent above the \nPresident's request, we could have funded repeal of the death tax over \ntwice over.\n  Here is my point: I am not saying that every one of these things was \nterrible and there weren't good things in them. I am just saying, here \nare five examples where we spent multiples of the amount of money that \nwould be required this year for us to repeal the death tax. Nobody who \ntoday is saying we just don't have the money said that on any one of \nthose five things I mentioned. I said it, I believe, on each and every \none of them.\n  The point is, the people who are saying we don't have enough money to \nmake the repeal of the death tax permanent are the same people who \nvoted to spend all this money.\n  A final point on this issue: The Democrat budget that we voted on \nlast week on the floor and not one Member of the Senate voted for--I \nguess every Democrat thought it didn't spend enough and every \nRepublican thought it spent too much, but nobody voted for it--\nincreased spending on the discretionary account. I am not talking about \nnational security items. I am not talking about defense. I am talking \nabout $106 billion more than the President requested. That was more \nthan enough to have funded the repeal of the death tax. The same people \nwho thought we needed that $106 billion of spending now say we can't \nafford to repeal the death tax.\n\n  It is a matter of priorities. Many of our colleagues can never afford \nto let working people keep more of what they earn, but they can always \nafford to spend the money. That is what this debate is about.\n  It really boils down to this: First, we said we would repeal the \ndeath tax. It turns out it is coming back in 10 years. Should we make \nit permanent or not? Is it not wrong to force people to destroy the \nlife work of their parents to give the Government 55 cents out of every \ndollar they have ever earned and accumulated even though they paid \ntaxes on every penny of it?\n  Second, are these programs that we want to spend money on so valuable \nthat it is worth tearing up family farms and family businesses and the \nlife's work of our people to pay for it? I don't think so.\n  Finally, we have good, solid studies, including by our own Joint \nEconomic Committee, that suggest we are not even collecting money on \nthese taxes because they make the economy less efficient.\n  So this is really not even about money. This is about collective \ngreed in that we want to redistribute wealth when people die. We don't \nbelieve death ought to be a taxable event. That is what it boils down \nto.\n  Let me sum up, and then I will yield the floor. What is the No. 1 \nreason that 70 percent of all family businesses do not survive into the \nsecond generation? Seventy percent of all small businesses that \nsomebody founded do not survive into a successful operation by their \nchildren. Why? According to the National Federation of Independent \nBusiness, it is the death tax.\n  Eighty-seven percent of all small businesses fail before they get to \nthe third generation of the family member who started them. Why? The \nNFIB says the No. 1 reason is the death tax.\n  And finally, 60 percent of all small business owners report that they \nwould create new jobs over the coming year if estate taxes were \neliminated. We have businesses that are buying great big insurance \npolicies so their children won't have to sell the business. That money \ncould be going into the business instead of being wasted economically. \nIf you don't want to destroy small businesses, repeal the death tax.\n  My second point: Under the death tax, you are taxed once, you die, \nand then you are taxed again. Why is it right that you earn a dollar; \nthe Government takes 40 cents out of the dollar; you plow what is left \nof the aftertax dollar back into your business or your farm; you die; \nand your children have to sell the business or farm to pay a tax on the \n60 cents that you got to keep out of the original dollar? How is that \nright? It is not right.\n  No. 3, this is simple, it is clever, but it is just the truth, too. \nIt is just the pitiful truth. No one should have to visit the \nundertaker and the IRS on the same day. It is just not right. So often \nwe debate these things over numbers and budgets and all these other \nthings when this is an issue about right and wrong. This tax is wrong.\n  Finally, repealing the death tax would create jobs.\n  According to an article in the Wall Street Journal, ``The True Cost \nof Dying,'' on July 28, 1999, they estimate that repealing the death \ntax would create 200,000 jobs. Now, it is true that some of our \ncolleagues say if we take the tax cut back and we make people sell \ntheir farm or their business and give us 55 percent of its value, we \ncan spend it on programs. But are those programs worth 200,000 jobs? I \ndon't think so.\n  So we have before us a proposal that says let's repeal the death tax, \nbut only for a few people. Let's raise the cost now when we have a \ndeficit, but let's not eliminate the tax when we can afford it and when \nwe have a huge surplus. It makes no sense. The plain truth is that a \ngreat bulk of the cost of making this tax cut permanent occurs in the \nyear it expires, which is 2010, and by the most recent Congressional \nBudget Office projections our elimination of the death tax will occur \nin a year when we will have a surplus of $653 billion. And $335 billion \nof that will not belong to Social Security.\n  Why should we not repeal the death tax? Is there anything we can \nspend that money for that would be more valuable? I don't think so. I \nhope my colleagues will agree.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I appreciate the fine explanation of my \ncolleague from Texas. He has been an advocate of the repeal of the \ndeath tax for a long time. I am pleased to join with him in this \namendment and to be able to say that we have finally been able to bring \nbefore the Senate the permanent repeal of the death tax.\n  I want to make several points. I see that the Senator from Oklahoma \nis here. Was he intending to make a point at this time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I have about 7 or 8 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. I will go ahead. Will the Chair let me know when I have \nspoken for 12 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. KYL. I appreciate that. The first point the Senator from Texas \nmade was that the death tax is bad tax policy. Let me explain a little \nbit more of what we mean by that. The Tax Code generally taxes you for \nvoluntary conduct. If you sell property, you know there is going to be \na capital gains tax on that. If you work, you know you are going to \nearn income and you are going to be taxed on that. People make \ndecisions based upon tax consequences. But there are a few situations \nin our Tax Code that are treated as involuntary conversions.\n\n[[Page S5354]]\n\n  If the Government condemns your property and pays you money for that, \nyou don't want that money; you want your property. The Government \nrecognizes that as an involuntary action on your part, so you don't pay \nordinary income at that time on that money. If your house burns down \nand you collect money from an insurance policy, you didn't intend for \nthat to happen. The Government doesn't treat those insurance proceeds \nto you as ordinary income. It is taxed in a different way. The same \nthing is what we are proposing to do with the estate tax. Nobody \nintends for your father, or whoever it might be, to die. He certainly \ndoesn't. The money that you may get as a result of that is coming to \nyou involuntarily. You didn't take some action in order for it to \noccur. So that money coming to you should be treated in a different \nway.\n\n  The way that it is treated under the amendment of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota is to take 50 percent of the amount over $3 million. In \nother words, there is a $3 million exemption and, after that, every \nother dollar is taxed at 50 percent. If it is over $10 million, it is \nat 55 percent.\n  Now, that is bad tax policy. What we say instead is that the tax is \nnot due on the date of death. Death is not a taxable event. Instead, \nthe money passes to the heirs and, at that point, if they sell the \nproperty, there is a taxable event. You pay the capital gains on that \nproperty. In fact, the basis for the capital gain is the original basis \non when the property was purchased by the decedent, not the value at \nthe time of death. So, in effect, we are replacing one tax with another \ntax. Much of the revenue is not lost to the Treasury as a result. But \nat least as to the decision to pay Uncle Sam, the money comes from the \nvoluntary act of people who inherited the property and who are willing \nto pay the capital gains tax if they sell the property, or part of it.\n  But what you don't have to do, as the Senator from Texas said, is \nvisit the IRS the same day you visit the mortuary. That is wrong. That \nis why over 60 percent of the American people believe this is an unfair \ntax.\n  It is interesting that three-fourths of the people surveyed who say \nit is an unfair tax say they would favor its repeal, even though they \ndon't believe that repeal would have any effect on them because they \nwould not be receiving any of that money, or paying it, as an heir. So \nit is an unfair tax. As a matter of fact, the Senate agreed that it was \nunfair. We repealed it. A majority of Senators voted to repeal the \nestate tax.\n  Now, under the procedures under which that was done, no action that \nwe took could last longer than 10 years. So the irony is after 10 \nyears, none of our tax relief exists; it evaporates and we go back to \nwhere we were in 2001. Did we intend that? When we told our \nconstituents we reduced the marriage penalty and reduced their \nindividual income-tax rate and repealed the estate tax, were we kidding \nor did we really mean it? We will find out tomorrow.\n  If we were just kidding, then we will defeat the Gramm-Kyl amendment, \nor adopt some other proposal. If we meant what we said, saying we meant \nto repeal it, to cast the vote to do that, and since that sunsets after \n10 years, we are going to permanently repeal it with our vote today, \nyou will support the Gramm-Kyl amendment.\n  Some say this doesn't affect many people. The fact is that it doesn't \njust affect the rich. The descendant--the rich person--died. He cannot \nbe affected; he is gone. Most of the people who inherit the money are \nnot rich, and certainly the employees of their companies or the farms \nare not rich. So most of the people who are affected by the death tax \nare not wealthy at all.\n  The question is, Do you want to take half of what they are going to \nget from the person who worked so hard during his or her life to \nprovide it to them? According to the Treasury Department, 45,000 \nfamilies paid some level of estate tax in 1999. That is families. If it \nis a family of four, multiply that by 4 to see the number of people who \nare immediately affected, and then you can add to that the people \nindirectly affected. What is not included in the statistics is twice as \nmany people sell their business or their farms. Many more people are \nadversely impacted when jobs in the community are lost when a family-\nowned business is sold to pay the tax.\n  In addition, more than 2 percent of Americans bear the aggregate \ncosts of this tax--fees to lawyers and accountants and life insurance \nagents. As a matter of fact, it costs just about exactly as much for \nthe people who pay the lawyers and insurance agents and the accountants \nto avoid the total consequence of the tax as the Federal Government \ncollects from those who actually end up paying. So it ends up being a \ndouble tax on Americans. Half pay the tax to Uncle Sam and the other \nhalf pay the lawyers. I don't know which is worse.\n  The death tax not only impacts more than 2 percent of Americans, it \nburdens family-owned businesses under $100 million in value. According \nto the IRS, in 1999, 116,500 estate tax returns were filed; 60,700 of \nthese returns were filed by estates with values of less than a million \ndollars. Estates valued between $1 million and $5 million filed 50,600 \nreturns. There were 5,200 estates filed of more than 5 million. So even \ncombined, the millionaires filing for the tax do not exceed the \nnonmillionaires.\n  The bottom line is that Americans recognize it is an unfair tax. It \naffects a lot more people than the person who had wealth when he died. \nThe Senate recognized the same thing when it adopted the repeal of this \ntax.\n  Madam President, I was a bit surprised by the amendment of the \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  I know a lot of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \nopposed to permanent repeal of the estate tax. I thought what they \nwould do was offer a fairly generous package that would be tempting for \nour colleagues to vote for in lieu of the real repeal, which is the \nGramm-Kyl repeal. As it turns out, that was not done. It is a very \nstraightforward proposal which is not generous at all. As a matter of \nfact, it is worse--it is worse--than the status quo. People would be \nbetter off under the existing law, even without the ultimate repeal, \nthan they would be taking the amendment of the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  It is interesting that while he is concerned about the cost of repeal \nin the first 5 years, for which we have figures, the repeal of the \nproposal before us of the Senator from North Dakota would be about $22 \nbillion versus $9 billion for our proposal at a time when we are in a \ndeficit situation, as the Senator from Texas noted.\n  The only way this is made up is that in return for that, we \nimmediately go from a reduced rate of taxes under our bill and under \nthe status quo to a 50-percent rate under the amendment of the Senator \nfrom North Dakota. The exemption amount is $3 million. The exemption \nunder ours by the year 2009 is $3.5 million and, of course, in the \nfinal year, there is no need for an exemption from the estate tax \nbecause the estate tax is repealed.\n  Under the substitution of the capital gains tax for the estate tax in \nthe Gramm-Kyl proposal, we retain a $5.6 million equivalent to an \nexemption so that nobody will pay a capital gains tax who would not \nhave paid an estate tax. People are made whole, in other words.\n  Under no scenario would you be better off under the amendment of the \nSenator from North Dakota. You would be much better off under the \namendment Senator Gramm and I have proposed.\n  Let me make one other point. When we talk about the cost of this \nproposal, it is always a bit frustrating for me because we are talking \nabout lost revenues to the Federal Treasury. To me, that is not a cost; \nthat is an opportunity for Americans to keep more of their own money.\n  What we know from tax policy generally is if you reduce people's \ntaxes, you improve the status of the economy. One thing we forget when \nwe talk about the alleged cost of the repeal of the estate tax is the \npositive effect that has on the economy. A study conducted by Alan \nSinai shows the GDP of our country could increase a total of $150 \nbillion over 10 years and job growth could increase 165,000 per year \nwith repeal. The increase in household savings would be between $800 \nand $3,000 annually. So the impact on families and on the GDP would be \nsignificant from a repeal of the estate tax.\n  A Joint Economic Committee study estimates the existence of the tax \nhas reduced the Nation's pool of savings by $497 billion. An expert in \nthis area testified before our Finance Committee\n\n[[Page S5355]]\n\nand said immediate repeal of the death tax would result in a $40 \nbillion economic stimulus.\n  If you really want to stimulate the economy, if you really want to \ncreate more jobs, if you want to enhance the GDP and if you want to \nenhance personal savings and personal income, then repeal the tax.\n  It is true that the Federal Government is a little worse off if we \nrepeal the tax. It does not take in quite as much money. But American \nfamilies have a lot left, and the American economy is a lot healthier \nas a result.\n  What happens when the economy grows? We all know that tax collections \nby the Government actually increase when the economy grows. We do not \nhave an exact study on what Federal revenue increases would be, but we \nknow they would be significant.\n  A final point: There is always the bottom line argument: when you \ncannot scare people any other way, say that Social Security might be \naffected.\n  There is zero effect; there can be no effect on Social Security by \nrepeal of the death tax. The death tax has nothing to do with Social \nSecurity. The death tax goes to the general revenues. It is about 1 \npercent, 1.5 percent of general revenues. It has no impact on Social \nSecurity. It pays none of the Social Security benefits.\n  Today, in the year 2002, we will be taking in about $624 billion in \nSocial Security, and the payments to Social Security recipients are \nabout $465 billion, so we have about a $175 billion surplus in Social \nSecurity funds.\n  No Social Security recipient could be affected by repeal of the death \ntax. Let's at least understand that and not scare people by suggesting \nthere is an adverse impact on Social Security.\n  We have more points. I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, first, I compliment my friends, Senator \nKyl and Senator Gramm, for their leadership in trying to eliminate one \nof the most unfair taxes in U.S. history. We have a chance to do it. We \nhave two proposals that are before us. One is by Senator Gramm and \nSenator Kyl, of which I am a cosponsor, to repeal the death tax so \nthere will not be a taxable event on somebody's death. Now there will \nbe a taxable event when the property is sold, also known as a capital \ngains tax. That is 20 percent. That ought to be enough.\n  We are trying to make permanent the repeal in the year 2010. Let's \nmake that permanent. That is our objective. Under that scenario, if \nthere is property in an estate--let's say it is a business, a \nmanufacturing company, maybe it is a farm or ranch, maybe it is a \nrestaurant in downtown Washington, DC. That restaurant may sell for $5 \nmillion. Maybe it is a second or third generation restaurant, Mortons, \nand it is worth several million dollars. If the son or daughter takes \nover that business and they do not sell it, there is not a taxable \nevent. But if they decide it is too much of a hassle and they do not \nwant to continue the operation and they sell it, then there is a \ntaxable event. It will be taxed as capital gains at 20 percent instead \nof under Senator Conrad's proposal of 55 percent.\n  I probably shocked somebody when I said 55 percent. I read Senator \nConrad's proposal as 50 percent. He has an exemption of $3 million, and \nin a few years $3.5 million, but above that is taxable at 50 percent. \nIf you have an estate between $10 million and $17 million, there is \nanother 5 percent kicker, and so the Federal Government will get 55 \npercent.\n  Why in the world would the Federal Government be entitled to take \nover half of somebody's property for which they worked their entire \nlives? Should the Federal Government come in and take half or over \nhalf? That is what is in the Conrad proposal.\n\n  We have two competing proposals. What will the impact be? Look at the \nbusinesses in Washington, Oregon, or Maine. We can all think of very \nsuccessful people who have built businesses and have employed a lot of \npeople. A lot of those are worth more than $3.5 million. Senator \nConrad's proposal says we want half of the property's worth when \nsomebody passes away. I happen to think that is absolutely wrong. \nWhether the value of that business is $3 million or $100 million, if \nsomebody wants to continue operating that business, why should the \nGovernment come in and say: No, stop, we want half; somebody died; \nstop; we want the Federal Government to come in and take half? That is \nwhat Senator Conrad's proposal is. I object to that.\n  I learned the hard way. My grandfather started a business. My dad \nbuilt it up. He died when he was pretty young, and the Government came \nin and said: Stop, we want half. We fought the Government for 7 years. \nFrankly, the business was a small, family-held business, and Uncle Sam \nsaid: We want half of it. We objected to that and we fought them for \nyears. We ended up settling. They ended up getting a lot more than they \nshould have.\n  The Government's purpose and function should be to protect our \nproperty, not confiscate it. If one thinks about it, under the Conrad \nproposal, if they get half--and let's say it is over $3 million,--\nsomebody passes away this year, and then in the next generation \nsomebody else passes away 20 years later, and they get half again. What \na disincentive to grow, build, and expand.\n  There are countless generations across the country trying to grow, \nbuild and expand by employing more people and creating more products. I \nthink of a company in Perry, Oklahoma called Ditch Witch. They \nmanufacture trench makers. These machines are used to lay cable, phone \nlines, pipelines, help build roads, among many other uses. Perry, OK, \nhas a population probably of 12,000 people, of which Ditch Witch \nemploys a couple thousand. It is a great little family-owned business. \nWhy should the Government come in and say: Stop, the proprietor passed \naway; we want half of it? What about those thousands of jobs?\n  Look at another company called Bama Pies. They make pies in Tulsa, \nOK. They make millions of pies, including all the pies for McDonald's. \nThey employ hundreds, if not thousands, of people. It is a closely held \nbusiness.\n  Why should the Government come in and take half because the \nentrepreneur who built that business happens to pass away and the value \nof the business is in the millions? I do not think they should.\n  That is what we are talking about. Should the Government come in and \nsay, oh, well, you have been relatively successful, and because your \nestate is in the upper maybe 1 percent or 2 percent, it is okay if we \nsock it to you? What is right about that? What is fair about it? Where \nare the jobs that are in that kind of an ordeal? We think the \nGovernment can operate it better? Sorry, you have to sell it to pay \nestate taxes. We hope the company will survive in its next form. Maybe \nit will. Maybe it will not. There are a lot of operations that cannot \nwithstand that type of a heavy tax.\n  A farm or a ranch is another good example. You might have a fairly \ndecent farm or ranch maybe adjacent to a large city and so its property \nvaluation is very high. This value could maybe exceed it's agriculture \nvaluation, or the profits or the money that would be generated from the \nagriculture. Just because it happens to be next to San Diego it is \nworth millions on the valuation sheets. Maybe somebody says, well, I \nwant to continue farming it and ranching it; I am second or third \ngeneration. And we are going to say, no, we are sorry; we have valuated \nthis, and because it happens to be next to San Diego, it is worth \nmillions of dollars so the Federal Government is entitled to take half. \nThey cannot pay half by continuing their agricultural operation, so the \nonly way they can pay taxes is to sell it. What kind of victory is \nthat? We have just broken up a family business, a family farm, or a \nfamily ranch. Why? So Uncle Sam can take half that property? Maybe that \nproperty is not worth near as much in that present function. What right \ndo we have to do that?\n  Some taxes are wrong, and this tax happens to be one of those that \nare wrong. The power to tax, it has often been said, is the power to \ndestroy. If the Government can take half--and in the amendment of \nSenator Conrad, the Government can take half. If you have a taxable \nestate over $3 million, then they have taken away a lot of your--maybe \ndestroyed a lot of incentive to build, grow, expand, and employ. I \nthink of so many entrepreneurs who have built and expanded businesses \nthat are now worth millions of dollars.\n\n[[Page S5356]]\n\nI look at this amendment and it says: Stop; do not grow anymore because \nUncle Sam is going to come in and take half of it. We have decided that \nis our property and we can handle it better than you can. How many \nemployees will the Government hire out of that type of operation?\n  I completely disagree with the premise espoused of, let's keep the \nrates at 50 or 55 percent. Again, I mention the rate. Under the \nproposal of Senator Conrad, there is a maximum rate because he has this \nbonus 5 percent hit if your taxable estate is between $10 million and \n$17 million. Well, $10 million and $17 million sounds like a lot if \nthat is your disposable income, but if that is your investment that you \nhave grown in plant and equipment, and you are putting the money back \nin the business year after year, it may not be that big. You may not \nmake that much money. You may have a business that is worth $20 million \nbut it may not make very much money. Yet, under Senator Conrad's \namendment, too bad: You pass away, we have a taxable event, and Uncle \nSam gets half. If it is a $20 million business, take away your $3 \nmillion deductible and you have a $17 million business. Under his \nproposal, half of it goes to Uncle Sam--actually, 55 percent of the $17 \nmillion. The Government is going to get almost $9 million out of a $20 \nmillion business. Congratulations, you are really successful. If this \nis the case, where are the liquid assets in this $20 million business? \nYou do not have them. You have invested them in plant and equipment, in \nmachinery, in jobs. You did not have them sitting around in CDs and \ncash, so you have to sell the business to pay the taxes.\n\n  That is what the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota is. It \nsays, Government, you are entitled to take half; and many of us say, \nno, you are not. This tax is unfair. It needs to be repealed.\n  We took a giant step in that direction when we phased down the tax \nand repealed it in the year 2010. We need to make it permanent, and \nthat is exactly what the Gramm-Kyl-Nickles amendment does, makes it \npermanent. Senator Conrad's amendment says, no, we do not want to do \nthat. We will increase the exemption a little bit and then the \nGovernment is entitled to get half.\n  I hope my colleagues will reject that type of unfair tax policy that \nneeds to be repealed. Even if it applies to one small percentage of the \nAmerican population, it is not right to take it. One can say, well, is \nit right to take 100 percent of somebody's property if it only affects \na few? I think of that as theft, rather than good, sound tax policy.\n  I heard some people complain, what about the effects on deficits? I \nstarted looking at spending. I always hear when we talk about taxes, \nbut when we talk about spending we do not hear about people talking \nabout, what is the impact on Social Security? What is the impact on \nfuture deficits? Between the years 2000 and 2001, budget authority went \nup from $584 billion to $664 billion. That is a 14-percent increase. \nBetween the years 2001 and 2002, it went up to $710 billion. That is a \n7-percent increase. That was before we started working on the \nsupplemental. The budget we are working on now that just passed--if we \ninclude the supplemental that just passed Congress--is $768 billion. If \nwe add that together, that is an 8-percent increase over the previous \nyear. So we are compounding spending at 14, 7, 8 percent.\n  Then I look at some of the other requests. The farm bill that we \npassed about a month ago was $82 billion over the baseline. We are \npaying cotton farmers 72 cents per pound when we look at cotton that is \nselling for 32 cents. The market price for cotton is 32 cents, but we \nare going to pay farmers 72 cents for 6 years.\n  Look at railroad retirement. We are writing out a check for $15 \nbillion for railroad retirement, something we have never done before.\n  The Trade Adjustment Assistance Program we passed had $11 billion of \nnew entitlements, where the Federal Government is going to pick up 60 \npercent of health care costs for people who happen to be uninsured, \nunemployed.\n  We are going to have a new wage entitlement insurance program under \ntrade adjustment assistance. The supplemental was $3.9 billion over the \nPresident's request. The supplemental was almost $4 billion above the \nPresident's request. Trade adjustment assistance had $11.1 billion over \nthe President's request in new entitlements. The farm bill was $82.8 \nbillion over the baseline. Railroad retirement is $15 billion. So there \nis a lot of new spending in excess of about $120 billion that Congress \nhas passed in the last few months. Where is the outrage on the impact \non deficits on these bills?\n  When we start talking about not taking away half of somebody's \nproperty when they die and reject this tax policy, perhaps we should \nhave the tax policy be enacted when their property is sold by their \nbeneficiaries. Then there is a taxable event and that taxable event is \ntaxed at the capital gains rate, which is 20 percent. With this method, \nyou would eliminate these billions of dollars that are being spent \npresently to avoid the tax. To everyone who knows estate planning, the \nlawyers and the accountants, this is an enormous field, which in my \nopinion uses a lot of minds in a productive venture to avoid a very \nunfair tax.\n  If we said, let us have a tax on capital gains, it would simplify \ntaxation. I think we would see a lot of businesses grow if they did not \nreceive this signal, stop, do not grow anymore because we are going to \ntake half of everything you have. The economy would respond in a very \npositive way. We would create thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands, \nof jobs if we could repeal this unfair tax.\n  I urge my colleagues, when we vote tomorrow, when we have final \npassage, to vote in favor of the Gramm-Kyl-Nickles amendment to repeal \npermanently this unfair death tax.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I have been amazed at the argument from \nthe other side, absolutely amazed. My amendment is not as good as the \nstatus quo? Their proposal is better? What math are they using?\n  I grew up in North Dakota, went to North Dakota schools where one and \none is two; two and two is four; four and four is eight. That is the \nmath I learned. I don't know what math they are talking about.\n  Let's talk about the difference between my proposal before the Senate \nand their proposal. Let's talk about current law. They say mine is not \nas good as current law. Under current law, next year the exemption will \nbe $1 million. That is 2003. Under my proposal, the exemption is $3 \nmillion. So the rate for an individual who has an estate that is taxed \nnext year below $3 million, the rate is zero; their rate above $1 \nmillion is 41 percent. Which is better? A zero rate up to $3 million, \nas in my proposal? Or their proposal, which is a 41-percent rate over \n$1 million? Can we do the math? Which proposal means less tax to the \nindividual in the family? Zero percent up to $3 million? Or their \nproposal that says a 41-percent rate over $1 million.\n  Compare it to current law. My rate is zero percent up to $3 million. \nThey have zero up to $1 million. That is current law. But over that the \nrate is 41 percent. Let's see, are you going to pay less tax under my \nproposal or their proposal? Are you going to pay less tax under my \nproposal or under current law? Come on. I am ready to have an honest \ndebate but let's not twist things around and claim that my proposal \ntaxes more than your proposal. That stands truth and logic on its head.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield.\n  Mr. KYL. I agree with the point in the first year there is a greater \nbenefit for individuals but a higher cost to the Government. Would the \nSenator continue the timeline over the next 10 years?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be happy to do that.\n  The next year, 2004, their exemption is $1.5 million for current law \nwith a 41-percent rate. Their proposal is a $1.5 million exemption with \na 43-percent rate. My proposal is $3 million, nothing, no tax. So you \nare higher in 2003; you are higher in 2004; you are higher in 2005; you \nare higher in 2006; you are higher in 2007. That is a long time in \nwhich my proposal is better than your proposal.\n  Not only is my proposal better in terms of the taxpayer for those \nyears, my proposal is better for the Federal Government's Treasury and \nfor fiscal responsibility and for Social Security because our proposal \ncosts less over the\n\n[[Page S5357]]\n\nnext decade than does theirs. Why is that? Because at the end of the \ndecade they eliminate the estate tax completely. It does not matter how \nbig. It does not matter if you have a $50 billion estate, they say you \npay no tax.\n  The Senator from Texas talked about what is fair and right. Let me \ngive an example of why I think what he is proposing is less fair, is \nless right, than what I am proposing.\n  Under their proposal, someone with an estate of $50 million--for \nexample, Mr. Skilling, the executive who ran Enron. He would have his \nestate tax eliminated. The $55 million he would save would be \nequivalent to all of the Social Security taxes paid in one year by \n30,000 people earning $30,000. In other words, in their idea of what is \nfair, it is more important to take Mr. Skilling off the tax rolls \ncompletely, even though his gains, many might say, are ill gotten, it \nis more important to take him off than to worry about the 30,000 \nAmericans earning $30,000 a year paying that amount of money into \nSocial Security. Make no mistake, these things are directly related.\n\n  The proposal I have offered reforms the estate tax. It says nothing \nis paid starting next year if you are an individual with an estate of \nless than $3 million, and for a couple that is up to $6 million. You \npay zero. That is much better for next year, and 2004, and 2005, and \n2006, and 2007, than their proposal. But, at the same time, my proposal \ncosts less because we do not eliminate the estate tax. So my proposal \ncosts $12.6 billion in the first decade; their proposal costs $99.4 \nbillion. That is a dramatic difference. It is at a time when we will be \nrunning deficits for the entire next decade. Let me repeat that. We \nwill be running deficits for the entire next decade unless something \nchanges. And just hours ago we had to increase the debt of the United \nStates $450 billion. They are proposing a cost in the second 10 years \nof $740 billion.\n  Reform, not repeal, is the best thing for this country's economy, for \nour fiscal stability, and for fiscal responsibility. And interestingly \nenough, it is the best thing for taxpayers. It is the best thing for \ntaxpayers because they get a better break now. We go from a $1 million \nexemption to a $3 million. Next year, that would be $6 million for a \ncouple.\n  This idea of repeal which they have proposed is a hoax. I don't think \nit will ever happen. They can pass it now, but I don't think it will \nhappen. By some other name this tax will come back and we will have \ndenied people the ability to plan and we will also have denied people \nthe chance to get a greater exemption now, which is what I am \nproposing.\n  When I was raised, I was taught a bird in the hand is worth two in \nthe bush. This proposal I am making is a bird in the hand, a $3 million \nexemption, or a $6 million exemption for a couple, starting next year, \ninstead of the $1 million exemption that exists in current law and the \n$1 million they have in their plan.\n  The choice is pretty clear, pretty simple, but pretty important.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, our dear colleague has a substitute which \ncosts a ``fraction'' of a repeal but it is better. If his amendment \nsounds too good to be true, it is because it is too good to be true.\n  The first thing he never mentioned was if you are a small business or \nfamily farm and you are engaged in any estate planning, and we know \nthat small businesses and family farms spend dollars in estate \nplanning, this completely wipes all that out. I can show figures on a \nsmall business, a $10 million small business, the tax would equally be \nhigher next year under his proposal than under ours. But we do not have \nto get into all this gamesmanship. It really boils down to a simple \nquestion. We repeal the death tax for everybody.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield on that last point?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will yield. I only have a couple of minutes, so do it \nfast.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would love to see the calculation the Senator has.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will be glad to show him. I have someone from the \nFinance Committee here, the staff person who worked on this. She worked \nout the example of $10 million, and I will send her over with it so \nyour staff can take a look at it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would love to take a look at that.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Here is the point. We don't need to get into all this \nbusiness about ``he did,'' ``he didn't,'' ``he did,'' ``he didn't.'' It \nboils down to this. We said we repeal the death tax and we repealed it. \nOnly there is a trick: it comes back in 10 years.\n  Senator Kyl and I want to repeal it so it is dead forever. We do not \nthink death ought to be a taxable event. We don't think you ought to \nhave to sell your family's farm, business, or estate to pay tax on \nmoney which you have already paid taxes on.\n  The Senator says let's do it for some people but not other people. \nLet's do it for some Americans but not other Americans. And let's, at \nthe same time, ban all of the procedures whereby every small business \nin America and every family farm in America is planning for estate \ntaxes to try to minimize their costs.\n  The bottom line is: Are you for a repeal for everybody or are you for \na repeal for some of the people? It really boils down to that simple \nissue.\n  As for this argument about Social Security, I hope everybody \nunderstands that we collect a payroll tax for Social Security. The \ndeath tax collects less than 1 percent of revenues, and none of that \nmoney goes into Social Security. In fact, as I pointed out over and \nover and over, five times in the last 9 months we have spent \ncumulatively about 20 times the amount that it would take to repeal the \ndeath tax. So, obviously, it is not a question of money. It is a \nquestion of priorities.\n  I yield the floor. We are through on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Might I address a question to the Senator from North Dakota \nsince the Senator from Nevada is not here. It is our understanding \nunder the unanimous consent agreement the next amendment that will be \nlaid down will be laid down by Senator Dorgan or by Senator Reid on his \nbehalf?\n  Here is Senator Reid. Perhaps we could get this underway now. If I \ncould inquire of the Senator from Nevada, the time having expired under \nthe unanimous consent agreement on the first amendment laid down, is \nthe amendment of the Senator from North Dakota next? The next thing \nthat will transpire is that the Senator from Nevada on behalf of the \nother Senator from North Dakota will lay down an amendment; is that \nright?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota still has 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KYL. I am sorry. I thought the Chair said all time had expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Texas had \nexpired.\n  Mr. KYL. If the Senator from North Dakota still has 5 minutes, I will \nyield the floor to the Senator from North Dakota. But if we could get a \nclarification about what is going to happen when that time has expired, \nI would appreciate it.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator from North Dakota will yield without this \ntime counting against his 5 minutes, I will respond to the question of \nthe Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator, at this time the Senator from North \nDakota, Mr. Dorgan, is working on some minor changes in the amendment \nthat he offered previously. That amendment, I cannot go into detail on.\n\n  Basically, what it does is exempt from the estate tax small farms and \nbusinesses that let descendants take over after the death of the \nparty--the same amendment he offered previously that I think got 43 \nvotes. Basically, that is the amendment.\n  I do say to my friend, I just talked to the cloakroom and he is \nmaking some changes. We were and are entitled to two second-degree \namendments under the unanimous consent agreement. At this stage we may \nonly offer one of them. Senator Dorgan is trying to change the one \namendment so there may be one amendment rather than two. As soon as we \nget something in writing, we will let the Senator from Arizona know. I \ndo not think there is any question that the amendment you are going to \nlay down is the same one we have seen before, just an outright repeal?\n\n[[Page S5358]]\n\n  Mr. KYL. Also, not taking away the time of the Senator from North \nDakota, the Senator from Nevada is correct. I just inquire, then, for \nthe benefit of all Senators, when the Senator from North Dakota has \ncompleted his 5 minutes of concluding remarks, could the Senator from \nNevada explain what happens at that point?\n  Mr. REID. I have spoken to the majority leader. We have the Prime \nMinister of Australia coming for a joint session of Congress tomorrow \nmorning. We are going to do a limited amount of morning business in the \nmorning. Then the escort committee would go with the Senators over to \nthe House side and listen to that speech. That is expected to be \ncompleted and we will be back in session approximately 12:30 tomorrow \nafternoon.\n  At that time, Senator Dorgan will lay down his second-degree \namendment with a 2-hour time limit. We would vote at approximately 2:30 \non the Dorgan amendment, then the Conrad amendment, and then we would \nturn to the Senator from Texas. He would lay down his amendment which \nwould probably be around 3:15. At 5:15 or 5:30, thereabouts, debate on \nthat would be completed, and I hope on or about that time we could vote \non the amendment of the Senator from Texas and be finished with this \nmatter.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If the Senator will yield, let me just reaffirm so \neverybody knows, I will offer exactly the language that passed the \nHouse, repealing the death tax permanently. So if we did it, it would \ngo right to the President, he would sign it into law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, let me conclude this debate as I began. \nI believe our votes must be informed by the current fiscal condition of \nthe country. As the President said to us last year, his budget was \ngoing to pay off $2 trillion of debt over the next decade. He said, at \nthat time, that would be the largest debt reduction of any country \never.\n  Now the President comes to us 1 year later and says: Whoops, forget \nabout that. Forget about maximum paydown of the debt. Forget about \npaying down more debt than any country ever. Instead of paying down \ndebt, I am asking you, Members of Congress, for the second biggest \nincrease in the debt in our Nation's history.\n  The only bigger request for an increase in the debt was made by the \ncurrent President's father when he was President. He asked for and \nreceived a $915 billion increase in the national debt in one fell \nswoop, in November of 1990.\n  Now comes this President and he asks for a $750 billion increase in \nthe debt, the second biggest in our Nation's history.\n  We all have to think a moment about the changed circumstances. Just \nhours ago, this Chamber voted to increase this Nation's debt by $450 \nbillion. Now our colleagues on the other side are here saying they want \nto increase the debt another $100 billion in this 10 years, by another \n$740 billion in the second decade.\n  Let's look at where we are and where we are headed. This chart shows \nthat from 1992 to 2000 we pulled out of deficit. We got ourselves into \ncircumstances in which we were running surpluses. Last year with the \nPresident's budget plan we plunged back into deficit, and we now are \ntold that we can expect deficits the entire rest of the decade. That is \nbefore their proposal to dig the hole even deeper. And the outlook for \nthe years beyond is even more serious.\n  That brings us to the question of what do we do on the estate tax. I \nacknowledge we need to reform the estate tax--$1 million is too low for \na tax to be imposed. So I proposed that next year we go to $3 million \nof exemption for an individual estate; $6 million for a couple. They \nwould pay zero under my proposal. A couple would pay no estate tax up \nto $6 million. Our friends on the other side, they don't get to $3 \nmillion until 2009.\n  My proposal also freezes the maximum estate tax rate at 50 percent. \nIt retains stepped-up basis. I know that is a confusing term, but it is \nan important one. What it means is that in the future, you will pay \ntaxes on what you inherit based on the value at the time you inherit \nit, not what grandpa paid for the property, not what grandma paid for \nthe property, but what it was worth when it passed to you.\n  That is a very important difference between their proposal and mine. \nWhile my proposal is more generous to taxpayers in the short term, it \nis also more fiscally responsible because we don't eliminate the estate \ntax completely as their proposal does. They are proposing to eliminate \nthe estate tax completely after the year 2010. My proposal saves \nhundreds of billions of dollars that otherwise are going to come \nstraight out of Social Security. There is no other place for it to come \nfrom. They deny it. They say this has no effect on Social Security. \nReally? Where is the money coming from? There is only one place it can \ncome from; that is, straight out of Social Security.\n  My proposal will reduce the number of estates that are taxable from \nthe current level, which is 2 percent. Only 2 percent of all estates in \nAmerica have any tax. I would reduce that to three-tenths of 1 percent, \nbut at the same time save the fiscal position of the country.\n  There is no question that what they are talking about--estate tax \nrepeal--raids Social Security trust funds. Look at what it does. Their \nidea of fairness is to eliminate the estate taxes for somebody like Mr. \nSkilling, former CEO of Enron, who would save under their plan an \nestimated at $55 million. That is equivalent to all of the Social \nSecurity taxes paid in a year by 30,000 American people earning \n$30,000.\n  They say their proposal is fair. They say their proposal is \nequitable. I don't see it. Taking all of the taxes from 30,000 people \nearning $30,000 a year to eliminate the estate taxes of Mr. Skilling is \nnot fair.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The clerk will call the roll.\n\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wanted to announce that there will be \nno further votes today. I appreciate the vigorous debate we have had on \nthe Conrad amendment, and appreciate Senators coming to the floor to \nmove the schedule along.\n  It is my hope that we will have a vote at approximately 2:30 \ntomorrow, and it may be stacked with another amendment.\n  I urge Senators to offer their amendments because we will miss a \nwindow here, and we will then make a point of order on the bill itself \nsometime tomorrow.\n  We are not going to wait for Senators. They are either going to offer \ntheir amendments or they are going to miss the opportunity.\n  So those Senators who have amendments need to come to the floor and \nlay them down and have the debate, as Senator Conrad did this \nafternoon.\n  We will pick up this debate again tomorrow morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/11/senate-section/article/S5358-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I recognize an American who honorably \nserved our Nation for nearly 40 years. At the age of 25, Lieutenant \nFloyd Calvert Jr., an Oklahoman and Cherokee Indian, served as a bomber \npilot in the U.S. Army Air Corps flying B-29 aircraft in the Pacific \nTheater during World War II.\n\n[[Page S5359]]\n\n  On June 1, 1945, Lt. Calvert and his crew of ten from the 504th Bomb \nGroup took off from Tininan Island, in the Marianias to strike Osaka, \nJapan. Immediately after delivering his ordnance, his B-29 aircraft was \nhit and severely damaged by anti-aircraft artillery fire. Lt. Calvert's \nheadset was blown off inflicting wounds in his scalp and left arm. His \nco-pilot was also wounded and unable to assist in flying the damaged B-\n29. With the right inboard engine on fire, Lt. Calvert placed his \naircraft in a steep dive to extinguish the flames. With the fire out he \ntried in vain to feather the engine but the runaway propeller spun off \nand flew into the right outboard engine, creating a very grave \nsituation with both engines on the right side inoperable. Lt. Calvert's \ncrew decided to remain with the crippled B-29. Wounded and bleeding, \nLt. Calvert flew solo toward the airfield at Iwo Jima. To reduce the \naircraft's weight and extend its range, he proceeded to jettison all \nremovable items, to include life rafts, reducing their chances of \nsurvival if they had to ditch the aircraft into the Pacific Ocean. Once \nover Iwo Jima, Lt. Calvert circled his bomber to permit other bomber \naircraft to recover or bail out over the tiny island. In a feat of \nunprecedented airmanship and heroism, Lt. Calvert then flew a flawless \napproach and landing, bringing his crew to safety in an aircraft that \nwould never fly again.\n  Like so many of his time, Lt. Calvert returned to Oklahoma and began \na fifty-one year marriage and raised five children. He worked for 34 \nyears as a federal employee at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma City \nand served on his local school board and in his church. Today, at age \n82, he resides with his youngest daughter, her husband and their two \nchildren, and he remains an inspiration to our generation as we look \nback and admire the heroes of our past. I thank him for his unwavering \nservice and sacrifice to the United States of America. May God bless \nFloyd Calvert Jr. and his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/11/senate-section/article/S5359-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECOGNITION OF THE VALOR, DEDICATION, AND PATRIOTISM OF CHALDEAN \n                           AMERICAN VETERANS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, later this month, on June 14th, people in \nmy home state of Michigan will be gathering at a special ceremony to \nhonor men and women of the U.S. armed forces who have served to \npreserve our nation's freedom. This ceremony held by the Chaldean \nAmerican Ladies of Charity will pay tribute to Chaldean American men \nand women who have served or are currently serving in our Nation's \nmilitary.\n  It is particularly poignant that people are gathering to honor \nChaldean American veterans on the day set aside to honor our foremost \nsymbol of freedom: the American flag. At a time when we are reminded of \nthe priceless value of our many freedoms, it is important that we do \nnot forget the heroes who fought so fearlessly and valiantly in past \nconflicts to protect our nation and our freedoms. Such brave men and \nwomen have preserved our liberty and democratic values and safeguarded \nour freedom to pursue the American dream.\n  The Chaldeans are people who possess a long and fascinating history. \nThey have traditionally spoken a form of Aramaic, the language in which \nthe New Testament was written, and possess an interesting theological \nhistory that includes a reunion with the Roman Catholic Church in 1551 \nA.D. This reunion led to the establishment of the Chaldean rite of the \nCatholic Church.\n  Many Chaldeans immigrated to the United States from Iraq, and have \nplayed an important part in our nation's growth and success. Detroit is \nprivileged to be home to the largest Chaldean community in the United \nStates. In Detroit and throughout the nation, Chaldean Americans have \ndedicated themselves to the making a better life in America. Detroit, \nthe State of Michigan and our nation have benefitted from their \npatriotism, hard work and dedication to community, faith and family. \nThese many contributions have greatly benefitted our nation and have \nincluded the service of nearly two hundred Chaldean Americans in the \nUnited States Armed Forces.\n  The entire Chaldean American community can take pride in their long \nand honorable tradition of service to our nation, particularly their \nservice in our nation's armed forces. I am sure that my Senate \ncolleagues join me and the Chaldean American Ladies of Charity in \npaying tribute to Chaldean American veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/11/senate-section/article/S5359-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5359-S5360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REMEMBERING THE MIA'S OF SULTAN YAQUB ON THE TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF \n                             THEIR CAPTURE\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join \nme in remembering the Israeli soldiers captured by the Syrians during \nthe 1982 Israeli war with Lebanon. It is with great sadness that we \nmark today 20 long years of anguish for their families, who continue to \ndesperately seek information about their sons.\n  On June 11, 1982, an Israeli unit battled with a Syrian armored unit \nin the Bekaa Valley in northeastern Lebanon. Sergeant Zachary Baumel, \nFirst Sergeant Zvi Feldman, and Corporal Yehudah Katz were captured by \nthe Syrians that day. They were identified as an Israeli tank crew, and \nreported missing in Damascus. The Israeli tank, flying the Syrian and \nPalestinian flag, was greeted with cheers from bystanders.\n  Since that terrible day in 1982, the governments of Israel and the \nUnited States have been doing their utmost by working with the office \nof the International Committee of the Red Cross, the United Nations, \nand other international bodies to obtain any possible information about \nthe fate of the missing soldiers. According to the Geneva Convention, \nSyria is responsible for the fates of the Israeli soldiers because the \narea in Lebanon where the soldiers disappeared was continually \ncontrolled by Syria. To this day, despite promises made by the \ngovernment of Syria and by the Palestinians, very little information \nhas been released about the condition of Zachary Baumel, Zvi Feldman, \nand Yehudah Katz.\n  Today marks the anniversary of the day that these soldiers were \nreported missing in action. Twenty pain-filled years have passed since \ntheir families have seen their sons, and still Syria has not revealed \ntheir whereabouts nor provided any information as to their condition.\n  One of these missing soldiers, Zachary Baumel, is an American citizen \nfrom my home of Brooklyn, New York. An ardent basketball fan, Zachary \nbegan his studies at the Hebrew School in Boro Park. In 1979, he moved \nto Israel with other family members and continued his education at \nYeshivat Hesder, where religious studies are integrated with army \nservice. When the war with Lebanon began, Zachary was completing his \nmilitary service and was looking forward to attending Hebrew \nUniversity, where he had been accepted to study psychology. But fate \ndecreed otherwise and on June 11, 1982, he disappeared with Zvi Feldman \nand Yehudah Katz.\n  During the 106th Congress, I co-sponsored and helped to pass Public \nLaw 106-89, which specifies that the State Department must raise the \nplight of these missing soldiers in all relevant discussions and report \nfindings to Congress regarding developments in the Middle East. We need \nto know that every avenue has been pursued in order to help bring about \nthe speedy return of these young men. Therefore, I strongly feel that \nwe must be sure to continue the full implementation of Public Law 106-\n89, so that information about these men can be brought to light.\n\n  Zachary's parents Yonah and Miriam Baumel have been relentless in \ntheir pursuit of information about Zachary and his compatriots. I have \nworked closely with the Baumels, as well as the Union of Orthodox \nJewish Congregations of America, the American Coalition for Missing \nIsraeli Soldiers, and the MIA Task Force of the Conference of \nPresidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. These groups have \nbeen at the forefront of this pursuit of justice. I want to recognize \ntheir good work and ask my colleagues to join me in supporting their \nefforts. For two decades these families have been without their \nchildren. Answers are long overdue.\n  I am not only saddened by the plight of Zachary Baumel, Zvi Feldman, \nand Yehudah Katz, but I am disheartened and angered by the fact that \neven as we\n\n[[Page S5360]]\n\nhave continued to search for answers about their welfare, we have been \nforced to add more names to the list of those for who we have no \nknowledge of their location, health, or safety.\n  IDF Soldier Guy Chever disappeared without a trace from his army base \nin the Golan on August 17th, 1997. Almost three years later, Colonel \nElchanan Tanenbaum was kidnapped by Hezbollah while on a business trip \nin Europe on October 15th, 2000. Left behind are two more families who \nsimply do not know what has become of their loved ones.\n  And at this time, I feel it is also appropriate to speak not only of \nthose who remain missing, but for those who were unfairly taken from \ntheir families never to return. I am speaking of course of Sergeant Adi \nAvitan of Tiberias, Staff Sergeant Binyamin Avraham of Bnei Brak, and \nStaff Sergeant Omar Souad of Salma.\n  In a clear-cut violation of international law, these three Israeli \nsoldiers were abducted by Hezbollah on October 7, 2000 while on \noperational duty along the border fence in the Dov Mountain range along \nIsrael's border with Lebanon. It is believed that they were wounded \nduring the incident.\n  According to an investigation by the IDF Northern Command, Hezbollah \nterrorists set two roadside bombs, then crossed through a gate near the \nfence, pulled the three soldiers out of their jeep and fired anti-armor \nmissiles at the empty vehicle. The soldiers were then taken by the \nterrorists to the Lebanese side of the border. Although the United \nStates called on Syria to assist in the timely release of these three \nsoldiers, no information was given as to their conditions or \nwhereabouts. The International Red Cross had also been requested to \nintervene by attempting to arrange for a visit with the three kidnapped \nIDF soldiers in order to ascertain their status.\n  After much soul searching and heartache, it was determined that the \nreturn of these men to their homes and loved ones could no longer be \nhoped for. Their families have grieved, and my heart goes out to them. \nThe hope I hold now is that we will not allow the families of those who \nremain missing to suffer in the same way.\n  The agony of the families of these kidnapped Israeli soldiers is \nextreme. They have not heard a word regarding the fate of their sons \nwho are being held captive for political ransom. We must pledge to do \nour utmost to bring these soldiers home, for the same of peace, decency \nand humanity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/11/senate-section/article/S5360-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. President, last week I introduced with my colleague \nfrom Nevada, Senator Reid, the Support of American Silver Eagle Bullion \nProgram Act. This legislation will preserve our most successful silver \ncoin program, the American Silver Eagle Bullion Program.\n  From the inception of the program, the Silver Eagle coin has been the \ndomestic and global market share leader in commemorative coin programs. \nIt is also the largest of the United States Mint's silver coin \nprograms. From Fiscal Year 1995-2001, the program has generated \nrevenues of more than $264 million. Profits from this program \nultimately go into the Treasury General Fund, which reduces the \ngovernment's debt.\n  Since 1986, the Mint, through interagency agreements with the Defense \nLogistics Agency, has been using the Strategic and Critical Materials \nStockpile as a source of silver from the American Eagle Silver Bullion \nProgram. The use of the Stockpile silver is a result of legislative \nmandates. This stockpile of silver, which had a beginning balance of \n137.5 million ounces, is rapidly being depleted. At the current rate of \ndepletion, the silver will be depleted in approximately two months.\n  With the depletion of silver reserves in the Defense Logistics Agency \nStockpile, it has become necessary for the Department of the Treasury \nto acquire silver from other sources in order to continue the Silver \nEagle Program. This bill adds a stockpile depletion contingency \nprovision to the United States Code that allows the Secretary of the \nTreasury to obtain silver from other available sources, while not \npaying more than the average world price.\n  I rise today to introduce this legislation because it is vital to the \neconomy in my home State of Idaho. The mines of the Silver Valley in \nNorth Idaho produce more than $70 million of silver per year, along \nwith employing over 3,000 Idahoans and contributing more than $900 \nmillion to the overall Idaho economy.\n  Moreover, I am proud to recognize that the blanks used by the United \nStates mint in their American Eagle Silver Bullion Program are produced \nby Sunshine Minting, Inc., in Coeur d'Alene, ID. Approximately 60 \npeople at Sunshine Minting work directly on the U.S. Mint Silver Eagle \nProgram.\n  Idaho's mining sector is a critical component of our national \neconomy, and this bill makes certain that we preserve the Silver Eagle \nprogram and keep valuable mining jobs in Idaho and other silver mining \nstates. It is my hope that the Senate will move expeditiously to \nconsider and pass this legislation before the stockpile is deleted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/11/senate-section/article/S5360-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        FOUR SOUTH CAROLINA STUDENTS TO PRESENT HISTORY PROJECTS\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS.

RALPH GAMBER, FOUNDER OF DUTCH GOLD HONEY\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, Friday, June 14, is our National \nFlag Day. This year, Flag Day has special meaning for many in \nLancaster, PA, it will be a day of remembrance for the life and work of \nW. Ralph Gamber. It is particularly appropriate that Ralph's legacy \nwill be honored on Flag Day; in many ways, he lived the American dream \nthrough the kind of patriotism that is grounded in community \ninvolvement and love of family. The company Ralph founded in 1946, \nDutch Gold Honey, Inc., will also be honored as part of his legacy and \nthose who will gather at the site of his family business in Lancaster \nwill dedicate a flagpole in his memory.\n  Ralph Gamber began his honey processing business with a $27 \ninvestment in three beehives in the mid-1940s. What was initially a \nhobby of canning honey in the family garage grew to be a vehicle for \ninnovation and a model for the success of hard work and family \ncooperation. Today, Dutch Gold Honey is one of the largest independent \nhoney packers in the nation and, as an industry symbol of quality and \npartnership, remains family-owned and operated. The plastic honey bears \nseen on the shelves of every grocery store in America are Ralph's \ninvention and their success led to the creation of the Gamber\n\n[[Page S5361]]\n\nContainer Company. Ralph, his wife Luella, and his three children have \nmade an incredible contribution to the Lancaster area through their \nbusiness accomplishments. Ralph served a term as president of the \nNational Honey Packers & Dealers and in 1992, was recognized as \nPennsylvania Entrepreneur of the Year by Entrepreneur Magazine. \nAdditionally, the Gambers established the Gamber Foundation, a resource \nto support local charities and nonprofit organizations, honeybee \nresearch, and scholarships for the children of Dutch Gold Honey \nemployees.\n  Ralph Gamber's legacy, however, is not limited to his honey-related \nwork. His life's worth of community and family focus is what earns him \nparticular attention on Flag Day. To Ralph, work was an extension of \nfamily togetherness and he firmly believed that when families pray \ntogether, they stay together. Evidently, a family that stays together \nis one that can also share in building a unique, successful business. \nRalph would count his 66-year marriage, three children, eight \ngrandchildren, and nine-great-grandchildren among his greatest \naccomplishments. He was involved with the Salvation Army and helped to \nfound his local fire company. He was a veteran of the Second World War \nand, with a strong connection to his church, Ralph acted as Sunday \nschool superintendent for many years, was a member of his church \ncouncil, and later chaired the church's stewardship committee. \nThroughout his life and through his livelihood, Ralph has demonstrated \nhis commitment to the community and people he cared so much about. I \nshare his story today because I believe it is worthy of our admiration \nand it is evidence of how the American Dream continues to inspire us.\n  My thoughts will be with the family and friends of Ralph Gamber this \nFlag Day. When our national banner is raised over Dutch Gold Honey, it \nwill be a reminder to all who see it that love, perseverance, and \ncommunity are the keys to success in family and in life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/11/senate-section/article/S5361-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5361-S5362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMERICA: A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, each year the American Immigration \nLaw Foundation and the American Immigration Lawyers Association sponsor \na national writing contest on immigration. Thousands of fifth-grade \nstudents from across the country participate in the competition, \nresponding to the statement, ``Why I'm Glad America is a Nation of \nImmigrants.''\n  These essays remind us that it is of great importance that we not \nforget our rich history and heritage as a nation of immigrants. \nContinued immigration is part of our national well-being, our identity \nas a nation, and our strength in today's world.\n  I had the privilege of serving as one of the judges for this year's \ncontest, and was very impressed by the young writers. In their essays, \nthe students showed great pride in our Nation's diversity and its \nimmigrant heritage, and many told the story of their own family's \nimmigration.\n  I am pleased to announce that this year's winner is a Massachusetts \nresident, Nicole Florio, a fifth-grade student in Framingham, MA. In \nher poem, ``Why Am I Glad,'' Nicole explores the value of her friends' \ncultures and how their diversity enhances her life. She describes the \ndiverse traditions and treasures of her friends, from Ceilidh's Irish \nstep-dancing to Anastasia's nesting dolls. In the final stanza, Nicole \nnotes how she herself is a product of immigrants, as all of us are, and \nthat without immigration, ``there would be no me!''\n  Other students honored for their creative essays were Mike Duffy of \nSarasota, FL, Emily Friedman of Los Angeles, CA, Christina Jundt of \nNorcross, GA, and Ilana Pena of North Miami Beach, FL.\n  I believe that these award-winning essays in the ``Celebrate \nAmerica'' contest will be of interest to all of us in the Senate, and \nask that they be printed in the Record.\n  The essays follow.\n\n            Why Am I Glad America Is a Nation of Immigrants\n\n (By Nicole Florio, Hemenway Elementary School, Farmingham, MA, Grand \n                             Prize Winner)\n\n     People come to America\n     from many different places,\n     I have lots of friends\n     of many different races.\n\n     Ceilidh's from Ireland,\n     we have loads of fun,\n     she taught me Irish step-dancing\n     we dance till day is done!\n\n     Jessica's from Colombia,\n     she speaks Spanish,\n     to speak two languages\n     is my wish.\n\n     Anastasia is from Russia,\n     I adore her nesting dolls,\n     I looked for them\n     in all of the malls.\n\n     Cara and Cady are from China,\n     Cady's grandma grows bamboo.\n     They both love Chinese New Year\n     and I do too!\n\n     Murat is from Turkey,\n     his wedding I did love,\n     when we left the\n     fireworks blasted 'bove!\n\n     Nicole is from Israel,\n     she is thirteen.\n     When she had her Bat Mitzvah\n     she looked like a queen!\n\n     If I didn't have these friends,\n     how boring life would be!\n     I'm glad America has immigrants\n     as you can plainly see.\n\n     Mom's family is from Poland,\n     Dad's from Italy,\n     if my grandparents didn't come\n     there would be no me!\n\n       Based on a true story!\n                                  ____\n\n\n            Why I Am Glad America Is a Nation Of Immigrants\n\n     (By Mike Duffy, Pine View Elementary, Sarasota, FL, Runner-Up)\n\n       I am glad America is a nation of immigrants. When the \n     original immigrants came to America, they came here seeking \n     freedom of expression, religious freedom, and freedom from \n     oppression. This helped to form our constitution, which gives \n     us those same equal rights today.\n       The diverseness of the people who came here for \n     opportunities brought about a culture that the world had not \n     previously seen before. It also gave us ideas that would have \n     never come to light otherwise.\n       Living with other cultures teaches us new things and makes \n     us more tolerant and understanding of our fellow man. The \n     education we gave each other makes us more open to new ideas \n     and better technology. Our nation is the strongest and best \n     because of our unity.\n       In America all religions are practiced freely. Our \n     different beliefs are acknowledged and respected. This makes \n     us strong and proud. Our way of life is often challenged \n     though. Freedom is always at stake from those who wish to \n     dominate. Brave immigrants past and present, who took the \n     chance of coming here for a better life; help keep our \n     country free and strong. Once they have enjoyed the freedom \n     we have, they are willing to stand up and fight to keep that \n     freedom.\n       Mutual respect, which all people can enjoy here in this \n     country, is why we (all cultures) come together so readily, \n     when any part of our nation is in trouble. It is living proof \n     that despite our differences we are all Americans at heart.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                         A Nation of Immigrants\n\n (By Emily Friedman, Stephen S. Wise Elementary, Los Angeles, CA, AILA \n              Southern California Chapter Contest Winner)\n\n       In early September my teachers asked, ``Do you think \n     America is a melting pot or a salad bowl?'' After thinking \n     about it, I decided America is neither. America is not like a \n     melting pot because all the cultures do not blend together \n     and become unnoticeable. However, America is not a salad bowl \n     because cultures do not stay as distinct as lettuce and \n     cucumbers in a salad. I thought America should be described \n     as a chunky, minestrone soup. The ingredients stay distinct, \n     but as the soup simmers, the ingredients like cultures \n     interact and blend with each other.\n       The different spices and vegetables that go into minestrone \n     soup are like the immigrants from different places around the \n     world. The immigrants spice up the soup and make it \n     flavorful. With the exception of Native Americans, we were \n     all once immigrants. The best secret of a minestrone soup is \n     that it never stays the same. As immigrants come from all \n     over the world, they contribute to the taste of the soup. \n     They bring their language, traditions, foods and customs and \n     their various dreams for a better life for freedom and \n     opportunity. They also add their ideas for a better America \n     and make contributions to our society.\n       I am proud to live in a country where people can be free \n     and where everyone can contribute. I am glad America is a \n     nation of immigrants because without them, America wouldn't \n     be a chunky bowl of delicious minestrone soup.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    America--A Nation of Immigrants\n\n  (By Christina Jundt, Simpson Elementary School, Norcross, GA, AILA \n                    Atlanta Chapter Contest Winner)\n\n       As Immigrants traveled over the rolling sea, checked in at \n     Ellis Island, suffered\n\n[[Page S5362]]\n\n     through minimum wage jobs, and endured criticism from the \n     people around them, they had no idea they would change \n     American people, and America itself forever.\n       America is like a giant mosaic--the most beautiful in the \n     world.

So \n     much of our lives would be different if it wasn't for the \n     diverse nationalities, and the Immigrants that traveled from \n     those nations.

When you take a bite, you still \n     taste each individual vegetable, but mixed all together, the \n     salad is delicious. Each American has his own distinct \n     identity yet mixes together to create our wonderful America, \n     a country made up of different people, with different \n     cultures and backgrounds.\n       Being a country of immigrants makes America a dynamic place \n     to live.

Also a native son of Wyoming, \nhis work for me and the great State extends deeply into the heart and \nsoul of the West and will continue long into the future.\n  Dan joined my office in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1991 \nright out of school. Dan did a great job for me and was promoted to \nCommunications Director when I was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1994.\n  Dan has not only been valuable in Washington, he was also a crucial \npart of three, statewide, victorious campaigns. He also took time from \nour efforts on sabbatical to assist with the success of my good friend \nand colleague, Senator Enzi, on his initial election effort in 1996.\n  We're part of a team, my staff and I. Along with my wife, Susan, we \nfeel strongly bound to service for the people of Wyoming. As we say in \nthe West, Dan's a good hand. That's a high compliment. It means that \nhe's part of the team, reliable in a storm or any circumstance. In the \nHouse, Senate and on the campaign trail, Dan has proved to be one of \nthe brightest and most effective public policy communicators and \npolitical strategists in Wyoming and Washington.\n  Dan has decided to join Brimmer Communications and will lead a new \nWashington, DC office for the public relations firm based in Jackson \nHole, Wyoming. While it's always hard to see good people move on, in \nthis case, I'm glad Dan plans to go to a strong firm at home and stay \nclose to Wyoming people.\n  I'm not always the best at saying good-bye. I don't like to say it. \nSo I'll just say see you, and I hope that's true. I'll look forward to \nit.\n  To our friend, Dan, I wish him and his wife, Isabel, the best of \nluck, and I know the Senate does as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/11/senate-section/article/S5362-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   COMMEMORATION OF KING KAMEHAMEHA I\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today in commemoration of the \nbirthday of Hawaii's first monarch, King Kamehameha I. More than two \ncenturies since his birth, Kamehameha is a legendary, indeed, mythical \nfigure renown worldwide for his bravery and martial brilliance. He \ncommands the respect of Hawaii's people for his wise and just \nleadership, and his accomplishments continue to influence and govern \nHawaii today.\n  Historically, Kamehameha is notable because of his brilliance as a \nmilitary strategist and political leader. Kamehameha adapted Western \ninnovation, weaponry, and science to gain a decisive advantage in his \ndrive to unify the Hawaiian Islands. For Native Hawaiians and the \npeople of Hawaii, Kamehameha is beloved for his concern and attention \nto the well-being of his subjects and for his commitment to do what was \njust and right for the people.\n  Kamehameha's wisdom, even more than his strength, stature, and \ndaring, is his greatest and most enduring legacy for Hawaii's \nindigenous peoples--the Native Hawaiians, the people of Hawaii, and all \nstudents of history. Mamalohoe, the Law of the Splintered Paddle, is \nthe most prominent example of Kamehameha as a wise and just leader. \nMamalahoe is Hawaii's first Bill of Rights protecting the common people \nfrom assault, and it is still part of our State's constitution.\n  One hundred and ninety years ago, in the summer of 1812, Kamehameha \nreturned to the Kona Coast. Having unified the islands and established \npeace and stability, Kamehameha worked to build prosperity for his \npeople by increasing agricultural production and foreign trade.\n  The first observance of a day honoring King Kamehameha was proclaimed \nby King Kamehameha V on June 11, 1872, in the Kingdom of Hawaii. It \nremains an annual holiday in the State of Hawaii. This year marks the \n130th anniversary of the only holiday in the United States created to \nhonor a once-reigning monarch in the only state that was once a \nkingdom, the State of Hawaii.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/11/senate-section/article/S5362-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5362-S5363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MISSION OF PEACE HOUSING COUNSELING AGENCY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have come today to ask the Senate \nto join with me in paying tribute to the Mission of Peace Housing \nCounseling Agency which is located in the City of Flint, in my home \nstate of Michigan.\n  Home ownership has long been one of the best ways for individuals and \nfamilies to acquire capital, build equity and secure entry into the \nmiddle class. Mission of Peace Housing Counseling Agency was founded in \n1997 by Reverend Elmira Smith-Vincent to assist those who desire to own \ntheir own home thereby gaining further control over their financial \nfutures. As a real estate agent, Reverend Smith-Vincent saw a need to \neducate people and provide them with the skills needed to purchase a \nhome. A faith-based, non profit agency, Mission of Peace Housing \nCounseling Agency provides assistance to families and individuals in \nthe skills needed to purchase a home.\n  Since its inception, Mission of Peace Housing Counseling Agency has \ndeveloped strong working relationships with the Department of Housing \nand Urban Development, The Fannie Mae Corporation, the Fannie Mae \nFoundation, the United States Department of the Treasury, the Federal \nReserve Bank, area banks and lenders, local governments, schools, and \nthe faith-based community. These strong relationships have enabled the \nMission of Peace Housing Counseling Agency to have accomplished many \ngreat things since its inception only five years ago.\n  In 2001, they formed a partnership with Fannie Mae to offer the \nMission of Peace Faith-Based Home ownership Initiative. As well, they \nimplemented with great success an Individual Development Account \nprogram which allows participants to open an account at the Fifth Third \nBank to save toward the\n\n[[Page S5363]]\n\ndown payment and closing cost of home purchase. Most recently, the \nUnited States Department of the Treasury announced that Mission of \nPeace Housing Counseling Agency is a recipient of a First Accounts \nProgram Grant to assist ``unbanked'' people. Through this grant, they \nwill provide services in Genesee, Lapeer, Oakland, Saginaw and Shiwasee \nCounties.\n  Mission of Peace Housing Counseling Agency is a leader in helping \npeople take control of their financial well-being and has been \nrecognized numerous times for their achievements. Some of the agencies \nawards include the Local and National HUD Best Practices Award, the \nCongress of National Bank Churches Client Volume Award, Homeowners and \nOutstanding Achievement Awards, Fannie Mae Partner Award, State of \nMichigan Special Tribute Award, the City of Flint Peppy Rosenthal Human \nService Award and the Project Zero Partner of the Year Family \nIndependence Agency of Genesee County Award. I know my Senate \ncolleagues join me in congratulating Mission of Peace Housing \nCounseling Agency on the work that they have done, and in wishing them \nwell in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/11/senate-section/article/S5363-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/11/senate-section/article/S5363-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/11/senate-section/article/S5363-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ON THE PARTICIPATION OF THE UNITED STATES IN THE UNITED NATIONS \n      AND ITS AFFILIATED AGENCIES DURING CALENDAR YEAR 2000--PM 91\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit herewith the final version of a report, \nprepared by my Administration, on the participation of the United \nStates in the United Nations and its affiliated agencies during the \ncalendar year 2000.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 2607. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior and the \nSecretary of Agriculture to collect recreation fees on Federal lands, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nauthorize the Federal land management agencies, the National Park \nService, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management and \nForest Service, to collect visitor recreation fees, and to use the \nproceeds from the fees to continue to fund high priority resource \nprotection and maintenance backlog needs.\n  Following enactment of the Recreation Fee Demonstration Program in \n1996, the Federal agencies have been authorized to experiment with \nvarious fee collection proposals. That program also authorized the \nFederal agencies, for the first time, to retain all of the fee revenues \nand to use those funds, without the need for further appropriation, on \nmaintenance backlog and other funding needs.\n  The Recreation Fee Demonstration Program has been extended each year, \nmost recently through September 30, 2004. For the most part, the fee \ndemonstration program has been very successful. However, unlike the \nprevious fee authority in the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act, the \nfee demonstration program contained no guidance to the agencies or \nlimitations on the types of fees that could be collected. As a result, \nthe program has generated some controversy, especially with respect to \ncertain Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management lands where fees \nhad not historically been charged.\n  The bill I am introducing today builds upon the positive results from \nthe Recreation Fee Demonstration Program, while including new criteria \nto ensure that fees are not imposed inappropriately. The bill provides \nthe Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture with \nconsiderable discretion to administer the program while ensuring that \nrecreational access to Federal lands remains available to all \nAmericans. Most importantly, the bill maintains the existing \nrequirement that a majority of the fees be retained for expenditure at \nthe site where collected.\n  I believe there is strong support for enacting permanent fee \nauthority. The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources will hold a \nhearing on this bill on June 19, and I hope it will be ready for \nconsideration by the full Senate in the near future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2607\n\n       Be it enacted in the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S5368]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 to \nauthorize the acquisition of coastal areas in order better to ensure \ntheir protection from conversion or development; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nGregg to introduce the Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Act of \n2002. I would like to thank our cosponsors, Senators Kerry, Snowe, \nInouye, J. Reed, Breaux, Cleland, DeWine, Sarbanes, Biden, Kennedy, \nMikulski, Cochran, Torricelli, Murray, and Landrieu for their support \nof this bill, which marks another important chapter of our thirty year \neffort to put coastal and ocean issues at the forefront of \nenvironmental policy.\n  When I was Governor of South Carolina over 30 years ago, I \nexperienced first hand the need for Federal direction and assistance to \nthe States to enable them to effectively and sustainably manage coastal \ndevelopment. My experiences during a series of coastal hearings and \ncontinued research in the Senate led me to write the Coastal Zone \nManagement Act of 1972, which provided clear policy objectives for \nstates to establish coordinated coastal zone management programs to \nhelp balance coastal development with protection. Since the CZMA became \nlaw, 34 of the 35 coastal states have established approved programs to \nhelp preserve and utilize their precious resources, and the program has \nproven to be a successful partnership between the Federal government \nand our states.\n  But we appear to need more tools to help States continue the job we \nstarted in 1972. In the year 2002, as our population grows, more and \nmore people are moving to the coast to enjoy its beauty and \nrecreational opportunities. In fact, by 2010, an estimated 60 percent \nof Americans will live along our coasts, which represent less than 17 \npercent of our land area. More than 3,000 people move to coastal areas \neveryday, and fourteen of the Nation's 20 largest cities are on the \ncoast, and are five times more densely populated than the interior of \nthe country. As these good folks move to take advantage of coastal \nliving, we have to be careful that we don't destroy the natural \nresources and quality of life that draw them to our shores. Big changes \nare coming to all of our coastal counties, and we must make some \ncareful and smart decisions if we want to keep the very resources we \ndepend on.\n  In particular, estuaries and wetlands have many unique attributes \nthat make them important to both our natural resources and our economy. \nEstuaries, and the watersheds that flow into them, support fisheries \nand wildlife and contribute immensely to the coastal area economies. \nWetlands are critical to many life cycles of organisms and help improve \nsurface water quality by filtering our wastes. But these ecologically \nand economically important watersheds are also under the most threat \nfrom land development and conversion away from their natural state. The \nForest Service's recently released Southern Forest Resource Assessment \nshows that coastal urbanization trends are particularly strong in the \nsoutheastern areas. In my state alone, the natural forests of the \ncoastal plain are projected to decrease by 1.9 million acres in the \nnext 40 years--a 35 percent loss of South Carolina's forests. These \nfindings and future trends tell me that for the good of our coastal \ncommunities we need some fast, targeted action to protect ecologically \nimportant coastal areas most threatened with development or conversion.\n  Now more than ever, the pressures of urbanization and pollution along \nour Nation's coasts threaten to impair watersheds, impact wildlife \nhabitat and cause irreparable damage to the fragile coastal ecology. \nThis year the Environmental Protection Agency rated the overall \ncondition of our coastal waters as fair to poor, with 44 percent of \nestuarine areas impaired for human or aquatic life use. While some \nareas of the country are seeing some improvement as a result of control \non industry, the experts predict that the more pristine areas like the \nSoutheast, which as some of the best water quality in the Nation, will \nexperience degradation of water quality due primarily to runoff of \npollutants from rapid development in our coastal watersheds. This is \nvery bad news for the shrimpers, oystermen, and recreational users who \ndepend on these waters for their livelihood and quality of life.\n\n  We see strong signals of what continuing down this path will bring \nus: sustained beach closings due to excess sewage drainage; shellfish \nbed closings and fish consumption advisories resulting from toxic \nrunoff or bacteria; fish kills due to lack of oxygen from nutrient \nrunoff; marine mammal diseases; and human health impacts. The National \nResearch Council reports that over the next 20 years over 70 percent of \nour estuaries will experience more of\n\n[[Page S5370]]\n\nthese low oxygen, or ``eutrophic'' conditions, such as the Gulf ``Death \nZone.'' If this trend continues, our coastal economies will suffer and \nperhaps never recover. I know in my state the economy would falter \ngreatly from the lack of fishing, shrimping and tourism opportunities, \nand this is true up and down the Atlantic coast, which contains 37 \npercent of the Nation's estuarine areas.\n  The good news is that there are ways we can make a difference, and we \nhave some goods models we can turn to. I am proud to say my home state \nof South Carolina is a leader in this area. The past decade I have led \nan extensive cooperative conservation effort, bringing together the \nState of South Carolina, private landowners, groups like the Nature \nConservancy, Ducks Unlimited and Federal partners like NOAA and the \nFish and Wildlife Service to protect the ACE Basin. It is now the \nlargest pristine estuarine reserve on the East Coast, a 350,000-acre \narea at the convergence of the Edisto, Ashepoo and Combahee Rivers, \nwhich comprises many ecologically important habitats that are home to \nmany fish and bird species, including a number of endangered species. \nAn outcome of these efforts is that the ACE Basin, already home to a \nNational Wildlife Refuge, was declared a National Estuarine Research \nReserve in 1992, and has been growing in size ever since. In building \nthe ACE Basin, the partners worked creatively and in a coordinated \nmanner, and we successfully obtained land acquisition funds through a \nvariety of federal sources, including the Forest Legacy Program.\n  What became clear, however, is that there is no federal program \nexplicitly setting aside funding for conservation of coastal lands, \nwhere the needs are clearly the greatest. That is exactly what the \nCoastal and Estuarine Land Protection Act of 2002 will do. The bill, \nwhich is strongly supported by The Trust for Public Land, Coastal \nStates Organization, The Nature Conservancy and Land Trust Alliance, \namends the CZMA to authorize a competitively matching grant program in \nNOAA to enable states to permanently protect important coastal areas. \nUnder this NOAA program, coastal states can compete for matching funds \nof up to 75 percent to acquire land or easements for the protection of \nendangered coastal areas that have considerable conservation, \nrecreation, ecological, historical or aesthetic values threatened by \ndevelopment or conversion. The bill also provides funding for a \nregional watershed demonstration project that can be used as a model \nfor future watershed-scale programs. The program is authorized at $60 \nmillion for fiscal year 2003 and beyond, with an additional $5 million \nfor the regional watershed demonstration project.\n  By establishing a plan for the preservation of our coastal areas, the \nCoastal and Estuarine Land Protection Act will build on the foundation \nlaid down by the CZMA, all in stride with the changing times, growing \nnumber of people, and limited resources available today. When it comes \nto the environment, rules and regulations sometimes can't do it all. \nSometimes cooperative actions work better and we can turn to models \nthat encourage joint conservation projects among folks who all want the \nsame thing, sustainable coasts.\n  Partnership programs among federal government, state agencies, local \ngovernments, private landowners and non-profits, like the ACE Basin \nProject, work and we need to encourage these partnerships in all our \ncoastal areas if we are to prevent degradation of our coastal \nresources. The good news is that we can make a difference today by \nproviding the funding for land conservation partnerships provided for \nby Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Act. I am proud to be a \nsponsor of this bill, which will not only improve the quality of the \ncoastal areas and marine life it supports, but also sustain surrounding \ncommunities and their way of life.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senator Hollings to \nintroduce S. 2608, the Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Act. We \nare introducing this much needed coastal protection act along with \nSenators Cochran, DeWine, Snowe, Biden, Carper, Cleland, Inouye, \nBreaux, Landrieu, Sarbanes, Mikulski, Kennedy, Kerry, Torricelli, and \nMurray. In addition, this legislation is supported by the Coastal \nStates Organization, the National Estuarine Research Reserve \nAssociation, the Trust for Public Lands, The National Conservancy, and \nthe Land Trust Alliance.\n  The Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Act promotes coordinated \nland acquisition and protection efforts in coastal and estuarine areas \nby fostering partnerships between non-governmental organizations and \nfederal, state, and local governments. With Americans rapidly moving to \nthe coast, pressures to develop critical coastal ecosystems are \nincreasing. There are fewer and fewer undeveloped and pristine areas \nleft in the nation's coastal and estuarine watersheds. These areas \nprovide important nursery habitat for two-thirds of the nation's \ncommercial fish and shellfish, provide nesting and foraging habitat for \ncoastal birds, harbor significant natural plant communities, and serve \nto facilitate coastal flood control and pollutant filtration.\n  The Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Act pairs willing sellers \nthrough community-based initiatives with sources of federal funds to \nenhance environmental protection. Lands can be acquired in full or \nthrough easements, and none of the lands purchased through this program \nwould be held by the federal government. S. 2608 puts land conservation \ninitiatives in the hands of state and local communities. This new \nprogram, authorized through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration at $60,000,000 per year, would provide federal matching \nfunds to states with approved coastal management programs or to \nNational Estuarine Research Reserves through a competitive grant \nprocess. Federal matching funds may not exceed 75% of the cost of a \nproject under this program, and non-federal sources may count in-kind \nsupport toward their portion of the cost share.\n  This coastal land protection program provides much needed support for \nlocal coastal conservation initiatives throughout the country. In my \nrole as the Ranking Member of the Commerce, Justice, State \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I have been able to secure significant \nfunds for the Great Bay estuary in New Hampshire. This estuary is the \njewel of the seacoast region, and is home to a wide variety of plants \nand animal species that are particularly threatened by encroaching \ndevelopment and environmental pollutants. By working with local \ncommunities to purchase lands or easements on these valuable parcels of \nland, New Hampshire has been able to successfully conserve the natural \nand scenic heritage of this vital estuary.\n  Programs like the Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection program will \nnow enable other states to participate in these community-based \nconservation efforts in coastal areas. This program was modeled after \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture's successful Forest Legacy Program, \nwhich has conserved millions of acres of productive and ecologically \nsignificant forest land around the country.\n  I welcome the opportunity to offer this important legislation, with \nmy close friend, Senator Hollings. I am thankful for his strong \nleadership on this issue, and look forwarding to working with him to \nmake the vision for this legislation a reality, and to successfully \nconserve our ecologically, historically, recreational, and \naesthetically important coastal lands.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 2609. A bill to require the Federal Trade Commission to promulgate \na rule to establish requirements with respect to the release of \nprescriptions for contact lenses; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Contact Lens Prescription Release Act \nof 2002 will rectify a troubling anomaly in competition and health care \nlaw: Eye doctors have long been required to provide patients with the \nprescriptions for their eyeglasses, but not for contact lenses. This \nbill will require ophthalmologists and optometrists to release contact \nlens prescriptions to their patients, just as they have long been \nrequired to do for eyeglass wearers.\n  Since 1973, when the Federal Trade Commission issued a regulation \nrequiring the automatic release of eyeglass prescriptions, the millions \nof citizens who wear glasses have had access to,\n\n[[Page S5371]]\n\nand the use of, their own prescriptions. They have long been able to \n``shop around'' for the best provider of eyeglasses for themselves, but \ncontact lens wearers are often forced to purchase their contacts from \ntheir eye doctors, because they have been denied possession of their \nown prescriptions.\n  The contact lens industry was in its infancy in 1973, and thus was \nexcluded from the FTC's regulation. Now that 35 million Americans wear \ncontact lenses, the industry is profoundly different. Thirty years ago, \nit made sense that the FTC did not extend its rule to cover contact \nlenses, but now that so many patients wear contacts, it seems the time \nis ripe for the law to reflect this growing health care trend. In \naddition, because patients' prescriptions can be exclusively held by \ntheir doctors, anticompetitive behavior among some eye doctors has \nescalated, to the detriment of consumers and competition.\n  In some instances, doctors can effectively force their patients to \nbuy contact lenses from their doctors who can also require them to come \nin for eye exams before they receive replacement lenses, even if there \nis no change to the prescription. Patients must then pay for medical \nservices they do not want, and cannot shop around for the best price or \nmost convenient delivery service for their contact lens, like on-line \nordering, or discount dealers. In fact, thirty-two State Attorneys \nGeneral have recently settled an antitrust suit against the American \nOptometric Association and Johnson & Johnson, maker of ACUVUE \ndisposable contact lenses, in which the attorneys general alleged that \ndefendants conspired to force patients to buy their lenses only from \neye doctors, and to eliminate competition from alternative distributors \nof contact lenses.\n  The Contact Lens Prescription Release Act would require the FTC to \namend its trade regulation rule on ophthalmic practice to require a \ncontact lens prescriber to release to the patient, or her agent, a copy \nof the prescription, and it would make it an unfair practice for any \ncontact lens supplier to represent that the lenses could be obtained \nwithout a valid prescription. This bill would put contact lens wearers \nin the same position as their bespectacled brethren: They could have \ncontrol of their own medical information, and be able to choose the \nright supplier, from a more competitive marketplace of suppliers, for \nthemselves.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself and Mr. Corzine):\n  S. 2610. A bill to amend part A of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to include efforts to address barriers to employment as a work \nactivity under the temporary assistance to needy families program, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Chance to \nSucceed Act of 2002 on behalf of myself and my colleagues Senator \nCorzine.\n  The research is clear that many of the parents still receiving \nTemporary Assistance for Needy Families, TANF, cash assistance have \nbarriers, often multiple barriers, that make it harder, sometime \nimpossible, for them to work. These barriers include mental and \nphysical impairments including learning disabilities, domestic and \nsexual violence, substance abuse, limited English proficiency, and \nhopelessness. In some cases, parents are caring for a child with \ndisabilities and this inhibits their ability to meet the State's work \nrequirements.\n  In my own State of Minnesota, we are beginning to see compelling \nevidence that many families receiving TANF, have significant barriers \nto employment. A recent study done by Lifetrack Resources looked at \nwelfare recipients participating in a transitional jobs program. This \nresearch found that individuals participating in the program had an \naverage of seven barriers to employment, ranging from a lack of \nreliable transportation to limited education to domestic violence \nissues. Welfare offices in Ramsey and Hennepin Counties, where the bulk \nof families approaching their 5 year lifetime limit live, found similar \nresults as they have begun testing TANF recipients for learning \nproblems, mental illness, physical limitations and other disabilities. \nThey found that: about two-thirds of the parents in each county have \nproblems severe enough to qualify for benefits extension; In Ramsey \ncounty, testers who have worked with several hundred parents, have \nfound the average IQ for English speakers was 82. An IQ of 100 is \nconsidered average; and Hennepin County found that 24 percent of a \nsample of 66 parents reaching their time limits had a mental illness.\n  With additional help, many of these families in Minnesota and \nelsewhere, will be better able to maximize their potential and move \ntoward greater financial independence. In order to be able to better \nhelp these families address such barriers and move toward work, States \nneed to have in place policies and procedures that help identify these \nfamilies and the barriers they face and provide them with the services \nand supports they will need to eventually succeed in the workplace. \nThere is no need for these policies and procedures to be identical--one \nsize does not fit all for states or families. But, the failure to have \nany such procedures results in families with barriers being \ninappropriately sanctioned while also unable to work. It also means \nthat States are not using their limited TANF resources most efficiently \nto ensure accurate matching of families' barriers with program to help \nto address those barriers. Inadequate screening and assessment impedes \nstates' ability to better tailor their programs and the individual's \nresponsibility plan to meet a family's needs.\n\n  Some States have already taken steps along the lines proposed in this \nbill. The purpose of the provisions in this bill is to put into place a \nskeletal structure in each State, leaving the States with flexibility \nin terms of exactly how the various provisions are implemented, will \nhelp to ensure that both states and families have the tools they need \nto ultimately ensure that more low-income families succeed in the \nworkplace. The Chance to Succeed Act encourages states to better serve \nthe needs of TANF recipients with barriers to employment by: giving \nstates broad flexibility to place TANF recipients in barrier-removal \nactivities and count recipients participating in such activities toward \nfederal work participation rates for at least three months; improving \nservice delivery for families with barriers by developing a screening, \nassessment and service delivery process; providing technical assistance \nto states to develop model practices, standards and procedures for \nscreening, assessment and addressing barriers to move individuals into \nemployment; and providing funding for state-level advisory panels to \nimprove state policies and procedures for assisting families with \nbarriers to work; helping TANF recipients with barriers to employment \nmove into the workforce by creating personal responsibility plans that \noutline an employment goal for moving an individual into stable \nemployment; the obligations of the individual to work toward becoming \nand remaining employed in the private sector; the individual's long-\nterm career goals and the specific work experience, education, or \ntraining needed to reach them; and the services the State will offer \nbased on screening and assessment; and developing sanction, \nconciliation and follow-up procedures that address barriers and improve \ncompliance.\n  TANF recipients want to work and be able to provide for themselves \nand their children. To be poor in this country is difficult enough, but \nto be poor and on welfare carries with it a stigma that makes life \nnearly impossible. States like Minnesota and others are only now coming \nto understand the true depth and extent of the kinds of barriers to \nemployment that many TANF recipients face. It takes a tremendous \ncommitment of effort and resources to provide individuals with the \nservices and supports they need to address these barriers so that they \nmay successfully transition into the workforce. It is critical that our \nfederal TANF policies do all that is possible to help those states that \nare already making this kind of commitment. I believe this bill does \njust that, and I urge each of my colleagues to support it. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on the Finance Committee and \nothers to ensure that the provisions in this bill are included in the \nSenate TANF reauthorization bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Collins, Mr. Jeffords, \n        Mr. Frist, Mr. Cochran,\n\n[[Page S5372]]\n\n        Mr. Levin, Mr. Chafee, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Dayton, and Mr. \n        Wellstone):\n  S. 2611. A bill to reauthorize the Museum and Library Services Act, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce the Museum and Library \nServices Act of 2002. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Kennedy, \nCollins, Jeffords, Frist, Cochran, Levin, Chafee, Landrieu, and Dayton \nin introducing this legislation to strengthen museum and library \nservices.\n  Museums and libraries are rich centers of learning, woven into the \nfabric of our communities, big and small, urban and rural.\n  Today's library is not simply a place where books are read and \nborrowed. It is a place where a love for reading is born and renewed \nagain and again, and where information is sought and discovered. \nAmerican libraries also coordinate and provide comprehensive services \nto meet the needs of their communities and people of all ages. They \nprovide Internet access, family literacy classes, homework help, \nmentoring programs, English as A Second Language, ESL, classes, job \ntraining, and resume writing workshops.\n  America's museums bring wonderment and joy to young and old alike, \nencouraging discovery and celebrating our heritage and our heroes. \nToday's museums bring everyday objects, art, music, science, \ntechnology, and much more to life. Museums help us preserve our past, \nunderstand our present, and plan our future.\n  The Federal Government has a long history of supporting our Nation's \nlibraries and museums, providing direct aid to public libraries since \nthe adoption of the Library Services and Construction Act, LSCA, in \n1956 and funding to museums since the enactment of the Museum Services \nAct in 1976.\n  The Museum and Library Services Act was enacted in 1996, \nreauthorizing federal library and museum programs under a newly \ncreated, independent federal agency called the Institute for Museum and \nLibrary Services, IMLS. The Museum and Library Services Act consists of \ntwo main subtitles, the Library Services and Technology Act and the \nMuseum Services Act. Senator Kennedy, Senator Jeffords, and my \npredecessor, former Senator Claiborne Pell, were instrumental in the \ndevelopment and enactment of this law.\n  Under the Library Services and Technology Act, LSTA, IMLS funds four \ngrant programs for libraries to improve access to information through \ntechnology, to ensure equity of access and to help bring resources to \nunderserved audiences. These programs serve all types of our nation's \n122,000 libraries: public, academic, research, school, and archive.\n  In Rhode Island, LSTA funding allows libraries to provide summer \nreading programs for students and participate in the Rhode Island \nFamily Literacy Initiative that helps families with limited English \nlanguage skills. Last fall, the Providence Public Library was one of 6 \nmuseums and libraries recognized by IMLS with a National Award for \nMuseum and Library Service.\n  Under the Museum Service Act, IMLS provides funding and technical \nassistance to museums for preservation of museum collections, new \ntechnologies for exhibits, and general operations. Approximately 15,000 \nU.S. museums from aquariums to arboretums and botanical gardens, to art \nmuseums, to historic houses and sites, to nature centers, to science \nand technology centers, to zoological parks benefit from the IMLS's \nexistence. Several Rhode Island museums have received IMLS funding, \nincluding the Children's Museum of Rhode Island, the Museum of Art at \nthe Rhode Island School of Design, and the Slater Mill Historic Site in \nPawtucket.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is based on the testimony we \nheard at an April 10 hearing of the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee, which I chaired, as well as proposals that the \nmuseum and library communities each crafted using a cooperative and \ncollaborative process. We are grateful for their efforts to come \ntogether on proposals so the law meets the future needs of museum and \nlibrary users.\n  The Museum and Library Services Act of 2002, which extends the \nauthorization of museum and library services for six years, makes \nseveral important modifications to current law. The bill ensures that \nlibrary activities are coordinated with the school library program I \nauthored and contained within the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. It \nestablishes a Museum and Library Services Board to advise the Director \nof IMLS, and it authorizes IMLS to award a National Award for Library \nService as well as a National Award for Museum Service. The bill also \nensures a portion of administrative funds are used to analyze annually \nthe impact of museum and library services to identify needs and trends \nof services provided under museum and library programs, and it \nestablishes a reservation of 1.75 percent of funds for museum services \nfor Native Americans (a similar reservation is currently provided for \nlibrary services under the Library Services and Technology subtitle). \nLastly, the bill updates the uses of funds for library and museum \nprograms, and it increases the authorization of LSTA from $150 million \nto $350 million and Museum Services from $28.7 million to $65 million.\n  I want to specifically highlight one other provision in the \nlegislation. The Museum and Library Services Act of 2002 doubles the \nminimum State allotment under the Library Services and Technology Act \nto $680,000. The minimum State allotment has remained flat at $340,000 \nsince 1971, hampering the literacy and cultural efforts of our Nation's \nsmaller states. An analysis prepared by the staff of the Joint Economic \nCommittee shows that it would take $1.5 million for our small States to \nkeep pace with inflation. The library community has instead suggested a \nmodest, but essential doubling of the minimum State allotment to \n$680,000. This will enable every State to benefit and implement the \nvaluable services and programs that larger States have been able to put \nin place. We heard about the importance of this change from David \nMacksam, Director of the Cranston Public Library, during the April 10 \nhearing. I will be fighting to retain this provision as we work with \nthe House to put this legislation on the President's desk for his \nsignature.\n  The House Committee on Education and the Workforce has already taken \naction on a reauthorization bill. Last year, during the reauthorization \nof the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), I was pleased to \nwork with Senator Collins, Chairman Kennedy, and others to secure \nfunding for school libraries for the first time in twenty years. I hope \nwe can also move forward on a similar bipartisan basis on a swift \nreauthorization of the Museum and Library Services Act.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation and work \nfor its passage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2611\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish wilderness areas, promote conservation, \nimprove public land and provide for high quality development in Clark \nCounty, Nevada, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I rise with my good friend Senator \nEnsign to introduce a bill that is important to Las Vegas, important to \nClark County, important to Nevada, and important to America. The Clark \nCounty Conservation of Public Land and Natural Resources Act of 2002, \nknown as the Clark County Conservation PLAN, provides a solution for \nsouthern Nevada's growth and conservation challenges.\n  The Clark County Conservation PLAN balances the needs for \ninfrastructure development, recreational opportunities, and \nconservation of our precious natural resources in southern Nevada.\n  Our bill is a broad-based compromise. We do not expect everyone to \nadvocate every provision of this bill. Indeed, we know that many people \nwill oppose various components of our legislation. The complaints we \nreceive will reflect the tendency for people to fear change, protect \nthe status quo, and miss the forest for the trees in this case, the \nJoshua trees.\n\n[[Page S5376]]\n\n  Before I discuss each title of the Clark County Conservation PLAN, I \nwill take a few moments to describe the profound challenge that public \nland issues pose for Nevada. 87 percent of the land in Nevada, that is \nnearly 9 out of every 10 acres in our State, is owned and managed by \nthe Federal Government. This includes land managed by the U.S. Forest \nService, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Bureau of Land Management, the \nDepartment of Energy, the National Park Service, the Fish and Wildlife \nService, the U.S. Army, the U.S. Navy, and the U.S. Air Force.\n  The Secretaries of Interior, Agriculture, Defense and Energy bear \ntremendous responsibilities for the management, development, and \nconservation of natural resources in Nevada. Unlike most of America \nwhere land use decisions are made by communities, in Nevada, many land \nuse decisions require concurrence of Federal officials and, in some \ncases, the passage of Federal laws. This is a circumstance that very \nfew Senators understand from experience, but I know that my colleagues \ncan imagine the tremendous challenge inherent in this system regardless \nof the State they represent.\n  The challenge of Federal land ownership is not unique to Nevada, in \nfact it characterizes much of the West. However, this situation is \ncompounded in Clark County where the fastest growing population in \nAmerica springs from the heart of one of the most extreme and fragile \nregions in North America, the Mojave Desert.\n  Many people believe that this scenario embodies an impossible \nchallenge. Some believe that guiding growth in Southern Nevada and \nprotecting our desert for future generations are mutually exclusive. \nSome believe that protecting our air and water quality and setting \naside some open space as wilderness are overly costly barriers to \ngrowth that unnecessarily restrict recreation and development. Some \nbelieve that the Federal Government's management of public land is too \nstrict; others believe it is too lenient. Some believe that every acre \nof Clark County should be privatized. Some believe that not a single \nacre more should be auctioned from the public domain. As different as \nthese views are, what they have in common is that they are passionately \nheld by Nevadans.\n  By describing the fundamental context within which Senator Ensign and \nI are working, I hope I have demonstrated why compromise is not just \nnecessary but warranted. We fully expect to be criticized for what this \nbill is not, for example it does not designate all of the 2 million \nacres in Clark County that the Nevada Wilderness Coalition advocates \nnor does it release all the wilderness study areas in Nevada as others \nadvocate. We do not need to apologize for this compromise, rather we \nwill advocate for what it is, a fair-minded, forward-looking framework \nfor the future development and protection of public land in Clark \nCounty.\n  The Clark County Conservation PLAN reflects three complementary \ngoals: 1. Enhancing our quality of life; 2. Protecting our environment \nfor our children and grandchildren; and 3. Making public land available \nfor quality development consistent with these two principles.\n  The remainder of my statement today will explain how the Clark County \nConservation PLAN will improve the quality of life and enhance economic \nopportunities for Nevadans while enriching and protecting the awe-\ninspiring natural resources that bless southern Nevada for the benefit \nof future generations of Nevadans and all Americans.\n  When Congress passed the Southern Nevada Public Lands Management Act \nin 1998, we made the decision that it was in the public interest to \ntransition away from Federal-private land exchanges and competitively \nauction those parcels of land deemed by the BLM to be disposable. This \ndecision has proven to be quite effective and fair and likely \nrepresents the future of land privatization in Nevada and the West. \nHowever, at the time the law was enacted, Congress did contemplate that \na limited number of ongoing land exchanges would be completed. One of \nthese exchanges is familiarly known as the Red Rock Canyon Howard \nHughes exchange. This exchange would be completed by Title I of the \nClark County Conservation PLAN.\n  In the Red Rock Exchange, the Bureau of Land Management will acquire \nroughly 1,070 acres of land owned by the Howard Hughes Corporation. \nThis land forms promontories above the gently-sloping bajada in the \nfoothills of the La Madre Mountains on the western border of the Red \nRock Canyon National Conservation Area. This acreage affords \nspectacular views of the Las Vegas Valley but development there would \ndegrade the Red Rock NCA and diminish the beauty of the view from Las \nVegas to the west, a view many Las Vegans treasure.\n  This bill provides that the lands I have described will become part \nof the Red Rock NCA once acquired by the federal government. In \nexchange for the Red Rock lands, the Howard Hughes Corporation will \nreceive acreage of equal value, as determined by a government-certified \nappraiser, within the Las Vegas Valley. Finally, the Howard Hughes \nCorporation will convey some of their acquired acreage to Clark County \nfor use as a county park and for inclusion in a regional trail system. \nAs I mentioned earlier, this proposal has been around for a number of \nyears and enjoys unusually broad support ranging from the County to the \nenvironmental community. The time when this exchange should have \nreached completion through the administrative process has long since \npassed and a legislative resolution is now in order.\n\n  Nevada has nearly 100 wilderness study areas on Federal land across \nthe State. These areas, which are primarily owned by the Bureau of Land \nManagement, are managed to protect wilderness character of the lands \nunder current law. These areas remain as de facto wilderness until \nCongress passes a bill changing wilderness study status by either \ndesignating the land as wilderness or releasing the land from \nwilderness study area consideration.\n  Although there is broad support for addressing Nevada's wilderness \nstudy areas through federal legislation, there is no consensus \nregarding how to do so. Those who advocate for wilderness designation \nand those who oppose further additions to the wilderness system hold \nstrong and, in many cases, irreconcilable views on this issue.\n  Those of us who wrote this bill likewise hold different views \nregarding wilderness. In developing the wilderness component of this \nbill, Senator Ensign, Congressman Gibbons and I made compromises that \nwill likely cause heartburn for all interested parties. We believe, \nhowever, that this is a critical step toward addressing the outstanding \nwilderness study issues in the state of Nevada. Our bill designates \nwilderness and releases wilderness study areas. It creates 20 \nwilderness areas: 6 managed by the BLM; 4 jointly managed by the Park \nService and BLM; 7 managed by the Park Service; and 3 jointly managed \nby the BLM and the Forest Service\n  In addition to the wilderness described earlier, our bill releases \nfrom wilderness study area status acreage associated with each of the \nBLM and forest service areas we address. In fact, we release three BLM \nstudy areas in their entirety. Two of these areas will eventually \naccommodate growth at the north end of the Las Vegas Valley and help \nprovide jobs for decades into the future. These lands might be \nconservatively valued at about $1 billion.\n  We have provided for wilderness management protocols that address the \nparticular circumstances of southern Nevada. For example, we explicitly \nrequire the Secretary of the Interior to allow for the construction, \nmaintenance and replacement of water catchments known as guzzlers when \nand where that action will enhance wilderness wildlife resources. In \naddition, we believe that the use of motor vehicles should be allowed \nto achieve these purposes when there is no reasonable alternative and \nit does not require the creation of new roads.\n  Some wilderness purists argue that these man-made guzzler tanks \ndisturb the naturally functioning ecosystems of the Mojave Desert. I \nrespect this view, but I believe that these water projects actually \nhelp restore more natural function to ecosystems that have been forever \nfragmented by development including roads. These projects which are \nprivately funded by dedicated sportsmen have a legitimate place in \nsouthern Nevada wilderness and this bill is clear on that point.\n\n[[Page S5377]]\n\n  In our effort to create a fair wilderness designation, we have \nbenefitted from the advice and suggestions of many Nevadans \nrepresenting a range of views. These advocates include the Nevada Land \nUsers Coalition, The Sierra Club, The Virgin Valley Sportsmen's \nAssociation, The Nevada Wilderness Project, The Fraternity of Desert \nBighorns, the Nevada Mining Association, Red Rock Audubon, and Partners \nin Conservation, to name just a few. We appreciate their help and \nbelieve that this compromise honors our commitment to listen carefully \nto all parties. We are also grateful for the help we have received from \nthe Federal land managers in Clark County and look forward to working \nwith them to improve this bill to help make their jobs easier and the \npublic experience on public land better.\n  Early in the development of this bill we decided not to address \nwilderness issues within the Desert National Wildlife Range. I \nrecognize that this is a major disappointment to many in the \nenvironmental community who view the wilderness resources in the Range \nas some of the best in the Mojave Desert. Wilderness in the Range is, \nhowever, beyond the scope of this bill.\n  The Clark County Conservation PLAN does transfer the management \nresponsibility of three wilderness study areas, totaling more than \n49,000 acres, from the Bureau of Land Management to the Fish and \nWildlife Service. These areas lie between State Highway 93 and the \nRange so this transfer helps rationalize the federal land ownership \npattern in northern Clark County.\n  In addition, this bill transfers a small parcel of land from the \nBureau of Land Management to the National Park Service for use as an \nadministrative site on the road between Searchlight and Cottonwood \nCove. This transfer will save taxpayer dollars by allowing the Park \nService to consolidate two planned administrative sites into one and \nmanage the Lake Mead National Recreation Area more effectively.\n  When Congress passed the Southern Nevada Public Lands Management Act \nof 1998, it established a new paradigm for the sale of public lands in \nClark County, Nevada. One of the core principles of this new way of \ndoing business was that the proceeds from the sale of Federal lands \nshould be reinvested in federal, state, and local environmental \nprotection and recreational enhancements in the state in which the \nlands are sold.\n  The Clark County Conservation PLAN Act modifies the Southern Nevada \nPublic Lands Management Act and expands the so-called Las Vegas valley \ndisposal boundary. This expansion will make an additional 25,000 acres \nof BLM land available for auction and development years into the \nfuture. The proceeds from the sale of this Federal land will continue \nto accrue to the Southern Nevada Public Lands Special Account and be \ninvested in the purchase of environmentally sensitive land, the \ndevelopment of Federal land infrastructure, the implementation of the \nClark County Multi-Species Habitat Conservation Plan, and \nlocal government open space, recreation and conservation projects. Our \nbill further provides that at least one-quarter of the Special Account \nbe dedicated to the last of these purposes.\n\n  One of the most important infrastructure issues facing southern \nNevada is siting a new international airport. The County's preferred \nand likely site is in a dry lake bed between Jean and Primm, Nevada \nsouth of the Las Vegas Valley in the Interstate 15 transportation \ncorridor near the California border. Congress made federal land at that \nsite available for use as an airport, pending environmental reviews.\n  The Clark County Conservation PLAN complements that law in two \nimportant ways. First, our bill conveys federal land adjacent to the \nproposed airport to the Clark County Airport Authority so that it can \npromote compatible development within the area impacted by the noise of \nthe airport. Any proceeds derived from sale of these Airport Authority \nlands would be distributed similarly to lands sold within the Las Vegas \nValley Disposal Boundary.\n  Second, our bill directs the Bureau of Land Management to reserve a \nright-of-way for non-exclusive utility and transportation corridors \nbetween the Las Vegas valley and the proposed airport. This corridor is \nimportant because for the new airport to remain economical will require \nsignificant utility development to come from the north. Our bill does \nnot dictate exactly where, when, how, or by whom this infrastructure \nwill be developed; it simply reserves land explicitly to serve this \npurpose.\n  One of the most precious areas in southern Nevada is a relatively \nnon-descript canyon near Henderson. It is an area graced with hundreds \nof wonderful and curious petroglyphs. Under ordinary circumstances, I \nwould not reveal the location of this site because public knowledge of \nprehistoric rock art sites commonly leads to their destruction. In this \ncase, however, this canyon is in desperate need of protection because \nit is within a short walk of the Las Vegas valley. Similar resources \nelsewhere in the desert Southwest have been destroyed by urban growth \nand lack of intensive management.\n  The Clark County Conservation PLAN designates the Sloan petroglyphs \nsite and the area that comprises most of its watershed as the North \nMcCullough Mountains Wilderness. This wilderness combined with about \n32,000 acres of open space comprises the proposed Sloan Canyon National \nConservation Area. The NCA and wilderness will provide critical \nprotection for the Sloan petroglyphs, preserve open space near \nHenderson's rapidly growing neighborhoods and together represent a \nlegacy of cultural and natural resource conservation our grandchildren \nwill value dearly one day.\n  The sheer number of public lands bill requests Senator Ensign and I \nreceive is staggering. If we chose to introduce stand-alone legislation \nto address each legitimate issue that constituents bring to our \nattention, we would create an awkward patchwork of new Federal laws. In \nthe Clark County Conservation PLAN, we have attempted to provide a \ncomprehensive vision and framework for conservation and development in \nsouthern Nevada by balancing competing interests.\n  The final title of our bill includes a select few of the many \nimportant public interest land conveyances. For example, we include two \nland grants to further the higher education mission of Nevada's \nuniversity system. One provides land to the UNLV research foundation \nfor the development of a technology park. The other provides land for \nthe planned Henderson State College.\n  We convey a small active shooting range to the Las Vegas Metropolitan \nPolice Department for training purposes. We grant a modest parcel of \nland to the City of Las Vegas for the development of affordable \nhousing. We provide for the conveyance of the Sunrise Landfill from the \nBureau of Land Management to Clark County pending completion of the \nenvironmental clean-up at the site. We convey park and open space land \nto the City of Henderson and provide for a cooperatively managed zone \ncomprised of federal land around Henderson Executive airport. These are \nrelatively small but important actions that help our communities, law \nenforcement, and educational system better serve southern Nevada.\n  The Clark County Conservation PLAN Act that Senator Ensign and I \nintroduce today promises a better tomorrow for our public lands in \nsouthern Nevada, for the more than 1.5 million people who call Clark \nCounty home, and for the millions of Americans who visit southern \nNevada every year. This constructive compromise provides land for \ndevelopment, land grants for public purposes, wilderness for \nconservation in perpetuity, and a new national conservation area to \ncelebrate and protect the wonderful natural and cultural resources of \nthe North McCullough Mountains including the Sloan petroglyph site.\n  Senator Ensign and I have been working on this bill since he came to \nthe Senate a year and a half ago. We are proud of the progress we've \nmade together and with Congressman Gibbons and believe that this public \nlands bill should serve as a model for bipartisan cooperation and \nconstructive compromise. We look forward to working with Chairman \nBingaman and the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to perfect this \nbill so that we can enact the Clark County Conservation PLAN into law \nthis year.\n\n[[Page S5378]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2612\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today it is a great privilege and honor \nfor me to introduce the Clark County Conservation of Public Land and \nNatural Resources Act of 2002 with my good friend and colleague from \nNevada, Senator Harry Reid.\n  The introduction of this legislation today is the culmination of over \na year of work. We held public forums in Clark County to solicit the \ninput of interested parties. My staff spent many hours with local \ngovernment officials, the environmental community, multiple-use groups, \nutility providers, home developers, sportsmen, and other Nevadans to \nreach a compromise on how we tackle the tough issues we face in Clark \nCounty. While it is a daunting job to bring Nevadans with opposing \nperspectives together on the controversial topic of wilderness, I \nbelieve we have achieved a consensus that is good for all citizens in \nClark County. We will look back 30 years from now and realize how this \nlegislation contributed to the quality of life we cherish in southern \nNevada.\n  Because the Federal government manages 87 percent of the land in \nNevada, the federal presence imposes enormous barriers to land use \nplanning in a state that, again, outpaces every other state in \npopulation growth. I know I speak for many Nevadans when I say that we \nwish we did not have so much federal land within our borders. But the \nreality is that we do, and that this legislation is necessary to plan \nfor growth and to set aside our pristine lands for future generations \nto enjoy and visit. In many states, land use planning takes place in \ncity council chambers. We do not have that luxury, as we have to obtain \nthe consent of the Congress to make some of the most basic decisions. \nDespite those obstacles, Senator Reid and I are putting forward \nlegislation that is a model for fast-growing communities struggling to \nbalance the equally important goals of environmental protection, \nplanned residential and business development, and the allocation of \nscarce resources such as water.\n  One of my proudest achievements during my service in the U.S. House \nof Representatives was the enactment of the Southern Nevada Public Land \nManagement Act, or what is probably better known in Nevada as the \nEnsign-Bryan bill. Like the legislation Senator Reid and I are \nintroducing today, the Ensign-Bryan bill was the product of bipartisan \ncooperation and the spirit of inclusion. Senator Bryan, who deserves \nmuch credit for that landmark measure, and I hosted a public lands task \nforce to identify and propose solutions to the unique problems we faced \nin the Las Vegas Valley. One of the major reforms that came about \nbecause of the Ensign-Bryan bill was the change in the way public land \nis disposed of in the Las Vegas Valley. We drew a disposal boundary \naround the valley and asked the Bureau of Land Management to auction \nthe land to the highest bidder, in consultation with local governments. \nThe proceeds of those land auctions millions of dollars have been going \ninto a special fund to build parks and trails, acquire environmentally \nsensitive land, initiate capital improvements in our beautiful \nrecreation and conservations areas, and maintain the Clark County \nMulti-Species Habitat Conservation Plan. We also allocated funds for \nwater infrastructure and to the general education fund of the State of \nNevada. This legislation continues to encourage orderly growth, \nimproves the environment, and benefits the schoolchildren of Nevada.\n  Federal land has become so valuable because of the infrastructure \ninstalled by private developers, local governments, and the taxpayers \nof Nevada. It is because of the phenomenal growth in southern Nevada \nthat public land auctions have brought in millions of dollars. Eighty-\nfive percent of the proceeds from public land auctions in southern \nNevada are reinvested in environmental projects. So, I would challenge \nthose who claim that the federal government is not getting its fair \nshare of the proceeds from land sales. In fact,\n\n[[Page S5385]]\n\nthe federal government is receiving large sums of money because of the \nvalue-added infrastructure supported by Nevadans.\n  In the Clark County Conservation of Public Lands and Natural \nResources Act, we build upon the Southern Nevada Public Lands \nManagement Act and settle a number of wilderness designations that have \nbeen pending since 1991. This bill designates 224,000 acres of BLM \nwilderness while it releases 231,000 acres of wilderness study areas. \nIn the jurisdiction of the National Park Service adjacent to the \nColorado River and Lake Mead, 184,000 acres of wilderness are \ndesignated. In all, 444,000 acres in Clark County will be added to our \nnational wilderness preservation system. While the acreage is more than \nsupported by a coalition of multiple-use advocates in Nevada, the \nacreage is about one-fifth of the amount requested by the Friends of \nNevada Wilderness. This compromise is fair.\n  I am particularly proud that the bill creates a second National \nConservation Area in southern Nevada, the Sloan Canyon National \nConservation Area. Having such a magnificent resource at the edge of \nthe City of Henderson will provide countless new recreation \nopportunities for those residents and provide open space that is so \nimportant to the quality of life in the Las Vegas Valley. I am happy we \nwere able to improve the existing Red Rock National Conservation Area \nby adding pristine land to the NCA held by the Howard Hughes \nCorporation.\n  An important feature of this legislation I worked to include is the \ncreation of a comprehensive Southern Nevada Litter Cleanup Campaign. As \nis the case in many desert communities, there is unfortunately a \nprevalence of discarded trash along our highways and on tracts of \nvacant BLM land within city limits. We must instill an ethic in our \ncommunity and sense of awareness that we cannot continue to treat our \ndesert lands as garbage dumps. While I attended college in Oregon, I \nsaw how effective the ``Keep Oregon Green'' campaign worked. I am \ncertain the same approach can produce results in southern Nevada, and \nthat it can be accomplished through the leadership of volunteers, civic \norganizations, environmental groups, and private industry, without the \nbureaucracy. I look forward to leaving to my children a community that \nis much cleaner than the one we have today.\n  I worked to include protections in the Clark County Conservation of \nPublic Land and Natural Resources so that existing access in wilderness \nis preserved. In addition to reserving motorized access through cherry-\nstemmed roads on maps referred to in the bill, we make it clear that \nreasonable access to water developments is permitted in wilderness \nareas. Groups such as the Fraternity of the Big Horn Sheep provide \ncritical water to ensure the health of big horn sheep populations in \nsouthern Nevada. Of course, all valid existing rights are honored \nincluding grazing and mining. Buffers of at least 100 along each side \nof the road are preserved. We also authorize fire suppression and \nclimatological data collection. All in all, reasonable access to \nwilderness has been achieved and I am especially appreciative of \nSenator Reid's flexibility in addressing the concerns of multiple-use \ngroups in this regard.\n\n  This legislation ensures Clark County's orderly growth over the next \nseveral decades through the establishment of educational and research \ninstitutions, industrial parks, and residential development. The \noriginal disposal boundary defined in the Ensign-Bryan Act has been \nexpanded to accommodate planned growth in Clark County, the City of Las \nVegas, the City of North Las Vegas, and the City of Henderson. We have \nsome of the finest planned communities in the world in southern Nevada \nand I know that the new lands will be showcases for quality living for \na broad spectrum of Nevadans. The bill sets aside land for the Clark \nCounty Department of Aviation for the development of the Ivanpah \nAirport south of Las Vegas, the only major international airport in the \nUnited States that will be constructed from scratch in the next ten \nyears. And very importantly, we have opened up an energy corridor that \nwill augment Nevada's and the Southwest's electricity needs.\n  I also wanted to mention the Clark County Multi-Species Habitat \nConservation Plan. As the home to many threatened species, Clark County \nhas entered into an agreement with the Fish and Wildlife Service so \nthat the rapid growth we have been experiencing does not destroy \ncritical plant and animal habitats. Senator Reid and I have included \nlanguage to ensure that the MSHCP is not revoked when releasing lands \nfrom wilderness study status. However, the agreement Senator Reid and I \nreached does not mean that lands will be unavailable for multiple-use \nin the future; we wanted to give Clark County and the Fish and Wildlife \nService the flexibility they need to amend the MSHCP as circumstances \nwarrant, particularly as this legislation is implemented.\n  Senator Reid and I went through a spirited campaign for the U.S. \nSenate against each other in 1998. It was a very close race and I \nconceded it by 428 votes. Our friendship is now strong, and I believe \nthat this bill is a testament to the fact that legislators from \ndifferent political perspectives can come together for the good of \ntheir state. It is not easy work to bridge philosophical differences, \nbut it can and must be done for the sake of the people we represent.\n  I would like to thank Congressman Jim Gibbons for his support of this \nmeasure in the U.S. House of Representatives. Congressman Gibbons was \nan active participant in the development of this bill, and he offered \nseveral constructive and good changes to its content. I appreciate very \nmuch his guidance and assistance.\n  Finally, I would like to thank members of my staff who worked hard on \nthe development of this bill here in Washington and in Nevada: John \nLopez, Margot Allen, Julene Haworth, and Mac Bybee are talented \nNevadans who care very much about Clark County and our great state. I \nalso appreciate the input and assistance of Clint Bentley, the tireless \norganizer of the Nevada Land Users Coalition. Clint was an articulate \nand reasoned advocate of multiple use principles and ensured that the \nNevada Land Users Coalition spoke with one voice during these \nnegotiations.\n  I look forward to quick passage of the Clark County Conservation of \nPublic Lands and Natural Resources in the 107th Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/11/senate-section/article/S5385-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3827.

Mr. President, as I indicated, tomorrow we believe Senator \nDorgan will lay down an amendment at 12:30. That would mean that debate \nwould culminate at about 2:30 tomorrow afternoon, at which time we \nwould have a vote on his amendment, the second-degree amendment, and \nthe Conrad amendment. Following that, unless there is some other \namendment, the Senator from Texas would lay down his amendment, and \nthat would mean at approximately 5:15 or 5:30 we would vote on his \namendment. We hope to complete this legislation tomorrow evening \nsometime.\n  The majority leader will make a determination as to what we will move \nto. That would be good because it is Thursday. I know he has been \nworking with the Senator from Kansas to come up with an agreement to \nmove forward on the cloning, stem cell legislation. That would allow us \nto hopefully complete that matter the following day. We have a lot of \nwork to do.\n  Hopefully, on Friday we can even do something that is constructive in \nnature and complete more legislation.\n  The majority leader indicated on the floor today that prior to the \nJuly 4 recess, he will move to the defense authorization bill. That is \na very difficult bill, as we know. There are a lot of amendments \nalways. So that will take a good part of the legislative week. So there \nis a lot of work to do and little time to do it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/11/senate-section/article/S5388-5", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  APPOINTMENT OF COMMITTEE TO ESCORT THE HONORABLE JOHN HOWARD, PRIME \n                         MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA\n\n  Mr. REID.
