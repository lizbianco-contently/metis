We \nseek Your guidance, Your mercy, and Your forgiveness, that this body of \nservants to God and this country will be blessed with hindsight, \ninsight, and foresight as only You can provide. Supply this elected \nassembly, entrusted by our Nation's citizens to ultimately trust the \nCreator of us all. As defined by humans, these are delicate times, but \nstill we know it is Your times. So let truth, excellence, justice, and \nservice lead the intellect and souls of our Senate. Yes, God bless \nAmerica. Yes, God has blessed America. Yes, God is still blessing \nAmerica, a land of diversity in every imaginable way. For in the Holy \nQur'an Guidance to humanity, it states: ``God has honored all of the \nchildren of Adam,'' and in America's Declaration of Independence, ``all \nmen are created equal.'' So with resources--material, spiritual, and \nmental--we thank You, God, for engineering the tradition of this land \nto witness that life and liberty must be secured by submitting our \nwills to Your plan.\n  Finally, we see the objective of life to nourish a world, a nation, a \ncity, a neighborhood, a home, where the soul is at peace. The soul is \nnot female or male, not rich or poor, nor African-American or \nCaucasian. As You have created us, aid us--really help us to struggle \nand realize, ``Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on Earth as it is in \nHeaven,'' as stated in Your guidance to humans in the Bible.\n  Help us use all our resources to preserve, maintain, and promote \ninherent freedom, not to be denied by the destiny of God until the \nworld, Nation, city, neighborhood, and home cry out; one voice, one \ninterest that life is sacred. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/24/senate-section/article/S10907-3", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The Honorable Ben Nelson led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:\n\n       I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of \n     America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation \n     under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/24/senate-section/article/S10907-4", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              APPOINTMENT OF ACTING PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, before we move to the bill, I want to take a \nminute and express the appreciation of the entire Senate, especially \nthat of Majority Leader Daschle, for the groundbreaking prayer today. \nImam Saleem appeared at our weekly prayer breakfast this morning at 8 \no'clock.\n  Now for the first time in the history of this country, at least to my \nknowledge--I have been here awhile--we have had a Muslim offer our \ninvocation. I not only was impressed with the content of the prayer but \nthe manner in which it was delivered.\n  We should all feel so good about today. Dr. Ogilvie, who is present \ntoday, is to be commended for inviting one of his colleagues to be the \nguest Chaplain and allowing him to take his place. No one can take his \nplace, but certainly he adequately represented him; that is for sure.\n  We are effusive in our praise for Dr. Ogilvie always but especially \ntoday for his insight into having Imam Saleem, the Resident Imam of \nMasjid Muhammad and also the National Educational Director for the \nMuslim American Society, with us. We are so grateful that he is here. \nWe hope he returns and again blesses us with his prayer.\n  We have over 6 million of his faith in America. We have thousands of \nMuslims in Nevada. I hope some of them had the pleasure of watching \ntoday. For those who didn't, I will broadcast it every chance I get to \nmake sure they do know he was here today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know there are several Senators who wish \nto speak. I will quickly yield the floor.\n  While the Imam is still here, I join Senator Reid in welcoming him to \nthe Senate Chamber. Of course, I thank Dr. Ogilvie for making him \navailable as a visiting Chaplain. It provides an example of the nature \nof the United States where we do not subscribe to one religion but have \nthe advantage of many religions; the fact that our country has been \nstronger and better for that, that\n\n[[Page S10908]]\n\nwe make the Nation available to all religions and respect all religions \nand an individual's right to practice the religion they choose.\n  We were honored this morning by having the Imam here at the opening \nof our session. He demonstrated to our Nation that we are a diverse \nnation, diverse in our heritage. We are all either children or \ngrandchildren or great grandchildren of immigrants, certainly in my \nfamily, my mother and my wife, first-generation Americans, speaking in \na different language than English until they learned English. But we \nare also so different in all our religions. Look across the Senate \nfloor. There are a number of different religions represented right \nhere. We have Mormons, Protestants, Jews, and Catholics. It is a \nwonderful example of the diversity of this Nation. So I was pleased to \nhear Senator Reid's comments. I associate myself with them. I thank the \nImam for opening our session.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator from Vermont aware that this is the first \ntime in the history of our country that a Muslim has offered the \ninvocation for the Senate?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I was not aware of that. I certainly hope it will not be \nthe last. I hope this will happen often. I also know that the visiting \nChaplain honors us, but I also hope he knows the Senate honors him. My \nwife's brother is a Catholic priest. One of his great moments in his \npriesthood was when he opened the Senate session. He reminded us of \nthat often. This is something we should do often, and I applaud the \nChaplain in using his prerogative to make this opportunity available to \nso many others.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues in welcoming \nthe opening prayer this morning and say how much all of us appreciate \nthis very important expression and how we value the message that was \ngiven to all of us today. I thank our leadership for giving us the \nopportunity to listen to this voice of peace and restraint and wisdom. \nI am personally very grateful to the guest Chaplain for his \npresentation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/24/senate-section/article/S10908-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, since September 11, the courageous acts \nof countless Americans have set a new standard for the Nation. As the \nwhole world watched the horror on television, it also witnessed what is \nbest in our country and our character. As buildings collapsed, the \nAmerican spirit soared.\n  The indelible images of the first days will live on in all the days \nof our history. Firefighters and police risked their lives and gave \ntheir lives to save others, and hundreds of rescuers paid the ultimate \nprice. The brave passengers of flight 93 fought and defied the \nterrorists, and in the face of their own inevitable death, they \nprevented the killing of so many others.\n  Construction and health workers went into the shadow of constant \ndanger to search for the missing and help the survivors. The mayor of \nNew York City went everywhere sustaining the city. New Yorkers lined up \nfor blocks to give blood, and so did thousands more across the country. \nHundreds of millions of dollars poured in for the families of the \nvictims, as valiantly, tearfully, and quietly they said goodbye to a \nmother, father, son, daughter, or friend in funeral after funeral.\n  And through it all Americans have begun to think deeply about our \ncountry again. We have a new sense of the precious nature of our \nfreedom which, in the years after the cold war, we have increasingly \ntaken for granted. We have learned anew to prize the experiment called \nAmerica--a nation based not on sameness, but on diversity--a nation of \ndifferent races, backgrounds, and faiths, defined not by an accident of \ngeography or history, but by the high aspirations for a better life and \ngreater opportunity that brought so many millions to these shores from \nevery continent and country on the Earth.\n  Now, we have seen, perhaps more clearly than ever before in our \nlives, how we are all in this together--how, if even one of us is \nhurting all of us hurt. Our first thoughts on September 11 were about \nothers, not ourselves.\n  That spirit must now live on. It is the new standard by which we must \nmeasure everything we do.\n  Today, brave young Americans are on the front lines of the fight for \nfreedom from fear. Here at home, we must stand together to face and \ndefeat the terrorists who would poison our people, panic our society, \nand paralyze our democracy. An essential point of protecting our \nhomefront is protecting our economy--because the state of our Union \ncannot be strong, if the state of our economy is weak.\n  We need to speak honestly and directly about the choices we face--and \nwe need to do so in the same spirit which has rallied Americans sine \nSeptember 11. The standard is clear--to seek what is right for our \ncountry, and not just for ourselves; not to strive for private \nadvantage in a time of national need. And that standard should be \nbipartisan--not the false bipartisanship of merely going along, but \ntrue bipartisanship, which is a two-way street, where we genuinely seek \nand respectfully debate what course is best for our economy, for \nrebuilding and restoring, and especially for all those who have been \nhurt in the downturn. As President Bush eloquently said when he spoke \nto the Congress. ``We will come together to strengthen America's \neconomy, and put our people back to work.'' Now all of us, in both \nparties, in both Congress and the administration, must live up to that \nall important responsibility.\n  Fundamentally, this, too, is a question of national security. For a \nstrong economy is the basis of a strong Nation. It assures opportunity \nfor all. It is the foundation of a decent and free society at home, \nwithout which we cannot fight for decent and free societies abroad.\n  Before September 11, the Nation's economy was already weakening. The \nunemployment rate had been climbing for months. Relatively few new jobs \nwere being created. Companies were announcing successive rounds of \nlayoffs. Business investment was being drastically reduced, and profits \nwere rapidly falling.\n\n[[Page S10909]]\n\n  Many economists believed we were in a recession, or that a recession \nwas inevitable. And then came September 11, which was an attack not \njust on our cities and citizens, but on the entire American economy. No \none can truly weigh the loss of life. But the loss of property amounts \nto tens of billions of dollars. We can redress that, and we will. But \nthe loss and the risk went far beyond Ground Zero--in New York or at \nthe Pentagon.\n  Americans stopped flying and stopped buying. Corporations put \ninvestment decisions on hold. Hundreds of thousands lost their jobs in \ncompanies across the economy, from airlines and hotels, to restaurants, \nretailers, and manufacturers of high-technology equipment.\n  Never before has it been so clear how inter-connected our society is. \nTwo buildings go down tragically in New York City, and the entire \neconomy suffers across the land. Economic models do not account for \nthis. The most important of all our resources, our national confidence, \nhas been more damaged than anyone initially realized.\n  It is crucial to recognize that once underway, a recession has no \nclear bottom. Unless we respond, it can spiral downward out of control, \nraising unemployment to higher and higher levels, and sharply reducing \nthe flow of revenues for both government and business.\n  Consider this: Americans on average were saving very little of their \nincome before September 11. If they now increase their savings by only \n1 percent because they are afraid to spend, they will withdraw more \nthan $100 billion from the economy. It is not enough just to tell \npeople to go out and spend and live normal lives. This is an \nextraordinary time--and we cannot talk the economy out of recession. \nCongress must act.\n  This week, as the Senate and the House continue the very important \ndebate on what must be done to revive our economy, there is at least \none overriding principle on which Republicans and Democrats both agree: \nUrgent action is required.\n  We all know that cutting interest rates is the first line of defense \nin a downturn. But we also know that in this time of clear and present \ndanger, lower interest rates alone cannot reverse the decline in \nconfidence, consumer spending, and business investment. Consumers and \ncompanies will not buy more and invest more in a time of great \nuncertainty simply because borrowing costs are lower.\n  We need a direct and sizable injection of resources by government to \nstimulate the economy.\n  But if we do this in the wrong way, a stimulus package could actually \nharm the economy. Some would rely almost exclusively on permanent tax \ncuts that will do little or nothing to promote growth when we need it \nmost--which is right now. Their proposals are neither fair nor will \nthey work. They do not measure up to the new and honest standard of \nthis time. A true stimulus package cannot be a disguise for special \ninterests.\n\n  Nor can it run the risk of imposing large new long-term deficits on \nthe Federal budget. Permanent new tax cuts--on top of nearly $2 \ntrillion in tax cuts enacted earlier this year--would actually hurt the \neconomy by increasing the cost of long-term borrowing. Such cuts would \ndeter the kind of business investments we need most.\n  Instead, a true economic stimulus program for our time must meet \nthree criteria:\n  First, it must have an immediate impact on the economy. Every dollar \nof the stimulus package must be spent in the economy as soon as \npossible. The best way to accomplish this goal is to target the dollars \nto the low- and moderate-income families who are most certain to spend, \nrather than save it. When it is spent, its impact will be multiplied as \nit flows from consumers to business and back to workers. In fact, every \ndollar given to unemployed workers in unemployment insurance payments \nexpands the economy by $2.15.\n  Second, all the tax cuts and spending provisions in the plan must be \ntemporary. They must focus on the immediate need to generate economic \nactivity. They must not impose substantial new long-term costs on the \nFederal budget.\n  Third, the package must be fair and compassionate. It must focus on \nthose who need and deserve the help, who are suffering the most in \nthese difficult days. It must reflect the renewed spirit of taking care \nof each other. Let us here in Congress set a standard for our work \nequal to that set by so many after September 11. Leave no American \nbehind--no victim of the terrorist attack, and no victim of its \neconomic aftershocks.\n  The House Republicans have proposed a stimulus package that fails all \nthree of these criteria. Sadly, this House Ways and Means Committee \nproposal does not rise to the higher standard required in this time of \nnational crisis. It fails the economy. It merely repackages old, \npartisan, unfair, permanent tax breaks, which were rejected by Congress \nlast spring, under the new label of economic stimulus. The American \npeople deserve better.\n  The long-term cost of the House plan is much too high. More than half \nof the dollars would not even reach the economy for more than a year. \nThe stimulus is needed now--not in 2003, 2004, or later. The House \npackage spends $46 billion on permanent new tax breaks for \nmultinational corporations and large businesses. It gives many large \nbusinesses a $25 billion windfall, not only by permanently repealing \nthe corporate minimum tax, but also by refunding the minimum taxes \nalready paid by them over the past 15 years. It also permanently \nreduces the tax on capital gains. It provides $60 billion in permanent \nnew tax cuts for upper income taxpayers--only a small percentage of \nwhich would even go into the economy in the next year.\n  The wealthy individuals and big businesses that would receive these \ntax breaks will not spend most of the windfall. They will save it. \nCorporations will not invest more unless business itself improves. We \ncannot afford to waste valuable Federal dollars in ways that will not \nhave a full and immediate impact on economic growth.\n  The House package also runs a grave risk of frightening financial \nmarkets and driving long-term interest rates up, because investors will \nexpect future federal deficits to rise as a result of additional, \npermanent and unaffordable tax cuts. Already, mortgage rates have \nstayed stubbornly high in response to the tax bill passed earlier this \nyear.\n  The House proposal is plainly unfair. In contrast to more than $115 \nbillion in permanent new tax cuts for wealthy individuals and \ncorporations, it provides less than $14 billion in tax cuts for lower \nand moderate-income families. While the tax cuts for these corporations \nand wealthy individuals are permanent, the cuts for working families \nare limited to just one year.\n  After passing nearly $2 trillion in tax cuts heavily slanted to the \nrichest taxpayers 4 months ago, it is wrong to give the wealthy still \nmore tax breaks when there is a better, more effective way to move the \neconomy. It makes no sense to offer indiscriminate long-term tax \nbreaks, when what is needed are realistic incentives to invest now. \nAnd, if this Congress chooses to violate that basic stimulus principle, \nit would be grossly irresponsible and grossly unfair not to include the \nfair increase in the minimum wage that has been delayed for too long \nalready.\n  The new standard set by September 11 calls for a new course of \naction--one that places national need above personal interests, one \nthat will truly stimulate our economy. We need a Government stimulus \npackage of $71 billion, a package of targeted and effective support for \nmiddle and lower income working families that would be immediate, \ntemporary, and fair, and that should include the following essential \nsteps:\n  We must immediately extend unemployment insurance coverage an \nadditional 13 weeks. The unemployed are on the front line of the \neconomic battle, and they will spend their money immediately.\n  We must also extend unemployment insurance coverage to part-time and \nlow-wage workers, who often do not qualify for any benefits at all, and \nwho can least afford to lose their wages.\n  We must raise unemployment benefits by 15 percent for all workers. An \naverage payment of $230 a week is not enough.\n  We must add $2 billion to job training programs to help workers \nprepare for and find new jobs.\n\n[[Page S10910]]\n\n  These changes will cost $18 billion, but an economy returning to \nprosperity will more than repay the expense.\n  We must protect health insurance for working families by having the \nFederal Government cover 75 percent of the cost of insurance premiums \nfor 12 months after a worker loses a job. We must also support coverage \nfor workers who do not qualify for such a plan. We know that when \nworkers lose their jobs, they lose their health insurance, too.\n  This program would provide an additional $17 billion of stimulus that \nwill help keep the health care sector strong while keeping our workers \nhealthy.\n  These elements--unemployment insurance, job training and health \ncoverage for workers between jobs--are essential to any economic \nstimulus plan, which is why Senator Baucus and I have come together to \npropose these key changes to help workers get their feet back on the \nground.\n  In addition to the Baucus proposal, an economic stimulus plan must \nadd $5 billion to help our communities: $2 billion to food stamps and \nWIC, $1 billion to heating assistance for families, and additional \nfunds for expanded community service and opportunities for voluntarism.\n  We must also invest more now in the public works that will expand \nemployment and stimulate the economy. As we make public buildings, \nairports, and our water supply more secure, we must also build and \nmodernize schools, rail lines, and infrastructure. I propose a new, $10 \nbillion investment for these vital national purposes: $3 billion for \nhighways and bridges; $3 billion for drinking water and wastewater \ntreatment systems; $3 billion for school safety and construction; and \n$1 billion for our railways and mass transit systems.\n  In addition, it will not do much good to spend more at the Federal \nlevel if there are significant cutbacks at the State and local level. \nWe do not want State and local governments, most of which have annual \nbalanced budget requirements, to be forced to either raise taxes or cut \nessential services. Any such steps would be counterproductive at this \ncritical time.\n  We are seeing State cuts in Medicaid, child care, job training, \neducation, and transportation. Tennessee officials have proposed cuts \nthat could cause 180,000 people to lose health insurance. Florida is \ndebating a reduction in coverage for its medically needy population \nunder Medicaid. Mississippi, Ohio, and South Carolina have already cut \nspending across the board. Other States are convening special sessions \nof their legislatures to address the crisis in their State budgets.\n  All this is hurting the very people who need help the most today--\nworking families, single parents, poor children. And such cutbacks will \nclearly undermine the effects of any stimulus package.\n  The answer is for the Federal Government to provide an additional $7 \nbillion in the stimulus package to help the States to continue their \nexisting human services programs. The most timely and effective way to \naccomplish this goal is to temporarily increase the Federal \ncontribution to programs where there is already a State-Federal \npartnership. The largest of these is Medicaid. In a recession, the \nnumber of families eligible for Medicaid increases substantially. In \nfact, some estimate that if unemployment rises 2 percent, the number of \nMedicaid recipients could increase by 2.5 million, dramatically \nincreasing State costs.\n\n  We should temporarily enhance the Federal matching rate for Medicaid \nby 2 percentage points for States that agree to maintain their current \neligibility standards and benefits. This would serve as an incentive \nfor those States.\n  We should also help States temporarily by increasing the Federal \nSocial Services Block Grant Program, which is used by States to pay for \na variety of services to low-income families. It is important that \nState governments not be forced to curtail assistance when it is needed \nmost--and, once again, these are dollars that will also go directly and \nquickly into the economy.\n  This spending will lift the economy in the short term; and strengthen \nit for the long-term.\n  A stimulus package must also include the right kind of temporary tax \ncuts that actually increase spending and growth. Seventy percent of \nAmericans pay more in payroll taxes than in income taxes. Yet many of \nthem received no tax rebate earlier this year. The rebate unfairly \nignored these low- and moderate-income families. A one-time rebate of \npayroll taxes would immediately inject $15 billion into the economy, \nplacing the dollars into the hands of people who will spend it \nimmediately.\n  I do not see how anyone can defend permanent tax cuts over the next \n10 years that primarily benefit the wealthy who will save most of the \nmoney, when that same money can and should be used to cut taxes now for \nmiddle- and lower-income families who will spend the gains immediately.\n  In the days and weeks ahead, there will be debates and compromises. \nBut surely we can fashion a comprehensive stimulus package that meets \nAmerica's new high standard--injects needed funds into the faltering \nAmerican economy as quickly as possible--and that is fair and just.\n  In this case, fairness is also the deepest practical wisdom--the way \nto get the economy back on its feet as soon as possible and without \njeopardizing the foundations of our future prosperity.\n  It would be wrong in principle and wrong economically to pass a false \nstimulus package of unfair tax cuts that would go largely unspent, \ngiving the largest benefits to the few, with limited benefits to \nconsumption and production, and long-term damage to fiscal and monetary \nstability. After September 11, we cannot afford businesses as usual, or \nthe clever politics of repackaging previous goals as if they were a \nreal response to the need for national renewal.\n  We need a real response and real results--now. But this stimuls is \nonly a first step in a new and greater project--for our economy and our \nsociety.\n  Let us be frank. For a long time now, our first thoughts have too \noften been about ourselves, not others. In the process, we have \nneglected the future and some of our best ideals. It is time to change \nthat, too.\n  Our wartime leaders have always understood that we cannot ask people \nto sacrifice and to fight abroad if we fail to fight for a more decent \nand more just society here at home.\n  Our leaders have always understood that the war front and the home \nfront are really the same front. Never has this been more true than in \nthis new kind of war against terrorism, fought both thousands of miles \nfrom our shores and in our own airports, our own mailrooms, and \npotentially in any American community.\n\n  In the late 1950s Dwight Eisenhower saw the relationship between our \nnational security and education when he created the National Defense \nAct. He had the vision to invest in both--through support of local \npublic schools, improvements in math, science and technical education \nas well as loans so that more people could go to college. President \nEisenhower would have met the September 11 standard.\n  As he led the Nation through World War II, Franklin Roosevelt fought \nto make the home front stronger, too. He demanded progressive income \ntaxes, defended unions, opposed discrimination, and created new \npartnerships with business. He would have met the September 11 \nstandard.\n  Beyond the stimulus package, how can we meet that standard now?\n  America would not be the America it is today if our nation and our \npeople had not dared again and again to reach higher across our \nhistory. Once more today, a new economy demands a new era of public \npurpose and progress.\n  The first priority is education. The information age requires an \never-more sophisticated work force. I commend President Bush for the \nnew and effective attention he has given to higher standards in our \nschools. Now, we must get this bill. And this bill is only the \nbeginning of our effort, not the end. We must do more and invest more \nto improve education and to secure for every person the chance to go as \nfar as their talents can take them. Maximum opportunity for each is the \nonly path to maximum prosperity for all, and maximum strength for \nAmerica.\n  The next priority is health care. Before September 11, we needed a \nPatients' Bill of Rights to guarantee that medical decisions will be \nmade by doctors, not accountants, and that people\n\n[[Page S10911]]\n\nwill have access to the best treatments, not just the cheapest. \nTerrorism is no excuse for delay. We need a Patients' Bill of Rights \njust as much today as we did before September 11. I urge the Congress \nto pass it now, and the President to sign it. And I urge the President \nand Members of Congress to keep the promise we all have made to \nguarantee all our seniors access to affordable prescription drugs. They \nneed that help now, just as much as they did before.\n  There is something we need now even more than we did then: We must \nstrengthen our fragile public health infrastructure to deal with the \nclear and present dangers of chemical and biological attack. On Capitol \nHill, we know the threat first hand; we must defeat it, and we will.\n  Today, Senators and Members of Congress have the best of the Nation's \nhealth care at our disposal. Imagine the millions who do not. Many \nAmericans do not even know where to go to find a doctor's help \nimmediately. We need an emergency health care system sufficient beyond \ndoubt to meet the dangers we may face--not just tomorrow, but over the \nnext decade.\n  The bioterrorist threat should remind us of an ideal too long denied \nin this country: Health care is a fundamental right, not just when a \nterrorist attacks, but when cancer or diabetes or any other disease \nstrikes. We have made progress; we must keep moving forward; we must \nget there.\n  Finally, the new economy has produced vast new wealth and \nopportunities, and reduced poverty by 25 percent since 1993. But \nmillions are still left behind, and working families have not gained \ntheir fair share of this new national wealth. So when prosperity \nreturns, we must ensure that we can all advance together. We must open \nnew doors for every American. We must help 21st century mothers and \nfathers cope with the stresses of choosing between the jobs they need \nand the children they love. We must make the workplace more flexible, \nso that workers cannot only provide for their families, but also care \nfor them. We must also provide a more decent living to the Nation's \ncaregivers, to teachers, nurses, and child care workers, who give so \nmuch, yet earn so little. We must make sure the new economy works for \nall Americans.\n  Some say we cannot fight for a safer society and a more just society \nat the same time. I say, we weaken ourselves abroad if we do not \nstrengthen ourselves at home. We cannot defend democracy abroad unless \nwe extend democracy at home. In America and Britain, World War II was \naccompanied and followed by a period of great reform and historic \ntransformation in society. Now, in this time of crisis, we cannot \nsettle for anything else.\n  The spirit of September 11 points the way. In that spirit, we must \ncontinue to care about each other, and fulfill the promise and \nopportunity of America for all our people.\n  This spirit of September 11 has compelled so many of our citizens to \ndo more for our country, our communities and our fellow Americans. This \ntime calls for active citizenship, whether by children getting involved \nin service learning programs at school or senior citizens signing up \nfor the Retired Senior Volunteer Program. This Saturday is Make A \nDifference Day, sponsored by America's Promise and the Points of Light \nFoundation. All Americans should use this occasion to find new ways to \nmake their own contribution.\n  We are one American community. September 11 proved that. Active \ncitizenship will nourish that spirit and sustain us in the challenges \nahead. So we must reject any attempt to misuse the terrorist threat as \nan excuse to deny or delay our obligations to teach our children well, \nto treat the sick, help the needy, and make the new economy a new \nfoundation for a stronger family life and a higher standard of life for \nall our families.\n  We have heard such excuses for inaction in the past. We will hear \nthem again in this crisis, that the war on terrorism will deplete our \nresources and delay our commitment to ``a more perfect union.'' Always \nin the past, there were doubters in America. But always we kept faith \nwith America's ideals, and came together to fight the hardest battles \nand respond to the greatest social needs. We mobilized our government \nand our whole Nation, wisely and well, to defeat our enemies and meet \nthe demands of our best ideals.\n  It has never been more critical to do so than it is today.\n  Let us start with a stimulus package that truly lifts our economy. \nAnd then let us finish the great work we are in--which is not just to \nwin a war, but to build a future of ``liberty and justice for all.''\n  So my message now is fundamental. We need not and we must not \nsacrifice the home front to the war front. they are one and the same. \nWe are all in this together, as we always have been throughout our \ngreat history.\n  If we meet the new standard of September 11, no one will stand in our \nway, and many more will join us. And the heroes of that day will have \nleft an undying legacy--a proud new chapter in annals of America's \ngreatness.\n  Let us pledge our energies to this cause. Let us show, that as the \nbattle goes on for a world free from fear, the work goes on to move \nAmerica forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Under the previous \norder, the Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I honestly and sincerely say it is one \nof the best speeches I have heard on the floor of the Senate in the 11 \nyears I have been here. It is very connected to values I hold dear. I \nthink what Senator Kennedy just said, especially if it gets translated \ninto our doing the work and passing this legislation, is so important. \nThese times call on all of us to be our own best selves. I believe that \nis what the Senator's speech has called for us to do here, and for all \nAmericans, we need each other as never before. We need each other as \nnever before in relation to the physical security challenges, in \nrelation to the uncertainty of the world, and we need each other as \nnever before in terms of how we help one another to be strong in our \nown Nation.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for a marvelous speech.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield.\n  Mr. REID. I agree with the Senator. It is one of the finest speeches \nI have heard on the Senate floor. It covers areas that needed to be \ncovered. It was an elaborate speech, very substantive. I agree with the \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, we have to make sure it translates into \ngetting work done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/24/senate-section/article/S10911-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10911-S10917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       FOREIGN OPERATIONS EXPORT FINANCING, AND RELATED PROGRAMS \n                  APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2002--Continued\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1922\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], for himself and \n     Mrs. Boxer, proposes an amendment numbered 1922.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       (1) Afghanistan's neighbors should reopen their borders to \n     allow for the safe passage of refugees, and the international \n     community must be prepared to contribute to the economic \n     costs incurred by the flight of desperate Afghan civilians;\n       (2) as the United States engages in military action in \n     Afghanistan, it must work to deliver assistance, particularly \n     through overland truck convoys, and safe humanitarian access \n     to affected populations, in partnership with humanitarian \n     agencies in quantities sufficient to alleviate a large scale \n     humanitarian catastrophe; and\n       (3) the United States should contribute to efforts by the \n     international community to provide long-term, sustainable \n     reconstruction and development assistance for the people of \n     Afghanistan, including efforts to protect the basic human \n     rights of women and children.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank both my colleagues. I think \nthere may be support for this amendment. I think there should be. I \nwill not take a lot of time. Let me explain why I think it is so \nimportant the Senate go on record.\n  I will not spend a lot of time on statistics. There are 7.5 million \npeople inside Afghanistan who are threatened\n\n[[Page S10912]]\n\nby famine or severe hunger as cold weather approaches. President Bush \nhas made it crystal clear that our military action is not against \nordinary Afghans; it is against terrorists and their supporters. \nOrdinary Afghans are among the poorest and most beleaguered people on \nthe planet. They were our allies during the cold war.\n  By the way, this amendment I send to the desk with Senator Boxer, as \nwell.\n  Yet right now, on present course, time is not neutral and time is not \non our side, and, more importantly, time is not on the side of ordinary \nAfghans. There will be at least another 100,000 children who will \nstarve to death. The winter months are approaching.\n  Even before the world focused on it as a sanctuary for Osama bin \nLaden and other terrorists, Afghanistan was on the brink of a \nhumanitarian catastrophe, the site of the greatest crisis in hunger and \nrefugee displacement in the world. Now the worsening situation on the \nground is almost unimaginable. After four years of relentless drought, \nthe worst in three decades, and the total failure of the Taliban \ngovernment in administering the country, four million people have \nabandoned their homes in search of food in Pakistan, Iran, Tajikistan \nand elsewhere, while those left behind eat meals of locusts and animal \nfodder.\n  Mr. President, 7.5 million people inside the country are threatened \nby famine or severe hunger as cold weather approaches, according to the \nUnited Nations.\n  As President Bush made clear, we are waging a campaign against \nterrorists, not ordinary Afghans, who are some of the poorest and most \nbeleaguered people on the planet and were our allies during the cold \nwar.\n  Yet, the current military air strikes and the disintegration of \nsecurity is worsening the humanitarian situation on the ground.\n  Aid organizations are increasingly concerned about their ability to \ndeliver aid to Afghanistan while the United States continues its \nbombing campaign. Several aid organizations have been accidentally \nbombed by the U.S. in the last week. In addition to these accidental \nbombings, law and order are breaking down inside Afghanistan. Reports \nindicate that thieves have broken into several aid organization \noffices, beat up the Afghan staff and stolen vehicles, spare parts, and \nother equipment.\n  Warehouses of the International Red Cross in Kabul were bombed \nyesterday. The ICRC says that the warehouses were clearly marked white \nwith a large red cross visible from the air. One worker was wounded and \nis now in stable condition. One warehouse suffered a direct hit, which \ndestroyed tarpaulins, plastic sheeting, and blankets, while another \ncontaining food caught on fire and was partially destroyed. The \nPentagon claimed responsibility for the bombing later in the day, \nadding that they ``regret any innocent casualties,'' and that the ICRC \nwarehouses were part of a series of warehouses that the United States \nbelieved were used to store military equipment. ``There are huge needs \nfor the civilian population, and definitely it will hamper our \noperations,'' Robert Monin, head of the International Red Cross' \nAfghanistan delegation, said in Islamabad, Pakistan.\n  Another missile struck near a World Food Program warehouse in \nAfsotar, wounding one laborer. The missile struck as trucks were being \nloaded for an Oxfam convoy to the Hazarajat region, where winter will \nbegin closing off the passes in the next two weeks. Loading was \nsuspended and the warehouse remains closed today.\n  Last week, four U.N. workers for a demining operation were \naccidentally killed when a bomb struck their office in Kabul.\n  In response to the dangers threatening humanitarian operations, the \nOxfam America president said, ``It is now evident that we cannot, in \nreasonable safety, get food to hungry Afghan people. We've reached the \npoint where it is simply unrealistic for us to do our job in \nAfghanistan. We've run out of food, the borders are closed, we can't \nreach our staff, and time's running out.''\n  The World Food Program was feeding 3.8 million people a day in \nAfghanistan even before the bombing campaign began. These included \n900,000 internally displaced people at camps. Although the U.S. \nmilitary has dropped thousands of ready to eat meals, everyone agrees \nthat only truck convoys can move sufficient food into Afghanistan \nbefore winter. As of last Friday, there were only two convoys confirmed \nto have gotten through. WFP announced that two more convoys since the \nbombing campaign started were nearing Kabul.\n  Complications and delays in delivering emergency food supplies to \nAfghanistan could cause rising death rates from starvation and illness \nas winter sets in. Many of the high mountain passes will be closed by \nmid-November due to 20-30 foot snows.\n\n  Aid agencies are falling behind in their efforts to deliver enough \nemergency relief to Afghans to avoid a large loss of life this winter. \nUNICEF estimates that, in addition to the total of 300,000 Afghan \nchildren who die of ``preventable causes'' each year, 100,000 more \nchildren might die this winter from hunger and disease.\n  The main reasons for this shortfall in aid are related to security \nconcerns. Aid agencies have withdrawn their international staff, and \nlocal staff have attempted to continue the aid programs but have been \nsubjected to intimidation, theft, and harassment. As the United States \ncontinues to pound Taliban targets, law and order in some cities is \nreportedly also breaking down. Truck drivers are unwilling to deliver \nsupplies to some areas for fear of being bombed by the United States, \nor being attacked by one faction or another. Taliban supporters have \nobstructed aid deliveries on some occasions.\n  Despite these nightmares, shipment of food and non-food emergency \nitems arrive in Afghanistan daily--but the total shipped is only about \none-half of what is needed. The situation is particularly urgent as \nsome of the poorest and most needy areas will be cut-off from overland \nroutes by mid-November. An estimated 600,000 people in the central \nhighlands are dependent upon international food aid, and little is on \nhand for them now.\n  The food shortfall in Afghanistan may result in an increased flow of \nrefugees to the borders. A flood of refugees to the border would \npresent a different but also challenging set of problems. Clearly, as \neveryone has said, it is better for them to remain at home than flee to \nneighboring countries out of hunger.\n  There is no easy solution to this humanitarian crisis. It is complex \nand requires the international community to take urgent and imaginative \naction to boost the flow of food inside. The United States should take \nthe lead in helping to devise aggressive and imaginative ways to expand \nthe delivery of food. These could include the creation of humanitarian \ncorridors, the use of existing commercial trading companies and air \ndeliveries to airports that have not yet been bombed.\n  The establishment of humanitarian ground and air corridors should be \nconsidered for the secure transportation and distribution of emergency \naid. The Administration should push to have some roads or air routes in \nareas of limited conflict be designated as protected humanitarian \nroutes. Such possible ground and air corridors include Northern \nAlliance held territory along the border of Tajikstan, and Northern \nAlliance airfields which have not been bombed. These airfields could be \nused for a Berlin style airlift to get massive amounts of aid into the \ncountry quickly.\n  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that 1.5 \nmillion additional Afghans could seek to flee the country in coming \nmonths due to the ongoing military conflict.\n  All six countries neighboring Afghanistan have closed their borders \nto refugees both on security grounds and citing an inability to \neconomically provide for more refugees. Thousands have been trapped at \nborders with no food, shelter, water or medical care.\n  I am introducing a resolution today which addresses this crisis. The \ntext of the resolution states the following:\n  Afghanistan's neighbors should reopen their borders to allow for the \nsafe passage of refugees, and the international community must be \nprepared to contribute to the economic costs incurred by the flight of \ndesperate Afghan civilians;\n  As the United States engages in military action in Afghanistan, it \nmust\n\n[[Page S10913]]\n\nwork to deliver assistance, particularly through overland truck \nconvoys, and safe humanitarian access to affected populations, in \npartnership with humanitarian agencies in quantities sufficient to \nalleviate a large scale humanitarian catastrophe;\n  The United States should contribute to efforts by the international \ncommunity to provide long-term, sustainable reconstruction and \ndevelopment assistance for the people of Afghanistan, including efforts \nto protect the basic human rights of women and children.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  There has been a lot of focus on airdrops. The truth of the matter \nis, airdrops from 50,000 feet--and I know the Presiding Officer was \npresent during the committee hearing we had--are not all that \neffective. Basically, all of the United Nations, the nongovernment \norganization, people on the ground have all said that not even 1 \npercent of the people are helped this way. Secretary Powell and the \nadministration know this. At the same time, the reality is we have to \ndo a couple of different things. If we don't, there will be a lot of \ninnocent people who will starve to death. That is a reality. That is \nnot consistent with our values; that is not who we are.\n  Frankly, if I were to make a political national interest argument--\nwhich I am not comfortable making because I think values enough should \ndictate what we do--I would say absolutely the worst thing imaginable \nwould be, in the next several weeks or months to come, for there to be \na situation where the Bin Ladens of this world were able to use the \npictures of starving children in Afghanistan against our country. We \ndon't want that.\n  Colleagues, on present course, that is what will happen. Therefore, \nthere are a number of things we can do. I will go to the wording of the \namendment. One is, we need the highest level United States engagement \nto open the borders, especially the Pakistani border. The \nadministration has spoken about this. It is extremely important. Right \nnow there are lots of refugees amassed at the border who cannot get \nover. It is a humanitarian crisis.\n  By the way, probably more serious than the 1.5 million refugees we \nwill have, given the dangerous situation for themselves and their loved \nones, is the people left behind in Afghanistan. The people who do not \ntry to cross the borders are the poorest of the Afghans. They are the \nelderly, the most infirm.\n  The second thing I mention today is we have to do a better job. Our \nGovernment has to do a better job of efficiently making sure the money \nwe have committed--we have made a generous commitment--actually flows \nto the United Nations organizations and nongovernmental organizations \nthat are delivering the food. It wasn't until last weekend that the \nfirst installment was made. That was $10 million to the United Nations; \nyesterday, $20 million to the NGO. Some of this was held up by Osama \nbin Laden. We have to be much more efficient at making sure the money \nflows to the people who are on the ground to deliver the food.\n  The third point is we are just going to need a more imaginative \nresponse, more imaginative action.\n  There are a number of different proposals that have been made, and \nthe resolution is broad and just says we need to make that commitment, \nfor example, opening up humanitarian response corridors. The most \neffective way to get food to people is going to be over land, by truck \nconvoy. We may need to do a better job of coordination vis-a-vis our \nmilitary action to open up those corridors and make sure the trucks can \nmove and the food can flow.\n  Another thing is we are probably going to need to take a very serious \nlook at these different airstrips. Airstrips that are in low conflict \nareas, we have to make sure they are going to be maintained because we \nmay need to do a Berlin-style airdrop and planes actually land and we \nthen get the food to people, which can be very effective.\n  What I am saying today is that we need to put every bit as much \neffort into the humanitarian relief right now as to the military \neffort. Both are extremely important.\n  I will just read the wording of the amendment which basically calls \non Afghanistan's neighbors to open their borders for safe passage and \nmakes it clear we are going to help with the economic costs and the \nplight of desperate Afghan civilians.\n  Second, it makes the point that in partnership with humanitarian \nagencies we have to do everything we can to deliver the food assistance \nin the most imaginative and effective ways possible. And then third, it \ntalks about the obvious contribution we will make with the \ninternational community in terms of long-term sustainable \nreconstruction development and assistance for the people of \nAfghanistan.\n  I have decided not to take a lot of time because I believe there will \nbe support. The aid agencies are falling behind in their effort to \nprovide the emergency relief. UNISEF estimates that in addition to the \n300,000 Afghan children who die of preventable causes each year, \n100,000 more children are going to die this winter as a result of \nhunger and disease. That is unacceptable. That is unconscionable.\n  So what this first amendment that I have introduced does is it puts \nthe Senate on record with a strong statement that we understand the \nurgency of getting the humanitarian assistance to the innocent people \nof Afghanistan. Again, I think this is a powerful and important message \nfor us to deliver. We cannot be silent about this. We cannot put the \nfact that many, many people could and will starve to death in \nparentheses. We can't do that.\n  Moreover, I think we can and should and must, as responsible \nlawmakers, make it crystal clear that there are some things we know \nneed to be done: opening the borders to people, making sure the money \nflows more efficiently from the United States to these relief \norganizations, and again find creative new ways of getting them the \nfood. Airdrops alone from 50,000 feet are not going to do the job.\n  I think the administration knows this. I hope there will be yet an \neven stronger commitment. I believe this statement from the Senate is \nextremely important. That is why I introduced this first amendment.\n  Mr. President, I think what I am going to do in order to move things \nforward is I am going to move to the second amendment which deals with \nUzbekistan. Basically, it is a reporting requirement that not later \nthan 3 months after the date of enactment of this act and then 6 months \nthereafter, the Secretary of State shall submit to the appropriate \ncongressional committees the following. This basically we want to get \nan accounting of how our money is used by the military there. This is a \nhuman rights amendment. I will explain it in a moment, after I send the \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator asking unanimous consent to lay \naside the pending amendment?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Until both managers are on the floor, I will lay aside \nthe first amendment and then we can deal with both of them. I think \nboth amendments will be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1923\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1923.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n     SEC.  .  UZBEKISTAN.\n\n       Reports.--Not later than three months after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, and then six months thereafter, the \n     Secretary of State shall submit to the appropriate \n     Congressional committees on the following:\n       (1) The defense articles, defense services, and financial \n     assistance provided by the United States to Uzbekistan during \n     the six-month period ending on the date of such report.\n       (2) The use during such period of defense articles and \n     defense services provided by the United States by units of \n     the Uzbek armed forces, border guards, Ministry of National \n     Security, or Ministry of Internal Affairs.\n       (3) The extent to which any units referred to in paragraph \n     (2) engaged in human rights violations, or violations of \n     international law, during such period.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I did not \nunderstand the request. May I inquire of the Senator how long he will \nbe speaking?\n\n[[Page S10914]]\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from West \nVirginia, I am actually trying to help the managers move along. I think \nI will probably be able to do this in less than 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, would the Senator include my request that I \nfollow his remarks with a statement of my own?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nmy remarks regarding this amendment, the Senator from West Virginia \nhave the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator and I remove my reservation.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The reason I offer this amendment requiring a report \nto Congress with respect to our efforts in Uzbekistan is that prior to \nthe tragedies of September 11, few of us knew anything about this \ncentral Asian country. Yet today Uzbekistan has become one of our most \nimportant allies in this battle against terrorism. In fact, it is one \nof only two states bordering Afghanistan which is willing to host overt \nU.S. military operations to find Osama bin Laden.\n  Although we should welcome the cooperation of Uzbekistan in our \nefforts, we cannot overlook what is happening in Uzbekistan itself. \nSince 1997, this Government has used the threat of terrorism to justify \na total crackdown on independent, peaceful Muslims who pray at home, \nstudy the Koran in small groups, belong to peaceful Islamic \norganizations not registered with the state, or disseminate literature \nnot approved by the state.\n  Colleagues, I am pointing to a real dilemma for us. On the one hand, \nwe understand the need for support. On the other hand, it is terribly \nimportant that we not uncritically align ourselves with governments \nwhich torture citizens.\n  This amendment is an important one, and I want to be clear about what \nit does. First and foremost, it in no way limits our ability to \ncooperate with Uzbekistan. We need Uzbekistan in the fight against \nterrorism, and we must be able to fully cooperate with their Government \nin that fight. But given the reports of grave abuses against civilians \nin the name of fighting terrorism, we need to monitor the cooperation. \nThat is what this amendment is about.\n  The amendment requires that not later than 3 months after its \nenactment the Secretary of State report to appropriate congressional \ncommittees on, No. 1, the defense articles, services, and financial \nassistance provided by the United States to Uzbekistan; No. 2, the use \nof such articles, services, and assistance by the Armed Forces there, \nborder guards, Ministry of National Security, and the Ministry of \nInternal Affairs, and, No. 3, the extent to which any units of these \ngroups engage in a pattern of human rights violations or violations of \ninternational law during that period.\n  In his national address on September 20th, President Bush linked the \nIslamic Movement of Uzbekistan, IMU, to Osama bin Laden, suggesting the \nIMU may be a target of U.S. counterterrorism attacks. Last year, the \nUnited States included the IMU on its list of terrorist organizations. \nThe Government of Uzbekistan has also targeted the IMU as part of its \nown counterterrorism efforts. But according to the most recent \nDepartment of State Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, the \nGovernment of Uzbekistan has responded to the threat of terrorism by \narresting ``hundreds of Islamic leaders and believers on questionable \ngrounds.'' In short, it has used the issue of terrorism to justify a \nfar broader crackdown on peaceful Muslims. It has branded \n``independent'' Muslims as ``extremists,'' and sentenced thousands of \nthem to long prison terms without connecting them to the IMU or to any \nacts recognized as crimes under international law.\n  The Uzbek government has particularly targeted a group known as the \nParty of Liberation. This is an Islamic group that supports the re-\nestablishment of an Islamic state by peaceful means. Membership in this \ngroup or even possession of one of its pamphlets is deemed grounds for \narrest and is punishable by up to twenty years in prison. Even prayer \ndraws suspicion and has been cited in court as evidence of subversive \nintent. According to Human Rights Watch, in one verdict condemning an \nalleged Party of Liberation member to 18 years in prison, the Judge \ndeclared: ``He confessed that in 1996 he started to pray.'' \nIncreasingly, police arrest relatives of those accused of belonging to \nan unregistered Islamic group. In April 1999, the President of \nUzbekistan declared that fathers would be punished for the supposed \nwrongs of their sons, and brothers and often arrested together and even \ntortured in each other's presence.\n  According to the Human Rights Watch World Report for 2001, those \narrested in Uzbekistan endure the worst torture. The Reports states: \n``In addition to hundreds of reports of beatings and numerous accounts \nof the use of electric shock, temporary suffocation, hanging by the \nankles or wrists, removal of fingernails, and punctures with sharp \nobjects, Human Rights Watch received credible reports in 2000 that \npolice sodomized male detainees with bottles, raped them, and beat and \nburned them in the groin area. Male and female detainees were regularly \nthreatened with rape. Police made such threats in particular against \nfemale detainees in the presence of male relatives to force the men to \nsign self-incriminating statements. Police also regularly threatened to \nmurder detainees or their family members and to place minor children in \norphanages.'' Human Rights Watch reports that police torture in \nUzbekistan has resulted in at least fifteen deaths in custody in the \npast two years alone.\n  According to our own Department of State Country Reports on Human \nRights Practices for 2000, the government of Uzbekistan's ``poor human \nrights record worsened, and the Government continued to commit numerous \nserious abuses.'' ``There were credible reports that security force \nmistreatment resulted in the deaths of several citizens in custody. \nPolice and the National Security Service tortured, beat, and harassed \npersons. The security forces arbitrarily arrested or detained pious \nMuslims and other citizens on false charges, frequently planting \nnarcotics, weapons, or forbidden literature on them.'' ``The Government \ncontinues to voice rhetorical support for human rights, but does not \nensure these rights in practice.''\n\n  Just listen to some of these accounts:\n  Thirty-year-old Komlidin Sattarov was arrested in February 2000 for \nalleged possession of Party of Liberation leaflets, following his elder \nbrother's conviction for membership in the group. His defender \nsummarized some of the young man's court testimony of his torture by \npolice:\n\n       He stuck it out for the first one or two days, but then \n     they used electric shock. . . . They put him in a chair and \n     strapped electrodes to his hands, feet, and neck and gave him \n     electric shock. He lost consciousness and then they did it \n     again. He confessed to some of the charges. Then they began \n     to beat him with truncheons, and he agreed to sign \n     everything.\n\n  Prior to a July and August 2000 trial of seventeen men on charges of \nWahabism, a form of Islam, the defendants were held by police and \ntortured over several months. Gafurjon Tohirov testified in court that \nhe was tortured for more than 2 months, that officers had beaten him on \nthe bottoms of his feet and that the white clothes he had been \nwearing--he had just returned from a pilgrimage to Mecca--were covered \nwith blood. While beating another defendant, police allegedly \nconcentrated their blows on the young man's already injured kidneys, \ndue to which, according to one source, the defendant agreed to sign a \nconfession. Another accused was allegedly burned with cigarettes and \nsubsequently raped in custody; investigators also allegedly threatened \nto rape his wife if he refused to give a self-incriminating statement. \nOnce transferred from custody of the National Security Service, SNB, to \nTashkent police headquarters in January 2000, this defendant continued \nto be tortured. A state appointed lawyer allegedly requested medicine \nfor him from his family on January 10, as well as dark trousers to \nreplace his bloodied white ones. They man was kept incommunicado in the \nbasement of police headquarters in Tashkent for sixty-eight days. \nDismissing his and other defendants' detailed allegations of torture, a \njudge of the Tashkent City Court declared on the day of the verdict, \n``No one tortured them. There was no written complaint that they\n\n[[Page S10915]]\n\nwere tortured. When they were asked, they couldn't name their torturers \n. . . [W]e consider their testimony [on torture] as having no \ngrounds.''\n  When brothers Oibek and Uigun Ruzmetov were arrested on charges of \nattempting to overthrow the government, on January 1, 1999, their \nparents were also arrested. Their father on the same day, their mother \non January 5. Their mother recounted that she was held for one night in \nsolitary confinement in the district police station, handcuffed naked \nand given no water. Then they showed her to her son Uigun:\n\n       They . . . stripped me naked . . . Twice they walked him by \n     me. He looked so bad, he had been completely beaten up. I \n     could only cry, I could not talk to him. They told him. \n     ``Your parents and your wife are also in prison. Your \n     children are in an orphanage. If you don't sign these \n     documents, we'll do something very bad to your wife.'' My son \n     at his trial said that he was told they would rape his wife \n     before his eyes if he did not confess.\n\n  Mr. President, these stories are incredible. We can not ignore them. \nTo do so implies that in the war against terrorism, anything goes. That \nkind of attitude will only weaken our war on terrorism, not strengthen \nit. Eighty percent of the population of Uzbekistan is Muslim. To ignore \nUzbek abuses could add fuel to the fire that this is not truly a war on \nterrorism, but is a war on Islam. We must ensure that anti-terrorism \nefforts are conducted in a manner that protects religious freedom and \nother human rights, and we must carefully monitor our cooperation with \nUzbekistan to ensure that protection. The amendment I offer here today \nrequiring a report to Congress on the extent to which any Uzbek units \nreceiving US assistance engaged in human rights violations, or \nviolations of international law, will remind the Uzbek government that \nalthough we welcome their cooperation, we are also watching them.\n  All I am saying is when you have a group of people in a country who, \nbecause of the practice of their faith, are being crushed in this way, \nand you have examples of torture and rape, to the extent that we are \ninvolved with such a country, we ought at least have a monitoring of \nhow the money is spent.\n  I think I will send the statement to Senators because, frankly, it is \nso graphic, it is difficult to go over in great detail.\n  You are talking about a government that has been involved in \nwidespread abuse of human rights. You are talking about a government \nthat has systematically tortured its citizens. I think at a very \nminimum in our work with this government, we have to make sure there is \na very rigorous reporting of how our money is spent in relation to the \nmilitary.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be set aside \nto be accepted as modified.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, what is the Senator's request?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, after both amendments are accepted, I \nwill yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we have looked at both amendments. They \nare certainly acceptable on this side of the aisle.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask whether we might have a voice vote on the \namendments, as modified.\n  Mr. President, I ask for a voice vote on both amendments, as \nmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendments, as \nmodified?\n  Without objection, the amendments are agreed to.\n  The amendments (No. 1923 and No. 1922) were agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the votes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to remind colleagues, \nindependent of the amendments, that I later on today will have a \ncolloquy with Senator Brownback dealing with the whole question of \nwomen and girls being forced into prostitution. We want to talk about \nappropriations for that. I will probably be joined by my colleague, \nSenator Feingold, in some discussion about Plan Colombia. I want to \ntalk about the number of trips I have taken to Colombia and what I have \nseen focusing on human rights and having a chance to speak on the human \nrights position; in particular, the work I have been able to do with a \nvery powerful Jesuit priest, Francisco De Roux, and something I think \nwe can learn from his wisdom.\n  I want to move those amendments along.\n  I want to say two other things very quickly.\n  Last week, we passed a resolution which I have been trying to make \nlong enough so that it can be in the Capitol Hill Police Office \nthanking the Capitol Police for their work.\n  This may be gratuitous--my guess is that Senators are doing this all \nthe time anyway--for which I apologize. I suggest to Senators when they \nare passing by the Capitol Police to be sure to thank them. I met, for \nexample, a young officer today. He told Sheila and me that he has \nlittle children. He sees them 1 hour a day. He is working six 12-hour \ndays. He says that is better than 17-hour days.\n  They are working under a lot of pressure. I want on the floor of the \nSenate to again thank them for their work. I appeal to Senators to go \nout of their way to thank them.\n  If you look at the Capitol Hill Police men and women, you can see a \nlot of exhaustion in their faces. I think we owe a real debt of \ngratitude to them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWest Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken to the Senator from West \nVirginia. We have some amendments that are cleared.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished whip for the \npurpose that he is now requesting. I ask unanimous consent that upon \nthe completion of his remarks and the action on amendments I be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to the Senator \nfrom West Virginia.\n  Senator McConnell and Senator Leahy have every intention of moving \nthis bill as quickly as possible. If Members have amendments, they had \nbetter bring them because the managers aren't going to wait around all \nday long for Members to bring amendments to the floor. After reasonable \ntime goes by and Members haven't gone to amendments, we are going to \nmove to third reading of this bill.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 1924 through 1939, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nfor the Senate to consider, en bloc, 15 amendments; that the amendments \nbe considered and agreed to en bloc; that the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table en bloc; that the consideration of these amendments \nappear separately in the Record; and that any statements or colloquies \nbe printed in the Record.\n  These amendments have been reviewed very closely by the managers of \nthe bill and their staff.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. McConnell and \n     others, proposes amendments numbered 1924 through 1939.\n\n  The amendments (Nos. 1924 through 1939) were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1924\n\n (Purpose: To make avaialble funds to assess the cause of the flooding \n along the Volta River in Accra, Ghana, and to make recommendations on \n                       how to solve the problem)\n\n       On page 125 line 16, before the period at the end of the \n     line insert the following: ``: Provided further, That, of the \n     funds appropriated under this heading, up to $100,000 should \n     be made available for an assessment of the causes of the \n     flooding along the Volta River in Accra, Ghana, and to make \n     recommendations for solving the problem''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1925\n\n       On page 133, line 17, after ``States'' insert the \n     following: ``, of which not to exceed $28,000,000 shall be \n     available for the cost, as defined in section 502 of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974, of modifying direct loans \n     and guarantees for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1926\n\n       On page 229, line 12, after ``steps'' insert the following: \n     ``, additional to those undertaken in fiscal year 2001,''.\n       On page 229, line 16, strike everything after ``(3)'' \n     through ``law'' on line 17, and insert in\n\n[[Page S10916]]\n\n     lieu thereof: ``taking steps, additional to those undertaken \n     in fiscal year 2001, to implement policies which reflect a \n     respect for minority rights and the rule of law, including \n     the release of all political prisoners from Serbian jails and \n     prisons''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1927\n\n       On page 176, line 15, strike ``$14,500,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$15,500,000''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1928\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n\n                           disability access\n\n       Sec.   .

Mr. President, I offer this amendment along with \nSenators Helms and Leahy out of concern with the continued detention of \npolitical prisoners in Serb jails. Our amendment is simple and \nstraightforward: It makes absolutely clear that among the certification \nrequirements contained in section 575 of this bill is the release of \nthese prisoners. I urge the democrats and reformers in Belgrade to take \nnotice of our actions, and to release the political prisoners \nimmediately. I yield the floor to my friend from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I find it incomprehensible for a government that claims to\n\n[[Page S10917]]\n\nbe democratic and just to sustain this cruel vestige of the Milosevic \nera.\n  Last August, I asked my staff to travel to Serbia and visit these \nAlbanian political prisoners. My intent was the following: I wanted to \ncheck on the physical conditions of these prisoners. I wanted to ensure \nthat they and their families know the United States has not forgotten \nabout their suffering. I wanted to underscore to authorities in \nBelgrade that they must release these political prisoners who were \narrested, too often brutally tortured, sentenced and jailed by \nMilosevic and his system of kangaroo justice. And, I wanted to remind \nBelgrade that failure to do so will have consequences for their \nrelationship with the United States.\n  Serbian Justice Minister Batic cooperatively arranged meetings for my \nstaff. These took place in two Serbian jails with four Kosovar Albanian \nprisoners: Kurti Aljbin, Isljam Taci, Berisa Petrit, and Sulejman \nBitici. These four individuals, I might add, were chosen at the \nrecommendation of an extremely courageous woman, Natasa Kandic of the \nHumanitarian Law Center in Yugoslavia. Ms. Kandic is Serb, who at great \nrisk to her personal safety, has provided these and other Albanian \npolitical prisoners legal and humanitarian assistance.\n  The stories of these four political prisoners speak volumes to the \natrocities and injustice of the Milosevic regime. Imagine being \narrested because you are an Albanian student, thrown in jail only to \nlearn later that there were no formal charges brought against you, and \neven if there were you couldn't appeal them because your file had \n``disappeared'' or it was burned. Imagine being thrown out of a fourth \nstory window so that your legs would break, or being subjected to \nrepeated beatings, shock torture, and mock executions. That is exactly \nwhat happened during the Milosevic era.\n  The good news is that these tortures have ended. However, ending the \ntorture is not enough. Each day Belgrade keeps people like Kurti \nAljbin, Isljam Taci, Berisa Petrit, and Sulejman Bitici locked behind \nbars is another day that Belgrade has continued the horrors and \ninjustice of the Milosevic regime. And this is totally unacceptable.\n  One prisoner asked the poignant question: ``If Milosevic is in jail, \nwhy are we still here?'' The fact is there is no justifiable answer to \nthis question. I yield the floor to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. It has been almost a year since the fall of Milosevic, and \nmore than five months have passed since his arrest. While some Albanian \nprisoners were released earlier this year, there are still more than \n100 Albanian political prisoners languishing in Serb jails. There is no \njustification under any circumstances, to imprison innocent people. \nSerb officials know this. These people should never have been arrested, \nand they should have been released long ago.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the Senator yield for an additional comment? I \ncontinue to be keenly interested in the investigation into the murder \nof the three American brothers of Albanian descent from New York who \nwere recently found in a mass grave in Serbia. Justice must be served \nfor their murders, which occurred at the end of the war in Kosova.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized \nunder the previous order.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I also congratulate and thank Senator Kennedy who spoke earlier for \nthe proposals and suggestions, and the good counsel that he offered to \nthe Senate at this critical time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/24/senate-section/article/S10917-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10917-S10919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMAINING A SENSE OF SECURITY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this morning the U.S. Postmaster General \nwarned Americans that their mail is not guaranteed to be safe.\n  The American people have been on an emotional roller coaster ride \never since September 11. In the days and weeks following the terrorist \nattacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the American people \ncollectively have experienced a national anxiety attack--fear, remorse, \noutrage, despair, confusion, depression, and unease have all manifested \nthemselves in recent weeks.\n\n  Before the brutal terrorist attacks of September 11, American \nconsumers were already nervous as layoff announcements rolled out of \nauto factories, and stock market retirement savings dissipated into \nthin air. Since that dark day, the economy has grown even more unstable \nas consumers, seized with fear--Franklin D. Roosevelt said, there is \nnothing for us to fear but fear itself, but fear is here, and it \npermeates throughout this city and throughout the Nation--consumers, \nseized with fear, have stayed riveted to their television sets and away \nfrom shopping malls.\n  American consumers have postponed taking that much-deserved family \nvacation out of fear of getting onto an airplane. I would share that \nsame fear. I know it is all right for some to say, go ahead and ride an \nairplanes if you have the Secret Service there to protect you and you \ncan go on a special plane, but I would not ride on a commercial plane \nright now because I share that fear. Consumers are shunning \nrestaurants, avoiding movie theaters and other public gathering places \nwhich they fear might be the target of new terrorist attacks.\n\n  Although the initial shock has begun to wear off, and economic \nactivity has recovered somewhat from the weeks immediately following \nthe terrorist attacks, nearly 200,00 Americans lost their jobs last \nmonth--the largest monthly decline since February 1991, more than 10 \nyears ago--and the unemployment rate is expected to soar to well over 5 \npercent in this month alone. This on top of the fear that has kept \npeople away from the streets of Washington.\n\n  Just a few days ago, I recall, Metro was offering free tickets to \npeople in the suburban areas in an attempt to entice them to come into \nthe city of Washington and go to the restaurants and go to the stores. \nAnd the restaurants were offering free food in some instances or a free \nglass of wine to encourage people to come into this city, the Capital \nCity, which was burned by the--I hope the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts will wait just a moment. I want to mention something he \nwill remember.\n  This Capitol was burned during the War of 1812 by the British. It is \npractically empty now. The Senator from Massachusetts will remember, \nwith me, something that was occurring in this city 39 years ago right \nnow. I was here on October 22, 1962--1962 or 1963?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It was 1962.\n  Mr. BYRD. The late President John F. Kennedy delivered an ultimatum \nto the then-leaders of the Soviet Union to get their missiles out of \nCuba. That was on Monday of this week, 39 years ago. We Senators then \nfelt the same angst that we do now.\n  The President, in a television address, delivered this ultimatum. \nPresident Kennedy also suggested that there be regional meetings where \nwe Members of Congress--I was a Member of the Senate--could go to \nregional meetings and get briefings. The Senate was not in session. The \nSenate had gone out of session on the October 13 sine die. And the late \nPresident John F. Kennedy informed Members of Congress that he would \ngive them notice to come into Washington if the necessity arose.\n  There was fear throughout the land. That was 39 years ago this week. \nOn Sunday of this week 39 years ago Nikita Khrushchev capitulated to \nPresident Kennedy's demand that those missiles, be pulled out of Cuba.\n  President Kennedy instructed our naval ships to stop any ship that \napproached Cuba and to search that ship. And there was a ship that \napproached Cuba. I forget what flag it was flying, but our naval units \nstopped it, searched it; and when we finally determined that Nikita \nKhrushchev really meant what he said, that he would get those missiles \nout of Cuba, then we relaxed.\n  I had no intention of bringing my wife into this city during those \ndays. They were very tense days. The people were not just thinking of \nanthrax; they were thinking of nuclear war. We had strong leadership--\nstrong leadership--that laid it down to the Soviet leaders. Mr. \nKhrushchev, who had once beaten his shoe upon the desk and said: We \nwill bury you--that was Khrushchev--he was soon relieved of his \nleadership\n\n[[Page S10918]]\n\nposition in the Soviet Union. Mr. Brezhnev then became the First \nSecretary, and who Nikolai Bulganin who became the Premier of the \nSoviet Union. But those were the conditions 39 years ago right now in \nthis city.\n  Well, fortunately, we are not facing what appeared to then be perhaps \nan immediate nuclear attack on this country. And some of the nuclear \nmissiles could have emanated from Cuba. Here we are again now, and we \nhave received a terrorist attack on the World Trade buildings in New \nYork City and on the Pentagon. We are faced now with an even more \nsubtle and sinister attack on the people in this city. As I said \nearlier, the Postmaster General indicated just this morning that the \nAmerican people cannot be guaranteed their mail is safe.\n\n  I say to my wife--my wife of 64 years, I hasten to add--Don't you go \nto the mailbox. Leave the mail in that box until I come home. I will \nget the mail out of the box.\n  That is the kind of fear that is permeating this whole country, this \nwhole city, this whole complex from which I speak today.\n  Our staffs are warned about the mail that comes to us from our \nconstituents. It may be a letter, a package, something that was not \nsent by a constituent in our mail. So our staffs are in fear.\n  The unemployment rate is expected to soar to well over 5 percent in \nthis month alone. The Congress will soon consider a stimulus plan. It \nis being discussed. Preparations for such a plan are going forward. I \nhave had my Appropriations Committee staff working on a stimulus \npackage, one that will include funds for homeland security, homeland \ndefense. This stimulus plan is aimed at providing a shot in the arm to \nour flagging economy.\n  We hear a lot about business tax cuts. I have already voted against a \ngargantuan $1.3 or $1.6 or $1.8 or $2 trillion tax cut earlier this \nyear. Now we hear that there are going to be further tax cuts. A \nmeasure is making its way in the House of Representatives, I \nunderstand, that would provide up to $100 billion in tax cuts and \nalmost $200 billion, $195 billion over 10 years. Business tax cuts, \nincreased unemployment benefits, subsidized health insurance premiums \nare all on the table. But none of these--none of these--will help to \nassuage the psychology of fear that grips this land of ours.\n  The surest way to stabilize the economy and encourage Americans to \nget back on airplanes, to go back to the shopping malls, to go back to \nthe automobile dealerships--look over those shiny automobiles, kick the \ntires, see if the windshield wiper works, raise the lid of the trunk--\nthe way to get people back to those dealerships, the way to get people \nback to those neighborhood restaurants, the way to get people back to \nthe movie theaters and to take their children is to take positive steps \nto address their fears, the fears of the American people about future \nterrorist attacks.\n  I might as well talk about this fear. We all know it is here. The \ndistinguished Senator from Florida, who is a former astronaut, who \npresides over the Senate today with such a degree of skill and dignity, \nhe knows this, he knows what we are talking about. The people at the \ndesk here in front of us, this is no secret to them; they know what \nfear is. The pages know about it. Why not say it?\n  The best way to make our people feel safe again and to defeat the \nintentions of the terrorists is to go ahead with this stimulus package, \ncertainly to move ahead with funding for homeland security in its many \nforms.\n  We can start by addressing our woefully inadequate border security; \nput more Immigration and Naturalization Service personnel on our \nborders; put more Customs agents on our borders; enhance this woefully \ninadequate border security. I doubt that many Americans find comfort in \nlearning that the Immigration and Naturalization Service cannot account \nfor how 6 of the 19 hijackers involved in the September 11 attacks \ngot into the United States. Likewise, how much comfort do the American \npeople find in knowing that the U.S. Customs Service--get this now--\ninspects only 2 percent of the cargo that enters the United States? We \nare wide open--wide open. And the terrorists have known that. As a \nmatter of fact, we have been lucky not to have been hit many times \nprior to September 11.\n\n  We can reassure the American people that the Government of the United \nStates is doing all it can to prepare for a biological or chemical act. \nThe American people have learned firsthand in recent days that chemical \nand biological weapons are no longer the stuff of fiction but are real \nthreats that can suddenly claim the lives of American citizens. We must \ntrain our doctors and nurses to diagnose and care for victims of \nbioterrorism as well as to contain any possible resulting outbreak.\n  We must expand our Nation's reserve of vaccines and antibiotics, and \nwe must provide our local health departments, in Beckley, WV, \nParkersburg, Clarksburg, Martinsburg, in cities all throughout this \nland, in towns all throughout this land, in hamlets all throughout this \nland, provide our local health departments, so many of which are in \nrural isolated areas, with access to the Nation's computerized networks \nof medical response information.\n  Our Nation's transportation network faces a similar daunting upgrade. \nIn the days immediately following the September 11 attacks, airport \nsecurity was improved, but much remains to be done. New scanning \nequipment must be built and installed as quickly as possible. Better \ntrained inspectors must be hired. Security enhancements must be made at \nour Nation's airports, and the same case must be made for improvements \nto our roads and bridges, our railroads, our water and sewer systems, \nour law enforcement capabilities that have suffered due to years of \nneglect. Hear me now! Due to years of neglect, we have allowed our \ninfrastructure to become antiquated! With the threat of further \nviolence on American soil, everything from dams and reservoirs and \nlocks and dams to nuclear powerplants to the method of transporting the \nNation's food supply, we need to beef up the inspections of our meat, \nour poultry, our imported food--all these things must be examined in \nterms of their potential vulnerability. By renewing our commitment to \ninvestments in our own country, we can help to mend the holes in \nAmerica's homeland security.\n\n  Mr. President, the American people are looking to the Congress for \nreassurance. The American people want to know that their \nrepresentatives understand their fears--the people's fears--and the \npeople's uncertainties. They want to know that the men and women in \nthis legislative branch--the Senate and the House--understand these \nthings and are taking steps to deal with potential threats.\n  Partisan disputes breed uncertainty in our financial markets and in \nour economy. All of us ought to be ashamed of the slowness with which \nwe have dealt with the appropriations bills. They are ready. We have \ncompleted conferences on and we have acted upon the conference reports \non 2 bills--2 out of 13 bills. And here we are. We have had two \ncontinuing resolutions, and we are now somewhat in the midst of the \ntime allotted by the second continuing resolution. We have instead been \narguing over other things--things that didn't have anything to do, as \nfar as I am concerned, with getting on with the appropriations bills.\n  Partisanship. Partisanship must no longer reign over this Senate or \nover the House of Representatives--at least until we get our \nappropriations bills completed. And we had better be busy about that. \nWe should allow the President 10 days after we send him the last \nappropriations bill. He should be allowed 10 days in which to sign the \nlast appropriations bill or to veto it. He should not be given the \nopportunity to pocket veto an appropriations bill. We need to be busy \nabout the people's business.\n  The American people want to regain that sense of security that they \nlost on September 11. They want to get on an airplane without worrying \nabout hijackers. They want to go to work free of angst about every \npiece of mail that comes into the office. Those who go to movies want \nto relax while they are there, and they are entitled to that. Those who \ngo to the shopping malls want to relax without looking over their \nshoulders, as it were. Unless we take--when I say ``we,'' I mean us \nfolks--unless we take immediate and serious steps to address these \nfears, all of the rhetoric about normalcy is just plain old hot air.\n\n[[Page S10919]]\n\n  This Government's most basic responsibility is to take all--not just \na few but all--feasible steps to protect its citizens. The conflict is \nnot just in the steep mountains of the Himalayas in Afghanistan. I was \nthere 46 years ago. Let me tell you folks, you have seen the Rockies. \nGo to the Himalayas; spend some time in Afghanistan. The winter is \ncoming on, and soon. And there are millions of landmines waiting on a \nfootstep.\n  The conflict is not just in the mountains of Afghanistan. Our people \nare at risk on our own soil. Congress, therefore, must act now to \nensure the security of the Nation and the American people. By investing \nin measures that strengthen our ability to guard our citizens right \nhere at home, we can take an important step toward removing the \nparalysis--the paralysis--go look that word up in the dictionary, and \nif you haven't noticed it before, you will see it--the paralysis of \nfear. Look at our empty office buildings on Jenkins Hill right here.\n  We can take an important step toward removing the paralysis that \nresults from living in fear. This should be our mission in the days \nahead as we craft a stimulus package. Whether or not we craft a \nstimulus package, we have 11 appropriations bills awaiting action here \nin one form or another. They will be coming along in conference \nreports. There are appropriations bills such as the one before the \nSenate now that will be up for action in this body. So let's get busy \nabout our work. This should be our mission in the days ahead as we \ncraft a stimulus package that can restore confidence, which is the \nbackbone of a strong economy.\n  Mr. President, I thank all Senators and I yield.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/24/senate-section/article/S10919-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10919-S10922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING AND RELATED PROGRAMS \n                  APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2002--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I rise to speak about an amendment to \nthe foreign operations bill. I understand it has been accepted. It \ndeals with funding for leadership training for Afghan women. I think \nthis is an important amendment. Even though it is not a great deal of \nmoney that is involved, I think it is important for us to do.\n  The proposed amendment funds a specially created training program for \nAfghan women involving civil society development, democracy building, \nand leadership, at a cost of $2 million. It is not a large amount of \nmoney, but if we can get women involved back in the Afghan society, it \nis an important amount of money.\n  This funding has two purposes. First, it helps talented but direly \ndisenfranchised Afghan women to strategically participate in nation \nbuilding. Second, this is a symbolic expression of support from the \nCongress for Afghan women under the present Taliban regime.\n  The American people are engaged in a war right now. It is a war \nagainst those who want to destroy our physical well-being, our peace of \nmind, and our way of life. It is a war against the Taliban, which \ncontinues to provide fertile soil and a shield for terrorists. It is \nnot, however, a war against the Afghan people, as the President \nrepeatedly stated and as Members of this body have stated. In fact, the \nAfghan people are the victims of the Taliban, and no one group has \nsuffered more than the women.\n  We have all heard the horrible stories by now: How women are forced \nto hide behind closed doors, prisoners in their own homes, some even \nstarving because there is no male relative to take them to market; how \nthey are barred from schools and jobs and from desperately needed \nhealth care; how they are beaten in the streets if their ankles are \nshowing; how they are beaten for begging, even though they are \nforbidden to work; how they are beaten for no reason at all; how they \nare continually silenced, hidden, and treated as less than human--all \nof this in the 21st century.\n  I am sure some of my colleagues and others recall the images on CNN \nof Afghan women fleeing Afghanistan into Pakistan dressed in burqas \nthat completely cover them. All she has is a small mesh area through \nwhich to look and breathe. That is so dehumanizing, as if this is not a \nperson; they are not recognized as a separate individual.\n  It has not always been like that in Afghanistan. That is important \nfor us to know and remember as well. These same women who now hide with \nfear and are forced into these burqas once had a voice in their \ncountry. Some choose to wear a certain traditional garb, and that is \nwonderful, but they should not be forced to do it.\n  In Afghanistan, women once represented half the students, half the \ncivil servants, and 40 percent of the doctors in Kabul were once women. \nOnce they were valued members of their society, and they must become \nthis again. To accomplish this, they will need our help and support, \nand we should give it.\n  I am pleased to offer this amendment with Senator Boxer. She and I \nhelped pass a resolution 2 years ago condemning the Taliban regime. \nThis amendment has been accepted by the managers of the bill. I am very \npleased with that.\n  This amendment funds $2 million for scholarships for Afghan women. \nThere will be approximately 300 women selected to participate in \ntraining programs for emerging leaders. They will be instructed in \ncivil society development, including effective governance, economic \ndevelopment, establishing nongovernmental organizations, and an \nindependent press, among other fundamentals of a free society, \nincluding the right to vote for all citizens in Afghanistan and human \nrights, including religious freedom for all citizens and people of \nAfghanistan.\n  The Afghan women will learn from top professors and experts in the \nfield. Their curriculum will be developed in close consultation with \nAfghan women's groups on the ground in South Asia and in the United \nStates. A selection of candidates will be made in close consultation \nwith leading Afghan women in exile and leading Afghan women still in \nAfghanistan today, and United States embassies abroad.\n  I believe programs such as these can help play a key role in \nstabilizing the region and rebuilding the lives of its citizens. The \nUnited States is at its best when it stands up for our fundamental \nprinciples, and that includes the right to vote for everybody, the \nright of participation for everybody, democracy, freedom, religious \nfreedom, and human rights.\n  This amendment can give the women who have far too long been \nvictimized by the Taliban brutality the tools to rebuild a new \nAfghanistan on the foundation of democracy, tolerance, human rights, \nand equality.\n  Lastly, this funding not only helps Afghanistan; it also helps \nAmerica. As Afghan women promote democratic values in their society, \nthey inherently prevail over the forces of terrorism, extremism, and \nrepression which have also victimized us.\n  I am pleased my colleagues have accepted this amendment, and I look \nforward to its implementation where we help Afghan women rebuild a \ncivil society in their country. As we move forward in the prosecution \nof this war in Afghanistan, it is very important that our next step, \nonce we are able to secure the country, is to rebuild a civil society \nwith everybody participating.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise to offer some comments on the \nbill before us, the foreign operations appropriations bill.\n  Today we are considering the fiscal year 2002 foreign operations \nappropriations bill. I ask my fellow Senators to consider this: The \ntotal foreign assistance spending in this legislation represents just \n.79 percent of the entire $1.9 trillion Federal budget. That is less \nthan half of what it was just 15 years ago, and it is barely .1 percent \nof GDP. An even smaller amount of the bill's funding is for foreign \ndevelopment assistance, less than .6 percent of the budget.\n  Anemic U.S. foreign assistance spending is not new news, but it is \npart of a very sad legacy of more than two decades of declining foreign \nassistance spending.\n  But at precisely the time when the events of September 11 have driven\n\n[[Page S10920]]\n\nhome what an integrated and globalized world we live in, a world that \nrequires us, I believe, to reexamine the basic underpinnings of U.S. \nnational security policy, it is baffling that the United States remains \non a course to tie a post-World War II low in foreign assistance \nspending and a 50-year low of overseas assistance as a share of \nGovernment spending.\n  I do not mean this as any criticism of the managers of the bill. \nGiven the administration's request and the allocations of the \nsubcommittee, they have done an excellent job of putting together a \n$15.5 billion bill. But in light of September 11, I strongly believe \nthat the fundamental assumptions regarding how best to safeguard U.S. \nnational security interests over the long term require rethinking and \nreexamination.\n  As America undertakes a war on terrorism, we must declare war on \nglobal poverty as well, and we must do so because our national security \ndemands no less.\n  If we are going to win this war against terrorism, we have to be \nwilling to invest in the lives and livelihoods of the people of the \ndeveloping world. For it is the poverty and the resulting political \ninstability and institutional weakness of developing countries, many of \nthem failed or near failed states, which provide the ecosystem in which \nterrorists, terrorist operations, terrorist recruitment, and terrorist \norganizations are able to flourish.\n  The World Bank estimates that 1.2 billion residents of poor nations \nlive on less than $1 a day. In South Asia alone, more than 550 million \npeople, 40 percent of the total population, live on less than $1 a day. \nIn sub-Saharan Africa it is close to 50 percent of the population. I \nknow the Chair is eminently familiar with this. Close to 50 percent of \nthe population--that is, 291 million people, or more than the entire \npopulation of the United States--live in that abject, grinding poverty.\n  All in all, about 2.8 million people, half of the world's population, \nlive in poverty, getting by on $2 a day. That is less than a cappuccino \nat Starbucks.\n  The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations \nestimates that nearly 800 million people in the developing world are \nundernourished, 1.2 billion lack access to safe drinking water, 2.9 \nbillion have inadequate access to sanitation, and over 1 billion people \nare either unemployed or underemployed.\n  For all too many of these people, there is precious little hope in \ntheir daily life, and they experience a world in which progress or \nbetterment is virtually impossible.\n  Yet, as a recent Congressional Budget Office study on the role of \nforeign aid and development reports: ``U.S. spending on foreign aid has \nfluctuated from year to year but has been on a downward path since the \n1960s.''\n  In 1962, the United States spent more than 3 percent of the budget \noutlays on foreign assistance. Today, as I noted, it is barely six-\ntenths of 1 percent. This is unconscionable. Interestingly enough, \npeople do not understand this. I often ask people: How much do you \nthink the foreign operations budget is as a percent of the overall \nbudget? Some will say 5 percent, some will say 10 percent, some will \nsay 15 percent, but nobody says less than 1 percent.\n  Yet that is the fact. The United States spends less than $30 a year \nfor each of its citizens helping those in the developing world, \ncompared with a median per capita contribution of $70 by other \nindustrialized nations. This has not always been the case and, I would \nargue, it is also not becoming of America's position and role in the \nworld.\n  Between 1950 and 1968, the United States contributed more than half \nof the official development assistance provided by countries in the \nOECD Development Assistance Committee, and by 1978 we were contributing \nless than a third. By 1998, it was less than a sixth, where it \nlanguishes today.\n  Some would question why this matters, or they would argue that it is \nthe responsibility of others, not us, to address these development \nneeds.\n  The short answer is that it matters because development assistance is \na critical tool for the protection and promotion of U.S. interests \naround the globe. It matters because poverty leads to financial \ninstability, infectious disease, environmental degradation, illegal \nimmigration, drugs, narcotic trafficking, and it fuels the hatred of \n``have-not'' nations for the ``have'' nations, of which the United \nStates heads the list.\n  Although not the sole cause of perceived grievances in an \nincreasingly unequal and increasingly globalized world, poverty is a \nprincipal cause of human suffering, and the political instability that \nresults as well.\n  In its worst form, poverty creates the political, social, economic, \nand institutional instability and chaos that leads to failed states, \nzones of anarchy, and lawlessness, with semi-legitimate governments, or \nno real functioning government, which are unable to offer their people \na positive vision of the future and instead utilize the United States \nas a scapegoat for their hopelessness.\n  It matters because into the void of failed states, and lives without \nhope or the prospect for betterment, step terrorists, fanatics, \nextremists, and others who take advantage of these situations for their \nown ends.\n  If a state is unable to educate its young, terrorists and extremists \nwill only be too happy to indoctrinate the young, poisoning their \nminds. If a country is unable to offer young men or women the prospect \nof a job and self-respect, terrorists, fanatics, and extremists are \nmore than happy to offer conspiracy theories to explain misfortune and \noffer alternative employment in their criminal enterprises. And if a \ngovernment is unable to offer its people a positive prospect for the \nfuture, terrorists or fanatics are able to offer their own distorted \nview of the world and twisted vision of the future.\n  It matters because poverty creates the swamp in which the terrorists \nfind protection and sustenance, and it matters in short because our \nnational security interests and the lives and safety of our citizens \ndepend on us recognizing this. It matters, I strongly believe, because \nself-interest aside, the United States has a strong moral global \nobligation, especially in cases such as Afghanistan and now Pakistan, \nto provide assistance to those who have helped us in the past and who \nstand with us today in this war on terrorism.\n  Foreign assistance and development assistance are valuable elements \nin our toolbox to respond to the events of September 11, and in cases \nwhere diplomacy or military force cannot be used, they may be the only \ntools available.\n  When nations who are friends or allies of the United States were \nsubject to terrorist attacks prior to September 11, all too often the \nU.S. reaction was to bemoan the rough neighborhood in which these \nnations live and shrug our shoulders as if nothing could be done. But \nSeptember 11 proved with startling clarity all of the globe is a \nneighborhood today, our neighborhood, and we must see what can be done; \nfor if we continue to do nothing, it is at our peril.\n\n  I would not argue that the United States should waste foreign \nassistance spending on ineffective programs, or on projects where \nrampant corruption prevents us from assuring that our assistance \nreaches those in need.\n  But a report last year by the Overseas Development Council suggests \nthat many aid programs have been successful. They have contributed to \nadvances in public health, sanitation, and education.\n  As a first step in this new war on global poverty, then, it is \ncritical that the government, private foundations, and nongovernmental \norganizations come together to identify areas where increased spending \ncan make a difference, especially in the world's poorest regions. This \nreview must also look at what government and private voluntary donors \nhave learned about how to make delivery of assistance more effective.\n  This evaluation should also extend to the activities of the World \nBank, the International Monetary Fund, and other multilateral \ndevelopment and lending institutions. Where these institutions need to \nbe reformed, and I believe they do, their activities should be \nredefined today.\n  Once this evaluation is complete, I believe it is critical we reverse \nthe past two decades of a downward trend in U.S. foreign assistance \nspending and dramatically increase funding, including that channeled \nthrough foundations and nongovernmental organizations.\n\n[[Page S10921]]\n\n  According to the U.N. Development Program, some $40 billion a year--\nremember, we are at $15 billion--would provide water and sanitation, \nreproductive health, basic health and nutrition, and basic education \nfor all in need in the developing world.\n  To help meet our share of this need, I believe and propose we triple \nthe foreign assistance budget within 5 years, bringing it back up to \nwhat it was before, roughly, and this is still a meager amount, 0.3 \npercent of gross domestic product. I fully believe such an increase in \nUnited States foreign assistance spending would be leveraged by \nincreases in assistance contributions by other potential public and \nprivate donors.\n  In addition to traditional economic development programs, our renewed \nfocus on fighting international poverty must also focus on the creation \nof public goods, democratic institutions, rule of law, functioning and \nlegitimate educational systems which allow public and economic progress \nand growth to take root and flourish.\n  The image of ``draining the swamp'' of terrorists has become a \ncommonplace metaphor, but the metaphor has its limits. The \nenvironmental elements which contribute to the germination and \nflourishing of terrorists and extremists cannot, in fact, simply be \ndrained away. Indeed, I am worried that if we do not act wisely and \naddress every dimension and level of this war on terrorism we run the \nrisk of fueling a new generation of terrorists.\n  Rather, we must adopt a long-term, carefully crafted strategy to \nreduce and perhaps even eliminate factors such as global poverty, which \nunderlie and foster terrorism. So I call upon my colleagues to \nrecognize that such long-term efforts are as much a part of the burden \nof global leadership and the war on terrorism as cruise missiles and \naircraft carriers. Meeting this obligation of leadership demands and \nrequires a serious, long-term commitment of the necessary resources by \nthe United States.\n  As one Senator, I am prepared to make that commitment and I hope my \ncolleagues are as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1940\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk, and I \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer), for herself and \n     Mr. Brownback, proposes an amendment numbered 1940.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the important \n       role of women in the future reconstruction of Afghanistan)\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF \n                   WOMEN IN THE FUTURE RECONSTRUCTION OF \n                   AFGHANISTAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that:\n       (1) Prior to the rise of the Taliban in 1996, women \n     throughout Afghanistan enjoyed greater freedoms, compromising \n     70 percent of school teachers, 50 percent of civilian \n     government workers, and 40 percent of doctors in Kabul.\n       (2) In Taliban-controlled areas of Afghanistan, women have \n     been banished from the work force, schools have been closed \n     to girls and women expelled from universities, women have \n     been prohibited from leaving their homes unless accompanied \n     by a close male relative, and publicly visible windows of \n     women's houses have been ordered to be painted black.\n       (3) In Taliban-controlled areas of Afghanistan, women have \n     been forced to wear the burqa (or chadari)--which completely \n     shrouds the body, leaving only a small mesh-covered opening \n     through which to see.\n       (4) In Taliban-controlled areas of Afghanistan, women and \n     girls have been prohibited from being examined by male \n     physicians whole at the same time, most female doctors and \n     nurses have been prohibited from working.\n       (5) In Taliban-controlled areas of Afghanistan, women have \n     been brutally beaten, publicly flogged, and killed for \n     violating Taliban decrees.\n       (6) The United States and the United Nations have never \n     recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of \n     Afghanistan, in part, because of their horrific treatment of \n     women and girls.\n       (7) Afghan women and children now make up 75 percent of the \n     millions of Afghan refugees living in neighboring countries \n     in substandard conditions with little food and virtually no \n     clean water or sanitation.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) Afghan women organizations must be included in planning \n     the future reconstruction of Afghanistan.\n       (2) Future governments in Afghanistan should work to \n     achieve the following goals:\n       (A) The effective participation of women in all civil, \n     economic, and social life.\n       (B) The right of women to work.\n       (C) The right of women and girls to an education without \n     discrimination and the reopening of schools to women and \n     girls at all levels of education.\n       (D) The freedom of movement of women and girls.\n       (E) Equal access of women and girls to health facilities.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. For the benefit of my colleagues, I will not take but \nabout 7 minutes on this and one other amendment dealing with suicide \nbombing, both of which I believe will be adopted. I will be very brief \nand ask my colleagues' indulgence.\n  Madam President, I know you are very well aware of the women in \nAfghanistan under the rule of the Taliban. I give praise to this \norganization called Fund for the Feminist Majority that brought this \nissue to my attention several years ago. I was unaware of what the \nTaliban were, what they were doing to women. My friends came to see me \nand not only told me about the abuses of the Taliban toward women but \nthey also told me the women were forced to wear these burqas, \ndehumanizing them, taking away every semblance of humanity from the \nwomen.\n  Therefore, what we try to do in this amendment after we detail the \ncondition of women, which the clerk read so beautifully, we talk about \nthe fact they have to wear the burqas which completely shroud their \nbody, leaving only a small mesh-covered opening through which to see. \nAmericans have seen that on TV. Women are completely obscured. If you \ntry on one of those burqas, you can barely breathe.\n  We know women in Taliban-controlled areas of Afghanistan have been \nprohibited from being examined by male physicians while, at the same \ntime, most female doctors and nurses have been prohibited from working. \nWe know women have been brutally beaten and publicly flogged, even \nexecuted, and we have seen that on CNN on an incredible documentary \ncalled ``From Beneath The Veil.''\n  Senator Brownback and I in this amendment say it is the sense of the \nSenate that Afghan women organizations must be included in planning for \nthe future reconstruction of Afghanistan and that the goal of the new \ngovernment should be equality for all.\n  That is all I have to say about this amendment. I ask it be laid \naside, and I ask to call up my second amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1941\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1941.\n\n       (Purpose: Condemning suicide bombings as a terrorist act)\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE CONDEMNING SUICIDE BOMBINGS AS A \n                   TERRORIST ACT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that:\n       (1) Suicide bombings have killed and injured countless \n     people throughout the world.\n       (2) Suicide bombings and the resulting death and injury \n     demean the importance of human life.\n       (3) There are no circumstances under which suicide bombings \n     can be justified, including considerations of a political, \n     philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or \n     other similar nature.\n       (4) Religious leaders, including the highest Muslim \n     authority in Saudi Arabia, the Grand Mufti, have spoken out \n     against suicide bombings.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) Suicide bombings are a horrific form of terrorism that \n     must be universally condemned.\n       (2) The United Nations should specifically condemn all \n     suicide bombings by resolution.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I think this amendment is very clear. As \nfar as we can tell, the United Nations has never passed a specific \nresolution condemning suicide bombings, nor has the Senate done it, as \nfar as I can tell. This would be important. Religious leaders of all \nkinds have basically said\n\n[[Page S10922]]\n\nthere is never a political reason, a philosophical reason, an \nideological reason, a racial, ethnic, or religious reason, no reason \nfor someone to become a suicide bomber. It demeans life.\n  I am very hopeful the managers of the bill will accept this \namendment. I have no need to speak any longer on it except to say I am \nhopeful it will be passed.\n  I ask the Presiding Officer if it is appropriate because I want to \nmake sure the amendment is disposed of--if it is appropriate to ask for \nthe yeas and nays or simply to lay it aside at this time; what is \nappropriate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can do either.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask this amendment be laid aside. In doing so, I have \ntwo amendments laid aside, one dealing with the Afghan women and one \ndealing with suicide bombings. I thank my colleagues for their \nforbearance. I am pleased to be on the Foreign Relations Committee \nwhere I have an opportunity to work on these matters.\n  I thank my Republican friend, and I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Allen be added as the original cosponsor of the suicide bombing \namendment. I thank him and Senator Brownback for working with me on \nboth issues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is laid aside.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Before the Senator from California leaves, I wonder if \nshe would put me on the two amendments, and I thank the Senator for \nrecognizing I have been waiting. I do appreciate the brevity.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague. I am very proud to ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Domenici as an original cosponsor of both \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/24/senate-section/article/S10922-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10922-S10924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            WORKING TOGETHER\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I come to the floor today to talk \nabout history, but strangely enough, short history--the last 3\\1/2\\ to \n4 weeks. Because so much has happened in that period of time, I am \nfirmly of the opinion today that while we will return to some level of \nnormalcy and we will all begin to understand what has changed in the \nworld, we all found out in a short period of time what kind of people \nterrorists are and what they will do. Americans can hardly understand \nhow somebody would organize people--having no country, no real habitat, \nwith no concern except to wreak havoc on those they do not like. We \nlive in that new bubble.\n  I rise today to urge that we continue one other important thing. I \nbelieve we have a long-time reputation of being the body wherein issues \nare argued, debates can even go on forever. What we did immediately \nafter that New York disaster, when the terrorists showed their true \nlight to the Americans, was we decided in the Congress we would not \nconduct business as usual. Something rather magnificent happened. The \npublic perceives us completely differently. We, too, have changed in \ntheir opinion because we lock arms on big issues, we work very hard \nbehind the scenes with experts. We come to the floor and, with a \nminimum of debate, we pass important measures.\n  That has been one of the most significant signals to our own people \nand to the terrorists of the world, that we can adjust this great \nRepublic to the modern problems, the problems we never, ever, \nanticipated, even 2 years ago, much less when our Constitution and Bill \nof Rights were written.\n  I think something is going awry, that maybe this unity is falling \napart or breaking. I am hearing leadership offer their own proposals. \nJust yesterday I heard the majority leader, who I thought was doing a \nmagnificent job joining with Republicans, introducing a reconciliation \npackage. I thought we were going to work the big issues together.\n  I urge that we return to that mode and during the next 4 to 6 weeks, \nor however long we want to spend, we complete some very fundamental \nwork and we get on with a few packages that will indicate we need to do \nsomething new and different. That way, we would not have either the \ntremendous buildup and pressure of not being able to get things done, \nnor would we have a cantankerous partisan debate over matters that \ncould easily be resolved, as we resolved the first four or five bills \nof importance when New York was still on fire and the Pentagon was \nstill steaming because we hadn't put out the fires deep inside the \nbeaten-upon building that was a symbol of our strength.\n  I also want to say something else is happening which makes this a \nvery difficult burden for our President, for us, and for the American \npeople. First I commend the President. I think he has done a tremendous \njob. I believe he leads not only us but I think right-minded people \neverywhere, although they all have different political problems. They \nare seeing America, now, under his leadership, presenting a real \nopportunity for the world to get rid of terrorism. They are joining us, \nnot one or two a day, but in flocks; the countries of the world are \njoining us.\n  Maybe from this will come a new world order. Who knows? I said that a \nfew weeks ago. The father of this President came into office saying he \nwanted to work for a new world order. Things got out of hand. The new \nPresident did not claim that. But, because of the courage, tenacity, \nfaith, he is leading the Nation to a whole new set of alliances, all of \nwhich I see as very positive.\n  It seems to me Russia and America may come out very differently as a \nresult of this incident. It also seems to me that a number of countries \nthat were not willing to join us are looking around and saying: We \nwould like to help America.\n  Most of what I have just said indicates a desire to unite and work \ntogether. What a joy to see all Members, Democrat and Republican--mayor \nRepublican, Governor Republican, Senators Democrat--go to New York \nCity. There wasn't anybody there trying to get their way. They were \ntrying to get together and get something going for the people of New \nYork and for our country. Again, unity paid off in really big \ndividends.\n  We don't usually think of our leaders, under our evolved two-party \nsystem, in a way that says, if you will just unite, you will do the \nbest thing you can for our people. But I think that is happening. That \nhas taken a back seat because today we are talking about anthrax, and \nwe are learning. I want to compliment all the professionals who worked \non it. I really believe they did the very best they could under the \ncircumstances. I compliment them all.\n  We are learning brand new things even about this particular \nmicroorganism. We are learning that maybe it is spread easier than we \nhad learned in the textbooks and that the scientists said. Maybe you \ncan aerosol it much easier than we thought. We thought that was a very \ndifficult thing. We thought it required very efficient kinds of \nequipment and tremendous resources. It still may. We don't have the \nanswer yet. But I don't believe we ought to start arguing among \nourselves about this particular problem. I think we ought to also join \ntogether, listen to our experts, and if we need to do some more things \nquickly, let's do them. Let's not run to see who is going to get \ncredit. Let's not try to put bill upon bill just to spend money.\n\n  I want to remind everyone we are down to about $50 billion in surplus \nfrom $176 billion just 5 or 6 weeks ago, and this is the surplus we \ndidn't even want to touch. It is the accumulated surplus that was all \ngoing to go on the debt. We are down to $50 billion or so, but we see \nthe bills people are proposing under the rubric of stimulus plus \nexpansion of social welfare programs. I trace our longer history, not \njust 3 weeks, and find we never did try to expand those programs in our \nserious recessions before. They were taken up in due course, not as a \nstimulus, not as an emergency. That has to do with COBRA and other \nprograms at which we are looking.\n  But I think we have to face up to the reality that every night we are \nlooking at Afghanistan on the television, trying to figure out how are \nwe doing, whose side is winning, what is happening, and here at home we \nare engaging our best scientists in this dread illness. This illness \ncomes from a product that is very common. I think the Senator in the \nchair knows that out west, where we have a lot of cows and pens for \ncows and the like, these spores are prevalent everywhere. In my State, \nin northern New Mexico, there are many\n\n[[Page S10923]]\n\nof them. We treat them properly, give them their proper respect, and \nthey don't go anywhere because people either take antibiotics or take \ntreatment, and we go on with our lives.\n  But the overhanging problem is the American economy. When it is \nflourishing, we can do almost anything. When it is coming down and in \nrecession, it has a tendency to harm an awful lot of people. The cycle \nin American capitalism, which nobody has cured yet, when it starts \ncoming down and unemployment goes up and the other things that we know \nabout come about--obviously, productivity is not growing like it was, \nmany people are put out of work, many businesses go bankrupt, many \nfamilies have to ask the Government to help because, through no fault \nof their own, they can't be employed. We can't order them to be \nemployed, if we want to use the great system that has built this \ncountry to its enormous material powerhouse status.\n  I want to say the third thing we have on our platter makes it a very \nbig platter. Three big things sit there, straining America: There is a \nwar that is different from any we had, and there is a human commitment \nby the American people, in spite of its difference, despite its \nferocity, despite the risks we have to take--it is amazing, the \nAmerican people, in excess of 90 percent, say stay with it; go get \nthem. It is amazing that they say America is on the right path.\n  We always ask, are we on the right path or the wrong path? This is \none time we have been united and they know we are on the right path \nwhen it comes to this war. Americans, given the facts, although they \nare a little more frightened than they have been in the past, will \nsupport an appropriate, righteous cause.\n  We are not without fault. But certainly we do not deserve, either \nfrom our own citizens or from people in the world, some of the things \nsaid about America. We are flourishing because we have a great system. \nAnd we have not destroyed our own system. We have lived with it, made \nit grow, and when things had to change, they changed peacefully and \nparties got new agendas for their candidates and we established new \nthings to make America grow. When America grows, we can do much more \nfor education, we can do more for all the things that we cherish, and \nwe can give our taxpayers a little bit of the empathy they need so they \ncan grow and prosper.\n\n  So far, as I look at it, it seems to me we are going to wake up in 3 \nor 4 weeks when we get some new economic numbers. I regret saying I \nthink there will be a new headline. The headline will be: America In \nRecession. Those speaking about it are saying we don't know quite how \nto fix it. I have sensed that for quite some time. I added my own \neconomics that I do, having worked with a lot of these people, had \nconversations, and then we look for some big facts. I just want to \nshare one that is very startling, and that has to do with a very \nimportant characteristic of our economy--industrial production.\n  The problem is that industrial production figures that were released \njust 1 week ago yesterday morning--we are down 1 percent in the month \nof September. This year alone, that great measure of our productivity, \nand of our production, will be down 6 percent. That is as much as it \nwent down in the entire 1990-1991 recession.\n  Put another way: This is the 12th consecutive month of that kind of \ndecline. This is the longest decline in industrial production since \nWorld War II. I understand it doesn't have all of the significance it \nhad during this period since World War II. It has been pushed aside as \na major indicator by some other things. But it is still a major one.\n  I believe our mission is simple: Get together on the appropriations \nbills, no excuses, unite, have our leaders unite, and let's get them \ndone. Let's just say it ought not be an excuse big enough to deny our \ndesire to work together in a unified way to get the ordinary business \ndone. I think when we were beginning to move, our buildings were closed \ndown. Who would have thought of that? Nonetheless, that is the case.\n  We are trying to find ways to work even though the buildings are not \nquite accommodating. We are getting there. We are forcing some \naccommodations so we can do our work.\n  In addition, we have to finish up the work of an appropriations bill \nthat appropriates money which we put in, in the early days for New York \nand for defense. Remember that we passed that to send a signal and to \nappropriate the money, but we said it is subject to a new \nappropriations bill. That has to be done. That requires unity. That \nrequires Senators and Congressmen to give up some things and get on \nwith a package with consensus, and then unite together and say let's do \nit. Some say it was too big a package. We will have to add a lot. Let's \njust say that considering America's future and what we are, the worst \nthing would be for us to not do what we have promised to do. The second \nworst is to not continue on with evaluations and then pass laws and \nappropriations to fill some very serious holes we have--clearly in the \nmedical area, biomedical, and chemical.\n  In terms of our country, we were at war in a sense, but we really \ndidn't understand the significance of biological and chemical warfare. \nWe weren't as well prepared. But whom do you want to blame for that? \nSome people are now beginning to ask. There have been Senators, House \nMembers, and Presidents who have spoken to terrorism. They have spoken \nto the issue of biological and chemical warfare. But I can tell you \nfrom our own experience on one bill. We passed a bill that is commonly \nknown as Nunn-Lugar-Domenici which is now in 126 cities with $670 \nmillion a year. It takes the first responders, fire, policemen, and \nmedical teams; it organizes them so they move in harmony again, in \nunity.\n  It was very hard during the first 2 or 3 years to get cities to \nwillingly participate. There is no criticism, but they did not like the \nidea because they did not want to let their people think they were \nsubject to any real problems from outside. It took 3 years to get the \nprogram implemented. It took the U.S. Government's executive branch to \ndivide it into three parts instead of in unity. It is implemented by \nthree different Departments of our Government. Obviously, we learn \nabout that now. We are in trouble. We are going to seek unity of \npurpose with reference thereto.\n  I also suggest that the economy needs an economic stimulus plan. I \nremind everyone, this economy is faltering. I don't believe we should \nbe the first as Senators from different States that may have problems \nto run and say we need to pay for a new program. Every program and \nevery tax proposal ought to be subject to that. Let's consider it. How \ndoes it help the economy grow? I think if it doesn't, it ought to be on \nanother calendar. We don't know with precision, but we know pretty well \nthat a bridge construction program that comes into effect 3 or 4 years \nfrom now may be a good program because we need bridges, but it is not \nan economic stimulus package. I think we have come to the conclusion \nthat highway bridges and like programs, if we need them, are good \nprograms, but for the most part they are not programs that will \naccelerate the growth in this economy. Instead of everybody going to \nthe wall on that, that can be organized and talked about.\n  We can get on with doing what we don't do so well. But we have done \nmarvelously well for the last 5 or 6 weeks to commit to the American \npeople that until we finish our business, including a stimulus package, \nif we can do it, we are going to lock arms and finish on an upbeat note \nthat says we are united to do what we can about this terrible new \nenemy. We are absolutely committed to give our President what he needs \nmilitarily, and we encourage him to follow them to their demise.\n  To the extent we have additional stimulus ideas, we ought to take a \ngood look to see if we can do them together. If it is OK, we can then \ncome in the next year. We don't have to do everything in the next 3 or \n4 weeks. We will learn a lot about this problem in the next 5 or 6 \nweeks. Instead of passing bills, we will have some very refined \nexaminations and appraisals of our problems.\n  For instance, everybody always hears me talk about the laboratories \nthat do our nuclear work. The people who visit them say they are crown \njewels in terms of research capacity. I think it still shocks people to \nknow that, for instance, in this area that has to do with this \nbiological enemy that we are\n\n[[Page S10924]]\n\nfighting now, those two laboratories combined in expertise, if not the \nparamount source of evidence, are the paramount source of definition \nabout these spores. That happens to be a program they have in place, \nand they are being called upon now to be some of the experts to resolve \nsome of these unknown issues. We have to help put all of those together \nto work in unison under our new manager of domestic problems, a \nwonderful former Governor, Governor Ridge.\n\n  I close by saying to the Senators from both sides of the aisle, House \nMembers and those who are in close contact with our Members, let's get \nback to where we were and seek unity; let's try to lock arms and get \nour basic job done, the extraordinary work done, and do it in such a \nway that Americans can continue to feel what they feel about this \nGovernment. They totally support our President. They think we are \nbetter than we have ever been. I don't think we need to fight when we \nhave an enemy that will just capitalize on anything going on in our \ncountry that is tearing at us. They think they are going to cause that. \nWe ought to do just the opposite.\n  Thank you for the privilege of speaking today. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/24/senate-section/article/S10924-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10924-S10969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nFOREIGN OPERATIONS EXPORT FINANCING AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS \n                          ACT, 2002--Continued\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, is there an amendment pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are two amendments that have been set \naside.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I know the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky is off the floor. So I will not move any action while he is \ngone.\n  I wish to urge Senators who have amendments to come forward. There is \nno reason this bill cannot be finished. Even if we finish it fairly \nsoon, I hope Members of the Senate will realize the importance of this \nbill.\n  I remember coming to the Senate at a time when so many would talk \nabout foreign aid as some kind of a massive giveaway. People would ask, \nWhat have these countries done to help us? Why are we sending money \nthere? Fortunately, at that time we had people such as Senator Mike \nMansfield, a happy memory in the Senate, and people who preceded the \nPresiding Officer, Senator Jacob Javits on the Republican side who knew \nhow important these programs were.\n  Of course, you can argue that there are a whole number of reasons. We \nare the wealthiest, most powerful nation history has ever known. You \ncould speak to the moral reasons we should be helping other countries. \nWe could talk about what it does for our security interests. If we \nbring about stability in other parts of the world, we help democracy \nflourish. We would help the middle class build up in areas that \notherwise were prone to overthrows of governments, instability, \nrebellions.\n  I think of some of the programs that Members of this body have \nproposed--not necessarily on this bill but others--the School Lunch \nProgram for Africa that former Senator Dole and former Senator McGovern \nproposed.\n  I recall last year being down at the White House when they discussed \nthis with President Clinton, and the interesting points brought out. \nThey were talking about countries where families could not feed their \nchildren any way, not mentioning anything about educating them.\n  But if we help those countries have a school lunch program, something \nthat costs us a tiny fraction of what we spend on foreign aid, then \nchildren could go to school and learn. But also in a lot of these \ncountries where girls do not go to school, where only the boys go to \nschool, some of the families said: Wait a minute. If we can feed our \ndaughters as well as our sons, we will be able to do that.\n  Now, what has happened in doing that is we not only benefit those \ncountries, but we can benefit the people there. We carry out the moral \naspects of our foreign aid bill. But then we also have money in this \nbill for health care, not only the health care of the people in these \nother countries, but there is a provision which would allow us to build \nup the medical infrastructure of other nations to get rid of possibly \nanother Ebola plague, to have an early warning system when one is \nexisting so the country can act to stop it.\n  Now, this is not just altruism. There is no disease anywhere in the \nworld that is more than an airplane trip or a postage stamp away from \nour own country. If we can help countries fight these diseases within \ntheir own borders, not only do they help those people but they help all \nthe rest of us.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 1942 through 1948, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I have discussed this with Senator \nMcConnell. We have a number of amendments I will just briefly describe.\n  There is one by Senator Helms on Venezuela, one by Senator McConnell \nand myself on development credit authority, another Leahy-McConnell \namendment on MDB authorizations, a McConnell-Leahy amendment on \ndocumentation center, an amendment by Senator McConnell on nuclear \nsafety, a Mikulski amendment on small business, and a Gordon Smith \namendment on religious freedom. Also, there are two previously offered \namendments by Senator Boxer; one is on Afghan reconstruction and one is \non suicide bombings.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to send all the \namendments to the desk; that they be considered to be in order; that \nthey be considered en bloc, and they be adopted en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 1942 through 1948), en bloc, were agreed to, as \nfollows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1942\n\n       On page 142, line 21, after the colon, insert the \n     following: ``Provided further, That of the amount \n     appropriated under this heading, up to $2,000,000 should be \n     made available to support democracy-building activities in \n     Venezuela:''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1943\n\n       On page 130, line 4, strike ``September 30, 2003'', and \n     insert in lieu thereof: ``expended''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1944\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n\n                             authorizations\n\n       Sec.   .

None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be made available for the \n     Government of the Russian Federation after the date that is \n     180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, unless \n     the President determines and certifies in writing to the \n     Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Appropriations \n     and the Committee on International Relations of the House of \n     Representatives that the Government of the Russian Federation \n     has not implemented any statute, executive order, regulation, \n     or other similar government action that would discriminate, \n     or would have as its principal effect discrimination, against \n     religious groups or religious communities in the Russian \n     Federation in violation of accepted international agreements \n     on human rights and religious freedoms to which the Russian \n     Federation is a party.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, as a freshman Senator in 1997, I \noffered an amendment to the foreign operations bill that predicated \nforeign aid to the Russian Federation on the implementation of a new \nlaw restricting religious freedom in Russia. That law, passed by the \nRussian Duma on July 4, 1997, had the potential of severely restricting \nfreedom of religion in Russia. The bill was ironically titled ``on \nfreedom of conscience and on religious associations.''\n  That bill was eventually signed into law--a law that required \nreligious groups to register with the State and submit their religious \ndoctrines and practices to scrutiny by a commission of experts with the \npower to deny religious status. Without this status, these groups would \nlose the rights to rent or own property, employ religious workers or \nconduct charitable and educational activities. Clearly that law in \nRussia and its implementation would have a grave impact on religious \nfreedom in that country.\n  I am happy to report that my 1997 amendment passed the Senate 95 to \n4. I would also note that both the bill managers, Senators Leahy and \nMcConnell, voted in favor of this amendment and I thank them for their \nsupport.\n  In following years this amendment was included as part of the foreign \noperations bill. This year it was not. I rise today to offer this same \namendment again and understand that it will be accepted by the managers \nof this bill sometime today during its consideration.\n  In my years in the Senate I have remained vigilant on the issue of \nreligious freedom. The Foreign Relations Committee has held yearly \nhearings on religious freedom abroad--especially what is going on in \nthe Russian Federation. I also host, with the Department of State, a \nseries of yearly roundtable discussions on religious freedom.\n  These roundtable discussions are attended by members of each \nreligious community impacted by this new law in Russia and by various \nState Department and NSC officials that are responsible for religious \nfreedom abroad.\n  As the years went by and the registration period closed regarding \nreligions, it was felt by all those interested in religious freedom in \nthat country that this amendment was a positive influence on how the \nnew Russian law was implemented.\n  It let the Russian Government know that Americans cared about freedom \nof religion in Russia--that the eyes of the world were upon the Russian \nGovernment as it implemented the law on religions.\n  Although the amendment has never been implemented--and each year aid \nhas gone out to the Russian Federation--the amendment's influence and \nimpact has been positive and undeniable according to those religions \n``on the ground'' in Russia.\n  In general many of the problems initially have worked themselves out \nunder this new law. Many of the problems with denials of registration \nor persecution have occurred in the far reaches of the Russian \nFederation. The conventional wisdom regarding implementation of that \nlaw is that persecution occurs abroad--the farther away from Moscow and \nthe centralized government, the greater the risk is for religious \nintolerance.\n  But even in Moscow there is a requirement of vigilance. And I am \nhappy to report that this body has been vigilant on this issue--\nespecially regarding the old problem of anti-Semitism in Russia. Some \nmight say that we shouldn't single out Russia regarding this issue. I \nwould agree--we should fight anti-Semitism in every nation including \nour own.\n  Because I believe that how a nation treats the sons and daughters of \nIsrael is a bellweather for tolerance.\n  I would like to submit for the Record letters from years past that \nalmost all of my colleagues signed regarding their concerns over the \nrise in anti-Semitism in Russia. Each of these letters contain 98 to 99 \nsignatures--virtually all of the Senate was united on this issue.\n  I firmly believe that this language is needed again this year. I \nwould also like to submit for the Record a letter from NCSJ--advocates \non behalf of Jews in Russia, Ukraine, the Baltic States and Eurasia. \nNCSJ is the leading advocate for the plight and well-being of the \nJewish community in Russia.\n  NCSJ's executive director, Mark Levin, writes:\n\n       We wish to underline NCSJ's support for your amendment to \n     condition certain assistance to the Russian Federation \n     on verification by President Bush that the Russian \n     Government has no way acted to restrict freedom of \n     religion as guaranteed by international commitments and \n     treaties.\n       . . . the 1997 law on religion, under which ``non-\n     traditional'' groups must register with government \n     authorities, has continued to generate misunderstandings, \n     difficulties and intimidation.\n\n  The Russian law, among other things, limits the activities of foreign \nmissionaries and grants unregistered ``religious groups'' fewer rights \nthan accredited Russian religious organizations such as the Russian \nOrthodox Church, Islam, Judaism and Buddhism. This law if poorly \nimplemented, could also sharply restrict the activities of foreign \nmissionaries in Russia.\n  The Russian Government should permit foreign missionaries to enter \nand reside in Russia--within the framework of Russian law--and work \nwith fellow believers.\n  Furthermore, foreign missionaries should be allowed to enjoy the \nreligious freedom guaranteed Russian citizens and legal residents by \nthe Russian constitution, OSCE commitments, and other international \nagreements to which Russia is signatory.\n  One of my own constituents, Pastor Dan Pollard, is a missionary with \na church in the Russian far east--in a town called Vanino. Pastor \nPollard has been continually harassed by local officials, many who cite \nthe 1997 law as an official reason for barring Pollard from \nministering.\n  I thank the managers again for accepting this amendment as part of \nthe foreign operations bill and hope that this legislation sends a \nstrong signal to President Putin that human rights and religious \nfreedom are core American values and we seek to share them with all our \nfriends and allies. However it must be understood that American dollars \nwill not find their way to support a country that treats freedom of \nreligion in such a manner.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letters to which I previously referred.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          National Conference on Soviet Jewry,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 8, 2001.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: We wish to underline NCSJ's support for \n     your amendment to condition certain assistance to the Russian \n     Federation on verification by President Bush that the Russian \n     government has in no way acted to restrict freedom of \n     religion as guaranteed by international commitments and \n     treaties.\n       We are encouraged that President Putin continues to express \n     public support for tolerance and pluralism. Nevertheless, \n     some disturbing trends toward intolerance and oppression \n     remain of concern. In particular, the 1997 Law on Relation, \n     under which ``non-traditional'' groups must register with \n     government authorities, has continued to generate \n     misunderstandings, difficulties and intimidation. Groups such \n     as Jehovah's Witnesses and Evangelical Christians have had \n     financial assets and membership rolls confiscated, and some \n     have been subject to outright violence.\n       In addition, new incidents of anti-Semitism have also \n     arisen, affecting the Jewish community. Judaism is, under \n     Russian law, a sanctioned (``traditional'') religion. \n     Unfortunately, at times local police response to acts of hate \n     against schools and synagogues has been delayed. And, in \n     October 2000, the federal Interior Ministry conducted an \n     illegal, prolonged search of the Moscow Choral Synagogue.\n\n[[Page S10926]]\n\n       We write in a spirit of cooperation and concern for the \n     fabric of Russian society. We believe Russia can and should \n     be a country that embraces and celebrates religious \n     differences. By monitoring progress toward unrestricted \n     religious liberty, we can help ensure that it will come to \n     pass.\n       Thank you for your continuous leadership in this cause.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                    Mark B. Levin,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 18, 1999.\n     President Boris Yeltsin,\n     Russian Federation, The Kremlin,\n     Moscow, Russia.\n       Dear President Yeltsin: We are writing to you to express \n     our serious concerns over the rise in anti-Semitic rhetoric \n     heard at both the national and local levels of Russian \n     society and politics. We strongly believe that the first line \n     of defense against the growth of anti-Semitism in your \n     country is exposing and condemning the hate-filled rhetoric \n     at all levels of contact between our two governments.\n       As you know, recent events and remarks in Russia have \n     marred this decade's re-emergence of Jewish life in post-\n     communist Russia. The Russian Jewish community now numbers \n     upwards of one million, and the opening of synagogues, \n     schools and community centers has been a bright counterpoint \n     to the centuries of violence and anti-Semitic laws against \n     the Russian Jewish community. We strongly feel that the \n     recent spate of anti-Semitic rhetoric, in particular those \n     comments from Russian communist and extremist/nationalist \n     political groups, should be disavowed. In particular, the \n     fascist extremism exhibited by Alexander Barkashov's Russia \n     National Unity Party is alarming in its use of slanderous \n     stereotyping and crude scapegoating.\n       Recently, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's \n     Subcommittee on European Affairs held a hearing on the rise \n     of anti-Semitism in Russia. This was not the first hearing on \n     this subject--in fact, the Senate held hearings and \n     considered resolutions regarding the treatment of Jews in \n     Tsarist Russia as early as 1879. Over the years it has not \n     been unusual for the United States to act on this subject, \n     linking American foreign policy with what should now be \n     regarded as a cornerstone of human rights policies in Russia.\n       While we support a strong effort to address the economic \n     difficulties in Russia and encourage the development of a \n     strong, market-oriented economy, we want you to know that the \n     United States also expects from Russia a strong commitment to \n     human rights and religious freedom. As your country enters an \n     election cycle, there may well be temptations to sound ultra-\n     nationalist themes that attempt to blame the small Jewish \n     community for Russia's problems.\n       President Yeltsin, we believe it is imperative that you \n     demonstrate, through your emphatic disagreement with those \n     who espouse anti-Semitism in Russia, your understanding of \n     the importance the Russian government places upon religious \n     freedom. The United States predicates its support for \n     democratic institutions in Russia upon unwavering opposition \n     to anti-Semitism at any level, in any form. While we are \n     pleased by your administration's statements against anti-\n     Semitism, the horrific explosions near two of Moscow's \n     largest synagogues on May 1st and the recent attacks on the \n     only synagogue in Birobidzhan, are reason enough for further \n     vigorous and more public condemnation.\n       We hope you share our deep concern for this issue and look \n     forward to receiving your response.\n           Sincerely,\n         Craig Thomas, Sam Brownback, Charles Schumer, Joe \n           Lieberman, Wayne Allard, Paul D.

Vladimir Putin,\n     Acting President, Russian Federation, The Kremlin, Moscow, \n         Russia.\n       Dear President Putin: As you assume your new leadership \n     position, we write to you with hope for your success in \n     leading Russia through a newly prosperous and democratic \n     millennium. We are writing to you, as we have to other \n     Russian leaders, to express our repeated concerns over the \n     risk in anti-Semitic rhetoric heard at both the national and \n     local levels of Russian society and politics.\n       We strongly encourage you to make fighting anti-Semitism \n     one of the priorities of your new administration. President \n     Putin, we believe it is imperative that you demonstrate, \n     through your emphatic disagreement with those who espouse \n     anti-Semitism in Russia, your understanding of the importance \n     the Russian government places upon religious freedom. We \n     understand that in past discussions with both Russian and \n     American Jewish leaders you have expressed your concern about \n     anti-Semitism. We applaud your past comments and efforts and \n     urge you to take corresponding action in keeping with your \n     new position as acting president.\n       The Russian Jewish community represents a vibrant and \n     active portion of the Russian population. Though emigration \n     has reduced the community size in the past ten years, the \n     birth of democracy in the Russian Federation has also \n     resulted in the opening of new synagogues, schools and \n     community centers in Moscow, St. Petersburg and beyond. \n     Currently there are almost 200 Jewish organizations, \n     institutions, and religious communities in 75 cities and \n     towns throughout Russia. One hundred and fifteen schools \n     serve over 7,000 students, and Jewish organizations publish \n     18 newspapers and journals. This open and free blossoming of \n     culture and community will only benefit the Russian nation \n     and her people.\n       Anti-Semitism in Russia must not become a weapon in the \n     struggle for power by political parties. Indecisive actions \n     on the part of the Russian government only further feed the \n     belief that hate is an allowable and integral component of \n     political life. The hate-filled rhetoric of a number of \n     Communist Party leaders, some of whom retain important \n     parliamentary positions, must be condemned by your strong \n     deed and word. Further, it is our belief, that the violence \n     that follows such hate, for example the May, 1999 Moscow \n     synagogue bombings, must always be strongly and loudly \n     condemned in order to avoid further violence in the future.\n       President Putin, last year ninety-nine out of 100 United \n     states Senators signed a letter to President Yeltsin similar \n     to this one. Few issues in politics unite the United States \n     Senate more. As we wrote your predecessor, we believe it is \n     imperative that you demonstrate, through your emphatic \n     disagreement with those who espouse anti-Semitism in Russia, \n     your understanding of the importance the Russian government \n     places upon religious freedom. The United States predicates \n     its support for democratic institutions in Russia upon \n     unwavering opposition to anti-Semitism at any level, in any \n     form.\n       We hope you share our deep concern for this issue and look \n     forward to receiving your response.\n           Sincerely,\n         Gordon H.

Your remarks last year publicly condemning anti-\n     Semitism assume special significance against a backdrop of \n     centuries of tsarist and Stalinist persecution. We strongly \n     encourage you to continue to publicly condemn anti-Semitism \n     whenever it manifests itself in the Russian Federation.\n       We also believe that it is important to back up the \n     rhetoric of condemnation with the substance of action. Sad to \n     say, physical violence against Jews still occurs in the \n     Russian Federation. In Ryazan last year, youths attacked a \n     Jewish Sunday school, threatening teachers and children and \n     later intimidated school officials into revoking the Jewish \n     community's use of a classroom. Rhetorical anti-Semitism also \n     continues. In July anti-Semitism played a minor role in the \n     gubernatorial race in Ryazan and has also played a role in \n     gubernatorial elections in Krasnodar.\n       Radical extremists continue to operate openly in more than \n     half of Russia's 89 regions. While most of these \n     organizations are small, there is also little social or \n     governmental opposition to them. There are at least ten \n     ultra-nationalist groups in Russia with memberships between \n     100 and 5,000 members each. Anti-Semitism is a staple of most \n     ultra-nationalist groups and is evident in the publication of \n     the groups' periodicals. At least 37 newspapers and magazines \n     of ultra-nationalist bent published anti-Semitic materials in \n     2000.\n       The year 2000 witnessed increasing cooperation between \n     Russian extremists and their ideological counterparts abroad. \n     The most notorious example of such cooperation was that of \n     David Duke, the U.S. white supremacist, who visited Russia \n     twice during the year. Duke's most recent anti-Semitic tract \n     was prepared exclusively for the Russian market.\n       We recognize that you have made important statements in \n     response to manifestations of anti-Semitism, and that law \n     enforcement has in some cases been effective in investigating \n     and prosecuting the perpetrators of anti-Semitic violence and \n     crimes. More consistent and comprehensive implementation of \n     your government's policies and of Russian laws would \n     represent a significant improvement in this area. The United \n     States Senate supports efforts to promote public awareness \n     and training programs within the Russian Federation. We would \n     welcome additional ways for the American involvement and \n     cooperation in these efforts.\n       As members of the Senate we have sent you or your \n     predecessor a similar letter for the past three years. We \n     continue to believe it vital that you continue to \n     demonstrate, through your emphatic disagreement with those \n     who espouse anti-Semitism in Russia, the importance the \n     Russian government places upon religious freedom. The United \n     States predicates its support for democratic institutions in \n     Russia upon unwavering opposition to anti-Semitism at any \n     level, in any form.\n       We hope you share our deep concern for this issue and look \n     forward to receiving your response.\n           Sincerely,\n         Joe Biden, Gordon H.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I see the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Florida, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, in the \nChamber. He would be recognized next, but while he is preparing his \npapers, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1949\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, earlier today I came to this Chamber \nand notified the manager on the Republican side and staff for Senator \nLeahy that I intended to offer a resolution as an amendment. I believe \nI saw Senator Leahy in this Chamber a moment ago. At this time, I send \nan amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1949.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To urge the Senate, prior to the end of the first session of \n the 107th Congress, to vote on at least the judicial nominations sent \n        to the Senate by the President prior to August 4, 2001)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       The Senate finds that:\n       Currently 106 Federal judgeships are vacant, representing \n     12.3 percent of the Federal judiciary;\n       40 of those vacancies have been declared ``judicial \n     emergencies'' by the Administrative Office of the Courts;\n       Last year, at the adjournment of the 106th Congress, 67 \n     vacancies existed, representing 7.9 percent of the judiciary;\n       In May 2000, when there were 76 Federal judicial vacancies, \n     Senator Daschle stated, ``The failure to fill these vacancies \n     is straining our Federal court system and delaying justice \n     for people all across this country'';\n       In January 1998, when there were 82 Federal judicial \n     vacancies, Senator Leahy stated, ``Any week in which the \n     Senate does not confirm three judges is a week in which the \n     Senate is failing to address the vacancy crisis'';\n       The events of September 11, 2001, make it more important \n     than ever that the branches of the Federal Government should \n     operate at maximum efficiency which requires the Federal \n     judiciary to be as close to full strength as possible;\n       100 percent of President Reagan's judicial nominees sent to \n     the Senate prior to the 1981 August recess were confirmed \n     during his first year in office;\n       100 percent of President George H.W. Bush's judicial \n     nominees sent to the Senate prior to the 1989 August recess \n     were confirmed during his first year in office;\n       93 percent of President Clinton's judicial nominees sent to \n     the Senate prior to the 1993 August recess were confirmed \n     during his first year in office;\n       President George W. Bush nominated and sent to the Senate \n     44 judicial nominees prior to the 2001 August recess;\n       21 of all pending nominees have been nominated to fill \n     ``judicial emergencies''; and\n       The Senate has confirmed only 8 judicial nominees to date, \n     which represents 18 percent of President Bush's judicial \n     nominations sent to the Senate prior to the 2001 August \n     recess;\n       It is the sense of the Senate that (1) prior to the end of \n     the first session of the 107th Congress, the Committee on the \n     Judiciary shall hold hearings on, and the Committee on the \n     Judiciary and the full Senate shall have votes on, at a \n     minimum, the judicial nominations sent to the Senate by the \n     President prior to August 4, 2001, and (2) the standard for \n     approving pre-August recess judicial nominations for past \n     administrations should be the standard for this and future \n     administrations regardless of political party.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, the resolution calls for a sense of the \nSenate that all of the nominations submitted by President Bush to the \nSenate for the Federal judiciary prior to August 4, which was the start \nof the August recess, be considered by the Senate before the close of \nthe first session of the 107th Congress.\n\n[[Page S10928]]\n\n  There has been considerable concern and controversy over the number \nof judges which have been confirmed. And there had been a form of a \nfilibuster engaged in on opposing the motion to proceed to the foreign \noperations appropriations bill last week and again yesterday.\n  That effort has not been pursued. It is my view that in the long run \nit is not productive to stop legislation as a pressure tactic, although \nthat is a longstanding practice in the Senate by both parties. But in \nany event, that is not being pursued.\n  This resolution seeks to establish a standard which would be \napplicable not only to the occasions when a Republican President \nsubmits nominations to a Senate controlled by Democrats, but also to \nsituations where there is a President who is a Democrat who submits \nnominations to a Senate which is controlled by Republicans.\n  I had written to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nLeahy, on October 12, enclosing for him a first draft of this \nresolution and advising him in his capacity as chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee that I intended to raise it at the Judiciary \nCommittee meeting first in order to give the Judiciary Committee the \nfirst opportunity to act on it. It was on the agenda for last Thursday, \nOctober 18, when it was considered and, on a party-line vote, voted \ndown.\n  This is the first opportunity there has been to submit the resolution \nfor consideration by the full Senate, which I am doing at this time.\n  Before proceeding to the merits of the resolution, I am going to \nyield the floor and wait for the arrival of the Senator from Vermont, \nwho is also chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee and is the \nmanager for the Democrats.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the Senator from Pennsylvania, he need \nnot wait for Senator Leahy. He is aware that the Senator has offered \nthis amendment. The Senator should say whatever he has to say.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from Nevada for saying that. I \nwanted to give him the courtesy of awaiting his arrival. I did see him \nmomentarily, just about a minute and a half before I took the floor. \nWith the comment by the assistant majority leader, I shall proceed to \nmake an argument.\n  The resolution recites the facts that there are currently 106 Federal \njudicial vacancies, representing more than 12 percent of the Federal \njudiciary. Forty of these vacancies have been declared judicial \nemergencies by the Administrative Office of the Federal Courts. What \nthat means is that there is an urgent need for judges to be sitting in \nthose courts.\n  Last year at the adjournment of the 107th Congress, there were 67 \nvacancies, representing 7.9 percent of the Federal judiciary. It is \nobvious that the vacancies now are more than 50-percent higher than \nthey were when the 106th Congress adjourned.\n  When Senator Daschle was the Democratic leader and not in the \nmajority in May of 2000, when there were 76 Federal judicial vacancies, \nSenator Daschle said, as set forth in this resolution:\n\n       The failure to fill these vacancies is straining our \n     Federal court system and delaying justice for people all \n     across the country.\n\n  In January of 1998, when there were 82 Federal judicial vacancies, \nSenator Leahy stated--again set forth in the body of the resolution:\n\n       Any week in which the Senate does not confirm three judges \n     is a week in which the Senate is failing to address the \n     vacancy crisis.\n\n  The events of September 11 of this year, when the terrorists attacked \nNew York City, the Pentagon, and Somerset County, PA, make it all the \nmore imperative that all branches of the Federal Government shall \noperate at maximum efficiency, which requires the Federal judiciary to \nbe as close to full strength as possible.\n  As analogous here, the first year of President Reagan's \nadministration, 100 percent of all judicial nominees sent to the Senate \nprior to the August 1981 recess were confirmed during his first year in \noffice. During the first year in office of President George H.W. Bush, \n1989, again, 100 percent of the nominations sent prior to the August \nrecess were confirmed. During President Clinton's first year in office, \nin 1993, 93 percent of the vacancies were filled during the first year \nin office. President George W. Bush this year has nominated and sent to \nthe Senate 44 judicial nominees prior to the August 2001 recess. \nTwenty-one of all pending nominees have been nominated to fill \n``judicial emergencies.''\n  The Senate has confirmed only twelve judicial nominees to date, which \nrepresent 27 percent of President Bush's judicial nominees sent to the \nSenate prior to the August 4 recess.\n  The resolution calls for the sense of the Senate that prior to the \nend of the first session of the 107th Congress, which will be sometime \nbefore the end of 2001, that all of the nominees sent prior to August 4 \nbe acted upon by the Judiciary Committee, sent to the Senate, and voted \non one way or another, up or down, further that the standard for \napproving all of the nominees submitted prior to the August recess be a \nstandard policy of the U.S. Senate which would apply in future years \nand apply in future circumstances where there was a President who was a \nDemocrat and a Senate controlled by Republicans.\n  During the course of our discussion during the Judiciary Committee \nmeeting last Thursday, the issue was raised by one of the Senators who \nwas a Democrat that this position was taken contrary to what it was in \nprior years. I said that I would modify the resolution to apply equally \nto times when there was a Democrat who was President and a Republican-\ncontrolled Senate.\n  It is a rather straightforward resolution. That is the essence of the \nargument.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, this matter was raised in the Judiciary \nCommittee. It was tabled. We have for 3 weeks been experiencing a \nfilibuster in the Senate based on these same issues. That ended \nyesterday. Thankfully, we are now on this legislation.\n  The record is replete about Chairman Leahy doing the very best he can \nunder extremely difficult circumstances. We are going to move judges as \nquickly as we can under the direction of the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  Based upon that, I raise a point of order against the amendment that \nthe amendment is not germane under rule XVI.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I am informed that there was a \ntypographical error in the resolution and that the figure 8 judicial \nnominees should have been 12, which represents 27 percent of President \nBush's judicial nominees sent to the President prior to August 4, 2001. \nI wanted to make sure the record was accurate in that respect.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I do not intend to appeal the ruling of \nthe Chair because I do not wish to establish a precedent for nongermane \namendments to be heard on appropriations bills. This has been a \nprocedural quagmire which has been very problemsome for the Senate for \na very long time and has a special impact on my own views, since I am a \nmember of the Appropriations Committee. I regret that the issue of \ngermaneness was raised and a point of order was raised, but I thought \nit was important to put this resolution before the body. I do believe \nit is the appropriate way to establish a standard--much preferable to \nhaving a filibuster and trying to block\n\n[[Page S10929]]\n\nthe work of the Senate to establish a standard which would apply to \nboth parties or both sides that a very reasonable cutoff date is the \nAugust recess. This year it started on August 4. Now the matter was \nconsidered in the Judiciary Committee. It was not tabled. There was a \nvote on the merits; not that that makes a lot of difference, it was 10-\n9.\n  But with the point of order having been raised by the assistant \nmajority leader, there may be some political evaluation by the \nelectorate of the position taken by the Democrats on this issue. It is \nnot an unusual practice to have amendments offered on the Senate floor, \nand those who oppose them will have to explain them to their \nconstituencies. It is my hope that those who have opposed this standard \nthat all judges be voted on when submitted prior to the August recess, \nthat they will have to explain that to their constituency.\n  The point of order having been raised by the assistant majority \nleader for the Democrats, not being considered on the merits, being \ndefeated, we will just take it to the electorate for whatever \nconsideration they may wish to give.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. First of all, I express my appreciation to the Senator from \nPennsylvania for not appealing the ruling of the Chair. The Senator, as \nhas been indicated, is a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, \nand the precedent this would set if the Chair would overrule makes \nappropriations bills almost unmanageable. So the Senator from \nPennsylvania has knowledge of the needs of the Senate compared to the \nissue he feels strongly about--and I know how strongly he feels about \nit. I appreciate the Senator not appealing the ruling of the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, it is my intention to send to the desk \nan amendment that will restore the funding recommended by the President \nfor the Andean Regional Counterdrug Initiative. I consider this to be a \ncentral issue in the U.S. relationship with our neighbors in Latin \nAmerica, but maybe even at this time a more important statement as to \nour commitment to the war against terrorism.\n  To develop these points, I want to first give a brief resume of the \nhistory of this region over the past several years. By the late 1990s, \nColombia and the Andean region were nations in peril and at risk. \nColombia had been one of the most stable countries in Latin America \nduring most of the 20th century. It had a phenomenal economic record, \nwith some 50 years of unbroken increases in its rate of gross domestic \nproduct growth. It also was the oldest democracy on the continent of \nSouth America, with a long tradition of transition of power from one \npolitical party to the other without violence.\n  Unfortunately, it was also a region which had been infected by strong \nguerrilla groups. These guerrilla groups had their origin in various \nnuances of Marxism. They were guerrillas who represented Soviet \nMarxism, guerrillas who represented East German Marxism, Chinese \nMarxism, North Korean Marxism, Cuban Marxism. They were ideologically \noriented.\n  Over time, they had become less political and more economic. They had \nmade the transition from being Lenin to being Al Capone in their \norientation.\n  Something else was developing in the countries in the Andean region \nduring the last half of the 20th century, and that was a surge of \nillicit drug production, starting with marijuana and then moving to \ncocaine, with a very high percentage of the world's cocaine being \nproduced in this region.\n  The drug traffickers who were producing cocaine were of the General \nMotors format: They were highly centralized. They had a CEO. They had a \nvertically integrated process that started by financing the farmers who \ngrow the raw coca to the ultimate distribution and financing of that \nsystem in the United States and Europe.\n  We made a major effort--we, the civilized world, with the United \nStates playing a key role--to take down these highly centralized drug \norganizations--the Medellin cartel, the Cali cartel. After a long \nperiod of significant investment and loss of life, we were successful. \nWe thought that by taking off the head of the snake of the drug cartels \nwe would kill the rest of the body.\n  In fact, what we found in the late 1990s was that these decapitated \nsnakes were beginning to reconstitute themselves, and they were moving \naway from the General Motors model towards a more entrepreneurial \nmodel; whereas they used to have vertically integrated parts of the \ndrug trafficking chain, now they have multiple small drug traffickers \ndoing each phase, from the growing in the field, to the transporting, \nto the financing of the drug trade.\n  For a period of time, these new entrepreneurial drug traffickers \nfound themselves at risk because they did not have the kind of security \nprotection that the old centralized system had, and so they turned to \nthese now economic guerrillas, the Al Capones of Colombia, and made a \npact with them. The pact was: We will pay you well if you will provide \nus security so that we can conduct our illicit activities.\n  For a while, that was the relationship, but then the Al Capones \nfigured out: We are providing the reason and the capability of these \ndrug traffickers to do their business. They are making a lot more money \nin drug trafficking than we are providing the security for the drug \ntraffickers; why don't we become the drug traffickers ourselves?\n  By the end of the nineties, the drug trade, in particular in \nColombia, had been largely taken over by the former ideological \nguerrillas who had become Al Capones and now were becoming drug \ntraffickers.\n  In addition to the two things I have indicated were occurring, the \nchange in the way in which the drug trade was organized and, second, \nthe role of the guerrillas in the drug trade, a third thing was \noccurring in the late 1990s, and that was, after this long unbroken \nperiod of economic progress and the benefits that was providing for the \npeople of the Andean region, particularly Colombia, they started to go \ninto economic decline.\n  The two previous events were a principal reason for that decline: \nBoth domestic and outside investors became leery about investing in \nColombia and other Andean pact countries because of their concern about \nthe level of violence and the influence the drug trade was gaining over \nthose countries.\n\n  Just 18 months ago, unemployment in Colombia exceeded 20 percent as \nmany of its traditional legal businesses went out of business.\n  Into this very difficult environment came a new leader for Colombia: \nPresident Pastrana. President Pastrana was not a person who was \nunknowing or immune from these forces that were shaping his country. He \nhimself had been kidnapped by the guerrillas and held for a \nconsiderable period of time. Members of his family had been kidnapped \nand assassinated by the guerrillas. He was elected on a reform platform \nthat he was going to, as the hallmark of his administration, lean \ntoward a resolution of all three of these issues: The guerrillas, the \ndrug trafficking, and begin to build a base for a new period of \neconomic expansion.\n  The key to this became Plan Colombia which President Pastrana \ndeveloped early in his administration. Plan Colombia is a very \nmisunderstood concept, particularly from the perspective of the United \nStates. I like to present it as being a jigsaw puzzle with 10 pieces. \nThat total puzzle, once assembled, was a comprehensive plan to rid \nColombia of the influence of the guerrillas, to suppress the drug \ntrafficking and large-scale production of cocaine, and to engage in \nsocial and economic and political reform within Colombia, to transform \nColombia into a fully functioning, modern, democratic, capitalistic \nnation state.\n  Of those 10 pieces that made up that total picture of Plan Colombia, \nthe Colombians were going to be responsible for 5 of those 10 pieces.\n  The total cost of Plan Colombia was estimated at $8 billion, and the \nColombian Government was going to pay for $4 billion. They raised \ntaxes, made adjustments in their budget, and did other things to get \nprepared to accept their 50-percent share of this plan.\n  The other 50 percent was going to be divided between the United \nStates, which would assume approximately 20 percent of the cost of Plan \nColombia, and the rest of the international community, which was to \nassume 30 percent of the cost.\n  When the decisions were being made as to what parts of that \ninternational\n\n[[Page S10930]]\n\neffort should be the U.S. component, the decision was made that most of \nour responsibility was going to be on the military side.\n  Why was that? The reason was, because a key part of a successful \nattack against the drug traffickers and since, in many instances, drug \ntraffickers and guerrillas were the same people in the same uniform, \nthe United States had the best ability to provide the intelligence the \nColombian military would need to use its forces as effectively as \npossible.\n  We had the ability to provide the training that the Colombian \nmilitary needed to increase its professionalism, and particularly to \ndeal with issues such as the long history of human rights abuses within \nthe military of Colombia, and we also could provide some of the \nequipment the Colombian military needed, specifically helicopters, to \ngive the Colombian military greater mobility so that when they \nidentified through intelligence where there was a drug activity that \nwas susceptible to being attacked, they would be able to deliver the \ntroops and the materials necessary to successfully carry out that \nattack.\n  I go into this in some detail because, for Americans, there has been \na tendency to assume that since our component of Plan Colombia was \nheavily oriented toward military activities, that described the \ntotality of Plan Colombia. That is not quite the fact.\n  The fact is the totality of Plan Colombia was a balanced plan that \nhad social, economic, political components, as well as law enforcement \nand military components. It just happened that because we were in the \nbest position to provide the military components, that was where most \nof our part of Plan Colombia happened to fall.\n  Plan Colombia was presented to the Congress in 2000, and in the \nsummer of 2000 the Congress voted to provide as the first installment \ntowards our commitment to Plan Colombia $1.3 billion. We also committed \nwe would have follow-on commitments to Plan Colombia as the progress of \nthis effort to fight the three ills of Colombia: The guerrillas, the \ndrug traffickers, and the economic decline.\n  President Bush has continued the Plan Colombia commitment which had \nbeen made by President Clinton. He has recommended to us that we \nappropriate $731 million. His plan substantially broadens the \ncommitment from a primary focus on Colombia, which was the focus of the \nfirst year of the plan under President Clinton's leadership, to a \nregional focus.\n  The funds, as proposed by President Bush, are roughly evenly divided \nbetween Colombia on the one hand and the other Andean pact countries \nthat are beneficiaries, which are Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. President \nBush also recommended that of the 50 percent to go to Colombia, that \nshould also be divided roughly 50/50 between law enforcement and \nmilitary on the one side and economic and social development on the \nother.\n  Part of the reason for that recommendation was the fact it has been \nthus far difficult to get the other components of the international \ncommunity, with a few major exceptions, Spain and Great Britain being \ntwo of those exceptions, to fully participate as had been anticipated \nin Plan Colombia. So we are now, in addition to our original area of \nprincipal responsibility, becoming more engaged in the social and \neconomic development aspects of this now Andean legislative initiative.\n  The reason I am speaking this afternoon is the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee rejected much of what President Bush had recommended, and \nthey recommended the $731 million be cut by 22 percent, or to $567 \nmillion. That cut will have serious implications on the United States \nand our relationship with this region and the future of this region, \nand our commitments we are making today towards the fight against \nterrorism around the world.\n  To be specific, what are some of the implications of a 22-percent cut \nin the now Andean Regional Counterdrug Initiative? Let me start with \nthe country that has been our principal focus and would be the \nrecipient of half of these funds: The Republic of Colombia. Support for \nthe Colombian National Police interdiction and eradication effort would \nbe reduced because there would be less funding for spare parts for the \nequipment we provided and fuel to operate the equipment. This would \nmake coca reduction targets less likely to be attained. The failure to \nattain those coca reduction targets means there will be more cocaine in \nthe streets of the United States of America, afflicting the people of \nthis Nation.\n  A second result will be security for government officials, which the \nmilitary provides in high conflict areas, will also be reduced, making \nthe police and alternative development workers even more vulnerable.\n  Last week there was a meeting held in Washington of an organization \nin which several members of this body participate called the Inter-\nAmerican Legislative Network. The purpose of this organization is to \nencourage the full development of the parliaments and congresses of the \nnations of the Western Hemisphere on the belief if they are truly going \nto have a democratic society, the institution in which we serve is a \ncritical component of that society.\n\n  We started our meeting last Tuesday with a period of silence. That \nperiod of silence was in recognition of the fact two legislators from \nColombia had been assassinated the week before we met, illustrative of \nthe level of violence which is being directed towards the democratic \ninstitutions by the assassination of the members of democratic \ninstitutions in Colombia.\n  A third effect of this cut will be the Colombian alternative \ndevelopment program will be restricted, and the success we have had to \ndate of signing up farmers who have been producing illicit coca to \nstart producing legal crops will be substantially hampered, and our \nability to comply with commitments we have already made will be \nrestricted.\n  Next, programs to strengthen democratic institutions such as the \njudiciary and witness protection will also be reduced because of less \nfunds available to support those programs. Lowered support for the \npolice and military would also call into question our political support \nfor Colombia, which might undermine the progress that has been made to \ndate in human rights.\n  Finally, in the next year a new President will be elected in \nColombia. They have a one-term limit on their Presidents. So President \nPastrana could not run for reelection. There is an active campaign \nunderway to elect his successors, and the candidates for the \nPresidential election which will occur next spring might raise \nquestions as to the reliability of United States support, particularly \nduring this difficult and significant period in the history of \nColombia.\n  The consequences both within Colombia and on the U.S.-Colombian \nrelationship of this proposed reduction are dire, but the implications \nare not limited to Colombia because, as I indicated, half of this money \nwill now go to the other countries, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia.\n  Speaking of Peru, where there has been a very aggressive alternative \ndevelopment program which has been enormously successful, 15 years ago \nmost of the coca produced in the world was produced in either Peru or \nBolivia and then was transported to Colombia for processing into \ncocaine. That level of production in Peru and Bolivia has been \ndramatically reduced. That reduction has, in large part, been because \nwe have been encouraging the farmers to do the same thing we hoped to \naccomplish in Colombia, which is to transition to legal crops.\n  We had no funding for that alternative development program in either \nfiscal year 2000 or 2001 because of our concerns about President \nFujimori. As we know, President Fujimori was forced out of the country. \nHe is now living in exile. A new President, President Toledo, has been \nelected and had been anticipating we would resume the level of support \nwe have been giving to Peru. That support is now at risk. Failure to \nsupport Peru in this area of alternative development will undermine the \nhopeful reflourishing of democracy that will come to Peru under the \nleadership of President Toledo.\n  Similarly, Brazil's success is also being challenged as a new \nPresident takes office. Planting of coca is beginning to occur in the \nChampara region, which was the principal area of coca production in \nBolivia. We need to help the new Government continue to enforce the \ncoca ban and to offer further\n\n[[Page S10931]]\n\nalternative development assistance, not to retreat as this subcommittee \nrecommendation would have us do.\n  Ecuador is also vulnerable to cuts as we seek to maintain enforcement \nand foster community development, particularly in the northern border \nregion adjacent to Colombia's major coca cultivation zones. Ecuador, \nwhich is one of the poorer countries of Latin America, has a long \nborder with Colombia which is immediately adjacent to the area where \nthe principal guerilla group called the FARC in Colombia operates, and \nthe area where we have been putting the principal focus of our coca \neradication.\n\n  There has been a great deal of cross-border activity, and Ecuador has \nbeen looking to us to give them some assistance in maintaining the \nsanctity of their borders so they can maintain what has been a \nsurprisingly effective effort to avoid substantial coca production in \nEcuador. Brazil, Panama, and Venezuela also have modest enforcement \nprograms which need support to have a chance to overcome the efforts of \ntraffickers to transit drugs and corrupt local governments.\n  The whole Andean region is a region at risk. I suggest we are sending \nexactly the wrong signal of our awareness of that risk and our \nwillingness to be a good partner at a time of need by this 22-percent \ncut in our program of assistance to the Andean region.\n  The proposed Andean Regional Counterdrug Initiative, in my opinion, \nis an integrated, balanced package. There are proposals now, even with \nthose funds that are left, to earmark those funds in ways that will not \nbe consistent with an integrated effort in the Andean region. \nEarmarking funds for non-Colombian programs will increase the \nlikelihood of failure and increased violence in Colombia, the largest \ncoca producer in the world. As indicated, we are already proposing--the \nadministration is proposing--to allocate these funds on a 50/50 basis \nbetween Colombia and the other Andean countries. The earmarking would \nchange that rational balance.\n  Finally, following September 11, U.S. law enforcement and military \nresources which had been placed in the Andean region were withdrawn. \nSignificant numbers of law enforcement personnel were withdrawn back to \nthe United States to assist in homeland security. Many of the military \npersonnel are now in central Asia. This regional effort, funded by \nforeign assistance, the effort we are considering today, represents the \nmost significant remaining activity in the world to stem the flow of \ndrugs into the United States. For those who say they want to fight \ndrugs, this is the drug program in terms of reducing the supply into \nthe United States. To cut it by almost a quarter will seriously curtail \na program on the verge of success, with no alternative supply reduction \nstrategy available. The consequences of this action are serious, \nimmediate, but also with very long-range implications.\n  I close by asking this question: What is the message the United \nStates of America is sending to our own citizens, what is the message \nwe are sending to the world, when on October 24, 2001, we come before \nthe Senate with a proposal to cut back on the only effective program we \nhave in the world to reduce the flow of cocaine into the United States \nand one of the most important programs we have in the world to attack \nterrorists?\n  These are some of the messages. We are saying we are prepared to give \nup on the international effort to strengthen the forces of democracy, \nlawfulness, and future economic growth in a very important region for \nthe United States. How do we ask a European country to make a \ncommitment to support this region if we, who have much more immediate \ninterests and so much more at risk, take the action being recommended \ntoday?\n  Second, are we giving up on Latin America? President Bush, when he \ncame into office, and previously as Governor of Texas and as a \ncandidate for the Presidency, emphasized the importance of the United \nStates relations with Latin America. Unfortunately, we have yet to move \nforward on an effective program to influence our closest neighbors in \nthe Western Hemisphere.\n  The one next to this program that is most important is to increase \nour trade relations. We have a 10-year program with the countries of \nthe Andean region, called the Andean trade pact, whereby we have \nprovided beneficial trade relations. That program will expire in early \nDecember. As of today, less than 60 days to expiration day, we have not \nmoved in either the House Ways and Means Committee or the Senate \nFinance Committee the legislation even to renew that program which is a \nvital part of the economic capacity of that region and particularly \ncritical now as we are trying, for instance in the case of Colombia, to \ndisemploy 400,000 people who are now working in illicit drug \nactivities, and give them some opportunity to work in a legal, \nproductive area of the economy. Yet we are about to see an important \npart of the pillar of that legal economy eroded.\n  The irony is that much of the funding that has been stripped out of \nthe Andean region has been diverted to, as I understand it, providing \nadditional funds to the Export-Import Bank, the purpose of which is to \nincrease our trade. Here we are with some of the best self-trading \npartners the United States has, a region of the world in which we have \na positive trade balance, and we are undercutting its capacity so we \ncan fund the Export-Import Bank whose purpose is to promote trade. That \nis ironic.\n  Third, I am concerned we are returning to neo-isolationism, and doing \nso at the very time when we need to be building strong international \ncoalitions to prepare for the long-range war against terrorism.\n  That brings me to my final point. What is the message we are sending? \nA number of Members earlier today were asked to go to the White House \nto meet with the President, the Vice President, and other leaders of \nthe administration and the newly appointed head of the Homeland \nSecurity Agency, Gov. Tom Ridge. At the end of the meeting, President \nBush gave us a final challenge. I would like, to the best of my \nability, to quote what he said in that final challenge. He asked this \nquestion: Do we really want to win the war against terrorism? His \nanswer: Absolutely, and that it will require unity, that we must be \nprepared to act in different ways in order to win this war. We must be \nprepared to win it at home, and we must be prepared to win it at the \nsource.\n\n  I agree with all of those challenges the President has given to the \nAmerican people. But what is it going to say if, today, on October 24, \nsome 6 weeks and 1 day after the tragedy of September 11, we strip away \na substantial amount of the resources that are being used to fight one \nof the most virulent terrorist operations extant in the world? The FARC \nterrorists of Colombia.\n  In the year 2000 alone there were 423 terrorist attacks against U.S. \ninterests by guerrillas in Colombia. Tell me that we are not fighting \nterrorism as we fight the source of funding for those terrorists, which \nis the drug trade in Colombia.\n  Of those 423 international terrorist acts against U.S. interests, \nover a third were in Colombia. Mr. President, 44 percent of all attacks \nagainst American interests in 2000 were conducted in the country of \nColombia.\n  We have a war against terrorists. An important component of that war \nis not just 6 weeks old but now is several years old. We have made \nrepresentations to the people of the United States, the people of \nColombia, the people of the Andean region, that we were going to be a \nfull partner in the successful pursuit of that war.\n  More recently, we have made similar representations to the people of \nPakistan and to its leadership and to other countries around the world \nas we ask them to join the coalition for a long, protracted, difficult \nwar to root out global terrorism wherever it exists in the world. I \nsuggest our true commitment is not going to be judged by the words we \nspeak but by the actions we take.\n  If we, today, accept a budget which strips 22 percent of the funds we \nhave committed to an area which has become in many ways the global \ntesting ground for our commitment against terrorism, I believe we will \nbe sending a signal that will reverberate around the world, and one \nthat will potentially substantially erode our credibility.\n  We have only had Plan Colombia now for a few days more than 12 \nmonths. It went into effect October 1 of 2000. Today is October 24 of \n2001. Yet hardly\n\n[[Page S10932]]\n\nmore than a year into this battle we are beginning to sound the trumpet \nof retreat and run up the white flag of surrender. That is not what \nAmerica wants this Senate to say on its behalf. We want to say, as \nPresident Bush asked us: Are we really in this war to win? Absolutely. \nWe will have a chance later today to decide whether we want to put an \nexclamation point behind the President's statement and commitment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator from Minnesota yield for a moment?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. As long as I can regain the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1950\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I sought the floor for the purpose of submitting the \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham] for himself, Mr. \n     Hagel, and Mr. Dodd, proposes an amendment numbered 1950.\n\n       On page 142, line 17, strike ``$567,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$731,000,000, of which, $164,000,000 shall be derived from \n     reductions in amounts otherwise appropriated in this act.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will be relatively brief. I want to \nrespond to my colleague from Florida.\n  First of all, the Senator from Florida is about as committed to this \nregion of the world, and to the country of Colombia, as anybody in the \nSenate. I understand that. This is just a respectful difference of \nopinion we have.\n  The two members of the Colombian Congress my colleague spoke about \nwere killed by paramilitaries, the AUC, not by the FARC or ELN, the \nguerrillas. Although I agree that the FARC and ELN are terrorist \norganizations and should be listed as such, so is the AUC, which is now \nlisted as a terrorist organization. I will go into this in a moment \nbecause I think it is an important point.\n  There are reasons we do not want to put an additional $71 million \ninto this package without much more accountability when it comes to \nhuman rights and who is committing the violence.\n  I also want to point out that of the money we are talking about, the \n$71 million, a lot of that money in this package goes to disaster \nrelief, goes to refugees, goes to combating HIV/AIDS, goes to public \nhealth, goes to education. I think we are probably a lot better off in \na foreign operations bill with these priorities than we are putting an \nadditional $71 million into this package.\n  I also have, which I think is very relevant to this debate, an EFE \nNews, Spain piece, the headline of which is ``Colombian Paramilitaries \nKidnap 70 Farmers to Pick Coca Leaves.''\n  The truth is, the FARC and ELN, these are not Robin Hood \norganizations; they are into narcotrafficking up to their eyeballs. But \nso is the AUC and the paramilitary.\n  The problem is this effort, Plan Colombia, has been all too one-\nsided. If it was truly counternarcotics, we would see just as much \neffort by the Government and by the military focused on the AUC and \ntheir involvement in drug trafficking as we see vis-a-vis ELN and FARC. \nBut we don't see that.\n  There are other reasons we can make better use of this $71 million. \nSince we started funding Plan Colombia, unfortunately we have seen a \ndramatic increase in paramilitary participation.\n  By the way, let me also point out that on the whole question of the \nwar against drugs, not only do I think we would be much better off \nspending money on reducing demand in our own country--there is a reason \nwhy Colombia exports 300 metric tons of cocaine to the United States \nevery year or more, and that is because of the demand. We ought to get \nserious about reducing the demand in our own country. As long as there \nis demand, somebody is going to grow it and somebody is going to make \nmoney and you can fumigate here and fumigate there and it will just \nmove from one place to another.\n  My colleague from Florida talked about this effective effort, but the \nUnited Nations, with a conservative methodology, pointed out that \nalthough 123,000 acres of coca plants have been fumigated under Plan \nColombia, cultivation increased 11 percent last year. Cultivation \nincreased 11 percent last year.\n  Senator Feingold and I will have an amendment and we will talk about \nthe fumigation and we will see where the social development money is \nthat was supposed to come with the fumigation. That was supposed to be \npart of Plan Colombia. We are also going to be saying we ought to \ninvolve the local people who live in these communities in decisions \nthat are made about this aerial spraying.\n  There are health and safety effects. We can raise those questions. \nBut it is a little naive to believe these campesinos are not going to \ncontinue to grow coca if they are not given alternatives, and the \nsocial development money has just not been there.\n  What I want to focus on, which is why I am opposed to the Graham \namendment, is the human rights issues. The ranks of the AUC and \nparamilitary groups continue to swell. The prime targets are human \nrights workers, trade unionists, drug prosecutors, journalists, and \nunfortunately two prominent legislators, murdered not by FARC or ELN \nbut murdered by AUC, with the military having way too many ties--the \nmilitary that we support --with the paramilitary at the brigade level.\n  I objected to such a huge infusion of military assistance to the \nColombian security forces when civilian management remained weak, and \nthe ties between the military and paramilitaries were so notorious and \nstrong.\n  Since Plan Colombia funding began pouring into Colombia, we have seen \na massive increase in paramilitary participation and its incumbent \nviolence. The ranks of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) \nand other paramilitary groups continue to swell. Their prime targets: \nhuman rights workers, trade unionists, judges, prosecutors, \njournalists, and myriad other civilians.\n  The linkages between Colombia's security forces and paramilitary \norganizations are long and historic. Everybody agrees, including the \nColombian Ministry of Defense, that the paramilitaries account for 75 \npercent of the killings in Colombia.\n  The media and international human rights groups continue to show \nevidence of tight links between the military and human rights violators \nwithin paramilitary groups.\n  The U.S. State Department, the U.N. High Commission on Human Rights, \nAmnesty International, and Human Rights Watch are among the \norganizations who have documented that the official Colombian military \nremains linked closely with paramilitaries and collaborates in the \natrocities.\n  According to the Colombian Committee of Jurists (CCJ), ``[i]n the \ncase of the paramilitaries, one cannot underestimate the collaboration \nof government forces.''\n  According to the International Labor Organization (ILO), the offical \nColombian military has in some cases created paramilitary units to \ncarry out assassinations.\n  The State Department's September 2000 report itself mentions \n``credible allegations of cooperation with paramilitary groups, \nincluding instances of both silent support and direct collaboration by \nmembers of the armed forces.''\n  Likewise, in its Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, released \nin February 2001, the State Department reported that ``the number of \nvictims of paramilitary attacks during the year increased.'' It goes on \nto say: ``members of the security forces sometimes illegally \ncollaborated with paramilitary forces. The armed forces and the police \ncommitted serious violations of human rights throughout the year.''\n  More from State Department Reports:\n\n       The Government's human rights record remained poor; there \n     were some improvements in the legal framework and in \n     institutional mechanisms, but implementation lagged, and \n     serious problems remain in many areas. Government security \n     forces continued to commit serious abuses, including \n     extrajudical killings. Despite some prosecutions \n     and convictions, the authorities rarely brought higher-\n     ranking officers of the security forces and the police \n     charged with human rights offenses to justice, and \n     impunity remains a problem. Members of the security forces \n     collaborated with paramilitary groups that committed \n     abuses, in some instances allowing such groups to pass \n     through roadbacks, sharing information, or providing them \n     with supplies or ammunition. Despite\n\n[[Page S10933]]\n\n     increased government efforts to combat and capture members \n     of paramilitary groups, often security forces failed to \n     take action to prevent paramilitary attacks. Paramilitary \n     forces find a ready support base within the military and \n     police, as well as among local civilian elites in many \n     areas.\n\n  Two weeks ago, Human Rights Watch released a report titled ``The \n`Sixth Division': Military-Paramilitary Ties and U.S. Policy in \nColombia.'' It contains charges that Colombian military and police \ndetachments continue to promote, work with, support, profit from, and \ntolerate paramilitary groups, treating them as a force allied to and \ncompatible with their own.\n  The ``Sixth Division'' is a phrase Colombians use to refer to \nparamilitary groups, seen to act as simply another part of the \nColombian military. The Colombian Army has five divisions.\n  In the report, Human Rights Watch focuses on three Colombian Army \nbrigades: the Twenty-Fourth, Third, and Fifth Brigades.\n  At their most brazen, the relationships described in this report \ninvolve active coordination during military operations between \ngovernment and paramilitary units; communication via radios, cellular \ntelephones, and beepers; the sharing of intelligence, including the \nnames of suspected guerrilla collaborators; the sharing of fighters, \nincluding active-duty soldiers serving in paramilitary units and \nparamilitary commanders lodging on military bases; the sharing of \nvehicles, including army trucks used to transport paramilitary \nfighters; coordination of army roadblocks, which routinely let heavily-\narmed paramilitary fighters pass; and payments made from paramilitaries \nto military officers for their support.\n  President Andres Pastrana has publicly deplored paramilitary \natrocities. But the armed forces have yet to take the critical steps \nnecessary to prevent future killings by suspending high ranking \nsecurity force members suspected of supporting these abuses.\n  This failure has serious implications for Colombia's international \nmilitary donors, especially the United States. So far, however, the \nUnited States has failed to fully acknowledge this situation, meaning \nthat military units implicated in abuses continue to receive U.S. aid. \nHuman Rights Watch contends that the United States has violated the \nspirit of its own laws and in some cases downplayed or ignored evidence \nof continuing ties between the Colombian military and paramilitary \ngroups in order to fund Colombia's military and lobby for more aid, \nincluding to a unit implicated in a serious abuse.\n  Although some members of the military have been dismissed by \nPresident Pastrana, it appears that many military personnel responsible \nfor egregious human rights violations continue to serve and receive \npromotions in the Colombian military.\n  For example, according to a Washington Office on Latin America, \nAmnesty International and Human Rights Watch joint report, General \nRodrigo Quinones, Commander of the Navy's First Brigade was linked to \n57 murders of trade unionists, human rights workers and community \nleaders in 1991 and 1992. He also played a significant role in a \nFebruary 2000 massacre. A civilian judge reviewing the case of one of \nhis subordinates stated that Quinones' guilt was ``irrefutable'' and \nthe judge could not understand how Quinones was acquitted in a military \ncourt. Nevertheless, he was promoted to General in June 2000.\n  According to the Colombian Attorney General's office, another \ngeneral, Carlos Ospina Ovalle, commander of the Fourth Brigade, had \nextensive ties to military groups. He and his brigade were involved in \nthe October 1997 El Aro massacre, wherein Colombian troops surrounded \nand maintained a perimeter around the village while residents were \nrounded up and four were executed. General Ospina Ovalle also was \npromoted.\n  In the State Department's January 2001 report Major Jesus Maria \nClavijo was touted as an example of a successful detention of a \nmilitary officer associated with the paramilitaries. Yet, by several \nNGO accounts he ``remains on active duty and is working in military \nintelligence, an area that has often been used to maintain links to \nparamilitary groups.''\n  Colombian and international human rights defenders are under \nincreased surveillance, intimidation, and threats of attack by \nparamilitary groups.\n  According to a recent Amnesty International press release, two men \nidentifying themselves as members of a paramilitary group approached \nmembers of Peace Brigades International, threatened them with a gun and \ndeclared PBI to be a ``military target.''\n  Members of Colombian human rights groups such as the Association of \nFamily Members of the Detained and Disappeared and the Regional \nCorporation for the Defense of Human Rights have been ``disappeared,'' \nmurdered in their homes and harassed with death threats. Despite \nreports to the military and requests for help, Colombian authorities \nseemingly have failed to take significant steps on behalf of the human \nrights groups.\n  The systematic, mass killing of union leaders and their members by \nparamilitaries in Colombia can only be described as genocide. There has \nbeen a dramatic escalation in violations against them--kidnapping, \ntorture, and murder--and the response by the Colombian authorities in \nthe face of this crisis has been negligible.\n  These attacks are an affront to the universally recognized right to \norganize.\n\n       One hundred and thirty-five trade unionists, both leaders \n     and members, were assassinated during the year, bringing the \n     total number of trade unionists killed since 1991 to several \n     thousand. At least another 1,600 others have received death \n     threats over the last three years, including 180 in 2000; 37 \n     were unfairly arrested and 155 had to flee their home region. \n     A further 24 were abducted, 17 disappeared and 14 were the \n     victims of physical attacks. (International Confederation of \n     Free Trade Unions--10 October 2001. Colombia: Annual Survey \n     of Violations of Trade Union Rights--2001).\n\n  I would like to share this quote with my colleagues; it will reveal \nthe true nature of the situation in Colombia. The quote is attributed \nto Carlo Castano, head of the AUC, the largest paramilitary group in \nColombia): ``We have reasons for killing all those we do. In the case \nof trade unionists, we kill them because they prevent others from \nworking.''\n  Most of the union killings have been carried out by Castano's AUC, \nbecause they view union organizers as subversives. One of the most \nrecent killings occurred on June 21, when the leader of Sinaltrainal--\nthe union that represents Colombia Coca-Cola workers--Oscar Dario Soto \nPolo was gunned down. His murder brings to seven the number of \nunionists who worked for Coca-Cola and were targeted and killed by \nparamilitaries.\n  I recently met with the new leader of Sinaltrainal, Javier Correa. In \nour meeting, he described the daily threats to his life, and the \nextremely dangerous conditions he and his family are forced to endure. \nIn his quiet, gentle manner he told me about the kidnaping of his 3-\nyear-old son and his mother, both at the hands of the paramilitaries. \nFrankly, I fear for his life and that of his family. In the wake of \nthis meeting, I dread news from the Colombian press, mainly out of fear \nof what I may read.\n  In response to these threats, the United Steelworkers of America \nrecently sued Coca-Cola in Federal court for its role in such violent \nattacks on labor, and other large corporations are being investigated.\n\n       According to the International Labor Organization (ILO), \n     the vast majority of trade union murders are committed by \n     either the Colombian state itself--e.g. army, police and DAS \n     (security department)--or its indirect agents, the right-wing \n     paramilitaries.\n\n  On both of my visits to Colombia, I heard repeated reports of \nmilitary-paramilitary collusion throughout the country, including in \nthe southern departments of Valle, Cauca, and Putamayo, as well as in \nthe city of Barrancabermeja, which I visited in December and March.\n  Consistently, the military, in particular the army, was described to \nme as tolerating, supporting, and actively coordinating paramilitary \noperations, which often ended in massacres. I was also told that too \noften detailed information was supplied to the military and other \nauthorities about the whereabouts of armed groups, the location of \ntheir bases, and yet authorities were unwilling or unable to take \nmeasures to protect the civilian population or to pursue their \nattackers.\n  While in Colombia, I discussed with General Carreno the status and \nlocation of the San Rafael--de Lebrija--paramilitary base. The base is \noperating openly in an area under his command, and its activities have \ndirectly\n\n[[Page S10934]]\n\ncaused much of the bloodshed in the region. Almost 7 months after our \nmeeting, however, no effective action has been taken to curtail the \noperations of the San Rafael paramilitary base, and that it remains \nopen for business.\n  The Colombian military knows where the base is, and who operates it. \nThe Colombian government knows. I know, for heaven's sake. But, just in \ncase they don't know, I will tell them here. The base is on the \nMagdalena River about 130 kilometers north of Barrancabermeja on the \nsame side of the River as Barranca, northwest of the Municipio of Rio \nNegro, in the Department of Santander.\n  It is from San Rafael de Lebrija that the paramilitaries launch their \noperations to dominate the local governments and the local community \norganizations in the area around and including Barrancabermeja. It is \nthere that they organize their paramilitary operations of intimidations \nof the citizens of the area including the attacks on Barrancabermeja.\n  It is from there that they stage the murder of innocent civilians \nlike Alma Rosa Jaramillo and Eduardo Estrada. These brave volunteers \nwere brutally assassinated in July, simply because they stand for \ndemocracy, civil rights, and human rights. They are against the war, \nand have no enemies in the conflict. They were both leaders in the \nProgram of Development and Peace of the Magdalena Medio, located in \nBarranca, lead by my friend Father ``Pacho'' Francisco De Roux.\n  I call on the Colombian government and military to show the U.S. \nSenate that they are serious about cracking down on paramilitaries.\n  Close San Rafael. Close Mirafores and Simon Bolivar, also located in \nBarranca, in the northeast quadrant of the city. Close San Blas, south \nof the Municipio of Simiti near San Pablo in the South of the \nDepartment of Bolivar. Close Hacienda Villa Sandra, a base about one \nmile north of Puerto Asis, the largest town in Putumayo. Is this too \nmuch to ask?\n  From the annual report on Colombia, by the Inter-American Commission \non Human Rights (Organization of American States--year 2000) (The OAS \non paramilitary bases):\n\n       . . . observations . . . confirm that the free operation of \n     patrol checks, paramilitary bases and acts perpetrated by the \n     AUC in the areas of Putumayo (La Hormiga, La Dorada, San \n     Miguel, Puerto Asis, Santa Ana), Antioquia (El Jordan, San \n     Carlos), y Valle (La Iberia, Tulua) are being investigated \n     mainly in the disciplinary jurisdiction.\n\n  It further says:\n\n       The Commission is particularly troubled by the situation in \n     Barrancabermeja, Department of Santander. Complaints are \n     periodically received concerning paramilitary incursions and \n     the establishment of new paramilitary camps in the urban \n     districts. The complaints report that even though civilian \n     and military authorities have been alerted, paramilitary \n     groups belonging to the AUC have settled in the Mirafores and \n     Simon Bolivar districts in the northeast quadrant of the \n     city, and have spread to another 32 districts in the \n     southern, southeastern, northern and northeastern sectors.\n\n  Arrest the notorious paramilitary leaders who open and sustain these \nbases. Nearly everyone knows who they are, where they operate. I know, \nand I've only been to Colombia twice.\n  They are operated by the AUC, led by the likes of Carlos Castano, \nJulian Duque, Alexander ``El Zarco'' Londono, Gabriel Salvatore ``El \nMono'' Mancuso Gomez, and Ramon Isaza Arango.\n  The men on this short list--a mere five paramilitaries--account for \nover 40 arrest warrants over several years. They are responsible for \nuntold cases of kidnaping, torture, and murder. Go get them.\n  In its annual report on Columbia, the Inter-American Commission on \nHuman Rights (Organization of American States--year 2000) addressed the \nproblem of paramilitary groups and their bases of operations. Here is \nwhat they said:\n\n       The Commission must point out . . . that although the human \n     rights violations committed by paramilitary are frequently \n     investigated by the regular courts, in many cases, the arrest \n     warrants the courts issue are not executed, especially when \n     they involve the upper echelons of the AUC and the \n     intellectual authors. This creates a climate of impunity and \n     fear. A case in point is the fact that in 2000, the highest \n     ranking chief of the AUC, Carlos Castano, has had access to \n     the national and international media and contacts at the \n     ministerial level, yet the numerous arrest warrants against \n     him for serious human rights violations, have never been \n     executed.\n\n  The Colombian government seems to have accepted paramilitary take \novers, in places like Barranca. The Colombian government and military \nmust find a way to respond to the paramilitary threat. It is a threat \nto the rights of free speech, free assembly, and moreover, the rule of \nlaw in Colombia.\n  Mr. President, as I have said all along, if we are really serious \nabout counter-narcotics we should strongly encourage the Colombian \ngovernment to act boldly and officiously in response to the increasing \nstrength of the paramilitaries, who are actively engaged in narco-\ntrafficking.\n  Carlos Castano has admitted that about 70 percent of his \norganization's revenues come from taxing drug traffickers. He is listed \nas a major Colombian drug trafficker in recent documents of the U.S. \nDrug Enforcement Agency.\n  Drug trafficking is a lucrative business for all parties involved in \nthe Colombian conflict. The fact is, many military personnel are \nfinding that paramilitary work is simply more lucrative than military \npay. In addition, they are not forced to comply with even the minimum \nin standards for conduct. Yet, this begets another crucial question: \nwhere do all these vetted officers and soldiers end up? I fear the \nanswer again lies in the paramilitaries. After all, their ranks have \nswelled dramatically in recent years.\n  To date, the debate surrounding Plan Colombia has been disingenuous. \nWhy has there been little effort to combat paramilitary drug lords? I'm \nafraid we may be exposing this plan for what it really is; \ncounterinsurgency against the leftist guerrillas, rather than a sincere \neffort to stop the flow of drugs. A recent Rand report suggested that \nthe U.S. government should abandon this charade, in favor of an all-out \nmilitary offensive on guerrilla forces.\n  Lamentably, I do not see any improvement on the rule of law front. \nSince Plan Colombia started, and the requisite oversight, we have \nwitnessed an unprecedented increase in the power and authority of a \nColombian military with a long history of corruption and abuse.\n  Last summer, President Pastrana signed a new national security law \nthat gives the Colombian military sweeping new powers. Among other \nthings, the law allows military commanders to declare martial law in \ncombat zones, suspending powers of civilian authorities and some \nconstitutional protections afforded civilians. The law also shortens \nthe period for carrying out human rights investigations of police and \narmy troops, allowing soldiers to assume some of the tasks that had \nbeen assigned to civilian investigators.\n  Other controversial aspects of the law are provisions that allow the \nmilitary to hold suspects for longer periods before turning them over \nto civilian judges. Under the old law, government troops had to free \nsuspected drug traffickers and guerrillas if they were unable to turn \nthem over to civilian authorities within 36 hours. I am very concerned \nabout the implications of these provisions. Like many, I fear that \ntorture or other human rights violations may increase as a result.\n  The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia believes, as \nI do, that some of the provisions of the law are either \nunconstitutional or violate international human rights treaties. I have \nconveyed my objections about this law to the Colombian government. By \npouring another $135 million into the coffers of the Colombian \nmilitary, we will be increasing their power further without adequately \nstrengthening checks on military abuses. Frankly, I feel this is the \nwrong direction.\n  I am pleased that my colleagues, especially Senator Leahy, have \nfought to attach safeguards to U.S. military aid to ensure that the \nColombian armed forces are: First, cooperating fully with civilian \nauthorities, in prosecuting and punishing in civilian courts those \nmembers credibly alleged to have committed gross violations of human \nrights or aided or abetted paramilitary groups; second, severing links, \nincluding intelligence sharing, at the command, battalion, and brigade \nlevels, with paramilitary groups, and executing outstanding arrest \nwarrants for members of such groups; and third, investigating attacks \nagainst human\n\n[[Page S10935]]\n\nrights defenders, trade unionists, and government prosecutors, \ninvestigators and civilian judicial officials, and bringing the alleged \nperpetrators to justice.\n  Moreover, the paramilitaries undermine the peace process. How can \nguerrillas--be they ELN or FARC--agree with the government about future \npolitical inclusion in the context of a cease fire without first \ndefining the problem of paramilitary groups?\n  In early 2001, President Pastrana agreed to create a DMZ for the ELN \nin the northern state of Bolivar. This backfired badly when ELN rebels \nwere chased out by members of the paramilitary group Autodefensas \nUnidas de Colombia, AUC. The ELN subsequently pulled out of the peace \nprocess.\n  Frustration with the peace process on the part of the military and \nthe country's elites has helped transform the paramilitary AUC into a \nmajor player in the conflict. Some estimates of the strength and size \nof the AUC are as high as 9,500 fighters. In my view, this resurgence \ncan be directly linked to the flawed peace process.\n\n  The AUC poses a real threat to the FARC and the ELN, who may now be \nforced to co-operate with each other more closely. That is bad news for \nthe security situation, particularly given the boost it could provide \nto the weaker ELN.\n  What's even more telling is the trend of FARC guerrillas joining the \nranks of the paramilitaries. Their motives are based on greed. \nParamilitaries, financed by narcotraffickers, are now using ex-\ngerrillas as scouts and officers, to combat the FARC and ELN more \nforcefully. This amounts to a deadly coalition. The narcotrafficers \nhave money without limits, the paramilitaries use violence without \nscruples, and the military supplies inside information and protection.\n  Press reports detailing U.S. reluctance to paticipate, even as an \nobserver, in peace talks between President Pastrana and FARC leaders \nonly serve to increase my concerns. All sides need to encourage a \ncontinued dialogue among all sectors of civil society, but the \nescalating violence makes that increasingly impossible.\n  Some of my colleagues have argued that the present campaign against \nterrorism merits our continued military involvement in Colombia. These \nfunds, it is said, are going toward counternarcotics operations, \ntargeting the FARC and ELN, both of which are on the State Department's \nterrorist list.\n  I am well aware that paramilitary groups are not the only armed \nactors committing human rights violations in Colombia, and I am no \nfriend of these guerrilla movements. In fact, I have consistently \ndecried their repressive tactics and blatant disregard for \ninternational human rights standards.\n  I was deeply saddened by recent reports from Colombia which suggest \nthat the FARCC kidnapped and murdered Consuelo Aruajo, the nation's \nformer culture minister. She was a beloved figure across Colombia, \nknown for her promotion of local culture and music. So, I would like to \ntake this opportunity to again call upon the FARC to suspend \nkidnappings, killings and extortion of the civilian population and the \nindigenous communities.\n  That said, I further believe that we should be more forceful in going \nafter paramilitary death squads, with longstanding ties to some in the \nColombian military and government.\n  Several weeks ago, Representative Luis Alfredo Colmenares, a member \nof the opposition Liberal Party was assassinated in Bogota. We do not \nyet know who perpetrated this despicable act, but most signs point to \nparamilitary death squads, AUC. These same paramilitaries are believed \nto be responsible for the October 2 murder of representative Octavio \nSarmiento, also a member of the Liberal Party. Both men represented the \nprovince of Arauca, Northeast of the capital, on the Venezuelan \nfrontier--a region that has become increasingly ravaged by the ever-\nwidening war.\n  I was pleased that Secretary Powell made the decision to add the AUC \nto the State Department's terrorist list. It was a sign that the United \nStates oppposes threats--from both the left and right--in the \nhemisphere, and I am encouraged by this development. Yet, I do not \nbelieve it goes far enough. As Senators, we should embrace the \nchallenge of making a bold effort to quell paramilitary violence. Wwe \nmust not shirk from that responsibility.\n  The way out of this mess is nothing particularly new or innnovative. \nWhat has been lacking in Bogota and Washington is the political will to \ntake the risks to make the old proposals work.\n  The Congress and the Bush administration must insist on credible and \nfar-reaching efforts to stop the paramilitaries.\n  Further, we must provide serious and sustained support for the peace \nprocess, and work to deliver economic assistance programs that work \ninstead of dramatic military offensives.\n  Finally, we need to embrace demand reduction as the most effective \nmechanism for success in the campaign against drugs.\n  General Tapias, the highest ranking military person in Colombia was \ncoming to meet with me. It was the day the Hart Building was evacuated. \nWe talked on the phone. I know the Presiding Officer spent some time in \nColombia. I said to him on the basis of the good advice from a \nwonderful human rights priest, Francisco De Roux, General: (A) thank \nyou for trying to do a better job of breaking the connection between \nthe military and the paramilitary. Thank you for trying to do that. We \nknow you have made that effort. (B) I said thank you for going after \nthe FARC and the ELN.\n  The third question I asked him was when it comes to the murder of \ncivil society people such as the people I met on two trips to \nBarrancabermeja--some of whom I met, some of whom are no longer alive--\npeople who work with Francisco De Roux, probably the best economic \ndevelopment organization in Colombia--they are murdered with impunity. \nI said to the general: Where are you? Where is the military? And where \nare the police in defending the civil society?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield for just \none moment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, military-paramilitary linkages are long \nand historic. Everybody agrees. I told you that FARC and the ELN are \nnot Robin Hood organizations. But the paramilitaries, now listed as a \nterrorist organization by our State Department, account for 75 percent \nof the killings in Colombia by the AUC.\n  The U.S. State Department, the United Nations High Commission on \nHuman Rights, Amnesty international, and Human Rights Watch are among \nthe organizations who have documented that the official Colombian \nmilitary has remained linked closely with the paramilitaries and all \ntoo often collaborates in these atrocities.\n  We don't need to be giving out any more money.\n  The State Department's September 2000 report mentions ``credible \nallegations of cooperation with paramilitary groups, including \ninstances of both silent support and direct collaboration by members of \nthe armed forces.''\n  Two weeks ago, Human Rights Watch released a report titled, ``Sixth \nDivision: Military-Paramilitary Ties and U.S. Policy in Colombia.'' It \nis troubling.\n  The ``Sixth Division'' is a phrase Colombians use to refer to \nparamilitary groups seen to act as simply another part of the Colombian \nmilitary. The Colombian military has five divisions.\n  In this report, Human Rights Watch focuses on three Colombian Army \nbrigades: The Twenty-Fourth, Third, and Fifth Brigades.\n  I asked the general about direct ties to the paramilitary. They are \ndocumented. The paramilitaries are brazen. President Pastrana operates \nin good faith, and I know he has publicly deplored the paramilitary \natrocities. But the armed forces have yet to take the critical steps \nnecessary to prevent future killings by suspending these high-ranking \nsecurity force members suspected of supporting these abuses.\n  I am telling you that it is documented. We know. But these military \nfolks aren't removed. They are not suspended. Nothing or very little is \ndone. I don't think we need to spend more money on this.\n  Human rights abusers are rewarded with promotion. The joint report of \nthe\n\n[[Page S10936]]\n\nWashington Office on Latin America, Amnesty International, and Human \nRights Watch talks about the fact that a number of different high-\nranking military people involved in atrocities are directly involved \nwith the paramilitary, and are promoted.\n  Human rights workers are under attack. There are systematic mass \nkillings of union leaders and their members by the paramilitary in \nColombia.\n  I describe that as genocide. That is what it is. As a matter of fact, \nthe AUC has actually bragged about this. Their leader bragged about \nthis.\n  And we need to give them more money? I don't think so.\n  I wish I could mention some of the courageous people who have been \nmurdered.\n  I have gone to Colombia twice. I have gone to Barrancabermeja. I have \ngone there because it is sort of a safe haven in Colombia. It is one of \nthe most violent cities in a very violent country.\n  I have had the opportunity to meet with a man that I consider to be \nreally one of the greatest individuals I have ever met--Francisco De \nRoux, referred to as Father ``Pacho.'' Why is he so respected and \nbeloved? He has an organization called the Program of Development and \nPeace of the Magdalena Medio located in Barranca. They do wonderful \nsocial justice and economic development work.\n  In the last several months, a number of innocent civilians, such as \nAlma Rosa Jaramillo and Eduardo Estrada, brave volunteers, were \nbrutally assassinated--one, I think, in front of his family members. It \nwas awful. They were murdered by the AUC. They were murdered by the \nparamilitary, and the civil society people who work for their \norganization still wait for the prosecution.\n  I said to General Carreno, the military man in the region: Here is \nAUC's leader, the bad guys. Go get them.\n  It hasn't happened.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Leahy, because I think there are some \nimportant human rights safeguards and Leahy safeguards in this \nlegislation that go absolutely in the right direction.\n  I will zero in on this for the Feingold amendment on fumigating and \nspraying. I am in profound opposition with the amendment of my \ncolleague from Florida, who is one of my favorite Senators. I am not \njust saying that; he is. I have great respect for him. I oppose the \nadditional ways in which money is being spent.\n\n  Funding for disaster relief--you name it--and health care makes a \nwhole lot more sense. I don't think we need to be putting any more \nmoney into this plan. Believe me. There are important human rights \nquestions to be raised. I don't think the Colombian Government has been \nnearly as accountable as they should.\n  Frankly, even with the war on the counternarcotics effort, there are \nvery real questions as to how effective this is.\n  At the very minimum, let's not spend even more money without making \nsure first we have the accountability, especially on the human rights \nissues.\n  My colleague from Florida said: What is the message going to be? I \nwill say this: What is the message going to be if the United States of \nAmerica, over and over, all of a sudden says when it comes to democracy \nand when it comes to the human rights question that we are going to put \nall of that in parenthesis, and we are going to turn our gaze away from \nit, that it makes no difference to us, and it is not a priority for our \ngovernment?\n  If we do that, we will no longer be lighting the candle for the \nworld. It would be a profound mistake.\n  I hope colleagues will vote against this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am rather disappointed with this \namendment. Senators have every right, of course, to offer any amendment \nthey have.\n  This bill has been before the Senate for almost 2 weeks now. We just \nheard about this amendment a very short time ago today. This amendment \ncuts at least $164 million from important programs, as the Senator from \nMinnesota and others have pointed out. I mention the money it is \ncutting because these are programs where funds have been requested by \nboth Republicans and Democrats.\n\n  The amendment of the Senator from Florida would transfer those funds \nto the Andean Counterdrug Program. That program essentially consists of \nmilitary and economic assistance to four principal countries--Colombia, \nPeru, Bolivia, and Ecuador--but these are not countries that are going \nunfunded. They already get over a half billion dollars in this bill--\nwell over a half billion dollars. They get $567 million.\n  I do not believe there is any region, other than possibly Middle East \ncountries and the former Soviet Republics, that gets that amount of \nmoney. That $567 million is on top of the $1,300 million--$1.3 \nbillion--that we provided for Plan Colombia last year. In fact, it is \nnot a half billion dollars; it is more than a half billion dollars. It \nis nearly three-quarters of a billion dollars when you include the \neconomic and development aid in this bill for the Andean countries, and \nthat is there on top of the counterdrug aid.\n  So you take the funds that are already in this bill--not the funds \nadded by the Senator from Florida, but the funds already in this bill--\nand we will have provided over $2 billion for these countries in the \npast 16 months; in 1\\1/3\\ years, over $2 billion.\n  In fact, by pouring money down there so fast, they can't even spend \nit yet. Much of last year's funds have not even been disbursed. Even \nthough they have not spent all the money, we are giving them another \n$700 million in additional funding this year.\n  It is no secret that--and, actually, I am not alone in this body--I \nam skeptical that this program will have an appreciable impact on the \namount of illegal drugs coming into the United States. We have spent \nbillions down there, and drugs are just as accessible. In fact, in our \ncountry, for many types of drugs the price has actually gone down.\n  I suggest, until we start doing something about reducing the \ninsatiable demand for drugs here, in the world's wealthiest country, we \nare not going to do too much good about incoming drugs. As long as the \nmoney is there, we can stop them in Colombia, but they will just come \nfrom somewhere else. Secretary Rumsfeld has said much the same thing.\n  In fact, a lot of other members of the Appropriations Committee--in \nboth parties--expressed similar doubts in a hearing we held earlier \nthis year. We had a hearing where the administration came up.\n  We asked them: By the way, how much money has been spent that we have \ngiven you so far?\n  They said: Gee, we don't know. We will try to get back to you on \nthat.\n  We said: Well, with a billion dollars or so, you must have some kind \nof basic idea what you spent the money on.\n  They said: We don't know, but we will sure check into it.\n  When my kids were little, I gave them a small allowance. I did not \nexpect them to tell me where it all went--whether it was baseball cards \nor comic books or ice cream cones or something like that--but we were \ntalking about a few dollars. When you give somebody $1 billion, you \nwould kind of like to know what they do with it.\n  So I said: If you can't tell us where you spent it, how about letting \nus in on a little secret. Has anything been accomplished with the money \nwe gave you?\n  They said: We will have to get back to you on that. We don't know how \nmuch has been spent. We don't know how much has been accomplished. We \ndo know we have another $700 million in this bill, and we have a whole \nlot of money in the pipeline that is not yet spent.\n\n  We keep pouring money in. We do not even know if the program will \nwork. But the administration wants some money in there. We put in a lot \nof money. We have a lot of other similar programs, especially in \nforeign policy. We pour a whole lot of money in there and not much \ncomes out.\n  We have spent billions of dollars to combat drugs in the Andes over \nthe past 15 years, and we have eradicated coca and we have eradicated \nopium poppy in several places, but, of course, they just pop up \nsomewhere else. It is sort of like Whack-A-Mole--knock down one, it \npops up somewhere else.\n\n[[Page S10937]]\n\n  And we have found one other thing: The flow of illegal drugs into \nthis country, no matter what we do in other countries, reflects our \ndemand. If the demand for drugs goes up in this country, the flow of \ndrugs coming into this country increases. If the demand for drugs \ndrops, the flow of drugs into this country drops. Far more than what we \ndo with our Customs agents--and they are extremely good--or the DEA or \nthe Coast Guard or anything else, in a nation of a quarter of a billion \npeople, if we want to spend billions upon billions upon billions of \ndollars for drugs, the drugs will come.\n  But even though there is serious doubts about whether this works, \nSenator McConnell and I have tried to give the administration the \nbenefit of the doubt. We include another half billion dollars in this \nbill, on top of the billions already there.\n  The senior Senator from Florida, who is in this Chamber right now, is \na good friend of mine. We have worked together on many issues. But I \nwould like to see him try to do the balancing act we have had to do in \nthis bill to get money for a program that actually most of us on the \ncommittee do not even like, but to give money for that program, and do \nthe other things in this bill.\n  We have had 81 Senators requesting funding for all sorts of programs \nwe tried to fund. I want to be fair; 81 Senators asked for some \nfunding, and 3 did ask for some money for the Andean Counterdrug \nProgram. Eighty-one of the 100 Senators asked for funding for various \nitems in this bill; 3 of the 100 Senators asked for funding for the \nAndean Counterdrug Program. Other than a few lobbyists, it does not \nseem to be the most popular program.\n  But we have a bill that is in balance. I know the administration \nsupports the Andean program. They also support the Economic Support \nFund. They support the Foreign Military Financing Program. They support \nfunding for the former Soviet Republics. They support money for Central \nand Eastern Europe. They support money for the International Military \nEducation and Training Program. They support money for our \ncontributions to the World Bank and United Nations programs. There are \na number of things the administration supports.\n  In fact, they have put together a legislative blivet. They support a \nlot more programs than there is money in this bill. If you put up a \nchart: Shown up here is what they support in programs, down here is \nwhere they put money. So we have had to take the money we have \navailable. We have taken the programs supported by the administration, \nand also assuming the Congress has some say in how the money is spent \non programs supported by this body and the other body.\n  All these accounts were cut by the House and, actually, in some cases \nthey were cut below what the President requested. We restored them to \nhelp out the administration. We made choices. We made choices which \nreflect the administration's priorities and Senators' priorities. They \nare not always the same requests. In fact, we were unable to fund over \n$3.4 billion in requests from 81 Senators. Now this amendment would cut \nthose even further.\n  In fact, the Andean Counterdrug Program received a lot more funding \nthan many other critical programs. We provide more money for the Andean \nCounterdrug Program than we do to combat AIDS, which infects another \n17,000 people every day. Many Senators wanted to provide more money to \nfight AIDS and also to help fulfill the President's commitment to do \nthat, but we are $1 billion short of what we should be spending on \nAIDS.\n  Incidentally, we provide more for the Andean Regional Initiative than \nwe do for assistance to the world's 22 million refugees.\n  Other Senators have asked for more money for refugees, but we were \nunable to do it partly because of the huge amount of money we are \nalready putting in the Andean Counterdrug Program.\n  Incidentally, we provide over twice as much in this bill for the \nAndean Counterdrug Program as for all disaster relief programs \nworldwide--for victims of war, earthquakes, drought, and other \ncalamities in all of Africa, Central America, and Asia--even at a time \nwhen we are trying to point out to the rest of the world that we are \nnot the Great Satan that Osama bin Laden and others try to make us out \nto be, that we do help in these areas. We don't help as much as the \nAndean Counterdrug Program, but we will help.\n  When I see requests for more money for the Andean Counterdrug \nProgram, it worries me. We already spend four times as much for the \nAndean Counterdrug Program as for basic education programs worldwide, \neven though the President and Members of both parties have said we \nshould do more to help improve education worldwide so that we will have \neducated people and the next generation coming along will be educated \nand have a better idea of what the United States and other democracies \nare like as well as what the real culture of their own country is like.\n  We provide four times as much for the Andean Counterdrug Program as \nfor microcredit programs for loans for the world's absolutely poorest \npeople, loans that help in many countries allow women, for the first \ntime in the history of those countries, to have a basic modicum of \nindependence. For women who have absolutely nothing otherwise, have no \nway of doing it, this program helps. We provide four times as much for \nthe Andean Counterdrug Program. We provide more for the Andean \nCounterdrug Program than we do for antiterrorism programs or \nnonproliferation programs. We actually should be spending twice as much \nfor those programs. We can't because of all the money we are already \nputting into the Andean Counterdrug Program.\n  At some point we have to set some priorities. We have poured in money \nso fast they can't even spend the money they have in the pipeline. The \nadministration, when they provide sworn testimony before the Congress, \ncan't even tell us what the money is being spent for. Yet they want \nmore. How many other programs do we have to cut? We provide more for \nthis than we do for our export programs.\n  Let's go back and tell some of the small businesses in America that \ndepend on the export business and that could employ people at a time \nwhen the economy is going in the tank, let's tell some of these small \ncompanies, sorry, we can't help you build up your business so you can \nexport and hire people who have been laid off to come back because we \nhave to give the Andean Counterdrug Program more money beyond the \nbillions we have already spent.\n  Maybe we ought to be cutting these export programs. The heck with \nputting people back to work; we have to send some money down to the \nAndean Counterdrug Program. We don't know where it is going. We don't \nknow how it is being spent. We know it is not effective. We know it \nhasn't stopped drugs coming up here. But let's make ourselves feel good \nand send it down there. Sorry, you are getting laid off from your \nfactory job here.\n  I care about international health. We have a total of $175 million in \nthis bill to combat infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and \nmalaria. They kill about 3 million people a year. We can help, with \nsome of this money, to make sure some of these infectious diseases that \nare a postage stamp or an airplane trip away from the United States, to \nstop them from coming in this country. But we don't have enough money \nto do that. We don't have enough money not only to help these people \neradicate these diseases in their own country but to stop them from \ncoming into our country because we don't have enough money. Why? We are \nspending four times more on the Andean Counterdrug Program, four times \nwhat we are doing to stop diseases--smallpox, tuberculosis, malaria, or \nthe Ebola plague--from coming into our country.\n\n  Ask somebody who has picked up the paper in the last few days what \nthey think our priorities are.\n  One would think from this amendment that Senator McConnell and I \ndon't support a counterdrug program. That is not so. We are willing to \ngive the benefit of the doubt. It hasn't proven it has done anything \nyet. It has yet to demonstrate any impact on the drug program in this \ncountry. But we are willing to give the administration a chance, and so \nwe have thrown in a half a billion dollars on top of the $1.3 billion \nof last year. The administration says it has not worked. It can't show\n\n[[Page S10938]]\n\nanything where it has been successful, but ``give us some more and we \nwill do it.'' We have done that.\n  If we add even more money for it, where do we cut? This amendment \ncuts across the board. It cuts Egypt. It cuts Israel. It cuts Jordan. \nIt cuts money for the former Soviet Union. It cuts education. It cuts \nTB prevention programs. It cuts education of children. It cuts programs \nthat might give some economic stability to poor women across the world. \nWhy? To go into an Andean Counterdrug Program where they can't even \naccount for the money they have.\n  I want to help Colombia. I want to help Bolivia. I want to help \nEcuador. I want to help Peru. We have put a half a billion dollars in \nhere to do that, even though that is money from priorities that might \ndo the country better.\n  I met the head of Colombia's armed forces last week. I have met him \nbefore. I have nothing but complete respect and admiration for \nPresident Pastrana of Colombia. I consider Colombia's Ambassador, \nAmbassador Moreno, a friend. I think he is one of the best ambassadors \nany country has sent here. He knows how the administration works. He \nknows how our country works. He knows what our culture is. He speaks \nout forcefully for his own country. He does it with great respect for \nColombia, but also with appropriate respect for the country in which he \nis serving. In fact, I sometimes wish some of the ambassadors we sent \nto other countries could do their job as well as Ambassador Moreno \ndoes.\n  I hope that this half a billion dollars--actually more than half a \nbillion dollars--that Senator McConnell and I have put into this bill \nwill pay off in the Andean Counterdrug Program. But in the past year we \nhave seen the civil war in Colombia intensify. We have seen the \nparamilitaries double in size. There have been more massacres of \ninnocent civilians by paramilitaries this year than ever before. There \nis indisputable evidence that the paramilitaries are receiving support \nfrom some in the Colombian armed forces.\n  Funding that we provided last year to strengthen Colombia's justice \nsystem has yet to be spent. Some of it has been allocated for purposes \nthat bear little if any resemblance to what Congress intended, in a \nbipartisan fashion, it to be used for.\n  Aerial fumigation has destroyed a lot of coca. But there are also \nsupposed to be alternative programs from which to give farmers \nsomething else to earn a living. They have barely been used. They have \nnot spent tens of millions of dollars we provided last year, and USAID \nhas serious doubt about Colombia's ability to implement these programs.\n  If we don't give these farmers an alternative source of income, if we \ndon't use the money we sent to do that, does anybody doubt that we will \nsee these farmers planting coca again so they can feed their families? \nI wish they wouldn't. I think it is wrong they do. But let's be \nrealistic. If you have a hungry family there, you are not going to \nthink of the people of another country who spend more money on their \ndrug habit in a week than these people ever see in a year.\n  I share the concerns of the Senator from Florida about the use of \ndrugs in this country, especially in my own State. I was a prosecutor \nfor 8 years. I have some very strong views on these issues. Heroin use \nhas been steadily increasing in Vermont. Like any Vermonter, that \nfrightens me and worries me. But the Andean Counterdrug Program is not \ngoing to have any impact on that problem we have in Vermont. Yet there \nis a half billion dollars in this bill. It is not going to help most \nStates. Let's see how last year's money gets spent. Let's see how this \nyear's half billion dollars gets spent. Then if the administration \ncomes here before Senator McConnell's and my committee next year and \nstarts telling us, gee, we don't know where the money is going, how it \nis being spent, or if it is having any effect, or they are able to tell \nus how it is being spent and what effect it has had, then we can talk \nabout more money.\n\n  Before we throw a whole lot more money into the problem, let's see if \nthe $718 million does any good in the first place.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the committee funded the President's \n$731 million request for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative at $567 \nmillion, which is a cut of $164 million. This figure reflects an \nattempt by the subcommittee to balance the interest of Congress and the \nPresident over such issues as restoring the administration's 25 percent \nor $119 million cut in the export-import pact funding.\n  Senator Graham's amendment seeks to restore that $164 million to this \ninitiative. I think he knows this is going to be an issue for the \nconference, as Senator Leahy pointed out, because the House funding \nlevel is $675 million. While I can appreciate his arguments for funding \nthe Andean initiative, it is clear from a hearing Senator Leahy and I \nheld on this issue earlier this year that there are Members who are \nconcerned with Plan Colombia and the ability of the United States to \nimpact narcotics growth and production in the civil war zones. Reducing \nfunds for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative will not starve our \ncounterdrug efforts. The disbursement of funds from last year's Plan \nColombia is occurring, frankly, at a rather slow pace. Figures from \nUSAID show that of the $119 million provided for judicial, economic, \nand other reforms, only $8 million has been actually spent to date.\n  So Senator Leahy and I included an amendment in the managers' package \nto ensure adequate levels of funding for counterdrug assistance for \nBolivia and Ecuador.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request to which \nI understand the Senator from Kentucky has agreed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Graham amendment No. 1950 be laid \naside, to recur at 4:40 p.m.; that there then be 20 minutes remaining \nfor debate prior to a vote on a motion to table the amendment, with the \ntime to be equally divided and controlled between the Senator from \nVermont and the senior Senator from Florida, or their designees; that \nno second-degree amendment be in order to the Graham amendment prior to \na vote on a motion to table; that Senator Feingold now be recognized to \noffer two amendments, one with respect to Andean drug and one with \nrespect to congressional COLA; that if debate has not concluded on the \ntwo Feingold amendments at 4:40 p.m., they be laid aside, to recur upon \ndisposition of the Graham amendment in the order in which they are \noffered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair, and I am sure he understood that \nconvoluted agreement just as much as the propounder of it did.\n  By doing this--and I see the Senator from Wisconsin in the Chamber--\nwe will be able to move forward. Again, the Senator from Kentucky and I \nare open to do business. I will have other things to say and will speak \non the Andean drug matter, but I remind everybody that we have a huge \namount of money in the bill already, and we are cutting a lot of \nprograms that should have higher priority.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWisconsin is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1951\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, and I \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself and \n     Mr. Wellstone, proposes an amendment numbered 1951.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n[[Page S10939]]\n\n  (Purpose: To provide an additional condition for the procurement of \n   chemicals for aerial coca fumigation under the Andean Counterdrug \n                              Initiative)\n\n       On page 143, beginning on line 9, strike ``and (3)'' and \n     all that followed through the colon and insert the following: \n     ``(3) effective mechanisms are in place to evaluate claims of \n     local citizens that their health was harmed or their licit \n     agricultural crops were damaged by such aerial coca \n     fumigation, and provide fair compensation for meritorious \n     claims; and (4) within 6 months of the enactment of this \n     provision alternative development programs have been \n     developed, in consultation with communities and local \n     authorities in the departments in which such aerial coca \n     fumigation is planned, and in the areas in which such aerial \n     coca fumigation has been conducted, such programs are being \n     implemented within 6 months of the enactment of this \n     provision:\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his help in \nmaking it possible to get going on this amendment. I rise to offer an \namendment to the foreign operations appropriations bill. I am very \npleased to have as an original cosponsor the distinguished senior \nSenator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone, who has certainly made it his \nbusiness to follow closely our policy in Latin America, in particular \nin Colombia.\n  My amendment is intended to improve the efficacy of U.S. efforts to \neradicate the supply of narcotics that threatens our families and \ncommunities and to ensure that our efforts to address this issue do not \ninadvertently plunge the people of Latin America into a humanitarian \nand economic crisis.\n  The amendment is very simple. It requires that the administration \nhave alternative development plans for a given region in place before \nengaging in aerial fumigation in that area, and it requires that \nalternative development plans are being implemented in areas where \nfumigation has already occurred.\n  This is hardly a radical initiative. I recently received a letter \nfrom the administration responding to some of my inquiries and concerns \nabout our fumigation policy. In the letter, the State Department itself \nnoted that alternative development must work in concert with \neradication and with law enforcement. Unfortunately, though, over the \npast year fumigation has occurred in areas where there are no \nalternative development programs in place at all or in areas where \nalternative development assistance has been exceedingly slow.\n  According to a recent Center for International Policy meeting with \nexperts from southern Colombia, communities that signed pacts agreeing \nto eradicate coca in December and January in Puerto Asis and Santa Ana, \nPutumayo, have not yet received aid. AID as of mid-July states that \nonly 2 out of 29 social pacts signed have received assistance so far. \nThese facts tell us that our policy has to be better coordinated. More \nimportant, they tell us our policy cannot possibly be working.\n  Of course, some people simply disagree with this policy as a whole. I \nhave heard from a number of my constituents who are concerned about \nfumigation in and of itself. They are concerned about the health \neffects of this policy, and they are concerned about whether or not \nlocal communities and authorities have been adequately consulted and \ninformed about their policies.\n  Frankly, I share those concerns. I strongly support the language the \nAppropriations Committee has included conditioning additional funding \nfor fumigation on a determination to be submitted by the Secretary of \nState, after consultation with the Secretary of HHS and the Surgeon \nGeneral, that the chemicals involved do not pose an undue risk to human \nhealth or safety; that fumigation is being carried out according to \nEPA, CDC, and chemical manufacturers' guidelines; and that effective \nmechanisms are in place to evaluate claims of harm from citizens \naffected by fumigation. I believe these provisions are critically \nimportant, and I share the skepticism of many with regard to United \nStates policy in Colombia in general.\n  Nevertheless, like those underlying conditions in this bill, my \namendment does not seek to eliminate fumigation from our policy \ntoolbox. It does seek to ensure that when we use that tool, we use it \nin a rational and effective way. If we keep on fumigating without \nimproving the conditions of coca growers, drug crops will simply shift \nto other locations or spring up again as soon as the fumigation stops. \nIt makes no sense to take away a farmer's livelihood, provide him no \nalternative, and expect him not to plant illicit crops again.\n  Without this amendment, we risk failing in our counternarcotics \nefforts in creating a humanitarian and economic disaster for the people \nof Colombia, one that will doubtless also be costly for the United \nStates in the long run.\n  I also want to point out that my amendment calls for consultation \nwith affected communities and local authorities. Supporting democratic \ngovernance and a strong civil society in Colombia are important United \nStates policy goals. Those aims reflect our clear interest in a stable \nand law-governed Colombia.\n  This is a very modest proposal. It aims to make our policy work \nrationally and in a coordinated fashion. It recognizes that eradication \nwithout alternative development simply makes no sense.\n  It acknowledges the stake of the Colombian people in our policy. So I \nurge my colleagues to support it.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1951, As Modified\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk. This \nmodification changes a typographical error in the original amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 143, beginning on line 9, strike ``and (3)'' and \n     all that follows through the colon and insert the following: \n     ``(3) effective mechanisms are in place to evaluate claims of \n     local citizens that their health was harmed or their licit \n     agricultural crops were damaged by such aerial coca \n     fumigation, and provide fair compensation for meritorious \n     claims; and (4) within 6 months of the enactment of this \n     provision alternative development programs have been \n     developed, in consultation with communities and local \n     authorities in the departments in which such aerial coca \n     fumigation is planned, and in the departments in which such \n     aerial coca fumigation has been conducted, such programs are \n     being implemented within 6 months of the enactment of this \n     provision:''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, did the Senator from Wisconsin wish to say \nsomething further?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to make sure, before we proceed \nwith this amendment, the Senator from Minnesota has an opportunity to \naddress it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I assure the Senator from Wisconsin, and \nothers who will come with other matters, I will turn over the floor in \na few minutes.\n  Sometimes we take these bills and we move them. We do this bill now, \nwe will do that bill now, and it is fairly routine. Even on this bill--\nand I have had the privilege of being either chairman or ranking member \nof this subcommittee for years, handling our foreign aid bill through a \nnumber of different administrations, Republican and Democrat. It occurs \nto me, we have never quite had a time as we do today with this bill. We \nhave never quite had the situation where what happens in other parts of \nthe world might threaten us so directly.\n  Let me tell my colleagues why I say that. It is not a case where we \nhave this threat of an army marching into the United States or a navy \nsailing against us. We are too powerful for that. It is partly because \nof our power and our world status that we have both the good news and \nthe bad news.\n  Our economy is intricately intertwined with the global economy. Our \nhealth depends on our ability and the ability of countries in Africa, \nAsia, and Latin America to control the spread of deadly infectious \ndiseases. Our security is linked to the spread of nuclear, biological, \nand chemical weapons, on our ability to stop terrorism, \nnarcotrafficking, and organized crime. These threats are prevalent from \nas far away as China, to our own cities.\n  Another less defined threat, but potentially the trigger that ignites \nmany others, is poverty. We are surrounded by a sea of desperate \npeople. Two billion people, a third of the world's inhabitants, live on \nthe edge of starvation. They barely survive on whatever scraps they can \nscavenge. Oftentimes one sees children in food dumps scavenging for \nsomething. Many of the children die before they reach the age of 5.\n\n[[Page S10940]]\n\n In some countries, they do not even list their births until they are 4 \nor 5 years old. They wait to see whether the children make it.\n  This grinding, hopeless, desperate existence, something that is \nunimaginable for all of us within this Chamber, it is overladen with \ndespair. That despair fuels hatred, fuels fear and violence. We see it \non so many continents. We see it today in Pakistan, where thousands of \npeople are threatening to overthrow their own government if that \ngovernment gives American troops access to Pakistani territory. We see \nit across Africa, Colombia, and Indonesia. We see it in the form of \nrefugees and people displaced from their homes, and they number in the \ntens of millions.\n  The world is on fire in too many places to count, and in most of \nthose flash points poverty and the injustice that perpetuates it are at \nthe root of that instability.\n  Our foreign assistance programs provide economic support to poor \ncountries, health care to the world's neediest women and children, food \nand shelter to refugees and victims of natural and manmade disasters, \nand technical expertise to promote democracy and free markets and human \nrights and the rule of law. That is the way it should be, when we are \nso blessed in this Nation with such abundance.\n  As important as this aid is, the amount we give is a pittance when \nconsidered in terms of our wealth and the seriousness of the threats we \nface. So many countries give so much more.\n  I can make an argument for the foreign aid bill on national security. \nI can make an argument for this bill because it helps create American \njobs. I can make an argument for this bill because when we eliminate \ndisease, we protect ourselves. The biggest argument I will make for \nthis bill is how can we accept the enormous blessings of this country--\nwe are about 5 percent of the world's population. We are consuming more \nthan half of the world's resources. How can we say we are a moral \npeople if we do not help others?\n  This goes beyond politics. This goes beyond economics. This goes \nbeyond security. It is a matter of morality; morality to shape our \nwhole nation in the helping of others.\n  If somebody came up to us today and said look at this child who is \ngoing to die of malaria; if you would give us 75 cents or a dollar you \nwould save the child, if you knew it was real and you could save the \nchild, of course you would give that. We do not even give that in these \nbills.\n  The approximately $10 billion that we provide in this type of \nassistance, through the State Department or the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development, the contributions to the World Bank, the \nU.N. Development Program, the World Food Program, all of that money \ncomes out to well under a dollar a week from us.\n  The amount that each of us gives does not keep two refugees alive a \nyear. We do not keep up with the number of people living in poverty, \nwhich is rising steadily.\n  I know our economy is suffering and our people are hurting in this \ncountry. As much suffering as we have and as hurting as we are, I can \nshow you places where billions of people would trade places with us in \na heartbeat.\n  We will work to help people in our country, as we should, but let us \nnot bury our heads in the sand. We do not protect our national \ninterests in today's complex and dangerous world on a foreign \nassistance budget that is less in real terms than it was 15 years ago \nwhen I was a junior Senator. Our world is not simply our towns and our \nStates and our country. It is the whole world. We live in a global \neconomy.\n  The Ebola virus is like a terrorist; it is only an airplane flight \naway from our shores. We can try our best to control our borders, but \nwe cannot hide behind an impenetrable wall. We have to go to the source \nof the problem; that is, to countries that are failing from AIDS, from \nignorance, from poverty, and from injustice. We need a better \nunderstanding of the world in which we live.\n  Almost 60 percent of the world's people live in Asia. That number is \ngrowing. Seventy percent of the world's people are nonwhite. Seventy \npercent are non-Christian. About 5 percent, though, own more than half \nof the world's wealth. Half the world's people suffer from \nmalnutrition. Can one imagine what a tragedy it would be if we went \nback to our home States and half of the people of the State were \nmalnourished? Well, half the world's people are.\n  Seventy percent of the people in this world are illiterate. Instead \nof $10 billion to combat poverty, support democracy, promote free \nmarkets, and the rule of law, and aid victims of disaster, we should be \nspending $50 billion.\n  Is it a lot? With a Federal budget of $2 trillion, that depends. We \nare going to spend more than that just to recover from the September 11 \nterrorist attacks. We are going to spend a lot more to conduct a \ncampaign against terrorism, and we must. Maybe if we had spent more \nmoney in the first place on some of these problems we might not have \nfaced a September 11 terrorist attack. We also have to look at other \nglobal problems. Not the problems, thank God, that killed 6,000 \nAmericans in a day, but they have posed immense long-term problems \naffecting our lives.\n\n  Extreme poverty on a massive scale, population growth effects on \ncountries, and the poisoning of our environment are problems we cannot \ncontinue to treat as afterthoughts. We cannot spend so little to combat \nthese threats, anymore than we could justify failing to anticipate the \nattacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. We cannot solve all \nthe problems. Nobody can.\n  Maybe one of the positive things that will come from the time of \nnational soul-searching is to think differently about what the future \nholds in our role in the world. The Senator from Kentucky and I have \ndone our best to respond to these problems, but it is not enough and \nfalls far short. We are not going to do it with a budget that is less \nthan that of a decade ago. Because of that, we fail the American people \nand we fail future generations.\n  We say with pride we are a superpower. And I say that with pride. But \nlet's start acting like a superpower, like the leading democracy of the \nworld. Let's reach deep inside of the best of our country. Then let us \nlead the world in combating poverty and supporting the development of \ndemocracy and preserving what is left of the world's natural \nenvironment. Let's start paying our share. We have a moral \nresponsibility.\n  But even if we are not reaching inside ourselves to answer that moral \ncall, give a pragmatic reason why we should not do our share. We are, \nafter all, the Nation with the very most at stake.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Feingold, with this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to address disturbing developments in our \nantinarcotics efforts in Colombia, and to join Senator Feingold in \ncalling for a shift in our fumigation policy.\n  The motivations behind the Andean Counterdrug Initiative and last \nyear's Plan Colombia are important--stop the flow of illicit drugs into \nthe United States. I, like every other member of this body, am \nextremely concerned about the effects of drug use on our citizens, \nparticularly our children. That said, I am becoming more and more \nconvinced that the plan advanced for combating this problem targets the \nwrong source. What's more, I think that the methodology used is neither \nfair nor effective.\n  I am talking about aerial coca eradication, which has been the focus \nof our efforts in Colombia. Last December, the Colombian military began \na massive fumigation campaign in southern Colombia, with U.S. support. \nUnder the current plan, pilots working for DynCorp, a major U.S. \ngovernment military contractor, spray herbicide on hundreds of \nthousands of acres of Colombian farmland. To date, the provinces of \nPutumayo, Cauca, and Narino have been most affected, but expansion of \nthe program is imminent. I have a number of concerns about this \napproach.\n  First, I have become increasingly convinced that fumigation is an \nextreme, unsustainable policy causing considerable damage. Since the \nfumigation campaign started last December, rivers, homes, farms, and \nrainforests have been fumigated with the herbicide Round-Up. Because\n\n[[Page S10941]]\n\nRound-Up is a ``non-selective'' herbicide, it kills legal food crops \nand the surrounding forest, in addition to coca plants. Furthermore, \nfarmers and their supporters contend that glyphosate is hazardous. I'm \nbeginning to believe they're right.\n  Round-Up is classified by its manufacturer, Monsanto, as ``relatively \nsafe.'' However, the EPA classifies Round-Up as ``most poisonous,'' \nwhile the World Health Organization classifies it as ``extremely \npoisonous.'' Directions on glyphosate products, like Round-Up, warn \nusers not to apply the product in a way that will cause contact with \npeople ``either directly or through drift.'' These instructions and \nwarnings are not being taken into consideration.\n  What's more, according to the Round-Up website, the herbicide is not \nrecommended for aerial application and is not supposed to be applied \nnear or in bodies of water. However, in Colombia, much of the coca \ncultivation takes place alongside rivers and ponds, and these bodies of \nwater are routinely fumigated. A November 2000 report by the American \nBird Conservancy notes that Round-Up is extremely toxic to fish and \nother aquatic organisms.\n  Putumayo, where the spraying has been principally concentrated, \nreports over 4,000 people with skin or gastric disorders, above and \nbeyond normal averages. In January and February alone, over 175,000 \nanimals were killed in that region. All had been sprayed with Round-Up \nand Cosmo Flux, a Colombian-made mix.\n  Mr. President, in light of this mounting evience, I don't believe \nthat we can sit idly by as U.S. taxpayer dollars go toward such a \npolicy. The environmental consequences are serious. The health effects \nare concerning at best, deadly at worst.\n  This is an especially personal issue for me. As the only United \nStates Senator to withstand aerial fumigation, I feel I have a unique \nobligation to address this matter forcefully. When I visited Colombia \nlast year, I was sprayed with glyphosate. At the time, I had little \nidea of the threats that such activity entailed.\n  Families continue to suffer hunger as legal food crops have been \ndestroyed and livestock have been harmed. No emergency aid has been \nprovided, and economic development efforts have yet to be realized. In \nfact, according to a report by Colombian Human Rights Ombudsman Eduardo \nCifuentes, eleven different alternative development projects were \nfumigated during the campaigns. We are undermining our own programs.\n  This brings me to my second point; alternative development aid has \nnot been delivered, even though fumigation has been in place since \nDecember.\n  While fumigation began soon after the passage of Plan Colombia, \nalternative development programs have yet to get off the ground. Last \nJuly, the Center for International Policy held a meeting with experts \nfrom southern Colombia. At that meeting, they reported that those \ncommunities who have signed pacts agreeing to eradicate coca in \nDecember and January have not yet received aid. These communities--like \nPuerto Asis and Santa Ana, both in Putumayo--have expressed their \nwillingness to work on the problem. What have they gotten instead? They \nhave gotten babies with rashes, dead animals, ruined food crops, and \ntainted water.\n\n  In addition, the slowness in aid delivery makes farmers lose further \ntrust in the Colombian government and in eradication. As we all know, \nalternative development takes time to plan and implement. We can expect \nthat USAID will be moving ahead in the future. But it is clear from \nevents in southern Colombia that there was no coordination between \nfumigation efforts and alternative development. A massive fumigation \ncampaign went ahead when development programs were still in the \nplanning stage. This is the height of irresponsibility.\n  How are we going to get Colombian peasants to change their practices \nwithout viable alternatives?\n  Under the current plan, the government of Colombia will give each \nfamily up to $2,000 in subsidies and technical assistance to grow \nsubstitute crops like rice, corn and fruit. We are providing $16 \nmillion specifically for these purposes--a mere 1 percent of the total \nColombian aid package. Many believe this is not enough, with the \naverage coca farmer making about $1,000 a month. Regardless, these \nsubsidies have yet to take effect. We haven't even tried.\n  In the USAID ``Report on Progress Toward Implementing Plan Colombia--\nSupported Activities'' released at the end of last month, these facts \nbecome apparent. Of the more than $40 million obligated under Plan \nColombia for promoting economic and social alternatives to illicit crop \nproduction, a mere $6 million has been spent. Of the 37,000 families \nwho signed ``social pacts'' agreeing to eliminate coca in exchange for \nalternative development programs, only 568 families had received their \nfirst package of assistance.\n  Moreover, fumigation campaigns without alternative development \nthreaten the very goals they claim to support. They fuel a mistrust in \nthe national government, as communities are forced by the campaigns to \nflee their homes and move elsewhere in search of food. Individuals in \nthese areas often turn to the guerrillas or paramilitaries in search of \nsecurity, exacerbating the violent conflict and undermining the rule of \nlaw in the region. An abandonment of the fumigation policy will help to \nstrengthen the relationship between farmers in these areas and the \nnational government, which will help eradication efforts in the long \nterm.\n  A recent study by the conservative think tank, Rand Corporation, \nrightly notes that the aerial fumigation of coca crops is backfiring \npolitically. They say: ``Absent viable economic alternatives [such as \ncrop substitution and infrastructure development], fumigation may \nsimply displace growers to other regions and increase support for the \nguerrillas.''\n  Next, I don't believe that fumigation solves the problem of coca \ncultivation, but simply shifts the problem from one area to another. In \na New York Times interview with Juan de Jesus Cardenas, governor of the \nHuila province, reporter Juan Forero wrote the following: ``the \ngovernor of Huila said regional leaders across the southern area of \nColombia believed that defoliation would simply drive farmers to \ncultivate coca and poppies in other regions. `That is what happened \nwith defoliation of Putumayo, with the movement of displaced people \ninto Narino,' said the governor.'' Likewise, our Ambassador to \nColombia, Mrs. Anne Patterson, has acknowledged that coca had appeared \nfor the first time in the eastern departments of Arauca and Vichada.\n  Fumigation without adequate alternative development programs in place \ncreates a vacuum in the local economy and food supply. This causes coca \ngrowers to flee and move deeper into the agrarian frontier, where they \nreplant coca, often twice as much, as an insurance policy. This causes \ndeforestation and instability among residents indigenous to the new \nareas of production.\n  This has implications not only on ecology, but also on regional \nsecurity. Brazil, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela, have been and \nwill increasingly be affected by massive population flows caused by \naerial eradication. Frankly, I do not want to be responsible for \ncontributing to an already devastating humanitarian catastrophe.\n  Putting aside these concerns, I must ask: ``to date, just how \neffective have our efforts been at eradicating coca?'' Regrettably, the \nanswer is--not very good!\n  Recent estimates by U.S. analysts report that there are now at least \n336,000 acres of coca in Colombia, far higher than earlier estimates. \nThe United Nations, using different methodology, put the amount even \nhigher for last year's major growing season--402,000 acres. Although \nabout 123,000 acres of coca plants have been fumigated under Plan \nColombia, cultivation increased by 11 percent last year. What are we \naccomplishing here?\n  There is a way out. Local governments have pledged to eradicate coca-\nwithout harmful fumigation; I think they deserve a chance.\n  In May, six governors from southern Colombia, the region where most \nof Colombia's coca is grown, presented ``Plan Sur,'' a comprehensive \nstrategy for coca elimination, alternative development, and support for \nthe peace process. The plan opposes fumigation as destructive and \nunnecessary. The governors ask that communities have\n\n[[Page S10942]]\n\nthe chance to manually eradicate their crops, and call for sufficient \nalternative development funding.\n  Twice this year, I have met with these governors, as well as \nrepresentatives from the Colombian House and Senate, and NGO leaders. \nThey are an impressive, courageous group. In their visit to Washington \nin March, four of the governors from southern Colombia, led by Ivan \nGuerrero of Putumayo, denounced fumigation and called for a more humane \nand sustainable approach to coca eradication. Governor Jaramillo \nMartinez of Tolima stated: ``fumigation is not working as expected. It \nis displacing people and continuing to deforest the jungle. We need to \ngive these farmers the opportunity to grow other crops.''\n  I am in full agreement. The present course is not only destructive, \nbut also ineffective.\n  Meanwhile, opposition to fumigation continues to mount. Numerous \nmayors from southern Colombia support the governors in their call to \nchange the policy. And, prompted by these same concerns, other \nprominent officials like Carlos Ossa, the nation's general comptroller, \nhave called for a suspension of spraying. In July, Judge Gilberto Reyes \nordered ``the immediate suspension of the entire fumigation project''; \nit seems he, too, wants definitive answers on the effects of \nglyphosate.\n  However, President Pastrana's government continues to spray large \nswaths of territory. Frankly, the decision to proceed despite \nwidespread opposition was a disappointment. In a country that has \nstruggled to promote democracy and lawfulness, surely this was the \nwrong course of action.\n  Yet I refuse to give up on Colombia and its brave citizenry. I \nbelieve there are many positive steps the United States can take to \nreduce drug production and promote peace and democracy in Colombia and \nthe Andes.\n  I join Senator Feingold in opposing only those parts of this package \nthat damage human rights and the environment--not the bulk of the \nassistance for alternative development, judicial support and \ninterdiction efforts through the police.\n  In concluding, I believe there must be a moratorium on further \nfumigation until alternative development is implemented. I am pleased \nthat my colleague, Senator Leahy saw fit to include language that would \nwithhold funding for aerial fumigation without first determining and \nreporting to Congress on the health and safety effects of the chemicals \nbeing used, and the manner of their application. Our decisions should \nreflect the will of the Colombian people. Colombian governors, \nparliamentarians, mayors, judges, and activists have all called for an \nend to spraying. Too much is riding on our decisions, made so far away.\n  I further believe we should play a more effective role by helping \ncreate genuine economic alternatives for the peasant farmers and others \ninvolved in the Andean drug trade. As the failure of our current policy \nshows, the most that can be expected from the strategy of eradication \nand interdiction is moving the areas of production from one country to \nanother and thereby spreading the problems associated with the drug \nmarket.\n  Finally, we should better combat drug abuse here at home through \nfunding drug treatment and education programs. As long as there is \nconstant demand for cocaine and heroin in our country, peasants in the \nAndes with no viable alternatives will continue to grow coca and \npoppies simply to survive.\n  I will summarize this way. When I look at this Andean Counterdrug \nInitiative and last year's Plan Colombia, I think the intention is \nright on the mark and in good faith: protecting our children and our \ncitizens, from drugs. The methodology is absolutely flawed. We would \nactually be doing a much better job if we focused on the demand for the \ndrugs in our own country.\n  I remember when I met with the Defense Minister in Colombia, Mr. \nRamirez, he said: We export 300 metric tons of cocaine to the United \nStates. As long as we have this demand, we will continue to do it. \nSomeone will do it.\n  There will come a point when we will look at addiction and make sure \nwe cover this and we will get help to people so they get into treatment \nprograms. We will do what we need to do by way of prevention. That will \nbe far more the answer than this effort.\n  I will focus on the fumigation. I have become increasingly \nconvinced--and I think Senator Feingold talked about this--that it is \nan extreme, unsustainable policy which I think causes damage to people. \nThe experts will say that the spraying is classified by Monsanto as \n``relatively safe''. But the EPA calls it ``most poisonous'', and the \nWorld Health Organization classifies it as ``extremely poisonous''. \nTalk to the people living there and listen to them. They are the ones \nsaying they have the rashes, headaches, nausea, and are getting sick.\n  With all due respect, I cannot blame them for being a little \nskeptical about what all these experts tell them. There is some good \nlanguage in this foreign operations bill that Senator Leahy worked on \nsaying we have to do a careful study of the health effects of this, \nwhich I believe is right on the mark. Talk to the Governors of \ndifferent regions. They are worried about what this is doing to them. \nIt is easy for us to say it is not a problem. It is easy for Monsanto \nto say that.\n  I was kidding around with Senator Feingold, and said: I feel like I \nhave some expertise in that I think I am the only U.S. Senator to \nwithstand aerial fumigation. I was sprayed when I was in Colombia--I \ndon't think on purpose. I don't live there. It was just one time, not \nover and over and over again.\n  The second point that this amendment speaks to--and I pressed the \nAmbassador, who I think is very good; we have a very good Ambassador. I \nsaid to her, ``the social development money was supposed to go with \nthis''. Unfortunately, what we are doing, we are also eradicating legal \ncrops. That is part of the problem.\n  The other part of the problem is we are telling campesinos we are \ngoing to do the spraying and eradicate the crops without alternatives \nfor them to put food on the table for themselves and their families. \nThe whole idea was, with the spraying we're going to give campesinos \nthe social development money and the viable alternatives for their \nfamilies. This amendment speaks to that and makes it clear we have to \nsee that social development money on the ground; that is to say, where \npeople live.\n  I join Senator Feingold in this focus on what I call environmental \njustice. We both have tried, to the best of our ability, to raise the \nhuman rights concerns. I did that in an earlier statement today. I will \nnot go over it again.\n  The Leahy language would withhold funding for aerial fumigation \nwithout first determining and reporting to Congress on the health and \nsafety effects of the chemicals being used and the manner of their \napplication. It is important that language be implemented. I say that \non the floor of the Senate.\n  Many Colombian governors, parliamentarians, mayors, judges, and \nactivists have called for an end to the spraying. Between the focus of \nthis amendment, with the Leahy language, the emphasis we have on this \namendment on the alternative economic developments--and again I say one \nmore time, since I have already spoken to the best of my ability on \nhuman rights--it will make a lot more difference when we deal with the \ndemand for it here in our own country. That is what will make a \ndifference.\n  My hope is this amendment will be accepted. I thank the Senator for \nhis effort. I don't want to hold up the progress of the bill. I thank \nSenator Leahy for his statement about this foreign operations \nappropriations bill. I think it was a very important statement. In \nparticular, I say to my colleagues, I think probably people in the \nUnited States of America will no longer be isolationist again. People \nare painfully aware of the interconnections of the world in which we \nlive. Many of these countries are our neighbors whether we want them to \nbe so or not. I think there is much more of a focus on the world. We \nunderstand now that we ignore the world at our own peril.\n\n  This is a good piece of legislation overall. I presented my critique \nof Plan Colombia, and I would like to see some things change. I think \nwe have done our very best through some amendments and speaking out.\n  As long as we are talking about this world in which we live, I want \nto mention, and I will do this in 3 minutes, on September 11--everybody \nhas talked\n\n[[Page S10943]]\n\nabout it--but I have my own framework for thinking about this and I \njust want to mention it.\n  In 1940 and 1941, the Germans engaged in an unprecedented bombing of \ncivilians in Great Britain to weaken civilian opposition to Nazism, and \n20,000 citizens were killed, murdered. On September 11, almost 6,000 \nAmericans, innocent civilians, were murdered. Therefore, I think there \nis absolute moral justification for taking the kind of action we \nbelieve we must take so terrorists don't have free rein, to try to \nprevent this from happening again. That is why I reject the arguments \nabout what were the underlying causes of the hatred or violence.\n  I said to friends, some who make that argument, you never ask me to \ngive a speech about what caused those men to murder Matthew Shepard, a \ngay man in Wyoming. How could they have that hatred? They murdered him. \nMurder is murder. Camus said murder is never legitimate.\n  Here is the question I have. In trying to achieve this goal, I think \nthat force, unfortunately--and for me, the military option, the use of \nforce, is always the last option--is one of the options that is \nnecessary. In the end, I think the question is: Do we make this a \nbetter world, this journey we are taking?\n  I have spoken of humanitarian assistance. But the other point I want \nto make is, over and over again, we should speak on the floor, I \nunderstand that this is easier said than done, but reports of innocent \npeople being murdered in a nursing home or hospital are concerning. I \nhave no reason to believe that those who are carrying out the military \ncampaign are not making every effort to keep this away from innocent \ncivilians. I have no reason to believe that they are not making every \neffort. But I will tell you, we have to be concerned every single time \nour military action, our bombing, leads to the death of an innocent \ncivilian in Afghanistan. These people are not our enemies. Every time \nit happens, even though it is inadvertent, never on purpose, it is a \ncontradiction of the values we live by. It does us no good when it \ncomes to the rest of the Muslim and Islamic world.\n  So I would like to continue to make the appeal that in carrying this \nout with the use of force, the highest priority must be to avoid the \nloss of innocent life in Afghanistan.\n  As President Bush said, these Afghans are among the poorest people in \nthe world. They are not our enemies. The terrorists and those who \nharbor terrorists are our enemies. The Afghans are not our enemies. It \nis a tragedy, and I deeply regret the fact that there are innocent \nAfghans who lost their lives as a result of the bombing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for \nhis tremendous support of this amendment and his knowledge of the \nsubject. I am also hopeful this amendment will be accepted and make it \nall the way through the process. It is extremely modest. I appreciate \nhis help.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1952\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, pursuant to the previous order, I send \nan amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself and \n     Mr. Baucus, proposes an amendment numbered 1952.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide that Members of Congress shall not receive a cost \n          of living adjustment in pay during fiscal year 2002)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following \n     sections:\n\n     SEC.   . COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT FOR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no adjustment \n     shall be made under section 601(a) of the Legislative \n     Reorganization Act of 1946 (2 U.S.C. 31) (relating to cost of \n     living adjustments for Members of Congress) during fiscal \n     year 2002.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, there is a great sense of unity across \nthe Nation as we begin the process of recovering from the events of \nSeptember 11. I have been very heartened by the bipartisanship \ndemonstrated by Congress as it acts to respond to the human and \neconomic devastation. We will need to maintain that unity as we ask for \nthe sacrifices necessary to end this business.\n  Given all that has happened, all that will happen, and the sacrifices \nthat will be asked of all Americans, Congress should not accept a \n$4,900 pay raise. My amendment would stop it.\n  The automatic pay raise is something that I never regarded as \nappropriate. It is an unusual thing for someone to have the power to \nraise their own pay. Few people have that ability. Most of our \nconstituents do not have that power. And that this power is so unusual \nis good reason for the Congress to exercise that power openly, and to \nexercise it subject to regular procedures that include debate, \namendment, and a vote on the record.\n  That is why this process of pay raises without accountability must \nend. The 27th amendment to the Constitution states:\n\n       No law, varying the compensation for the services of the \n     senators and representatives, shall take effect, until an \n     election of representatives shall have intervened.\n\n  A number of my colleagues have approached me about this pay raise in \nthe past few weeks, and many have indicated they support the pay raise. \nIn fact, one of my colleagues said they would offer an amendment that \nactually increased the scheduled $4,900 pay raise because they felt it \nwas too low.\n  While I strongly disagree with that position, I certainly respect \nthose who hold it. But whatever one's position on the pay raise, the \nSenate ought to be on record on the matter if it is to go into effect.\n  The current pay raise system allows a pay raise without any recorded \nvote. Even those who support a pay raise should be willing to insist \nthat Members go on record on this issue.\n  This process of stealth pay raises must end, and I have introduced \nlegislation to stop this practice. But the amendment I offer today does \nnot go that far. All it does is to stop the $4,900 pay raise that is \nscheduled to go into effect in January.\n  We are spending the hard-earned tax dollars of millions of Americans \nto recover from the horrific events of September 11 and to ensure that \nit does not happen again. We have spent all of the on-budget surplus, \nand are well into the surplus that represents Social Security trust \nfund balances. That is something we should do only to meet the most \ncritical national priorities.\n   A $4,900 pay raise for Congress is not a critical national priority.\n  This to me obviously is not the time for Congress to accept a pay \nraise. Let's stop this backdoor pay raise, and then let's enact \nlegislation to end this practice once and for all.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, knowing the Senator from Wisconsin as I do, \nand knowing the seriousness of everything he does legislatively, I want \nthe Record to reflect my personal understanding of why he is offering \nthis amendment and reiterating how strongly he feels about it.\n  Being a member of the Appropriations Committee and having been a \nMember of this body when we had a rule XVI which didn't mean anything--\nyou could add anything you wanted to appropriations bills; you could \nlegislate on them--appropriations bills should be appropriations bills.\n  As a proud member of the Appropriations Committee, I raise a point of \norder against the amendment that the amendment is not germane under \nrule XVI.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Is the Chair \naware of any basis in the bill for the defense of germaneness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is unaware of any defense.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is well taken. The \namendment falls.\n\n[[Page S10944]]\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in light of the Chair's ruling, I want \nto let the body know that this issue is not going away. I understand a \nnumber of my colleagues want a pay raise. While I disagree with that \nsentiment, I certainly respect their right to hold it. I believe at the \nvery least there should be a rollcall vote on this matter itself and \nnot on any procedural approach. I will bring this issue back at every \nreasonable opportunity until I get a roll call on the merits.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1953\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Dodd, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 1953.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1953\n\n     (Purpose: To require a study and report on the feasibility of \n increasing the number of Peace Corps volunteers serving in countries \n                  having a majority Muslim population)\n\n       On page 232, between lines 23 and 24, insert the following:\n\n\n           increased peace corps presence in muslim countries\n\n       Sec. 581.(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September \n     11, 2001, it is more important than ever to foster peaceful \n     relationships with citizens of predominantly Muslim \n     countries.\n       (2) One way to foster understanding between citizens of \n     predominantly Muslim countries and the United States is to \n     send United States citizens to work with citizens of Muslim \n     countries on constructive projects in their home countries.\n       (3) The Peace Corps mission as stated by Congress in the \n     Peace Corps Act is to promote world peace and friendship.\n       (4) Within that mission, the Peace Corps has three goals:\n       (A) To assist the people of interested countries in meeting \n     the need of those countries for trained men and women.\n       (B) To assist in promoting a better understanding of \n     Americans on the part of the peoples served.\n       (C) To assist in promoting a better understanding of other \n     peoples on the part of Americans.\n       (5) The Peace Corps has had significant success in meeting \n     these goals in the countries in which the Peace Corps \n     operates, and has already established mechanisms to put \n     volunteers in place and sustain them abroad.\n       (6) The Peace Corps currently operates in very few \n     predominantly Muslim countries.\n       (7) An increased number of Peace Corps volunteers in Muslim \n     countries would assist in promoting peace and understanding \n     between Americans and Muslims abroad.\n       (b) Study.--The Director of the Peace Corps shall undertake \n     a study to determine--\n       (1) the feasibility of increasing the number of Peace Corps \n     volunteers in countries that have a majority Muslim \n     population;\n       (2) the manner in which the Peace Corps may target the \n     recruitment of Peace Corps volunteers from among United \n     States citizens who have an interest in those countries or \n     who speak Arabic;\n       (3) appropriate mechanisms to ensure the safety of Peace \n     Corps volunteers in countries that have a majority Muslim \n     population; and\n       (4) the estimated increase in funding that will be \n     necessary for the Peace Corps to implement any recommendation \n     resulting from the study of the matters described in \n     paragraphs (1) through (3).\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Director of the Peace Corps shall \n     submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report \n     containing the findings of the study conducted under \n     subsection (b).\n       (d) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``appropriate congressional committees'' \n     means the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and \n     the Committee on International Relations of the House of \n     Representatives.\n\n\n            Vitiation of Vote--Amendments Nos. 1922 and 1923\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the action on \nthe Wellstone amendments numbered 1922 and 1923 be vitiated. These \namendments were modified and accepted as part of the managers' package.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is the Reid for Dodd \namendment No. 1953.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Time has not been divided or anything on that amendment, \nhas it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, it has not.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The reason I ask, Mr. President, is I do not want to cut \ninto anybody else's time. But since I do not see anybody else seeking \nrecognition, I will continue, as I have throughout consideration of \nthis bill, to point out some of the issues we face in our foreign aid \nbill. Maybe one issue is especially good to look at as we look at the \nworld's attention focused on Afghanistan.\n  I was struck by what I heard over and over again from various \nmilitary analysts and others; that is, there are millions of unexploded \nlandmines scattered throughout that mountainous country. It is not \nhyperbole when I say millions of unexploded landmines; there are \nmillions. Most of them are plastic Russian mines--those are probably \nthe most difficult to detect--but some are Chinese mines, some are \nBritish mines, some are Italian mines, and some are American mines.\n  The reason I mention that is, any one of those mines could kill a \nsoldier--ours or theirs--or kill a child. A lot of them are designed to \ninjure a combatant, blow a leg off a soldier, the idea being, if the \nsoldier is not dead, it might tie up three or four of his comrades to \ntake care of him or carry him back to a safe place. But, of course, a \nshiny little mine that might blow a leg off a soldier--it looks like a \nshiny toy to a child--sometimes blows off the hands, arms, or head of a \nchild. In fact, the vast majority of those who will be injured by them \nwill be noncombatants.\n  Because landmines are also weapons of terror, they are routinely used \nto terrorize not combatants but civilian populations. Afghanistan is \nonly one example. There are lots of countries--dozens--that are plagued \nby mines.\n  Landmines maim and kill innocent people every day in the Balkans, in \nSoutheast Asia, Africa, Chechnya, even in Central America. What is as \ntragic is that the killing goes on long after the war that brought the \nmines is over.\n  We usually see the newspaper articles or television specials where \nthe parties come together and they sign the armistice, they sign a \npeace agreement at the end of the war. They say: OK, it is all over. We \nare now friends again, or at least we are noncombatants. They leave. \nThe armies march off, the tanks drive away, and so forth, but the mines \nstay. A child not even born at the time the peace agreement is signed \nis killed when first learning to walk.\n  We have mines and unexploded munitions from the United States in \nVietnam and Laos. They were dropped when I first came to the Senate a \nquarter of a century ago. They are still blowing people up. They are \nstill killing and wounding people in Vietnam and Laos.\n  In Bosnia, most American casualties were from landmines. The same was \ntrue in Somalia.\n  In Afghanistan, we gave mines to the anti-Russian forces, some of \nwhom are now the Taliban. You know the phrase: What goes around comes \naround. We gave the Taliban landmines. We also gave them Stinger \nmissiles. But landmines, think of that; we gave some of the Taliban \nlandmines. When our troops go there--as they already have, according to \nthe press accounts, and we assume will continue to go there--one of the \nbiggest dangers they will face is some of the landmines we left there \nfrom the 1980s.\n\n  We and the rest of the international community are going to be paying \nfor many years to clean up this deadly legacy. The right thing to do is \nto clean it up. In fact, this bill contains $40 million for demining \nprograms and has another $12 million to assist victims of war, \nincluding mine victims.\n  But I think of the $12 million or so that gets spent every year in \nthe Leahy War Victims Fund, and the tens of millions of dollars in \ndemining, and I think, wouldn't it be wonderful if we\n\n[[Page S10945]]\n\ndid not have to spend any of that money because the world stopped the \nindiscriminate use of landmines and we had a chance to clean up what \nwas there.\n  A lot of nations already have stopped using them. Every member of \nNATO, with the exception of one, has agreed to stop using them. \nIronically enough, even though we are spending a lot of money to clean \nup landmines, the one nation in NATO that has not agreed to stop using \nlandmines is the United States.\n  Every nation in the Western Hemisphere has banned the use of \nlandmines except two, the United States and Cuba. Interesting company. \nCuba should ban them; the United States should ban them. Every other \ncountry in our Western Hemisphere has.\n  Two months ago, terrorism was a foreign concept to so many Americans. \nAnthrax was a foreign concept. But it is not any longer. We have \nexperienced the tragedy and fear that people in many countries have \nlived with for years.\n  Fortunately, in our Nation, when it comes to landmines, we have not \nused landmines on American soil since the Civil War. I can't help but \nthink if landmines were used in this country to terrorize Americans, as \nthey are in other countries, then the United States, I am sure, would \nhave joined the 142 other nations in banning their use.\n  Ask people who have served in combat. Most people who actually served \nin combat tell me that mines are more trouble than they are worth, and \nany enemy worth its salt can breach a minefield in a matter of minutes. \nA child cannot; the enemy can.\n  You scatter landmines and then your own troops--who often need to \nmaneuver quickly because sometimes the battlefront moves very quickly--\nrisk triggering their own mines. The battle might be over in a matter \nof hours, but even self-deactivating mines stay longer than that. The \nbattle can ebb and flow very quickly.\n  Unfortunately, the Pentagon has been bogged down in a costly, poorly \ndesigned program to find alternatives to mines. Although it might have \nseemed like a good idea when it was proposed 6 years ago, it has been \nmanaged by people who have no sense of urgency and who never believed \nin the goal anyway. They spent the money, but there is little to show \nfor it.\n  It makes me think of that PBS program, ``Yes, Minister''--a wonderful \nprogram. You had a British minister who, while elected, had the head of \nthe public service for his ministry who did not agree with anything the \nminister wanted to do; but he was so nice.\n  Every time the minister said, we have to go forward with programs \nlike this, that, or the other thing, the head of his civil service \nwould say: Yes, Minister. Of course, Minister. Wonderful idea, \nMinister. We will do it in the fullness of time. And the minister \nfinally realized ``the fullness of time'' was not his lifetime.\n  That is what has happened with those who have been tasked with the \nidea of coming up with this alternative to landmines. They do not \nbelieve in it, so they drag their feet. They know those of us in \nCongress who support it will someday leave; they hope the sooner the \nbetter. Administrations come and go. But the irony is, we do not need \nto even search for alternatives.\n  As many retired and active duty defense officials will say privately, \nwe already have suitable alternative weapons technologies. We have \nsmart weapons. We have sensor technologies that are a lot more cost-\neffective than mines. They are safer for our soldiers, and they don't \nimpede their mobility. I hope that the Pentagon, with all the weapons \nin its arsenal, is not going to add to the millions of landmines \nalready littering Afghanistan.\n  They threaten civilian and humanitarian aid workers. They terrorize \nand kill and maim refugees who are trying to flee. These indiscriminate \nweapons don't belong on today's battlefield no matter who is putting \nthem there, no matter how right they think their cause.\n  The administration is conducting a review of its landmine policy. We \ncan have a mine-free military if we want. Then probably it would not be \nlong before Russia would do the same. Wouldn't it be nice if we could \nsay that in the western hemisphere, where today every country except \nthe United States and Cuba has banned mines, we banned mines as every \nother country except Cuba? Now it is your turn. Wouldn't it be nice \nwhen we sent our Ambassador to NATO not to have to look away when every \nsingle NATO ally tells us they have banned their landmines and we \nhaven't?\n  The Clinton administration took some first steps, but they never \nfully grasped the issue. They didn't understand it. Some did not want \nto. I believe the President did want to but didn't follow through.\n  This administration has an opportunity to design a roadmap to finish \nthe job. It would increase the effectiveness and mobility and the \nsafety of our own troops. This is not something we do just to help \nother countries. It would actually help our own troops. It would take \nWhite House leadership, but it can be done. The White House lead would \nbe strongly supported by the Congress, Republicans and Democrats, \nbecause so many across the political spectrum have already voted to ban \nlandmines.\n  One person in this country has done more than any other to bring to \nthe world's attention the need to ban landmines. That is Bobby Muller, \nthe head of the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation. Bobby Muller is \nknown and admired by so many Senators, particularly those who served in \ncombat. He is perhaps the most visionary, eloquent, dedicated, and \ninspiring person I have met.\n  He enlisted in the Marine Corps. He volunteered to serve in Vietnam. \nHe was paralyzed from the waist down from a gunshot wound. Last weekend \nhe was honored by Hofstra University, his alma mater, with its lifetime \nachievement award.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a Newsday article about this award be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Newsday, Oct. 17, 2001]\n\n                              A Man Reborn\n\n                          (By Marc Siegelaub)\n\n       United States Marine Corps 1st Lt. Robert Olivier Muller \n     will remember the day he died for the rest of his life.\n       On April 29, 1969, the 23-year-old infantry officer was \n     standing at the base of a hill in northernmost South Vietnam, \n     10,000 feet below the demilitarized zone and some 10,000 \n     miles from his home in Great Neck.\n       Lt. Muller was serving in an advisory capacity to 600 South \n     Vietnamese soldiers. They were massing for attack against a \n     handful of dug-in Viet Cong, 15 or so suicidal fanatics \n     bleeding and dazed from the concussive air attacks and \n     ferocious shelling unleashed upon them.\n       With soldierly instincts honed from eight months on active \n     duty in a country ravaged by civil war, Muller sensed a big \n     mismatch: He knew his battalion lacked the stomach to take \n     the high ground from an entrenched enemy force bent on \n     defending its turf to the death. Incensed that 15 Viet Cong \n     could keep his 600-man unit at bay, Muller rallied the outfit \n     into formation behind three U.S. Marine tanks and led them up \n     the rise. Foot by foot, they ascended the hill without a \n     misstep until the bullets started to fly. Instantly, the \n     South Vietnamese scattered, turning Muller into a sitting \n     duck.\n       And that's when it happened. That's when a bullet ripped \n     through Muller's chest, puncturing both lungs and splintering \n     the fifth thoracic vertebrae of his spine before exiting his \n     broken back. That's when this stranger in a strange land \n     collapsed on the dank dirt and closed his eyes in the \n     midafternoon light.\n       Fast forward more than three decades to Hofstra University \n     on Long Island, where homecoming weekend kicks off Friday \n     with a special awards reception. The high point is the honor \n     to be bestowed on one of Hofstra's own for extraordinary \n     lifetime achievement--alumnus of the year.\n       The distinction in 2001 goes to a local boy who never made \n     the top half of his class in law school. ``I was the most \n     average student you could have imagined,'' the recipient says \n     matter-of-factly.\n       But consider that when Kerry Kennedy Cuomo compiled a short \n     list of ``human-rights defenders who are changing our world'' \n     for inclusion in her book, ``Speak Truth to Power,'' this \n     ``most average student'' made it beside such stalwarts as the \n     Dalai Lama and Elie Wiesel. Or when Bruce Springsteen \n     composed ``Born in the U.S.A.,'' his hard-driving tribute to \n     Vietnam veterans, this ``most average student'' served as a \n     good part of his inspiration. Or when the 1997 Nobel Peace \n     Prize was conferred on the International Campaign to Ban \n     Landmines, this ``most average student'' was the co-founder \n     of the movement.\n       Considering all the testimonials heaped on this ``most \n     average student,'' perhaps his greatest act was the act of \n     survival. Hofstra's alumnus of the year, you see, is Robert \n     O. Muller, whose life ended on April\n\n[[Page S10946]]\n\n     29, 1969, in Vietnam, only to be reborn a short time later, \n     crippled from the chest down and altered forever from the \n     neck up.\n       By all accounts, Bobby Muller, now 56, never should have \n     made it to the dawning of a new day, much less to home or to \n     homecoming.\n       ``I was conscious long enough after I got hit to feel the \n     life ebbing out of my body,'' Muller recalled. ``I was on my \n     back, looking at the sky and grabbing my gut. I couldn't feel \n     a thing. My last thought on this earth was I'm dying on \n     this--piece of ground.''\n       Muller lapsed into a coma. Suddenly, a medevac helicopter \n     hovering overhead swooped down, and medical personnel scooped \n     him up and whisked him off. In no time, he was in surgery on \n     a state-of-the-art hospital ship, the U.S.S. Repose. The \n     vessel just happened to be positioned farther north than it \n     had ever been, mere miles from the stricken Marine.\n       ``Despite the instant medevac and great care, it was \n     written on my chart that had I arrived one minute later I \n     would have died,'' said Muller. ``When I came to, there were \n     seven tubes sticking out of me, but I was ecstatic. I \n     couldn't believe my luck--I was alive!''\n       Alive but paralyzed, the doctors told him about his \n     condition. ``Don't worry about it, that's OK. I'll handle \n     it,'' Muller shot back without hesitation. ``The fact that I \n     was permanently disabled. the sorrow of being told that I'd \n     be a paraplegic--a word I never heard before--was so lost in \n     the overwhelming joy of realizing I was going to make it.''\n       The bullet that stuck Muller cut him off from his past in a \n     flash. One second he had the sinewy limbs of a long-distance \n     runner; the next second he was laid out flat, unable even to \n     wiggle his toes.\n       Something else got severed on Muller's tour of duty in \n     Vietnam--his close connection to the country he loved and \n     trusted.\n       He as born in Switzerland at the tail end of World War II, \n     and his family moved to New York City while he was still in \n     diapers. The family later settled in Great Neck. Always on \n     the go, Muller played soccer, ran track and wrestled in high \n     school and college.\n       In 1965, Muller entered Hofstra. The Vietnam War was \n     raging, as were his red-white-and-blue sensibilities. ``I \n     felt it was my duty as a citizen of the greatest country in \n     the world to join the service . . . I never questioned the \n     war or studied the history of Vietnam. I only knew that my \n     government wanted me there to repeal a massive northern \n     communist invasion threatening the freedom -loving people of \n     South Vietnam.''\n       On graduation day in January, 1968, Muller enlisted in the \n     Marines. He underwent 33 weeks of intense training in boot \n     camp and officer's school, after which he was wound as tight \n     as a racehorse at the starting gate. ``I demanded Vietnam, \n     and I demanded front-line infantry.''\n       Muller got his wish in September of 1968, but he never got \n     his bearings abroad. ``The South Vietnamese civilians didn't \n     tell us where the booby traps were or the land mines or the \n     trails and supply caches; they harbored the VC, gave them \n     information and plotted against us. And our military allies \n     were nicknamed `The Roadrunners' for hightailing it at the \n     first sign of danger. What the hell were we doing there?\n       ``I was bitter because I put my allegiance in my \n     government,'' Muller said. ``I did so with the best, most \n     honest intentions, believing I was doing the right thing. I \n     gave my country 100 percent, and they used me as a pawn in a \n     game.\n       ``But I don't feel sorry for myself--I'm here and a lot of \n     my buddies aren't. The real tragedy is that I was totally \n     naive . . . As a college graduate. I was supposed to be \n     educated. I was an idiot. I never asked `Why?' And that is my \n     greatest tragedy--one which was shared by all too many \n     Americans.''\n       I Vietnam was Muller's baptism under fire, where the seeds \n     of activism took root, then his rehabilitation in a Veterans \n     Administration hospital in the Bronx was the detonator that \n     launched him on the path of social resistance.\n       This was the same rodent-infested, broken-down facility \n     featured in a shocking 1970 Life magazine spread ``My closet \n     pal and eight of my friends with spinal-cord injuries \n     committed suicide in the Bronx VA,'' said Muller. ``I was the \n     quadriplegics, multiple amputees, men who could only move \n     their heads. We were entitled to care second to none. I had \n     to fight against that system for reasons of my own \n     survival.''\n       At the ripe young age of 25, Muller ventured into the den \n     of inequity and started his own private war. He showed up in \n     Times Square and blocked traffic on the same afternoon that \n     President Richard Nixon vetoed a veterans' benefits act on \n     the grounds that it was ``fiscally irresponsible and \n     inflationary.''\n       ``I said, `Wait a minute, I was a Marine infantry officer, \n     I called in hundreds of thousands of dollars a day to kill \n     people. I got shot and now I come back and you suddenly tell \n     me it's `fiscally irresponsible and inflationary' to provide \n     critical medical care? I don't think so.''\n       As an activist he was a natural. ``From the moment a TV \n     crew stuck a microphone under his nose, Muller discovered he \n     had a gift for articulating what was on his mind,'' wrote \n     Gerald Nicrosia in ``Home to War,'' a history of the Vietnam \n     veterans' movement.\n       Muller began popping up all over the place-in Hofstra's \n     School of Law, learning how the system works and how to work \n     the system; in Miami Beach, shouting down Nixon during his \n     1972 acceptance speech; in the Academy Award-winning \n     documentary ``Hearts and Minds,'' spitting invectives at how \n     everything went awry in Vietnam; in the vanguard of anti-war \n     protests, riding his photographable wheelchair; in Congress, \n     carrying the burdens of veterans on his broken back.\n       Once again, Muller found himself leading the charge up the \n     hill. He arrived in Washington, D.C., in January 1978, as \n     head of the New York-based Council of Vietnam Veterans. ``I \n     figured if somebody went to Washington and simply told the \n     American people what was going on with Vietnam veterans. . . \n     . a compassionate society would have to respond.''\n       That February, The Washington Post ran an op-ed piece \n     headlined ``Vietnam Veteran Advocate Arrives.'' It was just \n     the beginning of a yearlong editorial campaign undertaken by \n     the Post on behalf of Vietnam vets. ``The New York Times \n     picked it up, and when that happens, you wind up setting a \n     lot of amplification,'' Muller said.\n       Even so, ``not a single thing we were fighting for was \n     enacted into law. That was a lesson: To argue for something \n     simply in terms of justice, fairness, equity doesn't make it \n     in our political process.''\n       So Muller switched gears and went grass roots. ``We \n     traveled into the districts that the members of key \n     congressional committees were elected from, and got into \n     their editorial pages and did their radio talk shows and \n     brought pressure from the people in their districts. And \n     finally we started to get the programs we critically needed \n     and deserved.''\n       In the summer of 1979, Muller co-founded the Vietnam \n     Veterans of America, a national movement designed to give \n     veterans a voice and vehicle to air their grievances and \n     drive their concerns. The political advocacy group would \n     bring about the passage of landmark legislation to treat and \n     compensate victims of Agent Orange and post-traumatic stress \n     disorder, and to secure the right to judicial review of VA \n     decisions.\n       With a measure of progress achieved on the home front, \n     Muller began to cast a wary eye beyond his own borders. In \n     1980, he established the Vietnam Veterans of America \n     Foundation, a nonprofit group that was separate and \n     autonomous from the VVA. Located smack in the lap of \n     government in Washington, D.C.--where Muller still works and \n     resides--the philanthropic organization set out to raise \n     revenue and raise consciousness on mattes of human rights \n     affecting victims of war throughout the world.\n       Muller led the first group of American veterans back to \n     Vietnam in 1981. The historic visit was cathartic: They \n     reconciled with their former adversaries, introduced \n     humanitarian assistance programs and laid the groundwork for \n     future economic and diplomatic detente between the two \n     countries.\n       Several years later, the VVAF brigade visited Cambodia on a \n     fact-finding mission. ``Cambodia changed my life even more \n     than Vietnam did,'' Muller said. ``What took place on the \n     killing fields was genocide. The horror of seeing 10,000 \n     skulls piled up in a ditch and legless kids walking on their \n     hands in the capital city of Phnom Penh was a whole different \n     order of suffering.\n       ``And I learned there were more land mines in Cambodia than \n     there were people, and it was considered proportionally the \n     most disabled society of any country on Earth.''\n       The VVAF launched a new campaign against the hidden scourge \n     of Southeast Asia--lethal underground bombs meant to wreak \n     havoc on innocent men, women and children.\n       ``If you've got a machine gun, a rifle, an artillery piece, \n     a tank, there's a target to fire at and a command-and-control \n     function with directing that fire,'' explained Muller. ``Not \n     so with a land mine. You simply set it, you bury it, you hide \n     it and whoever happens to step on that land mine becomes the \n     victim, long after the other weapons have been put back in \n     the armories.\n       What's more, land mines cause inhuman suffering. ``Step on \n     one, and all this crap--dirt, shrapnel, garbage, clothing--\n     gets blown up your limb. You go through a whole series of \n     operations when you're treated like a piece of salami and \n     keep getting resected and cut down. Guys on the hospital ship \n     would cry out for their mothers when the dressing was changed \n     on their raw wounds,'' said Muller.\n       Beyond the physical pain, psychological torture is \n     inflicted on the peasants who are denied use of the land. \n     ``This stupid $3 weapon winds up being the major \n     destabilizing factor in Third World countries, these \n     agrarian-based societies that are trying to recover,'' Muller \n     said. ``And not just in Cambodia, but in Afghanistan, \n     Kurdistan, Angola, Bosnia, Mozambique.''\n       And so the VVAF established a charitable beachhead on \n     foreign soil, setting up rehabilitation clinics in Cambodia. \n     ``By setting up the clinics to fit amputees with prosthetic \n     limbs and orthotic braces, by supplying wheelchairs free of \n     charge, by initiating programs to employ disabled people, we \n     went through a process of emotionally connecting with an \n     issue that we intellectually understood was devastating.''\n       Muller and the VVAF co-founded the International Campaign \n     to Ban Landmines in 1991, but they needed to recruit a potent \n     political presence to spearhead the effort in Congress. Enter \n     Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont), who controlled the money as \n     chair of the Appropriations Committee on Foreign Operations, \n     and ``who had seen, with\n\n[[Page S10947]]\n\n     his own eyes, what land mines were doing to civilians.''\n       In 1992, Leahy procured a one-year moratorium on the \n     trafficking of anti-personnel land mines. Before the ink was \n     dry, he was back on the Senate floor to draft a three-year \n     extension of the act, and his colleagues passed it \n     unanimously. ``I gotta tell you,'' Muller said admiringly, \n     ``the Senate doesn't vote a hundred to nothing that the moon \n     circles the Earth.''\n       Leahy, in turn, praised Muller for his pivotal role in the \n     campaign. ``Whenever I needed more votes, whenever I asked \n     him to talk to someone, he never failed me,'' Leahy said.\n       Meanwhile, a huge global network of anti-land- mine \n     organizations had begun to germinate, and influential support \n     had started to flourish in high places, most noticeably in \n     the Clinton White House and in the royal realm of Diana, \n     princess of Wales.\n       The bow was about to be tied on a comprehensive pact when \n     the coalition began to unravel. First the United States \n     balked at signing, with President Bill Clinton citing the \n     safety of American troops stationed in South Korea, where the \n     U.S. military had planted anti-personnel mines on the North \n     Korean border. Then the UN failed to reconvene the council on \n     conventional weapons. By September 1996, the landmark treaty \n     was in jeopardy of being shelved.\n       ``But we had a five-term senator go nuts on this issue and \n     drive it,'' Muller said. ``And the foreign minister of \n     Canada, Lloyd Axworthy, with great personal courage, said, \n     `We're going to do something totally different. We're going \n     to set a standard, and we're going to invite anybody who \n     wants to come and sign this treaty to do so in a year.' ''\n       For his part, Muller rounded up a posse of retired military \n     leaders who agreed to put their collective might behind a \n     full-page open letter in The New York Times, urging President \n     Clinton to scrap antipersonnel land mines because ``it was \n     militarily the responsible thing to do.''\n       The signatories included Gen. Norman Schwartzkopf and more \n     than a dozen other retired brass of the first rank.\n       ``Fact is, anti-personnel land mines were the leading cause \n     of our casualties in Vietnam,'' Muller said, ``and they are \n     the leading cause of casualties for our peacekeepers through \n     NATO and the UN,'' not to mention the peril they now pose to \n     our own foot soldiers in Afghanistan.\n       Off the record, officials from the Pentagon told Muller \n     that land mines were ``garbage.'' But if we let you reach \n     into our arsenal and take them out, went their reasoning, \n     then other categories of weapons would be at risk--the domino \n     theory as applied to armaments.\n       On Dec. 3, 1997, Axworthy delivered, as promised, an \n     international agreement involving 122 nations to scrap land \n     mines. But the achievement was muted by the refusal of the \n     U.S. government to put its John Hancock on the document.\n       Muller has no tolerance for hollow victories. Not when some \n     80 million land mines remain buried in the ground; not when \n     the job of providing assistance in all the countries that \n     need to be cleaned up and put back together lies ahead.\n       ``You cannot be looking to stigmatize land mines in the \n     public's thinking if the world's superpower, which has every \n     alternative to meet any possible military requirement, say \n     it's OK to continue to use them,'' Muller said.\n       ``If we allow genocide, if we allow innocent people to be \n     slaughtered on the scale that we're witnessing, it sows the \n     seeds of destruction. And one day that degree of madness is \n     gong to walk up the block and come into your neighborhood.''\n       It already has. Muller's view of the recent carnage in the \n     United States--the main hit taking place just 25 miles from \n     Hofstra--is colored by his frequent treks to ``ground \n     zeroes'' in Third World nations. He has eyeballed the \n     atrocities wrought by land mines. ``A terrorist is a \n     terrorist is a terrorist,'' said Muller.\n       With characteristic energy and purpose, Muller is \n     mobilizing his forces at the VVAF to confront the terrorist \n     threats to domestic safety and security in the wake of Sept. \n     11. The lessons he learned in the land mines campaign apply \n     readily to this grave new world, Muller said. ``Political \n     strength has got to be connected to the righteousness of the \n     argument; multilateral cooperation and agreements have got to \n     be in place; philanthropic funding has got to support global \n     efforts and concerns, and the American people have got to be \n     alert to and engaged in the issues that affect their \n     democratic way of life.''\n       Actually, the VVAF had already been hard at work on ``the \n     Justice Project''--an ambitious undertaking that includes \n     educational outreach programs and curriculum guides on \n     terrorism for schoolchildren.\n       This weekend, at homecoming, Muller will look upon the \n     youthful revelers and wonder who among them will go out and \n     absorb some hard knocks, ask tough questions, learn how and \n     why things happen, search for the plain truth, undergo vital \n     changes, and--as a result--get involved in trying to correct \n     the injustices they uncover.\n       The all-American boy who left the sanctuary of home and \n     Hofstra in 1968 and emerged at the other end of the Earth in \n     a brutal conflict got jolted to the core. ``I'm a better man \n     now than I was before I went to Vietnam,'' Muller said. ``I'm \n     certainly more aware of the sanctity of life.''\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we do good things in this bill to help with \nthe scourge of landmines. We do put in tens of millions of dollars to \nremove landmines. That is a credit to this Nation. It took a lot of \neffort and a lot of fighting, bipartisan efforts on the floor of the \nSenate to get the previous administration to do that and the current \none to continue.\n  We do fund every year the Leahy War Victims Fund. I appreciate the \nhonor of my Republican colleagues, who were the ones who renamed it the \nLeahy War Victims Fund. I appreciate the bipartisan gesture. Frankly, I \nwish we didn't need the fund. I suspect every Senator wishes we didn't. \nThis is money that buys prosthetics for those who have had their arms \nor legs blown off by landmines.\n  My wife, who is a registered nurse, and I have gone to hospitals and \nlandmine sites around the world and seen what good that does. It does \nhelp.\n  I see the Senator from Illinois on the floor. I don't want to take up \nhis time, but I remember very well one day going with our distinguished \nleader Senator Daschle, Senator Dorgan, and our former colleague John \nGlenn to one of these war victims sites, run by the Vietnam Veterans of \nAmerica and others. We saw people getting their first artificial limbs \nsince the Vietnam War. Some were getting their first wheelchairs. It \nwas a hot, muggy day. I was dressed in slacks and an open-neck shirt.\n  There was a man who was able to drag himself on pallet things on the \nground who was finally able to get his first wheelchair. They said, why \ndon't you go over and lift him into the wheelchair. He looked like a \nreally small man. He had no legs. He was probably about my age. He was \njust looking at me stoically, staring at me. I didn't know what to \nexpect, but I went over, picked him up, carried him, and put him in the \nwheelchair.\n  The expression never changed. But as I started to go back, he grabbed \nmy shirt, pulled me down, and kissed me. He didn't speak the language. \nIt was his way of saying thank you.\n  John Glenn, who we know is a wonderful man, certainly not an \nemotional man, also carried somebody to a wheelchair. I remember the \nemotion on his face. He said to us afterward, as we were going back on \nthe bus to Saigon: If anybody on this trip ever complains about \nanything again, I am throwing you out the door of the bus, after what \nwe have just seen.\n  The humanitarian part is good, but the injury is bad. We should ban \nthese landmines. We are not going to do it on this bill. The Senator \nfrom Kentucky has worked with me shoulder to shoulder in getting money \nto remove landmines and for the War Victims Fund. In fact, it was his \namendment I was referring to earlier that I thought was an \nextraordinarily generous act by my Republican colleagues in its \nrenaming. We have done a great deal of good with it.\n  The United States can do a lot more good by just removing the ban on \nlandmines.\n  I have imposed on the time of the Senator from Illinois, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say in response to my friend and \ncolleague and chairman from the State of Vermont, Senator Patrick Leahy \nhas written an amazing record in the Senate. Time after time when I \nwould look for those issues that touched my heart or defined it, Pat \nLeahy had arrived there first a long time ago.\n  On the issue of landmines, a scourge across the world, Pat Leahy was \na leader in the United States in defying his own party's administration \nin begging for the United States to join with other civilized nations \naround the world in banning landmines. The Patrick Leahy War Victims \nFund that is part of this legislation is an effort to say something \nvery simple but very true to the rest of the world; that is, that we \ncare. It is money that is given in the name of a Senator who has proven \nin his decades of public service that he does care.\n  The point I would like to address is part of our debate on this bill. \nI am honored to be part of this committee, to bring this bill forward. \nI am honored to be part of this debate which will result in a vote very \nshortly. I hope we will put this matter in some perspective.\n\n[[Page S10948]]\n\n  My colleague from California, Senator Feinstein, who took the floor \nearly this afternoon, spelled out in some detail the exact dollar \ncommitment being made by the United States in foreign assistance. It is \na substantial sum of money, until you put that sum in comparison to \nexpenditures for many other items. Then you find that it is only a very \nsmall part of our national budget.\n  Senator Feinstein made a point made by others, that if you ask the \naverage person in California or my State of Illinois what percentage of \nthe Federal budget is spent on foreign aid, people guess, oh, 15 \npercent, maybe 10 percent. It couldn't be as low as 5 percent. In fact, \nless than 2 percent of our total budget is spent on foreign aid.\n  America has learned a lot about itself since September 11. We as \npolitical figures have learned a lot about ourselves as well. I believe \nthe President of the United States has done an extraordinary job in \nleading this country. I told him in a chance meeting we had flying out \nto Chicago just a few weeks ago that although I didn't vote for him, I \nwas certainly singing his praises. He said he understood that.\n  I do mean it. I believe he has assembled an excellent team: Secretary \nof State Colin Powell, Vice President Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, Don \nRumsfeld as head of the Department of Defense. What an extraordinary \ngrouping of experience that we bring to one of the most important \nbattles America has ever faced, the war against terrorism.\n  I say in good faith to this administration that I believe it has \nlearned since September 11 that certain things that were assumed before \nare not true today.\n  For example, there were those who criticized Bill Clinton, the former \nPresident, for his personal involvement in the peace process in the \nMiddle East. I think those critics realize today that our President, \nour leaders, have to be involved in Middle East peace. No other country \nis likely to lead those warring factions to the peace table with any \nmeaningful result.\n  I am happy we are continuing to work with the leaders in the Middle \nEast to calm down tensions, to try to find a road to peace in an area \nthat has been wracked with war for almost 60 years. Nation building was \ncriticized in the last campaign as something the United States should \nnot get into, that we should not be worried about building up another \nnation. That is the U.S. role. We know better now. When we finally have \nour hands on Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaida terrorist organization, \nand the Taliban is long gone, you can bet the United States will be in \nthe first row rebuilding the nation of Afghanistan. It will be \ndifficult, but we know it has to be done, so that we can leave behind a \nstable government that can shun terrorism when they try to find refuge \nagain.\n  Of course, in rebuilding that nation of Afghanistan, we will say to \nthe Muslim world that what we told you at the beginning of this \nconflict is true at the end of it: This is not a war against Muslims or \nagainst the Afghan people; this is a war against terrorism and those \nwho harbor them. We will invest in Afghanistan, as we will invest in \nPakistan, to stabilize their leadership and give them an indication of \nthe caring of the United States--not just to prove our virtue but \nbecause it is important for our national interest. A stable world that \ndoesn't fall into war or doesn't harbor terrorism is a better world for \neveryone who lives in America.\n  We have also come to realize, since September 11, that organizations \nsuch as the United Nations are absolutely critical. I have been \nembarrassed in the last several years how in the Senate in particular, \nand in Congress in general, we have really made a mockery of our \ncommitment to the United Nations. Thank goodness those days have ended. \nThe United Nations is important. There are times when the U.N. and the \nSecurity Council infuriate me because they say and stand for things I \ndon't agree with at all. But that is the nature of a true debate. The \nUnited Nations is a gathering place for every country in the world, and \nit is a good place for that debate. It avoids war in many instances.\n  The need for global alliances has become clear. Whether we are \ntalking about tracking down financial transactions, fighting terrorism, \nor putting together a military alliance that will root out terrorism \naround the world, we need allies and friends. The United States cannot, \nwill not, should not go it alone. We have learned that since September \n11. It has been heartening in our grief and sorrow to see so many \nnations around the world who have shared that grief with us and raised \ntheir hands and said, we want to join the United Nations in this fight \nagainst terrorism.\n  So we have learned a great deal about ourselves and our role in the \nworld because of the tragedy of September 11. I think we have to pause \nand reflect and ask whether we are doing enough and whether there is \nmore we should do. I don't believe this Congress has been sparing when \nit comes to any request from this administration to help our military \nor invest in our intelligence. We want to be certain they are the very \nbest. We will not cut back or shortchange the men and women in uniform. \nWe want them to be well equipped, well funded, well prepared so that \nthey can fight these battles successfully and come home safely. I think \nwe have seen that time and again, where both Democrats and Republicans \nhave said that is our goal.\n\n  But I think we also have to concede the fact that in addition to \nsolidarity when it comes to the war effort and intelligence gathering, \nwe should show solidarity as well in this effort that is reflected in \nthis bill on foreign operations because in this bill you will find \nmoney that is being directed to countries around the world to deal with \nsome of the hardships and problems and challenges they face.\n  As you go through this bill, you see it is almost a catalog of the \nproblems facing the world. There is a section in here about the HIV/\nAIDS epidemic in Africa. I went there just last year. It is an \nexperience I will never forget. I really salute Senator Leahy for \nhelping a mutual friend of ours who is running an orphanage for AIDS \nvictims, small children, in Nairobi, Kenya. This Jesuit priest, who is \na mutual friend of ours, is devoting his life to those children. In \nstories such as that, where a small amount of money from the United \nStates is being spent, it is well spent not because it is for a good \npurpose of showing what is in the heart of America, but it is also \nattacking an epidemic which is the scourge of the 21st century.\n  If you were to grade the United States in terms of what we have \nachieved, I think you would have to put us No. 1 in the world when it \ncomes to the military. There is no one who can rival what we can bring \nto a military undertaking, a military enterprise. I think the United \nStates, justifiably, is proud of the men and women in uniform and all \nthose who have supported them, which has led to that great reputation \nwe do deserve.\n  I think if you would grade the United States in terms of other \nforeign operations around the world, we would not be at that high a \nlevel. In fact, many countries give a higher per capita contribution \nthan the United States when it comes to foreign assistance. I want to \nanswer them and say: But when you are in trouble and you need someone \nto come in a hurry with the best military in the world, we are there, \nand it costs a lot of money, and we put the lives of our men and women \non the line.\n  So it is not as if we don't care. We support the world in a different \nway. This bill seeks to reach out beyond the military commitment and \nsay there are other ways we can create support and stability in this \nworld.\n  Just a few weeks ago, Newsweek magazine had a cover story I read \ncarefully and shared with my family and all my friends entitled bluntly \n``Why They Hate Us.'' It tried to spell out in historic terms and \npolitical and economic terms why so many people in the Muslim world \naround this globe have such a low opinion of the United States. Some of \nit is undeserved. What has happened to many people of the Islamic faith \nover centuries that led up to this moment is certainly not of our \ncreation. Yet we are viewed as ``the West'' and ``the enemy,'' as ``the \ninfidels.'' That is a sad commentary.\n  We have to search for ways we can reach those around the world who \nwill listen to the message of for what America really stands. I commend \nto my colleagues two ideas that are not part of this legislation but I \nhope will be part of our thinking in the future. They\n\n[[Page S10949]]\n\ncome from two former colleagues in the Senate. One is a man who is a \nvery close friend of mine--one of my closest--former Senator Paul \nSimon. When he was a Senator from Illinois, he identified an issue that \nI believe is critically important today and will become increasingly \nimportant around the world, particularly in the Islamic world, in the \nnations that are struggling to survive, and that is simply the issue of \nwater, the availability of drinking water. We will find, I am sure, \nthat in the future there will be wars waged over the rights to water as \nmore and more people are born on the Earth and it taxes the resources \navailable.\n  Senator Simon suggested that the United States be a world and global \nleader when it comes to desalinization of ocean water so people can \ndrink it, so that we would provide fresh water, safe water to babies \naround the world--a message the United States could send saying, we \nwill bring our best technology, use it in a humane fashion, and your \nlife and your family will be benefited by it. What a positive message \nthat would be to those who are at least skeptical of us--if not those \nwho despise us--that we are a caring people. I hope the idea of moving \nforward with that initiative is one we might be able to pursue.\n  The second one is one that also was suggested by two former Senators, \nSenators George McGovern and Bob Dole. It was about a year ago that \nSenator McGovern, from a position in Rome, wrote a guest editorial in \nthe Washington Post calling for an international school feeding \nprogram. I think it is one of the best single ideas I have heard. He \nenlisted in support Senator Bob Dole. A Republican and a Democrat came \ntogether with the belief that the largess of America's agricultural \nplenty could be used in schools around the world to feed hungry \nchildren.\n  That not only encourages children to go to school, it particularly \nencourages young girls to go to school. Their families see this as a \nnutritious meal. As we educate these children in foreign lands with the \nbounty God has given us, their education helps them understand better \nthe world in which they live.\n  From what I read about the madaris, the Islamic schools in Pakistan \nwhere children are sent, they do not learn the basics of reading, \nwriting, history, or science, but literally spend every hour of every \nday memorizing every word of the Koran, and after that is done, they \nleave. Meanwhile they are being indoctrinated into political belief. \nThat to me is a terrible waste of a mind and intelligence, to limit \ntheir education to that sole purpose.\n  What Senator McGovern, Senator Dole, and many of us who support them \nbelieve is if we take some of our money and gather with other like-\nminded countries, we can provide a nutritious meal at a school so a \nchild going to that school will know they will not only get a good \nday's education but perhaps the only nutritious meal of the day.\n  We know what is going to happen. The more education we give young \ngirls in Third World countries, the less likely they are to have large \nfamilies, the more likely they are to have self-esteem and to have the \nkind of careers and opportunities and a future which we want for all \nchildren all around the world. Two simple ideas from former Senate \ncolleagues addressing the need for water that is safe and sterile, \naddressing the need for food that is associated with education, so that \nthe United States can continue to deliver the same message that we have \nfor so many years to parts of the world we may have ignored for the \nlast few decades.\n  I sincerely hope this bill receives a resounding bipartisan vote from \nthe Senate because it is part of our strategy to make certain we not \nonly defeat terrorism, but that we replace it with more positive values \naround the world and that we replace it with an image of the United \nStates that is a true image, an image of a caring people that not only \ncares for its own, but cares for many less fortunate around the world.\n  I salute Senator Leahy, and I also salute Senator McConnell and the \nentire committee for their hard work in the preparation of this \nlegislation which I hope will receive a sound bipartisan vote of \nsupport.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I spoke a few weeks ago about my belief that \nthe United States needs to more actively and constructively involve \nitself in educating the citizens of the Muslim world about our culture, \nvalues, and everyday life, and that, likewise, Americans need to become \nbetter educated about Muslim countries and the religion of Islam. As I \nhave stated before, it seems to me that the time has come to be honest \nwith ourselves about why international terrorism has become such a \ngrowing threat. Our citizenry does not understand the Muslim world, and \ncitizens of Muslim countries do not understand us. I believe that if \nboth the East and the West had a true understanding of the similarities \ninherent in our value systems that the world would be a safer place.\n  We need only look into the oppressed faces of the citizens of some of \nthe governments we have supported over the years, despite their less \nthan acceptable treatment of their own citizenry, to see why some of \nthe residents of these countries continue to cling to misguided \nperceptions of America's vision and values. The young people in many of \nthese countries grow up hating their leaders for their oppression and, \nsubsequently, they begin to hate our own country for keeping them in \npower. It is then easy for the likes of the Osama bin Ladens of this \nworld to persuade these young people to become terrorism's footsoldiers \nconvinced that violence is the answer to their grievances.\n  I hope that as we analyze what we need to do to protect our country \nat home, we also examine ways that the United States can play a more \nconstructive role internationally. We need to come to grips with the \nMuslim faith. That doesn't mean trying to keep secular governments in \nplace in countries where the will of the people is otherwise. It means \nbeginning to understand the underlying premises of Islam, and conveying \nour respect for a population's right to practice it. In addition, we \nneed to reach out to individuals in Muslim countries on a one-on-one \nbasis to educate them on what America really stands for. One way to do \nthis is to send our citizens to work with citizens of Muslim countries \non constructive projects in their home countries.\n  This type of mutual understanding is what President Kennedy was \ntrying to accomplish when he created the Peace Corps 40 years ago. The \nPeace Corps mission as stated by Congress in The Peace Corps Act, P.L. \n87-293, is to promote world peace and friendship. Within that mission, \nthe Peace Corps has three goals: to help the people of interested \ncountries in meeting their need for trained men and women; to help \npromote a better understanding of Americans on the part of the peoples \nserved; and to help promote a better understanding of other peoples on \nthe part of Americans.\n  The Peace Corps has had significant success in meeting these goals in \nthe countries in which it operates, and has already established \nmechanisms to put volunteers in place and sustain them abroad. However, \nit has not been as active, in my view, as it could be in Muslim \ncountries where the need for mutual understanding, and basic \ninfrastructure, may be the greatest.\n  It is not an easy task for the Peace Corps to go everywhere, but the \nfocus should be on those areas where the need is the greatest--places \nlike Jordan, Pakistan, Indonesia, Syria, and others. In addition, the \nPeace Corps should take the time to recruit people with the language \nskills, ability, and knowledge of these cultures. Sending civic-minded \nindividuals with these skills as emissaries to Muslim countries could \ndo an awful lot to change some of the anti-American attitudes we see \naround the globe, in my view. The Peace Corps should start \ninvestigating ways to do this now so that in the aftermath of the \nmilitary actions already occurring we will be ready to show a different \nface of our country, one that isn't simply militarily strong, but one \nthat is also willing to learn and willing to help. Yes, we need to act \nin the coming days to address the immediate threats and challenges \nconfronting our nation. But we have to take a long and hard look at \nways, at home and abroad, to make ourselves and the world safer for our \ncitizens and the citizens of this globe.\n  We need to explore ways to reach out to the international community \nand\n\n[[Page S10950]]\n\nrebuild after the military strikes are over. We also need to begin a \nprocess of mutual understanding between the United States and the \nMuslim world. In my view, the Peace Corps is best suited to this \nmission. For that reason, I am introducing an amendment to the foreign \noperations appropriations bill today that directs the Peace Corps to \nundertake a study to examine ways it can better serve Muslim countries \nwhile increasing recruitment efforts of qualified Arab-speaking \nindividuals in the United States. This amendment mandates that the \nPeace Corps deliver a report to Congress 6 months after this \nlegislation is signed into law, and I hope that this report will \nsuggest legislative remedies that will help the Peace Corps undertake \nthis important task.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it had been my intention, along with \nSenator Feinstein, to offer to this bill an amendment relating to the \nPalestinian Liberation Organization's adherence to its 1993 commitments \nto renounce terrorism and violence. The intent of the amendment would \nhave been similar to the provisions of S. 1409, the Middle East Peace \nCompliance Act of 2001, which my friend from California and I offered \nlast month, which today has 31 cosponsors.\n  We are, however, refraining from action at the personal request of \nthe Secretary of State who believes the amendment may adversely impact \nhis ability to form an international coalition against terrorism and \nefforts to bring the peace process in the Middle East back on track.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Secretary relating to \nthis request be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, few would disagree that America's top \nforeign policy today is to search out and destroy terrorist networks \nand prevent further incidents from occurring. Secretary Powell and the \nentire administration obviously have all of our support in this \nendeavor.\n  Perhaps more than any other democracy, Israel knows well the horror \nof terrorism. The extremists who hijacked American commercial aircraft \nand used them as missiles against the World Trade Center and the \nPentagon on September 11 are cut from the very same cloth as the \nsuicide terrorists who slaughter innocent women, children, and men in \nthe Israeli pizza parlors, discos, and buses. The loss of life is no \nless tragic, nor the fear any less real, in incidents that occur in the \nstreets of Manhattan or Jerusalem. Like America, Israel serves as proof \nthat nations founded in freedom and democracy do not crumble when \nattacked by extremists. In fact, the opposite is true. America and \nIsrael have become more united as individual nations and as allies \nagainst a common enemy.\n  The events of September 11 have been seared into America's national \nconscience, just as horrific attacks against civilians in Israel are \nfelt in the hearts and minds of all of its citizens. While terrorism is \na grave threat that both nations face, I ask each of my colleagues to \nconsider the following:\n  The terrorists who carried out the September 11 attacks traveled \nthousands of miles to our shores to commit their evil deeds. In Israel, \nterrorists live within an easy bus ride to Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and \nother major urban areas. Where satellites beamed pictures of \nPalestinian celebrations for the mass murder of Americans into our \nhomes and offices, Israel declared a day of mourning. Israelis need \nonly open their front door to encounter openly offensive, aggressive, \nand hostile behavior; and Israel has demonstrated restraint in its \nresponse to recent attacks against its citizens.\n  When 20 Israeli kids were killed by a suicide bomber earlier this \nsummer in a Tel Aviv disco, there was no massive Israeli retaliation. \nWhen Israelis were killed in a Jerusalem pizza parlor, again, there was \nno massive response. I think we can all now better understand the \nincredible restraint Israel has shown in the face of such attacks.\n  Criticisms over the use of excessive force by Israeli soldiers in \ntargeting and destroying Arab terrorists on the West Bank and in Gaza \nare simply misguided. America is doing similar targeting of terrorist \ncells but on a global scale. Israel's elected leadership, as ours, has \na duty and responsibility to protect its citizens against foreign and \ndomestic threats.\n\n  Let me close with some candid comments. First, I do not believe the \nadministration can make the determination that the PLO or the \nPalestinian Authority have lived up to their 1993 commitments to \nrenounce terrorism. The proof is admitted into hospitals and morgues or \nburied in cemeteries every single day.\n  In attempting to resuscitate the peace process, America must be \ncareful that it plays no role in recognizing or establishing a \nPalestinian state that is rooted in terrorism.\n  Second, I do not believe for one second PLO Chairman Arafat wants to \nend the violence. He allows terrorists to exist on the West Bank and in \nGaza and spurs them into action through newspapers, textbooks, evening \nprayers, and even children's television programs.\n  Finally, America cannot win the war against terrorism without Israel. \nIsrael has the experience, dedication, and freedom that is absolutely \nnecessary to prevail over these fanatics. We must stand arm in arm with \nour ally. We must help Israel in its battle against terrorism.\n  Senator Feinstein and I are not going to offer the amendment we \nplanned to offer because of the extraordinary situation in which we \nfind ourselves and as a result of the direct request of the Secretary \nof State. Having said that, I do not believe the Palestinian Authority \nhas been constructive, nor do I believe they have lived up to their \nagreements signed back in 1993.\n  Shifting for a moment to another ally, if you will, of the United \nStates--if you can call the Palestinian Authority an ally these days--I \nwant to talk for a few moments about Egypt. I had intended to offer an \namendment restricting assistance to Egypt but have been requested by \nthe Secretary of State and the administration to withhold such action, \nagain in light of the events of September 11 and our current efforts to \nrespond to those events.\n  While I continue to have serious concerns with many of Egypt's words \nand deeds toward the Middle East peace process and Israel, and the \ntroubling state of democracy and rule of law in that country, I am \ngoing to honor the administration's request. It is not my intention to \nimpede in any way ongoing efforts to identify, track down, and punish \nthose individuals and groups responsible for the slaughter of American \ncivilians and soldiers.\n  While America finds itself at a critical moment in history, so does \nEgypt. A major recipient of United States assistance to the tune of \nnearly $2 billion, stretching back to 1979, Egypt must today \nunequivocally prove it is a full partner in our war against terrorism. \nIt is not acceptable for President Mubarak and his Foreign Minister to \nobfuscate the assault against freedom with their not-so-hidden agenda \nto propagate Arab hatred against Israel and to muzzle democracy and \ncivil society in Egypt.\n  An October 11 editorial in the Washington Post boldly stated what has \nbeen whispered in the Halls of Congress and in the corridors of the \nState Department. Here is what the editorial said:\n\n       The largest single ``cause'' of Islamic extremism and \n     terrorism is not Israel, nor U.S. policy in Iraq, but the \n     very governments that now purport to support the United \n     States while counseling it to lean on Ariel Sharon and lay \n     off Saddam Hussein.\n       Egypt is a leading example. It is an autocratic regime. It \n     is politically exhausted and morally bankrupt. President \n     Mubarak, who checked Islamic extremists in Egypt only by \n     torture and massacre, has no modern program or vision of \n     progress to offer his people as an alternative to Osama bin \n     Laden's Muslim victimology. . . . It also explains why so \n     many of [bin Laden's] recruits are Egyptian.\n\n  Let me be clear that during these dark and troubling times, Egypt \nshould prove to the people of the United States and all the world's \ndemocracies, including Israel, it is indeed an ally in the fight \nagainst terrorism. The $2 billion question is whether they will succeed \nor fail in this task.\n  Secretary Powell knows that at a more appropriate time I may revisit \nthis important issue. In the meantime, I urge the Egyptian Government \nto advise its ministers and media to be more\n\n[[Page S10951]]\n\nresponsible and constructive and to aggressively encourage its \ncitizenry to understand the grave dangers of legitimizing terrorism \nunder the guise of Islamic teachings and practices.\n  The Egyptian people should understand Americans were horrified and \nangered at news reports of celebrations of the September 11 attacks in \nthe streets of Cairo and elsewhere. Sadly, this may be an indication \nthe Egyptians do not share the same principles of freedom and tolerance \nwe do. If Egypt wants to continue to have United States support, Egypt \nought to earn it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            The Arab Paradox\n\n                       Thursday, October 11, 2001\n\n       ARAB NATIONS, including those considered allies of the \n     United States, have been struggling with their response to \n     the U.S.-led military campaign in Afghanistan. If their \n     contortions were not so familiar they would be hard to \n     understand: After all, Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda \n     organization are sworn enemies of the Egyptian and Saudi \n     governments, which in turn depend on the United States for \n     their security. But it took Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak \n     three days to choke out a statement supporting ``measures \n     taken by the United States to resist terrorism''; and even \n     then he coupled it with a parallel demand that Washington \n     ``take measures to resolve the Palestinian problem.'' \n     Meanwhile, Mr. Mubarak's longtime foreign minister, Amr \n     Moussa, now the secretary general of the Arab League, \n     prompted first Arab states and then the 56-nation Islamic \n     Conference to adopt a resolution yesterday opposing U.S. \n     attacks on any Arab country as part of the anti-terrorism \n     campaign--a position that offers cover to Iraq's Saddam \n     Hussein.\n       In effect, Mr. Mubarak and Mr. Moussa are backing both the \n     military action of the U.S. alliance and the political \n     position of Osama bin Laden, who on Sunday claimed that \n     unjust American policies in Israel and Iraq justified his \n     acts of mass murder. The world, Mr. Moussa said, needs to \n     address the ``causes'' of the terrorism, and he suggested \n     that a United Nations conference might be the best forum. \n     There's little doubt what he has in mind: After all, Mr. \n     Moussa only a couple of months ago led the attempt to hijack \n     the U.N. conference on racism and revive the libel that \n     ``Zionism is racism.''\n       Behind this contradictory rhetoric lies one of the central \n     problems for U.S. policy in the post-Sept. 11 world: The \n     largest single ``cause'' of Islamic extremism and terrorism \n     is not Israel, nor U.S. policy in Iraq, but the very \n     governments that now purport to support the United States \n     while counseling it to lean on Ariel Sharon and lay off \n     Saddam Hussein. Egypt is the leading example. Its autocratic \n     regime, established a half-century ago under the banner of \n     Arab nationalism and socialism, is politically exhausted and \n     morally bankrupt. Mr. Mubarak, who checked Islamic extremists \n     in Egypt only by torture and massacre, has no modern \n     political program or vision of progress to offer his people \n     as an alternative to Osama bin Laden's Muslim victimology. \n     Those Egyptians who have tried to promote such a program, \n     such as the democratic activist Saad Eddin Ibrahim, are \n     unjustly imprisoned. Instead, Mr. Mubarak props himself up \n     with $2 billion a year in U.S. aid, while allowing and even \n     encouraging state-controlled clerics and media to promote the \n     anti-Western, anti-modern and anti-Jewish propaganda of the \n     Islamic extremists. The policy serves his purpose by \n     deflecting popular frustration with the lack of political \n     freedom or economic development in Egypt. It also explains \n     why so many of Osama bin Laden's recruits are Egyptian.\n       For years U.S. and other Western governments have been \n     understanding of Mr. Mubarak and other ``moderate'' Arab \n     leaders. They have to be cautious in helping the United \n     States, it is said, because of the pressures of public \n     opinion--the opinion, that is, that their own policies have \n     been decisive in creating. Though the reasoning is circular, \n     the conclusion has been convenient in sustaining \n     relationships that served U.S. interests, especially during \n     the Cold War. But the Middle East is a region where the \n     already overused notion that Sept. 11 ``changed everything'' \n     may just turn out to be true. If the United States succeeds \n     in making support or opposition to terrorism and Islamic \n     extremism the defining test of international politics, as \n     President Bush has repeatedly promised, then the straddle \n     that the ``moderate'' Arabs have practiced for so long could \n     soon become untenable. Much as it has valued its ties with \n     leaders such as Mr. Mubarak, the Bush administration needs to \n     begin preparing for the possibility that, unless they can \n     embrace new policies that offer greater liberty and hope, \n     they will not survive this war.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                       the Secretary of State,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 21, 2001.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: The President and I are working \n     intensively to build an international anti-terrorism \n     coalition to track down the perpetrators of the September 11 \n     attacks and put an end to their terror networks. The \n     engagement of the broadest possible coalition, including key \n     Arab and Muslim countries, will be critical to the success of \n     our efforts. At the same time, we cannot shrink from our \n     long-standing role in supporting peace efforts between Israel \n     and its neighbors, and will not stop working with the \n     Israelis and Palestinians to end the violence there, \n     implement the Mitchell Committee recommendations, and return \n     to productive negotiations. I need your help on this.\n       The Palestinian compliance legislation you introduced with \n     Senator Feinstein--and which may become an amendment to the \n     Senate Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill--would be \n     counterproductive to our coalition-building and peace process \n     efforts and we would like to see it withdrawn.\n       Imposing sanctions, or even waiving sanctions following a \n     mandatory determination that would have triggered sanctions, \n     would undermine our ability to play a role in defusing the \n     crisis and returning the parties to negotiations. Both sides \n     have undertaken specific commitments to each other. We remain \n     engaged with the Palestinians to ensure that the PLO and PA \n     understand exactly what they have to do to meet their \n     commitments. But requiring the President to make formal \n     determinations of the compliance of only one of the parties \n     would undermine our efforts to put an end to the violence and \n     facilitate a resumption of peace efforts. At the same time, \n     it would bolster segments of Arab public opinion that are \n     already very critical of their regimes' relations with the \n     U.S. and Israel, and their support for Middle East peace. In \n     this regard I also urge you to avoid any actions or \n     statements that single out key Arab allies such as Egypt and \n     Jordan.\n       The bottom line is that we agree with the need for the \n     Palestinians to comply with their commitments and control the \n     violence and to move toward implementation of the Mitchell \n     Committee recommendations. But in this critical period, I \n     urge you not to tie the President's hands and restrict our \n     ability to engage with both parties to help achieve these \n     goals.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Colin L. Powell.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, for almost 20 years, the Government of \nSudan has prosecuted a war of incredible barbarity against its own \npeople, leading to the deaths of over 2 million of its citizens through \nmass starvation, indiscriminate bombing raids, slave raids and other \noutrages.\n  I have made medical missionary trips to Sudan for the past three \nyears and have witnessed firsthand this human tragedy. I have long \nsupported an overhaul of our policy towards Sudan to strengthen and \nexpand humanitarian operations in Sudan and to design a framework to \nassist the Administration and our allies in bringing pressure to bear \non the Government of Sudan and the rebels to resume peace talks.\n  Recently, the Administration has taken significant next steps to \naddress the humanitarian crisis in Sudan. On September 11, the new \nSpecial Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan, Andrew Natsios, along with \nOFDA Director Roger Winter and other Administration officials, visited \nSudan to explore ways to bring added relief to the beleaguered \npopulation.\n  The Nuba Mountains is a region with massive humanitarian needs, where \naccess has been nearly impossible. In an unprecedented action, a \nspecial humanitarian relief flight sponsored by the U.S. and cleared by \nthe Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) and Government of Sudan \ndelivered eight metric tons of wheat to this extremely remote area that \nhad been cut off from international assistance. The immediate needs \nthough are for more than 2,000 tons of food. The Administration is now \nnegotiating expanded delivery of food aid through airdrops to the Nuba \nMountains to be implemented by the World Food Program. These new \ninitiatives will not move forward without additional funding.\n  In order to start and maintain such aid, $35 million would be \nrequired beginning in FY 2002 to fund the Administration's critical new \ninitiatives.\n  These new plans have great potential to move the southern Sudanese in \nthe direction of economic self-sufficiency. For example, to spur \neconomic development, USAID is planning an agricultural initiative to \ncreate more entrepreneurs producing honey, vegetable oils, hides and \nskins, and other agricultural products.\n\n[[Page S10953]]\n\n  Another important part of USAID's Sudan program is education. One of \nthe contributing factors to the instability of Southern Sudan is the \nloss of its educated citizenry. Over two generations of southerners \nhave gone without education since the civil war began in 1955. Civil \ngovernment is dependent upon education. The new education initiatives \nwould help revitalize education and training in southern Sudan through \nteacher training, scholarships, and other important projects.\n  A final aspect of USAID's new initiative focuses on rebuilding \nshattered communities. Through churches and other community groups, the \npeople-to-people reconciliation effort has brought peace among tribes \nin Southern Sudan and border communities between the North and South. \nUSAID's new Sudan initiatives would build upon these efforts by \nidentifying and supporting critical community level rehabilitation \nactivities.\n  These are just a few of the new programs that are critical to \nbringing relief to Sudan, but current funding levels are not sufficient \nto take advantage of them. Therefore, I urge the appropriators to give \nour government the resources to bring real change to one of the most \nwar-torn countries in the world by adding $35 million for new \ninitiatives in Sudan.\n  I thank the managers of the bill, Senators Leahy and McConnell, for \nworking with my colleagues--Senators Brownback, Helms, and Feingold--\nand me to accept our amendment to encourage an additional \nappropriations for humanitarian purposes in Sudan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 1951, as modified, and amendment \nNo. 1953 are agreed to.\n  The amendments (Nos. 1951, as modified, and 1953) were agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to reconsider the votes.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator from Vermont yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that the Senator from Vermont and \nSenator McConnell have worked through most of these amendments. At 20 \nminutes to 5, we have Senator Graham coming to speak for 10 minutes. A \nSenator opposed will have 10 minutes. There will be a vote on his \namendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Or in relation thereto.\n  Mr. REID. Or in relation thereto, that is right. It is my \nunderstanding we made an announcement earlier today--both managers \ndid--that we are moving toward final passage. I hope the two managers \nwill be able to announce prior to 5 if that, in fact, might be the \ncase.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to the Senator from Nevada, there is one other \nissue related to Armenia Azerbaijan on which we are working. We should \nhave a sense in the next 15 to 20 minutes whether we have been able to \nwork that out or not. That may require one additional vote.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the two managers, I think the work today has been \nexemplary. There have been some very difficult issues. They have been \ndiscussed. Agreements have been made on a number of the amendments.\n  Speaking for Senator Daschle, there has been great movement in moving \nan appropriations bill. It should be an example for those who are going \nto follow.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Nevada, we hope he will still \nbe able to say that an hour from now.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I certainly hope it is finished an hour from now.\n  Mr. President, I also say in response to what the Senator from Nevada \nsaid, there has been an enormous amount of cooperation from the Senator \nfrom Kentucky and other Senators from both sides of the aisle, and that \nis what has made it possible for us to complete this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Kansas, we \nare in the process of getting the colloquy copy. The Senator from \nKansas and I have come to talk about some legislation we have done \ntogether that deals with one of the horrible aspects of this global \neconomy; namely, the trafficking of women and girls and sometimes boys \nand men for purposes of forcing them into prostitution and some really \ndeplorable labor conditions.\n  I wonder whether the Senator from Kansas might give us a little bit \nof context, and then we will quickly do this colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, we have a colloquy we are prepared to \nenter into. In the context of this, last year we passed a bill on the \nissue of sex trafficking. It was ground-breaking legislation for this \nbody, ground-breaking legislation for around the world. Its effort and \nfocus was to get at the people who are trafficking, generally, young \nwomen and children for the purposes of prostitution. It is a global \nphenomenon. About 700,000 are trafficked to different places from \ndifferent countries around the world each year, about 50,000 into the \nUnited States.\n  We increased the penalties for people who are involved in \ntrafficking. We have an annual report coming out from the Government--\nthe first one came out this year. It was citing the problems of \ntrafficking taking place. The colloquy we are entering into today is to \nget the initial office up and running at the State Department and \nintends for funding in the foreign operations bill.\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with Senator \nWellstone on the topic of appropriations to combat international \ntrafficking in human beings.\n  I know that Senator Wellstone and other members of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, as well as the Senate Foreign Operations \nAppropriations Subcommittee, are greatly concerned about human \ntrafficking, which impacts approximately 1 million people annually \nworldwide. Last year, this body unanimously passed legislation, the \nTrafficking Victims Protection Act which included an authorization of \nover $30 million from the foreign operations budget to address three \nprinciple components of anti-trafficking: law enforcement, prevention, \nand victim assistance.\n  The bill allocates only $10 million for law enforcement related to \nhuman trafficking, and thus is $20 million shy of the hoped-for \nappropriation of $30 million for Fiscal Year 2002 which was passed by \nthe House. Given this shortfall, I hope that the State Department will \nspend more funds than those earmarked in this foreign operations \nappropriations bill. Furthermore, the Congress expects, as expressed \nthrough the trafficking legislation, that it will be combated worldwide \nthrough both enforcement and prevention programs; that is, sex \ntrafficking could be combated worldwide, and that the trafficking \nvictims would be assisted. Is it your understanding, Senator Wellstone, \nthat the State Department and other relevant agencies and departments \nwould dedicate and spend funds substantially over the $10 million \npresently allocated in this appropriation?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, that is our intention. Human \ntrafficking is a massive and multi-dimensional problem, impacting \ncountless victims. The U.S. government is responding, but I am \nconcerned that our response though well-intentioned, is both under-\nfunded and under-coordinated. I believe that approximately $15 million \nis currently being spent to address human trafficking in the overall \nState Department budget, but it is not at all clear to me that \nactivities are being coordinated among departments and agencies or that \nthe results are being optimized. I believe that the State Department \nshould work this year to dedicate not less than the $30 million \nauthorized in the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, and that this \nfunding would be distributed to all three prongs including law \nenforcement, victims assistance, and trafficking prevention activities.\n  I am very optimistic that the newly established office to combat \ntrafficking\n\n[[Page S10954]]\n\nat the State Department will bring some transparency and coordination \nto these activities. I'm sure that both of us, as well as other \nmembers, will be watching for this to happen.\n  To assist us all in monitoring progress, I will seek to add language \nto the statement of the managers to the conference report asking the \nState Department to report back to us next spring regarding plans and \nfunding allocations for trafficking. Again, this is an important issue \nthat certainly warrants more than $10 million and I believe there are \nample funds in this bill to enable the State Department to meet the \nauthorized levels.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Senator Wellstone, I agree completely. I would like to \nmake one last comment about the fiscal expectations for 2003. We \nunderstand that the trafficking budget for Fiscal Year 2002 is \nunderfunded by at least $20 million in relation to the authorization. \nHowever, once the office is fully up and running next year, I believe \nthat everyone is committed to seeing a full appropriation for Fiscal \nYear 2003 for the activities needed to combat trafficking worldwide. \nThis amount should be not less than $33 million for Fiscal Year 2003, \nin addition to the other amounts authorized under HHS, Labor, and CJS \nappropriations legislation. In closing, we expect a full appropriation \nfor Fiscal Year 2003, without which, worldwide trafficking cannot be \neffectively challenged.\n  Everybody has tried to do everything they could this year to address \nthe trafficking and get the office up and going. It is not a full \nappropriation. Next year, we will push for the full appropriation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1950\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, at 5 o'clock we are going to vote on an \namendment which I have offered, which would restore the 22 percent cut \nthat is contained in the subcommittee report as it relates to the \nAndean Region Initiative. This is funding which would provide for the \nfour countries of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia, with funds \ndivided approximately 50 percent to Colombia and 50 percent to the \nother three; 50 percent of the funds for law enforcement and military \nactivities, 50 percent for economic and social development programs.\n  This is the second chapter of the Plan Colombia which this Congress, \nunder the leadership of President Clinton, adopted last year. It is \nalso the continuation of the only program that we will have left to \nprovide a means by which to suppress the supply of cocaine into the \nUnited States from its primary sources, which are these four countries \nand today primarily Colombia.\n  I have listened to some of the arguments that have been made in \nopposition to this amendment. They raise questions about the \naccountability of this program, raise questions about the efficacy of \nthis program, and raise positive comments about the activities that are \ngoing to be funded with the 22 percent of the fund that is going to be \ntaken away from this account.\n  This is a program which has only been in effect since October 1 of \nlast year, for less than 13 months. I believe it has accomplished \nsignificant good. It has helped professionalize the army of Colombia, \nwhich has made it more able to launch effective attacks against drug \ndealers. It has begun to show the ability to reduce the amount of coca \nbeing produced in Colombia. It has stabilized the governments of, \nparticularly, Peru and Ecuador.\n  But beyond all of those positive benefits, I think the fundamental \nbenefit today, on October 24, is that this is the longest running U.S. \npartnership program to attack terrorism in the world. In this case, the \nterrorists happen to also be drug dealers. We are attacking them in \ntheir uniform as drug dealers, but, in so doing, we are also attacking \nthem in their 50-year role as terrorists, formerly ideological \nterrorists, now essentially thugs. They have gone from Che Guevara to \nbeing Al Capone.\n  I believe it would send the worst possible signal to the world that \nwe are trying to unite in an effective program against terrorism, to be \npulling the plug, essentially, on the effort that we have underway \nagainst one of the most vicious terrorist groups in the world, a group \nwhich in the year 2000, the last year for which statistics are \navailable, committed 44 percent of the all the terrorist assaults \nagainst U.S. citizens and interests in the world.\n  Mr. President, 44 percent of them were committed in Colombia. That is \nan indication of how concentrated, how deep, and how violent the \nterrorist activity is there, directed against U.S. citizens, to say \nnothing of the assaults against Colombian citizens and persons from \nother nations who are in Colombia.\n  I hope to reserve a few moments to close, but I urge in the strongest \nterms the adoption of this amendment which will recommit ourselves to a \nstrong U.S. partnership with our neighbors in Latin America, a strong \nprogram of attacking drugs at the source as we build up our capability \nto reduce the demand in the United States and to avoid sending the \nsignal that all of our rhetoric about how strongly we are prepared to \nresist terrorism is just that--rhetoric. Because when it comes to \nactual performance, we failed.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time remains to the Senator from \nFlorida and how much time to the Senator from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida has 3 minutes and 47 \nseconds and the Senator from Vermont has 8 minutes and 10 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I reserve myself 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  I don't want Senators to think we are not putting money in for \ncounterdrug programs in this bill. We have included $718 million for \nthe Andean Region Initiative. We will have put $2 billion in there in \njust the last 16 months. The administration's own witnesses couldn't \ntell us how much was disbursed, and for what purposes. And they cannot \nshow what we have gotten from it. So we have an act of faith here, \nputting in another $718 million.\n  What the $164 million cut in other programs the Senator from Florida \nproposes, to add to the $718 million already in the bill--where do we \ncut? This is sort an across-the-board kind of open-ended cut which \nallows cuts to come from military, economic, or other assistance to \nanywhere, including countries such as Israel, Egypt, and Jordan.\n  It could be cut from HIV/AIDS, from money the President and others \nhave promised to help combat the worst health crisis in half a \nmillennium; from money to cure TB and prevent malaria; from military \nassistance, including aid to NATO allies and the former Soviet \nrepublics. It could cut the Peace Corps. We increased money for the \nPeace Corps, but those increases may be gone if we do this cut.\n  Or the Eximbank, when many companies are laying people off today.\n  It could cut refugee and disaster relief assistance for places such \nas Sudan and the Caucasus.\n  How about programs to stop the spread of biological, nuclear, and \nchemical weapons? This is certainly not a time when we should be \ncutting those programs; or the money we have in here to strengthen \nsurveillance and respond to outbreaks of infectious diseases, including \ndiseases that may come here in a terrorist attack; or our money for \nUNICEF and peacekeeping operations.\n  Do we really want to cut those programs, when we have already put \n$718 million in for the Andean region?\n  I don't want to cut the Peace Corps. I don't want to cut funding for \nAIDS. But we will if this passes.\n  Obviously, the Senate has to make up its mind about what it wants. \nBut even without this amendment, we are going to have $718 million on \ntop of billions already in this program, a program that has millions of \ndollars which they have yet to spend.\n  I want to help. I set aside my own misgivings about this program by \nputting in the $718 million. But I remind the 81 Senators who have sent \nletters requesting increases in everything from Peace Corps to AIDS \nthat this is where this money would come from.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n\n[[Page S10955]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes, thirty-nine seconds.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, there are obviously choices made all over \nthe place in terms of programs being cut. The point of this is that the \nSenator from Florida and I are proposing that we get back to the level \nthe President suggested. This is about the Andean region. In the past \nwe dealt with Colombia. There were concerns raised by many about that \nprogram. This deals with the Andean region. It is more than just one \ncountry. This is a critical issue. I know our attention today is \nfocused on Central Asia, as it should be, and Afghanistan and the \nTaliban. But we will have to have a continuing effort in other parts of \nthe globe on threats we face.\n  Clearly, we will lose thousands of people every year in this country \nin drug-related deaths, and about 98 percent of the product which is \nthe source of this devastation in our country comes from the Andean \nregion. Our attention today has shifted.\n  All we are suggesting is that we get back to the level the President \nsuggested, $164 million. It is a cut of 22 percent dealing with several \ncountries in the region, not just one. I am sure my friend from Florida \nhas gone over the details of this to explain where the resources go and \nhow effective we hope it will be. I join with him.\n  Obviously, I am not interested in seeing the Peace Corps cut, or \nEximbank, or other programs, which I know my friend from Vermont cares \nabout very much. I understand the difficulty of wrestling with these \nprograms. But I believe very strongly that this is an area where we \nhave to maintain a level of consistent involvement, or we are going to \nfind that the resources we have committed are going to be diluted \nsignificantly.\n  This is a very serious effort. It is not on the front pages today, \nbut it will be again, I guarantee you. That is the reason we offered \nthis amendment. My hope is that we can reach some agreement so we can \ndo more.\n  Again, I believe very strongly that this is one of the most critical \nissues--not just for ourselves. It is in the direct interest of people \nwho are dying every day in our streets as a result of what happened in \nthese countries. Our efforts are to work with friends in the area--\nparticularly in Colombia--people who have paid an awful price over the \nyears, a devastating price. They have attempted to shed this country \ndown there of any vestige of its own long historic democratic \ninstitutions.\n  We are under siege in a lot of places around the globe. This is a \nmajor one. Therefore, the cut that has come here is one we would like \nto see restored. Therefore, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I understand we are going to vote at 5 \no'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator withhold?\n  Does the Senator understand that takes my time?\n  Am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would not cut off the time of the Senator from Florida. \nThat is really not showing very much comity.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, it was certainly not my intention to do \nthat. In fact, I wanted to use the 39 seconds that were left to me. I \nwanted to use them. And there might be a few more people in the Chamber \nthan is the case now. I suggest the absence of a quorum without that \ncounting against the time of either the Senator from Vermont or the \nSenator from Florida.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That would take unanimous consent, and I will not give it. \nWe told people we are going to vote at 5 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand the concerns of the Senator \nfrom Florida, who has spent an enormous amount of time in this area, \nand the Senator from Connecticut. I am sorry the Senator from \nConnecticut would not stay to hear these comments. But we have included \n$718 million for the Andean Regional Initiative. That is for Colombia, \nPeru, Bolivia, and Ecuador--$2 billion in just over a year. We have not \nignored this part of the world.\n  As the Senator from Connecticut says, it may not be on the front \npage. The Ebola plague is not on the front page. But we have inadequate \namounts of money in here to help protect us against such a health \ndisaster.\n  Can you imagine? Nobody would be wanting to cut money for that if the \nEbola plague were in the headlines. But this amendment would result in \na cut of some of that money.\n  We have money in here to help put Americans back to work at a time \nwhen tens of thousands are being laid off daily. It may not be the big \nheadline. But this amendment would in effect cut efforts to put these \npeople back to work.\n  What the Peace Corps has accomplished over the years is not in the \nheadlines. But this money would cut some of the increase in funds we \nput in for the Peace Corps.\n  There are a lot of things that are not in the headlines. Helping to \nstop the spread of AIDS may not be in the daily headlines. But this \nwould cut money for that.\n  This is not about whether you are for or against the Andean \nInitiative. We put nearly three-quarters of a billion dollars in here \nfollowing well over $1 billion in just the past year. It is not without \nfunding.\n  His amendment allow cuts to be made in everything from the Middle \nEast, refugee aid, basic education, biological, nuclear, and chemical \nweapons non-proliferation programs, anti-terrorism programs, and money \nto clear landmines. We need to strike a balance, which is what this \nbill does.\n  What is the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, how much time remains for my colleague \nfrom Florida?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, Senator McConnell and I have gone through \nthis bill and we have tried to set priorities. We have put considerable \namounts of money in this bill for counterdrug programs. The House has \neven more. In conference, as a practical matter, the money for the \nAndean Initiative is likely to go up some amount.\n  But let us not cut money for bioterrorism, money to stop plagues from \nreaching the United States, money to aid refugees from Afghanistan or \nAfrica, money to support the countries which the President has promised \nto help with our campaign against Osama bin Laden--let's not cut those \nfunds--and the Peace Corps and the Exim Bank and everything else, to \nadd even more funds for counterdrug programs when they have not spent \nwhat they already have.\n  Madam President, I yield back whatever time I have left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida has 11 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, in my 11 seconds, I want to direct them \nto our friends on the other side of the aisle. Our amendment would \nrestore the recommendation which has been made by President Bush of his \nbest assessment of what is necessary in order to accomplish the \npurposes. The President challenged us today to answer the question: Is \nAmerica prepared to stay in the war against terrorism? His answer was: \nAbsolutely.\n  If we want to say, absolutely, we need to vote yes for the amendment \nthat will restore the funds to the longest running antiterrorism \ncampaign in which the United States is currently engaged.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I make a point of order that the Graham \namendment No. 1950 violates section 302(f) of the Budget Act.\n  The bill before us is at the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation. \nTherefore, any net increase in budget authority or outlays would \ntrigger a 60-vote point of order.\n\n[[Page S10956]]\n\n  The Graham amendment does not identify a specific offset for its $164 \nmillion increase in discretionary budget authority for the Andean \nCounterdrug Program, nor does it establish a mechanism to ensure that \nthe funds are, in fact, offset. Therefore, if the Graham amendment \npassed, it would cause the Foreign Operations Subcommittee to exceed \nits spending allocation.\n  Additionally, even if the administration were to identify offsets for \nthe entire $164 million in budget authority, the Congressional Budget \nOffice is not confident that cuts would occur to programs with an equal \nor faster outlay rate. A net increase in outlays from the Graham \namendment would also trigger a violation of the subcommittee's \nallocation and a 60-vote point of order.\n  Therefore, I make a point of order that the Graham amendment No. 1950 \nviolates section 302(f) of the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a \ncosponsor to the amendment of the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: Amendment to modify the annual drug certification procedures \n    for FY 2002 with respect to countries in the Western Hemisphere)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill add the following new \n     section:\n       Sec.  . During fiscal year 2002 funds in this Act that \n     would otherwise be withheld from obligation or expenditure \n     under Section 490 with respect to countries in the Western \n     Hemisphere may be obligated or expended provided that--\n       (a) Not later than November 30 of 2001 the President has \n     submitted to the appropriate congressional committees a \n     report identifying each country in the Western Hemisphere \n     determined by the President to be a major drug-transit \n     country or major illicit drug producing country.\n       (b) In each report under subsection (a), the President \n     shall also--\n       (1) designate each country, if any, identified in such \n     report that has failed demonstrably, during the previous 12 \n     months, to make substantial efforts--\n       (A) to adhere to its obligations under international \n     counter narcotics agreements; and\n       (B) to take the counter narcotics measures set forth in \n     section 489(a)(1); and\n       (2) include a justification for each country so designated.\n       (c) Limitation on Assistance for Designated Countries.--In \n     the case of a country identified in a report for a fiscal \n     year 2002 under subsection (a) that is also designated under \n     subsection (b) in the report, United States assistance may be \n     provided under this Act to such country in fiscal year 2002 \n     only if the President determines and reports to the \n     appropriate congressional committees that--\n       (1) provision of such assistance to the country in such \n     fiscal year is vital to the national interests of the United \n     States; or\n       (2) commencing at any time after November 30, 2001, the \n     country has made substantial efforts--\n       (A) to adhere to its obligations under international \n     counternarcotics agreements; and\n       (B) to take the counternarcotics measures set forth in \n     section 489(a)(1).\n       (d) International Counternarcotics Agreement Defined.--In \n     this section, the term ``international counternarcotics \n     agreement'' means--\n       (1) the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic \n     in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances; or\n       (2) any bilateral or multilateral agreement in force \n     between the United States and another country or countries \n     that addresses issues relating to the control of illicit \n     drugs, such as--\n       (A) the production, distribution, and interdiction of \n     illicit drugs,\n       (B) demand reduction,\n       (C) the activities of criminal organizations,\n       (D) international legal cooperation among courts, \n     prosecutors, and law enforcement agencies (including the \n     exchange of information and evidence),\n       (E) the extradition of nationals and individuals involved \n     in drug-related criminal activity,\n       (F) the temporary transfer for prosecution of nationals and \n     individuals involved in drug-related criminal activity,\n       (G) border security,\n       (H) money laundering,\n       (I) illicit firearms trafficking,\n       (J) corruption,\n       (K) control of precursor chemicals,\n       (L) asset forfeiture, and\n       (M) related training and technical assistance;\n\n     and includes, where appropriate, timetables and objective and \n     measurable standards to assess the progress made by \n     participating countries with respect to such issues; and\n       (e) Section 490 (b)-(e) of the Foreign Assistance Act of \n     1961 (22 U.S.C. 2291j) shall not apply during FY 2002 with \n     respect to any\n\n[[Page S10957]]\n\n     country in the Western Hemisphere identified in subsection \n     (a) of this section.\n       (f) Statutory Construction.--Nothing in this section \n     supersedes or modifies the requirement in section 489(a) of \n     the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (with respect to the \n     International Control Strategy Report) for the transmittal of \n     a report not later than March 1 of 2002 under that section.\n       (g) Sense of Congress on Enhanced International Narcotics \n     Control.--\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) many governments are extremely concerned by the \n     national security threat posed by illicit drug production, \n     distribution, and consumption, and crimes related thereto, \n     particularly those in the Western Hemisphere;\n       (2) an enhanced multilateral strategy should be developed \n     among drug producing, transit, and consuming nations designed \n     to improve cooperation with respect to the investigation and \n     prosecution of drug related crimes, and to make available \n     information on effective drug education and drug treatment;\n       (3) the United States should at the earliest feasible date \n     convene a conference of representatives of major illicit drug \n     producing countries, major drug transit countries, and major \n     money laundering countries to present and review country by \n     country drug reduction and prevention strategies relevant to \n     the specific circumstances of each country, and agree to a \n     program and timetable for implementation of such strategies; \n     and\n       (4) not later than one year after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act, the President should transmit to Congress any \n     legislation necessary to implement a proposed multilateral \n     strategy to achieve the goals referred to in paragraph (2), \n     including any amendments to existing law that may be required \n     to implement that strategy.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, on behalf of Senator Hutchison and \nmyself--and I ask my colleague from Texas to make the comments she \nwants to make--this amendment for 1 year would impose a moratorium on \nthe drug certification process only for the Western Hemisphere. \nInterested colleagues--Senator Feinstein, Senator Grassley, and Senator \nHelms--have all indicated they support this amendment. Those are the \nMembers who have the most interest particularly with regard to the \nlarger proposal.\n  We believe this is a very important message to be sending. We know \nour colleagues have a deep interest in it. The administration supports \nthis amendment, and we urge its adoption.\n  As my colleagues know, the issue of how to construct and implement an \neffective international counternarcotics policy has been the subject of \nmuch debate in Congress over the years. Earlier this year, I introduced \nlegislation with the goal of seeing if there is some way to end what \nhas become a stale debate that has not brought us any closer to \nmounting a credible effort to eliminate or contain the international \ndrug mafia.\n  Thanks to the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee we were able to develop an effective alternative to the \ncurrent certification process, and that bill was reported out of the \ncommittee unanimously.\n  We all know that, by and large, the drug cooperation issue has been \nfocused on our relations with Mexico. We know as well that it is a new \nday in United States-Mexico relations. President Fox has been \nenormously supportive of the U.S. across the board. He wants very much \nto work cooperatively with the United States in fighting drugs and \nbelieves that the certification process could get in the way of that \neffort. It is important that we make a change in that process as \nquickly as possible.\n  It is not likely that we will get to the free-standing bill this year \nand therefore I have decided to offer the substance of this bill today \nwith slight changes to conform to the appropriations requirements.\n  First the current certification process will be altered for only \nfiscal year 2002, consistent with the scope of this bill. Second, it \nwill be limited to countries in the Western Hemisphere. Other than \nthose modest changes the thrust of the amendment is virtually identical \nto the committee bill.\n  We can all agree that drugs are a problem--a big problem. We also can \nagree that the international drug trade poses a direct threat to the \nUnited States and to international efforts to promote democracy, \neconomic stability, human rights, and the rule of law throughout the \nworld, and most specifically, in our hemisphere.\n  While the international effects of the drug trade are important, what \nconcerns me the most personally is the effect of the drug trade here at \nhome.\n  Last year, Americans spent more than $60 billion to purchase illegal \ndrugs. Nearly 15 million Americans over the age of 12 use illegal \ndrugs, including 1.5 million cocaine users, 208,000 heroin addicts, and \nmore than 11 million smokers of marijuana. And, the menace of drug \nabuse is not confined to just the inner cities and the poor. Illegal \ndrug use occurs among members of every ethnic and socioeconomic group \nin the United States.\n  The human and economic costs of illegal drug consumption by Americans \nare enormous. More than 16,000 people die annually as a result of drug \ninduced deaths. Drug related illness, death, and crime cost the United \nStates over $100 billion annually, including costs for lost \nproductivity, premature death, and incarceration.\n  The drug trade is extremely lucrative, generating estimated revenues \nof $400 billion annually. The United States has spent more than $30 \nbillion in foreign interdiction and source country counternarcotics \nmeasures since 1981, and despite impressive seizures at the border, on \nthe high seas, and in other countries, foreign drugs are cheaper and \nmore plentiful in the United States today than two decades ago.\n  I believe, and I hope that the Senate agrees, that for a variety of \nreasons the time is right to give the incoming Bush administration some \nflexibility with respect to the annual certification process, so that \nit can determine whether this is the best mechanism for producing the \nkind of international cooperation and partnership that is needed to \ncontain this transnational menace.\n  I believe that government leaders, particularly in this hemisphere, \nhave come to recognize that illegal drug production and consumption are \nincreasingly threats to political stability within their national \nborders. Clearly President Pastrana of Colombia has acknowledged that \nfact and has sought to work very closely with the United States in \nimplementing Plan Colombia. Similarly, President Vicente Fox of Mexico \nhas made international counternarcotics cooperation a high priority \nsince assuming office last December. These leaders also feel strongly, \nhowever, that unilateral efforts by the United States to grade their \ngovernments' performance in this area is a major irritant in the \nbilateral relationship and counterproductive to their efforts to \ninstill a cooperative spirit in their own bureaucracies.\n\n  The legislation I introduced recognizes that illicit drug production, \ndistribution and consumption are national security threats to many \ngovernments around the globe, and especially many of those in our own \nhemisphere, including Mexico, Columbia, and other countries in the \nAndean region. It urges the administration to develop an enhanced \nmultilateral strategy for addressing these threats from both the supply \nand demand side of the equation. It also recommends that the President \nsubmit any legislative changes to existing law which he deems necessary \nin order to implement this international program within 1 year from the \nenactment of this legislation.\n  In order to create the kind of international cooperation and mutual \nrespect that must be present if the Bush administration's effort is to \nproduce results, the bill would also suspend the annual drug \ncertification procedure for a period of 3 years, while efforts are \nongoing to develop and implement this enhanced multilateral strategy. I \nbelieve it is fair to say that while the certification procedure may \nhave had merit when it was enacted into law in 1986, it has now become \na hurdle to furthering bilateral and multilateral cooperation with \nother governments, particularly those in our own hemisphere such as \nMexico and Colombia--governments whose cooperation is critical if we \nare to succeed in stemming the flow of drugs across the borders.\n  Let me make clear, however, that while we would not be ``grading'' \nother governments on whether they have ``cooperated fully'' during the \n3-year ``suspension'' period, the detailed reporting requirements \ncurrently required by law concerning what each government has done to \ncooperate in the areas of eradication, extradition, asset seizure, \nmoney laundering and demand reduction during the previous calendar year \nwill remain in force. We will be fully informed as to whether\n\n[[Page S10958]]\n\ngovernments are falling short of their national and international \nobligations. The annual determination as to which countries are major \nproducers or transit sources of illegal drugs will also continue to be \nrequired by law. The President is also mandated to withhold U.S. \nassistance from any country that has been deemed to have failed to meet \nits international obligations with respect to counter \nnarcotics matters, although he may waive that mandate if he deems it \nwill serve U.S. interests.\n\n  I believe that we need to reach out to other governments who share \nour concerns about the threat that drugs pose to the fabric of their \nsocieties and our own. It is arrogant to assume we are the only nation \nthat cares about such matters. We need to sit down and figure out what \neach of us can do better to make it harder for drug traffickers to ply \ntheir trade. Together, working collectively, we can defeat the \ntraffickers. But if we expend our energies playing the blame game, we \nare certainly not going to effectively address their threat. We are not \ngoing to stop one additional teenager from becoming hooked on drugs, or \none more citizen from being mugged outside his home by some drug crazed \nthief.\n  During the Clinton administration, Barry McCaffrey, the Director of \nthe Office of National Drug Control Policy did a fine job in attempting \nto forge more cooperative relations with Colombia, Mexico, and other \ncountries in our own hemisphere. The OAS has also done some important \nwork over the last several years in putting in place an institutional \nframework for dealing with the complexities of compiling national \nstatistics so that we can better understand what needs to be done. The \nUnited Nations, through its Office for Drug Control and Crime \nPrevention has also made some important contributions in furthering \ninternational cooperation in this area. However, still more needs to be \ndone. I believe my legislation will build upon that progress.\n  It is my hope that a change in the certification process coupled with \nnew administrations in the United States and Mexico provide a window of \nopportunity for the United States working with Mexico to spearhead \ninternational efforts to find better and more effective ways for \nmultilateral cooperation. That is why I hope my colleagues will support \nthis bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be added \nas a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, this is something we must do. We \nhave been working with Mexico on the drug issue for a long time, and we \nwant to put forward a comprehensive program that will be a sharing of \nresponsibility. We will do that, but at this time we do not want the \ndeadline to come on us and not be able to certify Mexico.\n  We are working with Colombia. They are trying very hard to rid \nthemselves of their drug problem. We want to help them, not hurt them.\n  I thank the Senator from Connecticut for taking the lead on this \nissue. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1959.\n  The amendment (No. 1959) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Madam President, HIV/AIDS has become a world-wide \npandemic. More than 16 million people have died of AIDS. The Joint \nUnited Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the World Health \nOrganization, WHO, have estimated that over 32.4 million adults and 1.2 \nmillion children around the world are already living with HIV. Half of \nall people who acquire HIV become infected before they turn 25 and \ntypically die of AIDS before their 35th birthday.\n  The overwhelming majority of people with HIV live in the developing \nworld, and that proportion is likely to grow even further as infection \nrates continue to rise in countries where poverty, poor health systems, \nand limited resources for prevention and care fuel the spread of the \nvirus.\n  Sub-Saharan Africa bears the brunt of HIV and AIDS, with close to 70 \npercent of the global total of HIV-positive people. Over 14 million \nAfricans have already been claimed by the disease, leaving behind \nshattered families and crippled prospects for development. There have \nalso been recent reports of growing problems in China, India, and \nelsewhere. Of course, the United States is not immune to this virus, \nand its spread globally only contributes to risks in America.\n  It is estimated that approximately 90 percent of people in sub-\nSaharan Africa do not know if they are HIV infected or not. They have \nno means of gaining this vital knowledge so that they can protect \nthemselves and others. Thus, testing is a critical aspect of the effort \nto stop the further spread of HIV/AIDS. However, one must be careful \nthat tests are appropriate to the regions where they are used.\n  In developing regions served by USAID, tests should be fast, \naccurate, simple, designed to assist those providing counseling, and \nhave no need for labs or refrigeration. The importance of testing \ncannot be overstated. Early detection of HIV/AIDS might enable \ntreatment to be more effective. We must do all we can to control and \nstop the spread of this dreaded virus, and I urge USAID to seek to \ndevelop rapid tests that serve this purpose.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for bringing up \nthis important issue. I believe that USAID should be committed to \nfurthering the cause of finding a suitable field test for HIV/AIDS. I \nwould expect that of the funds appropriated to USAID, the Agency would \nevaluate potential tests for deployment in sub-Saharan Africa.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I also thank the Senator from Pennsylvania, and agree with \nhim on the importance of testing as an important part of the effort to \nstop the spread of HIV and AIDS. The bill under consideration includes \n$375 million for U.S. Agency for International Development programs to \ncombat HIV/AIDS. It is my belief that a portion of these funds should \nbe committed to the development of rapid tests.\n\n\n                           hacia la seguridad\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I have a question for Senator \nMcConnell, distinguished ranking member of the Foreign Operations \nAppropriations Subcommittee, regarding an important rule of law project \ncurrently underway in the Andean region. The project is the Hacia la \nSeguridad project located in Quito, Ecuador.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will be pleased to answer the Senator's question.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. The mission of the Hacia la Seguridad project is to \nincrease transparency throughout Ecuador's legal system as a means of \npromoting bureaucratic and judicial accountability, effective \ngovernance and law enforcement, and improved access to justice. The \nproject specifically focuses on the identification and elimination of \ninvalid regulations and statutes, the design of modern legal codes, \njudicial monitoring, and public education and support for rule of law \nreform. It is my understanding that the Senator supports this project \nand that it is the intention of the committee that it receive support \nfrom USAID.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. That is correct. The project advances the goals set \nforth in the International Anti-Corruption and Good Governance Act of \n2000 and helps promote stability and democracy in the Andean region \ngenerally. It is the committee's intent that this project receive ESF \nfunding in fiscal year 2002.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Senator for his clarifying statement and \nask that the committee seek Statement of Manager's language directing \nUSAID to fund the project.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will be happy to work with the conferees to try to \ndevelop Statement of Manager's language advising USAID of this project \nand its importance.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto.\n  The amendments (Nos. 1960 through 1965) were agreed to, en bloc.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, there is one more amendment which we \nexpect will be agreed to by voice vote. We have been working on it all \nday. It is about to miraculously appear from back in the Cloakroom. It \nis related to the Armenia-Azerbaijan dispute.\n  I say to my colleagues, we will be able to agree to that shortly, we \nbelieve on a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1921\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 1921.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I want to speak in favor of the \namendment put forward by my colleague from Kentucky. As he mentioned, \nthis is a contentious, difficult issue on which people have been \nworking all day. We have gotten to an agreement of what we think can \nwork.\n  Basically, the issue is trying to prosecute the war on terrorism. I \nthink we have been able to work some issues out to be able to get that \ndone. I am very appreciative of all my colleagues, particularly the \nSenator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, and the Senator from Maryland, \nMr. Sarbanes, and a number of other people for working aggressively on \nit.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter of \nsupport on this issue from the Secretary of State, Colin Powell, and \nask it be printed in the Record along with a letter from three former \nNational Security Advisers to Senator Daschle and Senator Lott in \nsupport of this amendment we are putting forward.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       The Secretary of State,\n\n                                     Washington, October 15, 2001.\n     Hon. Jesse A. Helms,\n     Committee on Foreign Relations,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Helms: The President has asked me to request \n     your support for providing legislative authority that would \n     allow assistance to the Republic of Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan \n     has joined the coalition to combat terrorism and has granted \n     the United States overflight rights, the use of its air \n     bases, and has provided critical intelligence cooperation. \n     Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act of 1992, however, \n     severely constrains our ability to provide most support to \n     the Government of Azerbaijan including assistance needed to \n     support our operations in the ongoing war against terrorism.\n       In addition to purely military matters, no less urgent is \n     our need to engage and assist Azerbaijan's intelligence and \n     law enforcement agencies. It is also imperative that we \n     assist and work with Azerbaijan's financial authorities to \n     track and disrupt assets of the terror network. The \n     campaign's evolution will probably bring other requirements \n     to the fore that we will need flexibility to address.\n       I request your assistance in passing legislation that would \n     provide a national security interest waiver from the \n     restrictions of section 907. Removal of these restrictions \n     will allow the United States to provide necessary military \n     assistance that will enable Azerbaijan to counter terrorist \n     organizations and elements operating within its borders. This \n     type of assistance is a critical element of the United States \n     fight against global terrorism.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Colin L. Powell.\n                                                 October 17, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Minority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Daschle and Senator Lott: Now that the United \n     States has been compelled to undertake a comprehensive world \n     war against terrorism, it is imperative that we ensure that \n     our President benefits from the diplomatic flexibility and \n     military capacities necessary to succeed decisively in this \n     war.\n       The first front of this war is the Caucasus and Central \n     Asia. Fostering and solidifying enduring partnerships with \n     the countries of this region is a strategic and operational \n     imperative.\n       For this reason, we urge you to support the repeal of an \n     archaic sanction against Azerbaijan, a country whose \n     cooperation will be no less vital than any of its neighbors. \n     Azerbaijan was among the first countries to condemn the \n     September 11th attacks. It has offered the United States \n     military overflight rights and the use of its military bases \n     in this war against terrorism.\n       However, Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act prohibits \n     the United States from benefitting from this offer. Unless \n     Section 907 is repealed, our military will not be able to \n     cooperate with Azerbaijan's security forces to create \n     capacities that will increase not only our ability to strike \n     against terrorist targets, but also our ability to provide \n     much needed security and logistical support to U.S. forces \n     operating in that region.\n       There is not a doubt that Azerbaijan is ready and willing \n     to be a full ally in the war against terrorism. Ironically, \n     it is not Azerbaijan's will, but an archaic legislative \n     provision that precludes the United States from accepting \n     Baku's hand of partnership. This is not only a diplomatic \n     loss, it is strike against our men and women in uniform now \n     conducting a military offensive in Afghanistan against Al \n     Qaeda and the Taliban.\n       For these strategic and operational reasons, we urge you to \n     support the repeal of Section 907. Doing so will help to \n     maximize America's ability to wage the war on terrorism.\n           Respectfully,\n     Zbigniew Brzezinski.\n     Brent Scowcroft.\n     Anthony Lake.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I don't know if there is further need for us to debate \non this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kansas for his tenacity in advocating his point of view. He and I \nand the Senator from Maryland have had some great debates on the issue \nof section 907 of the Freedom of Support Act in previous Congresses, \nbut I do believe we have been able to work out an approach that both \nallows the administration to engage with these areas in a way that \nfacilitates the fighting of the war and also preserves section 907 to \nbe dealt with at a later date when the final settlement comes between \nArmenia and Azerbaijan, which will obviously happen on another day. I \nthink this is a compromise that is worthwhile, and I am happy to \nsupport it.\n  I yield the floor. I see Senator Kerry here, the original author of \nsection 907.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I will be very brief. I thank Senator \nSarbanes for his strong commitment to trying to balance this properly \nand for his tenacity through the course of the day. His leadership has \nbeen really superb in helping to try to balance the interests.\n  I thank Senator Brownback for understanding what we have been trying \nto achieve. As the original author of 907, obviously I am sensitive to \nthe change. But I completely understand the circumstances in which we \nfind ourselves. These are changed circumstances. We need to respond, \nand we need to respond thoughtfully.\n  My hope is that the amendment we have put in that was just adopted a\n\n[[Page S10961]]\n\nmoment ago, which Senator McConnell sponsored on our behalf, adequately \nsets forth the balance we are trying to strike so the long-term \ninterests of peace and of the peaceful negotiations, bringing people to \nthe table representing all parties' interests, will be respected.\n  I hope we have achieved that. Obviously, there is more to play out. \nWe will watch this very closely as we go forward.\n  I thank Senator McConnell for his efforts today, and Senator \nSarbanes. Hopefully, the balance we have tried to achieve has been \nachieved.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I am confident if the dispute between \nAzerbaijan and Armenia is not settled on some other day that the \nSenator from Maryland and the Senator from Massachusetts and I will be \nallies in this fight on another day. I think for today we have worked \nout a compromise which is acceptable to the administration and which is \nacceptable to Senator Brownback and is the best we can achieve at the \nmoment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I thank my colleague from \nMassachusetts.\n  There is not a settlement of a longstanding dispute between Armenia \nand Azerbaijan. It is really an attempt for us to be able to work to \ndeal with terrorism and work with the country we need to work with in \nthis case; that is, Azerbaijan.\n  The language is being drafted very carefully so that we can work in \nour best interests in the United States fighting terrorism with the \nassistance of being able to land planes and to house planes, and \npersonnel being treated in hospitals in Azerbaijan, should we need to. \nIndeed, some of that is taking place now. We have tried carefully to \npull that together without touching the issue of peace talks which need \nto proceed. I hope we can get a final settlement of that sometime soon.\n  Do we have time for a vote? If not, we don't need a recorded vote but \na voice, I hope.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nin the second degree, No. 1966.\n  The amendment (No. 1966) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nin the first degree, as amended, No. 1921.\n  The amendment (No. 1921), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1967\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I have one final amendment related to \nthe United States-Armenia relationship that would provide some \nassistance for Armenia. It has been approved on both sides of the \naisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1967.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 152 line 10, after the word ``Appropriations'' and \n     before the period insert the following: ``:Provided further, \n     That of the funds appropriated by this paragraph, not less \n     than $600,000 shall be made available for assistance for \n     Armenia''\n       On page 153 line 7, after the colon insert the following: \n     ``Provided further, That of the funds appropriated by this \n     paragraph, not less than $4,000,000 shall be made available \n     for assistance for Armenia''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no debate, the question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1967) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1968\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, we have another amendment on behalf of \nthe Senator from Oregon, Mr. Smith.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], for Mr. Smith of \n     Oregon, proposes an amendment numbered 1968.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . FEDERAL INVESTIGATION ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2001.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Federal Investigation Enhancement Act of 2001.''\n       (b) Undercover Investigative Practices Conducted by Federal \n     Attorneys.--Section 530 B (a) of title 28, United States \n     Code, is amended by inserting after the first sentence, \n     ``Notwithstanding any provision of State law, including \n     disciplinary rules, statutes, regulations, constitutional \n     provisions, or case law, a Government attorney may, for the \n     purpose of enforcing Federal law, provide legal advice, \n     authorization, concurrence, direction, or supervision on \n     conducting undercover activities, and any attorney employed \n     as an investigator or other law enforcement agent by the \n     Department of Justice who is not authorized to represent the \n     United States in criminal or civil law enforcement litigation \n     or to supervise such proceedings may participate in such \n     activities, even though such activities may require the use \n     of deceit or misrepresentation, where such activities are \n     consistent with Federal law.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1968) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n\n\n                      global environment facility\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I would like to address the chairman of \nthe Subcommittee on Foreign Operations on the subject of the Global \nEnvironment Facility, an organization which for a number of reasons is \nvital to the restoration and preservation of our earth's environment. \nThe GEF channels funding from over 30 nations to help developing \ncountries confront the problems within their borders which affect the \nglobal environment. Traditionally, GEF's focus has been on global \nwarming, biodiversity, international waters, and the ozone layer.\n  Recently, the GEF was given a critical new assignment. It is now the \nfunding mechanism to implement the new international conservation on \npersistent organic pollutants, or POPS, which was signed by the United \nStates and other nations in June. Though long banned in the U.S., these \ntoxic chemicals continue to be used in the developing world. They \ntravel on air and water currents and work their way up the food chain \ninto humans, particularly native populations in northern latitudes like \nAlaska. As the funding mechanism for the POPS convention, GEF will have \na critical role in phasing out their use.\n  I greatly appreciate the efforts of the subcommittee chairman to \nprovide slightly more than the President's request for the GEF this \nyear. However, I had been hopeful that the Congress would be able to \nprovide not only the budget request, but significantly more to pay off \nexisting arrears. In June I joined Senators Chafee, Biden, Bingaman, \nCollins, Jeffords, Lieberman, Lugar, Murray, and Snowe in writing to \nthe subcommittee leadership urging the payment of a substantial amount \nof our arrears.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I appreciate the support of the Senator from Massachusetts \nfor our proposed increase over the President's budget request for the \nGEF. I agree that this is a vital organization. GEF's work gets at many \nof the international environmental problems which simply cannot be \nfixed by the U.S. or any nation acting alone, such as global warming.\n  Poor nations which struggle to feed and clothe their people simply do \nnot have the resources to devote to global environmental problems. Yet \nif we do not have a unified global approach to these problems, we have \nlittle hope of addressing them effectively. The GEF funds worthy \nprojects in 160 countries.\n\n[[Page S10962]]\n\n  Unfortunately, the United States has lagged behind in meeting our \nobligations to the GEF. Since 1994, twice the U.S. has pledged $107.5 \nmillion a year to GEF. We are now in the final year of the second \nreplenishment, and our total arrears stand at $203.9 million. Our \nrecommended appropriation this year will make only a small dent in that \nfigure, but at least will not add to them.\n  Mr. KERRY. I have been a part of international environmental \ndiscussions for a decade, and attended talks not only in Kyoto but also \nin Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires and The Hague. During this time, I have \nwatched tensions grow between the developed and developing world, which \nincreasingly views Western efforts to convince them to adopt strict \nenvironmental standards as an effort to hold them down economically. \nThis concern is an important factor in the dispute over a new round of \nworld trade negotiations. Cooperative efforts between developed nations \nand the developing world through organizations like the Global \nEnvironmental Facility can bridge this distrust.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I agree with the Senator. I am pleased that the Senate is \nrecommending a considerably higher appropriation than the House for the \nGEF, and I intend to work diligently to persuade the House to agree to \nour GEF number in conference. We must get back on track and pay our \narrears to the GEF.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chairman. This year's appropriations debate \ncoincides with new discussions among GEF members for a new \nreplenishment, one which must for the first time accommodate the new \nresponsibility for implementing POPS. Hence it's critical that the U.S. \nsend a strong statement that we remain committed to meeting our \nobligations to the GEF.\n\n\n             american companies doing business in Colombia\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, we often hear from American companies \nwhose investments in developing countries have gone sour. That is the \nrisk of doing business, and nobody disputes that. But international \narbitration was created in order to mitigate the risks of overseas \ninvestments and to avoid depending on shaky legal institutions in those \ncountries. Arbitration has been one of the principal building blocks to \nthe extraordinary growth in international trade. It has brought \ninvestments to countries which would have otherwise been considered too \nrisky because it gives investors and sovereign nations an agreed-upon \nmechanism to resolve disputes. Key to its success is the agreement by \nall parties that arbitration can only work if it is binding.\n  It recently came to Senator McConnell's and my attention that at \nleast two American companies, Sithe and Nortel, have participated in \nbinding arbitration to resolve disputes with the Colombian Government. \nAccording to information we have received, Sithe and perhaps Nortel, we \nare told, companies from Mexico and Germany, have won awards through \nbinding arbitration, only to have the Colombian Government renege on \nits commitment to honor the arbitration decision.\n  We have not had an opportunity to discuss these matters with the \nColombian Government, but if our information is correct, that American \ncompanies have agreed to binding arbitration and prevailed, only to \nhave the Colombian Government refuse to pay, that is unacceptable. We \nwant to help Colombia's economy develop in an environment where the \nrule of law is respected. This is crucial to Colombia's future. If \nColombia flaunts the rules of the private market, it will have \nincreasing difficulty attracting private investment because it cannot \nbe trusted.\n  Representatives of these companies have urged us to withhold a \nportion of U.S. assistance to Colombia until the Colombian Government \nfulfills its legal obligations to these companies. We considered \noffering such an amendment, because of the importance we give to the \nfair treatment of American companies, respect for the rule of law, and \nthe international arbitration process. I ask unanimous consent that a \ncopy of our proposed amendment be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  We decided not to offer the amendment, because of the precedent it \ncould set. But we want to emphasize that respecting binding, \ninternationally, sanctioned arbitration is essential to the investment \nthat will ultimately be the engine for Colombia's economic development. \nNo amount of foreign assistance can do that. The pattern of Colombia's \napparent abuse of the international arbitration process is very \ndisturbing, and by conveying our concern about it we mean to strongly \nencourage the Colombian Government to act expeditiously to resolve \nthese matters.\n  I know that both Senator McConnell and I will be following this issue \nclosely, and discussing it with the Colombian Ambassador, the American \nAmbassador to Colombia, and the Department of State, in the coming \nmonths.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me just add a word or two to Senator Leahy's \ncomments. Few would disagree that Colombia's long term political and \neconomic development resides in its ability to forge a lasting peace, \nestablish the rule of law, and attract foreign investment. No service \nis done to the nation or the people of Colombia when the Colombian \ngovernment refuses to recognize the legitimacy of an arbitration award \nto international businesses. The leadership in Bogota should understand \nthat such action further erodes confidence in the overall investment \nclimate in Colombia within the international business community--and in \nforeign capitals. It is my hope that the Colombian government takes \nnote of the amendment Senator Leahy and I contemplated offering and \ninitiates corrective action in the very near future.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, as the Senate considers the Foreign \nOperations Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2002, I would like to \ntake this opportunity to discuss discrepancies between the House and \nSenate versions regarding funding for the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia (FRY).\n  I have strong reservations about certain language included by the \nHouse Appropriations Committee in its report accompanying H.R. 2506. In \nits report, the House Committee recommends $145 million in funding for \nthe FRY, of which $60 million is to be provided to Montenegro. I \nsupport at least $145 million for the FRY, which is the amount \nrequested by the President. However, if the House funding level stands \nfor Montenegro, with a population of just 600,000 people, which is one-\nthirteenth the size of Serbia, it would receive more than 40 percent of \nthe total assistance package for the FRY.\n  I do not believe Montenegro could constructively absorb this much \nassistance, and I am concerned about the impact such a division of \nassistance for the FRY would have on U.S. assistance to Serbia. In my \nconversations with State Department officials, they also expressed \nstrong reservations about providing $60 million to Montenegro, as they \nbelieve it is more than Montenegro can effectively absorb. The State \nDepartment believes Montenegro should not receive more than the $45 \nmillion recommended by the Senate, and in fact, they believe that $35-\n40 million would be an appropriate amount.\n  Given disturbing reports of official corruption that have surfaced \nregarding illicit activity in Montenegro, it is particularly important \nthat we are able to fully account for the expenditure of U.S. \nassistance there. Moreover, if the House recommendation of $60 million \nprevails, U.S. assistance for the Republic of Serbia could fall to $85 \nmillion, which is significantly below the $100 million we provided to \nSerbia in fiscal year 2001.\n  As my colleagues are aware, significant changes have taken place in \nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia during the past twelve months. On \nFriday October 5, 2001, marked the one-year anniversary of the fall of \nthe Milosevic regime and the beginning of a new, democratic government. \nSince then, the new leaders have made significant strides in \nimplementing political and economic reforms. While there is still much \nwork to be done, it is critical that we recognize the important \nprogress that has been made in the past year. A cut in funding for \nSerbia would send precisely the wrong message. We want to support the \nSerb reformers, who took the courageous step of arresting and \ntransferring Slobodan Milosevic to The Hague. We want to encourage \ntheir continued cooperation with the War Crimes Tribunal, as well\n\n[[Page S10963]]\n\nas other democratic reforms and respect for the rule of law.\n  When the conference committee meets to reconcile the House and Senate \nversions of the foreign operations bill for fiscal year 2002, I urge \nthe Senate conferees to support the funding levels for Serbia and \nMontenegro that are recommended in the Senate bill.\n  I would appreciate knowing if the chairman and ranking member of the \nForeign Operations Subcommittee agree with me about this.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, for far too long, corruption has been \nallowed to run rampant in Southeastern Europe. Recent events have \nhighlighted the citizens of Montenegro as being among the most \nbeleaguered by the corruption of its government.\n  Montenegro is the beneficiary of a proud, freedom loving people \ncourageously standing against the tyranny of Slobodan Milosevic. \nHowever, they have not been well served by their government, whose \nactions have undercut United States assistance to Montenegro.\n  For example, the President of Montenegro purchases two luxury \naircrafts, during the Kosovo Crisis! Costing 26 to 30 million dollars \nor more, one plane was a Lear Jet, and the other a Cessna Citation X. \nPresident Djukanovic has been flown in these planes at the very same \ntime the taxpayers of the United States were making emergency cash \npayments to help the Montenegrin Government pay its pensions and energy \nbills.\n  The $26 million spent on aircraft would have averted electricity \npower shortages in Montenegro. These purchases, by the way, were not \nreported to the United States Government, the Montenegrin Parliament \nwhich is now investigating this matter, or, the citizens of Montenegro.\n  It is now clear that the Government of Montenegro was keeping two \nbudgets: one facilitated the flow of international assistance; the \nsecond apparently served the personal interests of senior government \nofficials.\n  Since actions speak louder than words, it is obvious that a premium \nwas placed on personal comfort of senior officials over legal reforms \nessential to rebuilding the Montengrin economy.\n  Last year the United States earmarked $89 million in foreign \nassistance for fiscal year 2001 for Montenegro; plans are to dedicate \nabout half that much in fiscal year 2002.\n  Let me be clear, United States assistance must never be permitted to \nbe a free ride for such officials. The citizens of Montenegro fought \nMilosevic to the very end. Now develops that, during that time, they, \nand the United States, were cheated by the government in Podgorica.\n  The people deserve a responsible governing body that puts foreign \nassistance into its economy not the pockets of corrupt officials. The \nUnited States deserves assurance that United States assistance dollars \nare used for their intended purpose.\n  Not one red cent should go to the government of Montenegro unless and \nuntil these planes have been fully accounted for--and sold. In \naddition, United States assistance to the Montenegrin government should \nbe firmly conditioned upon tangible progress toward rooting out \ncorruption and reintroducing the rule of law.\n  The people of Montenegro deserve far better than they have received \nfrom their government and their President Djukanovic.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friends from Ohio and North Carolina for \nbringing to the attention of the Senate the important issue of \nassistance to Serbia and Montenegro. The short answer to Senator \nVoinovich's inquiry is that Senator Leahy and I strongly support the \nfunding levels for Serbia and Montenegro that are recommended by the \nSenate Appropriations Committee, and that will be our position in the \nConference.\n  Those of us who closely follow developments in the Balkans appreciate \nthe many challenges that reformers in Serbia and Montenegro face each \nday, and we note the progress that has been made in the past year \nalone. As Senators Voinovich and Helms have stated, many challenges lie \nahead, including the need to address the troubling and complex issues \nof corruption and legal reform. I think we all agree that America must \nbe clear in our support of these reform efforts. Senator Leahy and I \nbelieve that the carefully drafted provisions in our bill, and the \nfunding levels we recommend, do just that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank my friends for their comments. This is an issue of \ngreat importance to the Senate. In crafting this bill, Senator \nMcConnell and I had three principal objectives with respect to the FRY. \nFirst, we want to send a message to Serb reformers that we strongly \nsupport their efforts. We recommend $115 million for Serbia in fiscal \nyear 2002, a $15 million increase in United States assistance above \nlast year. We have also provided authority for debt relief for Serbia. \nWe were told by Serb finance officials and our Treasury Department that \nthis is a top priority if Serbia is to attract new foreign investment, \nwhich is the key to Serbia's future economic development.\n  Second, we want to make clear that we expect to see continued \ncooperation with the War Crimes Tribunal and respect for the rule of \nlaw. While we fully appreciate the courage of Serb officials in \narresting and transferring Milosevic to The Hague in April, since then \nwe have seen little in the way of cooperation with the Tribunal. We are \nalso disappointed that political prisoners continue to languish in Serb \njails, even though Serb officials have acknowledged that they should be \nreleased. We therefore include language similar to last year, that \nlinks our assistance to continued progress in these areas.\n  Finally, with respect to Montenegro, we want to provide sufficient \nassistance to convey our strong support for Montenegro, and at the same \ntime ensure a proper balance within the $115 million available for the \nFRY. Montenegro is making impressive strides in reforming its economy, \nand we should support that. The reports of corruption are disturbing, \nand we need to ensure that our assistance is not misused. \nUnfortunately, corruption is a region-wide phenomenon, and we have \nemphasized to USAID and the State Department that combating corruption \nshould be a key component of our assistance relationship. Corruption \ncorrodes democracy, and the new leaders of Montenegro and Serbia, and \nindeed throughout the former Yugoslavia, will pay a heavy price in the \nlong run if they ignore it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I rise to offer for the Record the \nBudget Committee's official scoring for H.R. 2506, the Foreign \nOperations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act \nfor Fiscal Year 2002.\n  The Senate bill provides $15.524 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority, which will result in new outlays in 2002 of $5.580 billion. \nWhen outlays from prior-year budget authority are taken into account, \ndiscretionary, outlays for the Senate bill total $15.149 billion in \n2002. The Senate bill is at its Section 302(b) allocation for both \nbudget authority and outlays. Once again, the committee has met its \ntarget without the use of any emergency designations.\n  We have begun the 2002 fiscal year without the Congress completing a \nsingle appropriations bill. While extraordinary events have contributed \ngreatly to this late start, it is time that the Congress complete its \nwork. Earlier this month, the President reached agreement with Senate \nand House appropriators on a revised budget for 2002. The Congress must \nnow expeditiously provide funding that complies with that bipartisan \nagreement.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that a table diplaying the budget \ncommittee scoring of this bill be inserted in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  H.R. 2506, FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING, AND RELATED PROGRAMS\n   APPROPRIATION ACT, 2002, SPENDING COMPARISONS--SENATE REPORTED BILL\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     General\n                                     purpose     Mandatory      Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget Authority...............       15,524           45       15,569\n  Outlays........................       15,149           45       15,194\nSenate 302(b) allocation: \\1\\\n  Budget Authority...............       15,524           45       15,569\n  Outlays........................       15,149           45       15,194\nHouse-passed:\n  Budget Authority...............       15,167           45       15,212\n  Outlays........................       15,080           45       15,125\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority...............       15,169           45       15,214\n  Outlays........................       15,081           45       15,126\n \nSENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation: \\1\\\n  Budget Authority...............            0            0            0\n  Outlays........................            0            0            0\nHouse-passed:\n  Budget Authority...............          357            0          357\n\n[[Page S10964]]\n\n \n  Outlays........................           69            0           69\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority...............          355            0          355\n  Outlays........................           68            0           68\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ For enforcement purposes, the budget committee compares the Senate-\n  reported bill to the Senate 302(b) allocation.\n \nNotes.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding. Totals adjusted\n  for consistency with scorekeeping conventions.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I want to take a moment to speak briefly \nabout two interconnected issues--the destruction of the world's few \nremaining tropical forests, and the pressures of population growth, \npoverty, and development that is causing it.\n  The world's few remaining tropical forests, which are located in \nIndonesia, Central Africa, and parts of South America, are being cut \ndown at a staggering rate. Whether it is local farmers scratching out a \nliving by slash and burn agriculture, or multinational timber or mining \ncompanies, experts predict that these irreplaceable ecosystems will be \ncompletely gone in 15 to 20 years.\n  The forests are not just trees. They are the habitat for the majority \nof the Earth's endangered species, from great apes to insects, many of \nwhich we have yet to identify. They are also the source of many of the \nlife-saving drugs that are sold in America's pharmacies today, and who \nknows how many future cures wait to be discovered from rainforest \nplants.\n  They are home to the few remaining groups of indigenous people who \ncontinue to live in much the same way as they have for centuries, \nthreatening no one.\n  Development is widely regarded as synonymous with progress. That is \nwhy the United States Agency for International Development has its \nname. But it would be unforgivable if a decade or two from now the few \nremaining virgin tropical forests were gone. It is not simply a matter \nof planting new trees. They are a complex web of species.\n  There are many private homes in Washington, DC that are worth more \nthan what it would cost to protect hundreds of thousands of acres of \nvirgin rainforest in some African countries. Yet we have difficulty \nfinding a few million dollars to do that.\n  Even worse, the United States is a major consumer of timber stolen \nfrom the forests of Indonesia, Africa and South America. According to a \nrecent report, the U.S. imported over $300 million in illegal timber \nfrom Indonesia alone last year.\n  The international trade in illegal timber is out of control. It is \nrampant. It is accelerating, and it is driven by greed, an insatiable \ndemand, corruption, and the lack of effective strategies and resources \nto address it. This bill contains funds to increase our efforts, but I \nwould be the first to say is not enough.\n\n  There are two ways to protect these forests, and both are essential. \nOne is law enforcement. Many countries, like Indonesia and Brazil have \nenvironmental laws, but they are routinely violated, including by those \nwho are responsible for enforcing them.\n  In Indonesia, the military is deeply involved in the illegal timber \ntrade, and I encouraged the White House to discuss this with President \nMegawati when she was in Washington recently.\n  The same is true in Cambodia and the so-called ``Democratic'' \nRepublic of the Congo. The military trades protection for illegal \nloggers in exchange for a slice of the profits. So cracking down on \nthis corruption is essential.\n  What also must be done is to provide the people who live in the \nforests alternative sources of income and access to family planning to \nreduce population pressures on these fragile ecosystems.\n  As it is, they have no other way to survive except by cutting the \ntrees for fuel or timber and killing the animals for bush meat, which \nhas become a high priced delicacy.\n  Once the forests are gone, they will have to abandon their homes, \njoining the throngs of other impoverished people migrating to urban \nslums--without housing, without jobs, without health care, without \nhope.\n  On the other hand, if they are made to understand that the forest and \nthe animals can be a continuing source of tourist income, then they \nbecome the protectors of the forests.\n  We want USAID to expand its support for organizations and individuals \nwho have devoted their lives to protecting endangered species and the \ntropical forests where they live.\n  In some countries, like Brazil, some of the most courageous advocates \nfor the environment have been murdered, presumably by the mining and \ntimber interests.\n  There is still time to stop this, but only if we make it a priority. \nWe have to, because ten years from now will be too late.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, as the Senate considers the Foreign \nOperations Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2002, I would like to \ntake a few minutes to address U.S. assistance to the Federal Republic \nof Yugoslavia.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, I have taken a strong interest in \nissues affecting Southeast Europe during my time in the Senate. I have \nmade many trips to the region, most recently in December of 2000 with \nmy friend from Pennsylvania Senator Arlen Specter, and I continue to \nmeet with the region's political, spiritual and community leaders both \nin the United States and during time abroad.\n  I have long recognized the destabilizing influence that men such as \nSlobodan Milosevic have had on the region and the broader European \ncommunity. The international community witnessed the devastating \ninfluence of this so-called leader during years of violent conflict in \nthe former Yugoslavia, and we continue to see evidence of its affects \nin Kosovo and other parts of the region.\n  While the Balkans have not been without recent challenges, as \ndemonstrated by the situation in Macedonia and continued violence and \ndestruction in Kosovo and parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina, significant \nchanges have taken place in this part of the world during the past year \nand a half. The death of Franjo Tudjman in Croatia in December of 1999 \nand the ouster of the Milosevic regime in October of 2000 have removed \nmajor obstacles to positive change in the region.\n  One year ago this month, I watched with tremendous gratification when \nthe people of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia went to the polls, and \nthen to the streets, to demonstrate their support of democracy and \ntheir denouncement of Milosevic.\n  Since my days as mayor of Cleveland and Governor of the State of \nOhio, I have been an ardent supporter of democratic reformers in \nSerbia. I have long admired the courage and determination of many \nindividuals who remained focused on a democratic future for Serbia, \nwhatever the odds, such as members of the OTPOR student movement.\n  When I met with a group of these young leaders following the election \nof President Vojislav Kostunica and the removal of Milosevic from \npower, they told me that the feat we witnessed last October would not \nhave been possible without the support and influence of the United \nStates.\n  Just a few weeks ago in my office in the Hart building, I met with \none of the founders of the OPTOR student movement, who is now a member \nof the Serbian Parliament. Once focused on removing Milosevic from \npower, he is now intent on helping the government to strength its \ndemocratic institutions so that the FRY may better position itself \namong Europe's new democracies. Without a doubt, the Federal Republic \nof Yugoslavia is a different place today than it was one year ago.\n  When the Senate considered the foreign operations bill last year, we \nconditioned U.S. assistance to Serbia after March 31, 2001 on three \nconditions. In order to receive continued non-humanitarian assistance, \nthe United States had to certify that the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia was doing the following: First, cooperating with the War \nCrimes Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia; next, taking steps to \nimplement the Dayton Accords; and finally, taking steps to implement \npolicies reflecting the rule of law and respect for human rights.\n  Given the importance of a democratic and stable government in the FRY \nto the broader region and Europe as a whole, I was pleased that the new \ngovernment was, in fact, making significant progress in the areas \noutlined\n\n[[Page S10965]]\n\nin the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2001, thus \nallowing President Bush and the Secretary of State to grant \ncertification and allow non-humanitarian U.S. assistance to the FRY to \ncontinue following the March 31 deadline.\n  Additionally, the FRY's progress facilitated help from the World Bank \nand the International Monetary Fund, and the international community \npledged more than $1.2 billion for the country during a donors' \nconference sponsored by the World Bank at the end of June. Most \nrecently, we have seen positive developments in the FRY's negotiations \nwith the Paris Club to reschedule a portion of its debt.\n  The reforms took important action in each of the three areas. \nRegarding cooperation with the War Crimes Tribunal for the Former \nYugoslavia, we all remember the dramatic scenes on television during \nthe days before Slobodan Milosevic was transferred to The Hague in the \nmiddle of the night. It was a courageous and necessary step, and I am \npleased that the government understood the necessity to doing so.\n  In efforts to implement policies reflecting the rule of law and \nrespect for human rights, perhaps the most significant accomplishment \ndemonstrating the government's actions involved its work with the \ninternational community to successfully resolve the situation in \nsouthern Serbia, without significant international incident. In line \nwith the Dayton Agreement, the FRY has reduced its military to military \nties with the Republic Srpska, and it has indicated its commitment to \neliminate remaining ties and ensure transparency of any dealings it \nmight have with the Republic Srpska in the future.\n  While we acknowledge the positive things that have taken place during \nthe past twelve months, we must also recognize the reality that is \nstill work that remain to be done. Of highest priority is the release \nof ethnic Albanian prisoners who continue to remain incarcerated in \nSerbian jails. Moreover, it is critical that the Government further \nits cooperation with The Hague War Crimes Tribunal. Certainly the \ntransfer of Milosevic was highly important; at the same time, other \nindicated war criminals remain at large in the FRY, and every effort \nshould be made to work with The Hague Tribunal to rid the country of \nthose responsible for past atrocities.\n\n  That being said, as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia joins the \nranks of southeast Europe's new democracies, I believe it is important \nthat we begin to look beyond the conditions outlined in the foreign \noperations appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001, and work to create \nan assistance program for the FRY that is in line with our aid programs \nto other countries in the region.\n  Last October, when House and Senate conferees considered the final \nversion of the fiscal year 2001 foreign operations spending bill. \nVojislav Kostunica had been in office just a few short weeks. The \nstatus of Milosevic was widely unknown. Given the nascent state of the \nnew government at that time, I believe including language allowing the \nUnited States flexibility in its assistance program to the FRY, should \nthe new government have moved in a direction contrary to U.S. \ninterests, was a reasonable thing to do.\n  However, in the year following final consideration of last year's \nforeign operations appropriations bill, I believe the reformers in the \nFRY have developed a position--though not perfect--track record. While \nit is clear that additional steps must be taken to further cooperation \nwith The Hague and implementation of the rule of law, I believe we have \nsolid evidence that the new government is committed to moving forward \nwith reforms. If they fail to make the progress they have promised, we \nhave many avenues from which to demonstrate our displeasure.\n  As my colleagues are aware, the State Department must notify Congress \nbefore distributing U.S. funds abroad. At that time, our Foreign \nRelations Committee or Foreign Operations Subcommittee can withhold \nassistance to any country abroad. Additionally, we may instruct U.S. \nrepresentatives to international organizations such as the World Bank \nand the International Monetary Fund to withhold their support for \nprograms benefitting the FRY. Finally, if the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia does not act in accordance with actions deemed to be in \ntheir best interests by the United States and other members of the \ninternational community, there is no doubt in my mind that future U.S. \nsupport will be terminated.\n  I appreciate the work that my colleagues on the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee have done in preparing the Foreign Operations \nAppropriations Act for fiscal year 2002. I recognize their efforts to \nsend a positive message to reformers in the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia by increasing the level of assistance to Serbia to $115 \nmillion for fiscal year 2002, which is $15 million above the fiscal \nyear 2001 level, and providing $45 million for Montenegro.\n  Further, the committee has included language in its report applauding \nthe work that has been done by reformers in the FRY during the past \nyear. I also strongly support my colleagues' decision to provide $28 \nmillion toward debt relief for the FRY, and I was pleased to join \nSenator Leahy and Senator McConnell as a cosponsor of an amendment \nauthorizing that authority.\n  While I support many provisions in the bill, I am nonetheless \nconcerned that the same conditions on U.S. assistance to the Federal \nRepublic of Yugoslavia that were crafted in October 2000, just weeks \nafter the change of government, appear in the bill one year later. It \nis my feeling that placing the same conditions on U.S. assistance to \nFRY now may send the wrong message to the country's reformers. While we \nshould continue to encourage progress in the FRY, I believe placing the \nsame three conditions on U.S. aid to the country year after year could \nbe counterproductive.\n  I will continue to work with my colleagues on the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee and the Foreign Relations Committee during the next year \nregarding developments in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as our aid \nprogram to the country evolves, with the hope that we will be able to \nmove beyond conditionality in years to come.\n  While it is important for the United States to understand progress \nthat is made in the FRY, it is also imperative that the leaders of the \nFRY understand that the actions they take on the three areas outlined \nin the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act for FY2001 will have a \ndramatic impact on whether or not the conditions are included in next \nyear's bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, one of the most important provisions in \nthis legislation conditions assistance to the Colombian Armed Forces on \nimprovements in human rights.\n  It is essential to ensure that U.S. military aid does not contribute \nto human rights abuses in Colombia. Allegations of human rights \nviolations by military personnel there have decreased, but the State \nDepartment's 2000 Country Report on Human Rights Practices concluded \nthat the Colombian Government's human rights record ``remained poor'' \nand that ``government security forces continued to commit serious \nabuses, including extrajudicial killings.''\n  Many of us are particularly concerned about persistent links between \nthe Colombian Armed Forces and illegal paramilitary groups. On \nSeptember 10, Secretary of State Powell included the largest of these \ngroups, known by its acronym as the AUC, on the State Department's list \nof terrorist groups. According to the State Department's Human Rights \nreport, the Colombian military has repeatedly reassured our government \n``that it would not tolerate collaboration'' with such groups and that \n``the army would combat paramilitary groups.'' However, the report \nconcludes that such links persist and that ``actions in the field were \nnot always consistent with the leadership's positions.''\n  The report says:\n\n       Members of the security forces collaborated with \n     paramilitary groups that committed abuses, in some instances \n     allowing such groups to pass through roadblocks, sharing \n     information, or providing them with supplies or ammunition. \n     Despite increased government efforts to combat and capture \n     members of paramilitary groups, often security forces failed \n     to take action to prevent paramilitary attacks. Paramilitary \n     forces find a ready support base within the military and \n     police, as well as among local civilian elites in many areas.\n\n  A report recently released by Human Rights Watch titled ``The Sixth \nDivision: Military-Paramilitary Ties and U.S. Policy in Colombia,'' \nstates that\n\n[[Page S10966]]\n\nthe Colombia military and police detachments continue to promote, work \nwith, support profit from, and tolerate paramilitary groups, treating \nthem as a force allied to and compatible with their own.\n  Paramilitary groups continue to be linked to most human rights \nviolations committed in Colombia, including massacres. The State \nDepartment's Human Rights report cites a sharp increase in the number \nof victims of paramilitary violence in the last year. Just two weeks \nago, a new and ruthless massacre was committed by the AUC in Colombia. \nAt least twenty-four men were forced to lie on the ground and then were \nexecuted one by one in cold blood.\n\n  Many of us are deeply concerned that a majority of the armed forces \npersonnel who collaborate with the paramilitary organizations and who \nare responsible for human rights abuses are not prosecuted effectively. \nAccording to the State Department's report, ``impunity for military \npersonnel who collaborated with members of paramilitary groups remained \ncommon.'' Although the Colombian government claims to have dismissed \nmore than 500 members of the military, the State Department says that \nit does not know how many were dismissed for collaborating with illegal \nparamilitary groups.\n  The conditions included in this legislation are intended to address \nthese concerns. They require the Secretary of State to certify that the \nColombian Armed Forces are suspending members who have been credibly \nalleged to have committed gross violations of human rights, including \nextra-judicial killings, or to have aided or abetted paramilitary \ngroups, and are providing to civilian prosecutors and judicial \nauthorities requested information on the nature and cause of the \nsuspension.\n  The conditions require the Secretary of State to certify that the \nColombian Armed Forces are cooperating with civilian prosecutors and \njudicial authorities, including unimpeded access to witnesses and \nrelevant military documents and other information, in prosecuting and \npunishing in civilian courts members of the armed forces who have been \ncredibly alleged to have committed gross violations of human rights, \nincluding extra-judicial killings, or to have aided or abetted \nparamilitary groups.\n  Finally, the conditions require the Secretary of State to certify \nthat the Colombian Armed Forces are taking effective steps to sever \nlinks, including denying access to military intelligence, vehicles, and \nother equipment or supplies, ceasing other forms of active or tacit \ncooperation with paramilitary groups, and carrying out existing arrest \nwarrants.\n  These conditions will help ensure that U.S. assistance does not \ncontribute to human rights violations in Colombia. I urge my colleagues \nto support these important provisions.\n  Another important provision is intended to improve the lives of the \nDalit in India.\n  India's 160 million Dalits, who are also known as ``untouchables,'' \nsuffer severe hardship and face a unique form of discrimination. As \nvictims of economic exploitation rooted in the caste system, they are \nvirtually excluded from Indian society and endure some of the worst \nhealth conditions in the world. Dalits are born poor and landless and \nface discrimination at almost every stage in life. Wages from their \njobs rarely provide enough income to feed their families or educate \ntheir children, and so the cycle of poverty and illiteracy continues \nfrom generation to generation.\n\n  In rural areas, where sewer systems are virtually non-existent, many \nDalits make their living cleaning human waste. These workers, known as \nscavengers, use little more than a broom, a tin plate and a basket, \nthey clear human waste from public and private latrines, and carry the \nwaste long distances in porous wicker baskets to disposal sites. In \nurban areas, they often work neck-deep in pits filled with human waste \nand risk asphyxiation in city sewers. Health conditions are appalling. \nNearly all of these workers are women, and some are children.\n  A Dalit in India once described their existence:\n\n       When we are working, they ask us not to come near them. At \n     tea canteens, they have separate tea tumblers and they make \n     us clean them ourselves and make us put the dishes away \n     ourselves. We cannot enter temples. We cannot use upper-caste \n     water taps. We have to go one kilometer away to get water. . \n     . .\n\n  Dalit communities are frequently punished for individual \ntransgressions. With little knowledge of their rights, limited access \nto attorneys, and no money for hearings or bail, they are easy targets \nfor criminal prosecution. Police single out Dalit activists for \npersecution and frequently abuse and torture Dalit suspects.\n  While the Indian Constitution and the 1955 Civil Rights Act abolished \nuntouchability, and subsequent laws allow for affirmative action, \nhiring quotas and special training funds, discrimination against Dalits \ncontinues to flourish in Indian society. As the great author of the \nIndian constitution--and Dalit--statesman Dr. Ambedkar once said: \n``Mahatmas have come, Mahatmas have gone but the Untouchables have \nremained as Untouchables.''\n  While there are many people of goodwill in India, discrimination and \npoverty are widespread in the Dalit community. The foreign aid we \nprovide to India should contribute to easing the hardship and misery \nsuffered by this community and to addressing the disparity between \nDalits and others in India.\n  To advance this objective, a provision in this legislation requires \nthe executive director of the World Bank to vote against any water or \nsewage project in India that does not prohibit the use of scavenger \nlabor. Precious and limited resources should be used to provide \nincentive to communities in India to abolish this kind of labor and to \nreward those that do so.\n  Additionally, the report accompanying the Senate bill highlights the \nimportant role an organization called the Navsarjan Trust in India is \nbuilding a civil society in India by promoting the rights of the Dalit \ncommunity. The report encourages AID to provide funding for the Trust, \nwhich is run by Martin Macwan, who received the Robert F. Kennedy Human \nRights Award in 2000 for his work on behalf of the Dalit.\n  Founded in 1989, the Navsarjan Trust seeks to end discrimination \nagainst the Dalit. Since it was founded, it has become a highly \nrespected force that focuses on five issues for the Dalit community: \nbringing about the land reforms promised fifty years ago in the Indian \nConstitution, improving the working conditions and wages of farm \nworkers, abolishing scavenger labor, improving educational \nopportunities for children, and reducing violence. The Trust achieves \nits goals through non-violent protest and the judicial process. In \neleven years, it has grown to 187 full-time organizers and has a \npresence in more than 2,000 villages. It is widely viewed as one of the \nmost effective Dalit advocacy groups in India today, and it has filed a \nclass action suit to abolish manual scavenging.\n  Although our assistance program in India is limited, the Navsarjan \nTrust would be an important ally and a useful way to help the Dalit \ncommunity. Supporting the trust will demonstrate America's commitment \nto ending the discrimination faced by India's Dalits. I urge USAID to \nmake funding available for the organization to advance its worthwhile \nobjections.\n  I commend the subcommittee chairman, Senator Leahy, and the other \nmembers of the Appropriations Committee for including these important \nprovisions to reduce the discrimination faced by the Dalit community in \nIndia. Senator Leahy is an effective champion of human rights \nthroughout the world. I commend his leadership on this issue, and I \nlook forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in Congress to \nimprove the lives of the Dalit community in India.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I am an enthusiastic supporter of robust \nAmerican engagement with the world, and I believe current circumstances \ndemand such a presence. We must also resolve to back our commitment \nwith the financial resources to support the range of our interests \noverseas. For this reason, I am particularly disappointed by the long \nlist of unrequested and unnecessary earmarks in the FY 2002 Foreign \nOperations Appropriations bill, which total $186.2 million. This figure \nrepresents $30 million more than was contained in last\n\n[[Page S10967]]\n\nyear's Foreign Operations bill for programs neither requested by the \nAdministration nor authorized by Congress through the regular, merit-\nbased process for allocating scarce resources.\n  It is the task of America's leaders to make the case for meaningful \nforeign operations funding in the face of public skepticism about the \nflow of American tax dollars overseas. It is incumbent upon those of us \nwho serve in elective office to uphold the bipartisan tradition of \nenlightened American leadership around the world. In this era of \nglobalization, international affairs touch the lives of average \nAmericans in unprecedented ways. And as we wage a global campaign to \npurge from the world the terrorist threat against our very way of life, \nthe assistance we provide to friendly governments and impoverished \npeoples across the globe supports our ability to sustain an \ninternational coalition to fight terror and retain the popular goodwill \nnecessary to this task.\n  Unfortunately, the excessive and unwarranted earmarks in this bill do \nnot inspire confidence that all our tax dollars are being spent in a \nmanner most conducive to the advancement of our shared national \nconcerns. Indeed, it may shock some Americans to know that parochial \ninterests, not the national interest, have driven a disturbing \nproportion of the spending allocations contained in this bill.\n  Fragile allies suffering from civil unrest and economic decay will \nnot be helped by this bill's provision of $2.3 million in ``core \nsupport'' for the International Fertilizer Development Center, or the \nreport language's recommendation of $4 million for its work. Peanuts, \norangutans, gorillas, neotropical raptors, tropical fish, and exotic \nplants also receive the committee's attention, although it's unclear \nwhy any individual making a list of critical international security, \neconomic, and humanitarian concerns worth addressing would target these \notherwise meritorious flora and fauna.\n\n  The committee has disturbingly singled out for funding a laundry list \nof American universities some with multi-billion dollar endowments in \ncontravention of the usual merit-based process of allocating scarce \nforeign assistance dollars to the most worthy causes. Although \ndisappointing, it is perhaps not surprising that there is a correlation \nbetween the geographic locations of many of the universities targeted \nfor special treatment and the home states of those on the \nAppropriations Committee and members of the Senate leadership. Those \nleft out of this correlation predicated on patronage rather than value \nto American national interests are, of course, the very people we would \nlike to help overseas, and the programs of liberalization and reform we \nwould otherwise use the money to encourage.\n  Given the unprecedented war we are in, we should be redoubling our \nefforts to target as many resources as possible to win it. To this end, \nwe should all heed the words of Office of Management and Budget \nDirector Mitch Daniels, who said, ``Everything ought to be held up to \nscrutiny. Situations like this can have a clarifying benefit. People \nwho could not identify a low priority or lousy program before may now \nsee the need.''\n  America will go on, and we will continue to lead the world as only we \ncan. The security and prosperity of our people demand it. Our wish to \nsee our values flourish universally requires it. But we are \nhandicapping ourselves in refusing, even in these times, to abandon the \nparochialism that infected congressional spending decisions long before \nour compelling international responsibilities provided us with a higher \ncalling. Perhaps some of this parochial funding could be spent in a \nbetter way, helping more people and further advancing the virtuous \ncauses we aspire to lead.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \ndocumentation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs \n                Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2002\n\n\n                             bill language\n\n                TITLE II--BILATERAL ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE\n\n       Development Assistance:\n       The International Fertilizer Development Center: provides \n     $2,300,000 for core support.\n       The United States Telecommunications Training Institute: \n     provides $500,000 for support.\n       The American Schools and Hospitals Abroad program: provides \n     $19,000,000.\n\n\n                            report language\n\n                TITLE II--BILATERAL ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE\n\n       The Gorgas Memorial Institute Initiative for Tuberculosis \n     Control: Committee recommends $2,000,000.\n       Iodine Deficiency/Kiwanis: Committee recommends that AID \n     provide at least $2.5 million to Kiwanis International \n     through UNICEF.\n       Helen Keller Worldwide, the International Eye Foundation, \n     and others: Committee expects USAID to provide $1.3 million.\n       Helen Keller Worldwide-initiated programs to aid the \n     visually impaired in Vietnam and Cambodia: committee urges \n     USAID to expand funding for similar programs.\n       Population Media Center: Committee supports.\n       International Medical Equipment Collaborative: urges AID to \n     consider for funding.\n       Mobility International USA: recommends AID consider support \n     for up to $300,000.\n       Women's Campaign International: Committee recommends \n     $600,000.\n       Vital Voices Global Partnership: Committee recommends \n     $100,000.\n       American Schools and Hospitals Abroad: Committee has \n     provided not less than $19 million and expects USAID to \n     allocate funds for Operating Expenses.

Madam President, I am heartened by the amount of \ncooperation I have witnessed among my Senate colleagues and the \nexpeditious way they have addressed our national security concerns in \nthe wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11. The passage of the \nAirline Security and Anti-Terrorism bills will give the administration \nnecessary tools to combat terrorism here at home. Whether the anthrax \nattacks of last week on our Nation's Capitol prove to be connected to \nAl Qaeda, it is certain that the attempt to bring our government to a \nstandstill has failed. To be sure, the quarters here have been cramped \nbut our commitment to work together has not been affected. Our thoughts \nand prayers go out to the families of the postal workers who lost their \nlives this week, but this sad chapter only strengthens our resolve to \nfind the culprits of these heinous acts and bring them to justice.\n  I commend the administration for its success in forming an \ninternational coalition on such short notice. The President's visit to \nShanghai last week, and Secretary Powell's visit to India, were \nfruitful in getting us needed support from the two most populous \ncountries in the world. I join the President in admonishing all nations \nwho want to be a part of the civilized world to either side with us, or \nside with the terrorists. The time to be lukewarm is gone; we need to \ndraw a line in the sand. I believe we are entering into a ``New Cold \nWar,'' where the stakes are no less grave than they were in the cold \nwar of the twentieth century. The fight against radical Islam, like the \nfight against communism, is a fight to preserve the republican ideals \nthat made our Nation so great. May we look to President Reagan and the \nexample he set for American courage and American resolve to win in this \n``New Cold War''.\n  Many of my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee know that I am \nnot a big fan of foreign aid, particularly when there are many vital \nprojects that deserve attention here at home. The Foreign Operations \nAppropriations bill has many flaws, the worst of which has incited a \nPresidential veto threat due to provisions that would allow federal \nfunding for international family planning organizations that perform \nabortions overseas. American taxpayer dollars should not be used to \nsubsidize groups that do not respect the life of the unborn. This sends \nthe wrong message to our children and cheapens the value of life. Other \nflaws include the onerous certification requirements that the \nadministration must fulfill in order to assist in the rebuilding of \nvital infrastructure that we destroyed in Yugoslavia during the Kosovo \nwar. Yugoslavia has made tremendous strides towards democracy, as can \nbe witnessed by the free and fair elections that peacefully removed the \nMilosevic regime. Rather than further harm the Yugoslav people who are \nin need of such basic things as clean water, and heating for the coming \nwinter months, we should allow the administration to grant assistance \nas it sees fit in this area.\n  I also have a problem with a bill that is over a half a billion \ndollars larger than last year, but is over $160 million below the \nfunding level requested by the administration for programs to curb \nillicit narcotics trafficking in the Andean region. How can we justify \na spending increase of this magnitude at the expense of important \nprograms that help to prevent the flow of illegal drugs into this \ncountry? Where is this increase in spending going?\n\n  Despite these flaws, however, the events over the past 6 weeks have \nunderstandably changed Americans' outlook on international affairs, and \nour need to stay engaged. I recognize the responsibility the United \nStates has in leading the fight to defend democracy and Western \nCivilization and, as such, the United States must remain involved in \nthe international arena. This is not the time to isolate ourselves. The \nadministration must have a complete arsenal at its disposal for the war \nagainst terrorism, and that includes having the ability to use foreign \naid as a means to reward and reinvest in those nations who actively \nsupport us in this fight. Therefore, I will support the passage of this \nbill on condition that its most grave flaws be remedied in conference \nwith the House. However, should the conference report be sent to the \nSenate floor ``unremedied,'' I will be forced to consider opposing the \nreport and urging my colleagues to do likewise.\n  Lastly, as a complement to the ongoing efforts to strengthen our \nnational security, I urge the speedy passage of a revamped Intelligence \nAuthorization bill that will give our intelligence community the \ncapability it needs not to not only streamline the gathering and \nsharing of information among various agencies, but to have the \ndiscretion to act on that information as well. Our agents in the field \nshould not be more worried about getting reprimanded for the methods \nthey use in collecting information, than they should about ensuring the \nsafety of our Nation.\n  I would also like to reiterate the importance to our national \nsecurity of passing an energy bill that will allow us to explore other \nsources of energy domestically. As the prospects of a widened war in \nthe Middle East becomes more likely, it is crucial that we take steps \nnow to wean ourselves away from foreign sources of oil. We currently \nconsume up to 700,000 barrels of oil a day from Iraq alone. If the \nAmerican people are worried about the state of the economy now, just \nwait until we have a real energy crisis, and we will all see the \neconomy go into a tailspin.\n  The eyes of the free world look to us for direction. We must not fail \nthem.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I thank the ranking member, Senator \nMcConnell, for his support and cooperation throughout this process. He \nhas been a partner in writing the bill, in resolving the amendments, \nand I value his friendship and his advice.\n  I also commend the staff, for all their work. In particular, I \nrecognize Paul Grove, who took over as the Republican clerk for the \nForeign Operations Subcommittee earlier this year. Paul has quickly \nlearned the appropriations process and has been a pleasure to work \nwith.\n  In addition, Mark Lippert, the new deputy clerk on the Democratic \nside, has done an outstanding job.\n  Jennifer Chartrand, who has been a professional staff member for the \nAppropriations Committee for several years, provided essential advice \nand support to my staff. She was indispensable.\n\n[[Page S10969]]\n\n  I thank Tara Magner of my Judiciary Committee staff, and J.P. Dowd, \nmy legislative director, for their help during floor consideration of \nthis bill.\n  I recognize Tim Rieser, the Democratic clerk for the subcommittee, \nfor all his help.\n  And I thank Dakota Rudesill, staff member for the Budget Committee, \nwho provided excellent and very helpful advice during floor \nconsideration of this bill.\n  Finally, as always, we owe a debt to Billy Piper, on Senator \nMcConnell's staff. Billy came in at crucial times to resolve a number \nof important issues.\n  That completes action on the Foreign Operations bill for fiscal year \n2002.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I know of no other amendments.\n  I ask unanimous consent that with respect to H.R. 2506, the foreign \noperations appropriations bill, upon the disposition of all amendments, \nthe bill be read a third time and the Senate vote on passage of the \nbill; that upon passage, the Senate insist on its amendments, request a \nconference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, \nand the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the \nSenate, with the above occurring with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on final \npassage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read \nthe third time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I want to take this opportunity to \nthank the staff of my good friend from Vermont, Senator Leahy, with \nwhom we have worked on this bill for these many years. They are Tim \nRieser, Mark Lippert, and J.P. Dowd. I also extend my thanks to \nJennifer Chartrand, Billy Piper of my personal staff, and Paul Grove, \nwho replaced my long-time staffer, Robert Cleveland of the Foreign \nOperations Subcommittee. He has done a superb job with his first bill. \nI thank them all from the bottom of my heart.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I compliment the distinguished chairman \nand ranking member for their excellent work. This is not an easy bill. \nOftentimes, it is one that keeps us occupied for days, if not weeks. I \nthank them for their leadership, and I am very grateful for the fact \nthat we were able to get this bill done.\n  Also, I thank the distinguished Senator from Vermont, Senator Leahy, \nfor his work on the global AIDS matter. Were it not for him, we would \nnot have had the additional resources that are so critical right now, \nthis year, from this country. He did an outstanding job in that regard, \ntoo. While he is not on the floor at the moment, I thank him personally \nfor all of his work.\n  As I announced earlier, it is our intention to take up the \ncounterterrorism legislation. It has now passed in the House. We have \nhad a good debate in the Senate. I would like to proceed with a \nunanimous consent request that would accommodate a good deal of debate \nagain on a bill. I know there may be a colloquy involved. Let me \nproceed with the unanimous consent request, and I ask the cooperation \nof all Senators. I will propound the request now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/24/senate-section/article/S10969-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10969-S10970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 3162\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent that at 10 o'clock Thursday, \nOctober 25, the Senate proceed to the consideration of H.R. 3162, the \ncounterterrorism bill; that no amendments or motions be in order to the \nbill, except a motion to table the motion to reconsider the vote on \nfinal passage of the bill; that there be 5 hours and 10 minutes for \ndebate, with the time controlled as follows: 90 minutes each for the \nchairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, or their \ndesignees; 10 minutes each, controlled by Senators Levin and Wellstone; \n20 minutes under the control of Senator Sarbanes; 60 minutes under the \ncontrol of Senator Feingold; 15 minutes under the control of Senator \nGraham of Florida; 15 minutes under the control of Senator Specter; \nthat upon the use or yielding back of time, the bill be read the third \ntime, the Senate then vote on final passage of the bill, with this \naction occurring with no further intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to object, Madam President, I thank \nthe distinguished majority leader for giving me this opportunity. He \nand I have discussed at length the concern that I have that is shared \nby Senator Smith of Oregon. I want to take a minute or two to describe \nwhat is so important to us and have a discussion briefly with the \ndistinguished majority leader.\n  In my home State of Oregon, we have not been able to do a covert \ninvestigation into dangerous criminal activity such as terrorism in \nmore than a year. The hands of our prosecutors are tied. Senator Smith \nand I, along with a number of other colleagues and prosecutors, believe \nvery strongly that it is critically important as part of this \nantiterrorism effort that we allow the prosecutors to go forward and do \nwiretaps, stings, and essentially undercover operations. We have not \nbeen able to get such a provision into this\n\n[[Page S10970]]\n\nantiterrorism legislation because of the work of the House.\n  Senator Daschle has been exceptionally supportive, as have Senator \nHatch and Senator Leahy. The Senate is united on this matter. The \nSenate has agreed in its entirety. For reasons that are inexplicable to \nthis Member of the Senate, the House has been unwilling to untie the \nhands of Federal prosecutors in my home State.\n  The question then is: Why should every Senator care about what is \nhappening in the State of Oregon? The reason I feel so strongly about \nthis is that if we learned one thing on September 11, it is that if the \nterrorists get sanctuary anywhere, Americans are in trouble everywhere \nbecause we saw on September 11 the terrorists set up shop in New \nJersey, they set up shop in Florida, and they ended up murdering \nAmericans in New York City and in the Pentagon and in Pennsylvania.\n  As a result of the work that was done on the foreign operations \nappropriations legislation, again, to the credit of Senator Daschle, \nSenator Leahy, and Senator Smith, Senator Leahy added the original bill \nthat I authored. Senator Smith and I have teamed up on this, and it is \nnow in the foreign operations appropriations legislation that passed \nthis body.\n  What is different tonight and why I am not objecting is that the \nWhite House has now indicated for the first time that they will support \nin the foreign operations appropriations legislation what Senator Smith \nand I have crafted.\n  We have also been able to, in discussions with Senator Daschle, have \nan opportunity to let him discuss his views on it. He has renewed his \ncommitment to me that we will have the united support of the Senate on \nthe foreign operations appropriations bill, and if, in fact, the House \njunks this on the foreign operations appropriations bill in spite of \nthe administration's effort, Senator Daschle, to his credit, has \nrenewed his support for this effort and has been kind enough to give me \nthis time to state my reservation.\n  I would like to have him briefly describe his views on this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I say to both my colleagues from Oregon \nhow much we appreciate their extraordinary efforts. I do not know of \nmany pieces of legislation that pass unanimously not once but twice, \nand not only twice but within a matter of weeks. But that is the case.\n  This legislation passed unanimously as an amendment to the \ncounterterrorism bill. This amendment has just now been passed \nunanimously as part of the foreign operations appropriations bill. That \nwould not have happened were it not for their tenacity and their \ndecisive leadership. I am grateful to them, first of all, for their \nwillingness to continue to pursue this effort until they are \nsuccessful.\n  I was involved in these discussions and negotiations with our \ncolleagues from the House as we negotiated the various pieces. There \nwere various reasons this legislation was not kept as part of the \ncounterterrorism legislation, but I will tell my colleagues what I have \nsaid publicly: We will continue to pursue this; we will continue to \npersist until this becomes law.\n  As the Senator from Oregon has noted, the White House indicated they \nare prepared to join us in that effort. With that additional \nassistance, with those assurances, we are in a much stronger position \nnow than we have been at any time in recent months to ensure our \nsuccess. But if for whatever reason we are not successful, this will \ncome back again and again, and we will continue to send it to the House \nagain and again until it is done successfully.\n  I am confident we will complete our work successfully on this \namendment. I am confident that with their partnership and the effort \nthey have already made, we will be successful. I will pledge my \nsupport, and I know Senator Leahy feels every bit as strongly as I do. \nWe will work in concert with them to ensure the maximum level of \nsuccess as we go into conference on the foreign operations \nappropriations bill.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I say to the majority leader, I \nwill not object, but I want to be included in the colloquy and be \nentirely supportive of my colleague, Senator Wyden. I want to state \npublicly for the record, Senator Wyden and I began working on this \nissue together in great earnest this last weekend because it was \napparent that the good bill we had passed to the House was coming back \nas something less than that bill.\n  Because of the unique circumstances described by Senator Wyden, every \nAmerican should know that the bill we are about to pass tomorrow puts a \nstake in Oregon that says Oregon is open for business to terrorism. \nThat is a stake we want to pull out because right now no undercover \nwork is going on in Oregon for a whole variety of unusual reasons. That \nis where it is, and that must be fixed, or every American should know \nthat the bill we will pass tomorrow is an illusion until it includes \nall 50 States.\n  In my State, whether it is environmental terrorism, child \npornography, drug runners, methamphetamine producers, or al-Qaida \nterrorist groups, they are finding aid and comfort from the absence of \nlaw enforcement when it comes to undercover activities. That must end \nor we are kidding the American people.\n  I thank the majority leader for his commitment. I thank Senator Lott \nand the managers of this bill for their commitment, and I say for the \nrecord, I have the assurances of Carl Rove with the White House, John \nAshcroft in Justice, and I am awaiting a call from the Speaker of the \nHouse to work in earnest to get this resolved quickly so that we can in \ngood faith face the American people and say: We have passed a terrorism \nbill that includes all Americans. But right now, it does not include \nOregonians.\n  I yield to my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, if I may continue briefly on my \nreservation, Senator Smith has summed it up very well. At this point in \nthe State of Oregon, there are no wiretaps; there are no sting \noperations; you cannot infiltrate dangerous criminal groups no matter \nhow dastardly their plans. We are not talking about some kind of \nabstract proposition.\n  The bill that is going to be passed tomorrow is essentially a bill \nthat deals with terrorism in 49 States. As I say, it just seems to me \nonce you allow a sanctuary, a launch pad for terrorist groups anywhere, \neveryone is at risk. What is different tonight is we have been able to \nsecure a commitment from the White House.\n  The majority leader, as is his tradition, has worked very closely \nwith me and has made a similar commitment to Senator Smith, and \ntonight--and I will say this is very hard for this Member of the Senate \nto do because I think the people of my home State are going to be at \nrisk tonight--but because of the commitment we have secured from the \nmajority leader--and it is a renewed commitment; again and again he has \nbeen in these meetings fighting to change the McDade law and give our \nprosecutors the tools to deal with this problem.\n  With the new commitment tonight from the White House and with the \ncontinued commitment and assurance of the majority leader tonight, I \nwithdraw my reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I thank both of my colleagues from \nOregon for their willingness to work with us. I have already said how \nstrongly I feel about this matter, and the passion expressed by both \nSenators from Oregon I think is a clear indication of their \ndetermination to see this through to ultimate success. We will see \nsuccess. I am grateful to them tonight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/24/senate-section/article/S10970-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10970-S10971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 2330\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Madam President, I rise today to clarify a matter that has \nbeen somewhat taken out of context. I know my good friend, the majority \nleader, was asked this morning about comments the Senator from Delaware \nallegedly made speaking to the New York Council on Foreign Relations, \nwhich surprised me the question was asked.\n  I was informed that a high-ranking Republican on the House side put \nout a statement--and I am sure he did not understand the context--\nsuggesting I implied Americans were high-tech bullies who were bombing \nAfghanis, and we should be fighting on the ground and not bombing.\n  I want to assure my friend from South Dakota, in his response to the \nquestion, he was correct. I did not say anything like that. I will read \nfrom the transcript from the New York Council on Foreign Relations \nspeech.\n  I was asked by a gentleman, whose name I will not put in the--well, \nhis name is Ron Paul, whom I do not know, who says: I concur with \neverybody else in commending you on your comments, and he goes on.\n  Then he says: With regard to the bombing, every day it goes on the \nharder it may be for us to do something next, referring to rebuilding \nAfghanistan. He said: What do you see as the situation if we do not \ndefeat the Taliban in the next 4 weeks and winter sets in in \nAfghanistan?\n\n  The context of the question was, Is it not a hard decision for the \nPresident to have to choose between bombing, knowing it will be \nunfairly used for propaganda purposes by radical Muslims in that area \nof the world, and bombing to make the environment more hospitable for \nAmerican forces to be able to be successful on the ground?\n  I said it was a hard decision. The question was repeated, and my \nanswer was: I am not a military man--I will read this in part.\n\n       The part that I think flies in the face of and plays into \n     every stereotypical criticism of us----\n\n  Referring to the radical Muslims, that part of the world that is \nradical----\n\n       is we're this high-tech bully that thinks from the air we \n     can do whatever we want to do, and it builds the case for \n     those who want to make the case against us that all we're \n     doing is indiscriminately bombing innocents, which is not the \n     truth.\n\n  So I want the majority leader to know, and I am sure when the \ngentleman on the House side sees the comments, he will be able to put \nit in the proper perspective because the irony is anyone who has been \nin the Senate knows I was the first, most consistent, and the last \ncalling for the United States to bomb in Bosnia, bomb in Kosovo, use \nthe full force of our air power.\n  I have been around long enough to know unless someone stands up and \nclarifies something, it can get out of hand very quickly.\n  I thank my colleague for his response this morning to the press and \nfor his faith in his chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. I \nassure him, in this case at least, it was well placed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my entire speech--which I would not \nordinarily do because it is my own speech--to the Council on Foreign \nRelations be printed in the Record, along with the question and answers \nthat follow.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   [Remarks By Joseph R. Biden, Jr., United States Senator--Delaware]\n\n  From Tragedy to Opportunity: Acting Wisely in a time of Uncertainty\n\n  (Council on Foreign Relations, New York City, October 22, 2001, (As \n                               Prepared))\n\n       When I accepted this invitation I expected to be talking \n     about the ABM treaty, about our military priorities in the \n     context of an evaporating budget surplus, or about missile \n     defense versus the more urgent threats we could face--and \n     now, in fact, do face.\n       I thought the questions I might be asked would be about \n     strategic doctrine, about relations with traditional \n     adversaries like Russia and China, and whether the Yankees \n     will win another World Series.\n       I certainly did not, for one instance, think we'd be here \n     today wondering about our short-and long-term goals in a war \n     against terrorism: Will we succeed? How long will it take? \n     What constitutes victory?\n       But those are, in fact, the questions facing the United \n     States, and, I confess, they're not easy to answer.\n       First, our immediate goal is to cut off the head of Al \n     Qaeda, break up the network, leave them no safe haven. That \n     means the removal of Osama bin Laden, Mullah Omar, and the \n     Taliban leadership.\n       I don't know how long it will be before the regime is \n     toppled. I wouldn't want to guess. But the handwriting is on \n     the wall. They've lost the support of their key sponsors and \n     are essentially isolated. But some of these sponsors may need \n     reminding that they've got to make a clear break with the \n     past, and we should not hesitate to spell that out.\n       After Al Qaeda and the Taliban fall, and--to use the phrase \n     of the day--we drain the swamp, the medium-term goal is to \n     roll up all Al Qaeda cells around the world.\n       Then, with the help of other nations and possibly with the \n     ultimate sanction of the United Nations, our hope is we'll \n     see a relatively stable government in Afghanistan--one that \n     does not harbor terrorists, is acceptable to the major \n     players in the region, represents the ethnic make up of the \n     country, and provides a foundation for future reconstruction.\n       In the long term, our goals are easy to articulate, but \n     much more difficult to achieve.\n       We'll need to deter any potential state sponsors of \n     terrorism from providing support or haven to future bin \n     Ladens.\n       We'll work with others and try to help rebuild a \n     politically and socially stable Afghanistan that does NOT \n     export terrorism, narcotics, or militancy to its neighbors \n     and to the wider world--more like it was in the 1950s.\n       We'll need to stabilize Southwest and Central Asia and \n     prevent the Taliban-izing, if you will, of Pakistan and other \n     countries.\n       And we'll need to address some of the economic and \n     political forces that can be manipulated by men like bin \n     Laden. We must do this with the full awareness that attention \n     to social and political development alone won't prevent \n     another bin Laden from emerging. But, at least, it will \n     severely limit the pool from which he can draw recruits and \n     support.\n       If we're successful in prosecuting this effort in \n     Afghanistan, it ups the ante for other nations harboring or \n     sponsoring--directly or indirectly--other terrorist groups.\n       The President believes, and I agree, that we must stay \n     involved in the region, not necessarily with American troops, \n     but with American leadership, and resources.\n       The President has repeated many times, and it's important \n     that we say it over and over again: This is not a war against \n     the Afghan people or any one faith. This is a war between \n     nation states and transnational terrorist organizations, \n     between civilization and chaos.\n       We need to remind the world's 1.2 billion Muslims--the vast \n     majority of whom are sickened by the attempted hijacking of \n     their faith--that our beef is with bin Laden and Al Qaeda, \n     not with them.\n       American policy has long been marked by a blend of the \n     Wilsonian trend and realpolitik, but whatever our motive, it \n     has not been guided by religious imperatives.\n       When we sought to bring peace and stability to the Balkans, \n     the Muslims in Bosnia and Kosovo were the primary \n     beneficiaries.\n       When we went into Somalia, our aim was to feed starving \n     people who happen to be Muslims.\n       And, when we provided 170 million dollars in humanitarian \n     assistance to the Afghan\n\n[[Page S10972]]\n\n     people in the last year, it had to do with our principles, \n     and the people there were Muslim, too.\n       Unfortunately, we're doing a terrible job of disseminating \n     information. We have to take a fresh look at public diplomacy \n     and determine the most effective ways we can get out our \n     message.\n       But I'm under no illusions. Winning the hearts and minds of \n     ordinary citizens in the Islamic world is an uphill battle, \n     but one we must undertake.\n       We must enhance the means we use as well as the message--\n     whether it's people to people visits that explain our \n     principled respect for the diversity of all faiths and \n     cultures--or radio and television broadcasts that inform and \n     ultimately empower moderate Muslim voices.\n       What we cannot do is let the Taliban wage the same \n     propaganda war Saddam waged in Iraq, with photographs of \n     mothers and children scrambling for food and endless footage \n     of destroyed buildings--all designed to portray America as \n     anti-Islam. That's a bald-faced lie.\n       Regardless of whether we succeed in getting our message \n     out, the truth is, we CANNOT and we certainly WILL not walk \n     away from seven million displaced and desperate Afghans \n     surviving on little more than grass and locusts.\n       We must do more to help the Afghan people, and we must do \n     FAR more to make our aid visible across the Muslim world.\n       I'm reluctant to use the word ``nation building'' because \n     it's such a loaded political term--but, if we leave \n     Afghanistan in chaos, it'll be another time bomb waiting to \n     explode. And there's an enormous powder keg right next door \n     in Pakistan.\n       If we think we have a problem now, imagine a nation with \n     six times the population of Afghanistan, a nuclear arsenal, \n     and a Talibanized government.\n       To avoid that scenario, we have to work with the World \n     Bank, the IMF, the U.N., other NGOs and our allies, \n     especially those in the region, to help build an \n     infrastructure in Afghanistan that works.\n       United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan said it will \n     take nearly $600 million just to get the Afghan refugees \n     through the winter. But that's only the beginning.\n       In the long term, Afghanistan will need to find a way to \n     break the hold that the madrassas have had on a generation of \n     young men.\n       They will need to educate a generation of young women, to \n     give them the tools necessary to seize the rights so cruelly \n     denied them under Taliban rule.\n       They'll need to de-mine the most heavily mined nation in \n     the world.\n       They'll need crop substitution programs to rid themselves \n     of the title of the world's foremost producers of heroin and \n     opium.\n       They'll need wells, water purification centers, hospitals, \n     village clinics, even simple roads from one town to the next.\n       I commend the President for promising $320 million in \n     Afghan aid. In my opinion, this might be the best investment \n     we could make. I say this notwithstanding the many obstacles \n     to achieving these goals that exist in a region that has not \n     proved fertile for incubating democratic institutions. \n     Clearly, we can't do it alone.\n       As demonstrated since September 11th, it's even more \n     obvious, at least to me, that our national interests can't be \n     furthered, let alone achieved--in splendid indifference to \n     the rest of the world.\n       Our interests are furthered when we meet our international \n     obligations, keep our treaties, and engage the world.\n       Far from the black and white of campaigns and up against \n     the gray of governing, it's much easier to see the virtues of \n     multi-nationalism and the shortcomings of unilateralism.\n       The same tools we used to build this coalition may, in the \n     long term, help change the dynamics of bilateral relations, \n     and present real and unexpected opportunities to define this \n     new century.\n       And by the way, the Administration has figured it out.\n       Where the Administration may have once been tempted to see \n     only strategic differences with China over national missile \n     defense and Taiwan, today there's a growing recognition that \n     we have common strategic interests as well--like fighting \n     terrorism and maintaining peace and stability in Central \n     Asia.\n       Where the Administration may have once seen relations with \n     Russia through the prism of the Cold-War, today there's the \n     promise of entering into a fundamentally different \n     relationship with the Russian Federation.\n       Where the Administration may have once viewed relations \n     with Iran within the confines of a twenty-year time warp, \n     today Iran has signaled a desire to at least explore a \n     relationship based on newly defined common interests. They've \n     even said they would assist in search and rescue operations \n     of any downed American pilots.\n       Clearly there's an internal rift in Iran. The reformists \n     would like to go further. All they could get through the \n     system was this modest gesture. But because the system \n     operates on consensus, I'm virtually certain Khamene'i \n     approves, which is significant in itself.\n       Let's not be under any illusion that there will be full \n     blown rapprochement with China, Russia, and Iran. But if we \n     do this right, if we look at our adversaries in a new light, \n     there will be much to build off in the future.\n       This weekend the President was in Shanghai for the Asia \n     Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit. He met with China's \n     leaders, who now see more clearly than ever the threat posed \n     to them by the proliferation of nuclear, chemical, \n     biological, and ballistic missile technology.\n       I guarantee that Jiang Zemin can imagine a plane crashing \n     into an 80 story office tower in Shanghai. I expect that \n     China's leaders will never think of their nuclear and \n     ballistic missile exports to Pakistan in quite the same way.\n       Working with China against terrorism, however, does not \n     mean jettisoning our concerns about China's human rights \n     record, or overlooking proliferation. In fact, we may need to \n     remind China's leaders that respect for the human rights and \n     religious liberty of China's Muslim minorities is not only \n     morally right, but also essential if we are to deprive the \n     terrorists of recruits.\n       In Russia, President Putin has emerged as a strategic \n     thinker who realizes that, in order for Russia to advance \n     into the ranks of highly developed nations, he must cast his \n     lot with the West.\n       Putin recently said ``Today we must firmly declare: the \n     Cold War is over.'' And with respect to our efforts in \n     Afghanistan, he said ``I have no doubt that the U.S. \n     leadership and President Bush will do their best so that the \n     peaceful population does not suffer, and they are already \n     doing their best.''\n       Putin is willing to confront entrenched, reactionary \n     domestic opposition when necessary. He overruled his senior \n     military, and gave the green light for American planes to \n     overfly Russian territory and to permit troops on former \n     Soviet territory in Central Asia, actions virtually \n     unimaginable not long ago.\n       We have a genuine opportunity to pursue a new relationship \n     with Russia, and we should. If the news out of Shanghai this \n     weekend is accurate, it may well be possible to reach \n     agreement on mutually limiting offensive capabilities and \n     allowing Tests of missile defense systems. I hope the \n     President will resist those in his Administration who would \n     have him risk squandering this opportunity by withdrawing \n     unilaterally from the ABM treaty.\n       I've always said: nations, like people, use crises to \n     resolve differences, or create opportunities.\n       In the case of Russia, we have a momentous opportunity. It \n     may well be possible to deal not only with strategic forces, \n     but also with NATO enlargement and our non-proliferation \n     concerns.\n       That new relationship could shape this half-century as the \n     Cold-War shaped the last.\n       Three days ago, Secretary Powell said in Shanghai, ``Not \n     only is the Cold War over, the post-Cold War period is also \n     over.''\n       If the Administration proceeds pragmatically, rather than \n     ideologically, the new era could be good, indeed.\n       But let's remember that Russia is not the only country that \n     matters in developing a new strategic doctrine. We must take \n     care not to provoke a major Chinese arms build-up, which \n     could lead to more nuclear arms in India and Pakistan. We \n     need the help of both in the war on terrorism. And nobody \n     needs more nuclear weapons along a border that is already \n     getting too hot for comfort.\n       The time is right to consider joint efforts to reduce \n     strategic arms; commit to a joint program to combat \n     terrorism; develop a bilateral plan to prevent other \n     countries or terrorists from gaining weapons of mass \n     destruction; find ways to counter infectious disease \n     epidemics and clean up the residue left by our weapons \n     programs. And we should do everything we can to help Russia \n     stay on a path of economic and political growth and \n     stability.\n       Once the foundation of cooperation is firmly established, \n     we can pursue missile defense--if that's what we want--\n     without rocking the boat of strategic stability.\n       Look, in the long-term--even if the coalition breaks down--\n     we'll have the potential opportunity to create a new day of \n     enhanced bilateral relations with China, Russia, and maybe \n     even with Iran.\n       So, in the short term we want to eliminate bin Laden and \n     his top aides and remove Mullah Omar and the Taliban \n     leadership.\n       In the medium term, we'll need to establish a relatively \n     stable regime in Afghanistan and roll up Al Qaeda cells \n     around the world.\n       And in the long-term, we have to deter state sponsorship of \n     future bin Ladens, help rebuild Afghanistan, and stabilize \n     Southwest and Central Asia.\n       What will be much more difficult, will be to clearly \n     identify and address some of the root causes of this hard-\n     core, hate-driven zealotry so we can limit the pool from \n     which another bin Laden can draw recruits.\n       The list of root causes is long--from the lack of \n     legitimate channels of dissent in the Arab world, to \n     desperation, resentment at American material success, a \n     perception that our actions don't match our ideals.\n       All of these issues are worthy of our attention, but they \n     can never be excuses for terrorism.\n       Which brings us to Israel. Let me just say, Israel did not \n     produce bin Laden, and we can't let Israel be the scapegoat.\n       We are in a tough stage right now, and there are many \n     cross-winds buffeting our relationship, but our friendship \n     with Israel is not a transitory event, a marriage of \n     convenience, or a short-term alliance.\n       Differences are normal even among friends, but airing them \n     in public is never useful. Surely there are sufficient \n     channels to communicate our views. Let us not create any\n\n[[Page S10973]]\n\n     false impressions about the fundamental, long-term basis upon \n     which the U.S.-Israel relationship rests: we continue to be \n     bound by unshakable, shared democratic values.\n       After all this, the question remains--what constitutes \n     victory in the war on terrorism?\n       If we cut off the head of Al Qaeda, help to rebuild a \n     stable Afghanistan, and if, in the process, we find a way to \n     stabilize the relationship between Pakistan and India, and \n     enhance bilateral relations with China, Russia, and Iran, \n     then we have achieved a victory that may well define the 21st \n     century.\n       In sum, just as we could not have put together a viable \n     coalition if President Bush had already walked away from the \n     ABM treaty, so too will we have trouble nurturing future \n     bilateral relations if we decide, when the crisis is over, to \n     go it alone, again.\n       We should be figuring out right now how we revive the \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), the Biological Weapons \n     Treaty, move on arms control proposals that go to Start III, \n     environmental treaties, and how to amend--and not jettison--\n     the ABM Treaty.\n       Before I take some questions let me leave you with these \n     final thoughts. On September 11th the world changed for the \n     terrorists. It was, I believe the beginning of the end of a \n     way of life, not for America, but for international \n     terrorism.\n       Out of our dark grief our nation is newly united and abroad \n     we have new opportunities.\n       As my mother says, ``Out of every tragedy, if you look hard \n     enough, you can find one good thing.''\n       Or, in the words of another great Irish poet, Seamus \n     Heaney:\n\n     ``History says, don't hope\n     On this side of the grave.\n     But then, once in a lifetime\n     The longed-for tidal wave\n     Of justice can rise up,\n     And hope and history rhyme.''\n\n       I truly believe, notwithstanding incredible difficulties we \n     face in doing even half the things I mentioned here, that \n     we're on the verge, if we do it right, of making hope and \n     history rhyme. But we cannot squander this opportunity. I \n     believe the President has made a genuine transition in his \n     thinking on foreign policy. I hope I am not kidding myself. \n     If he has, I think not only will he go down as a great \n     President, I think we will have marked the beginning of a new \n     era in international relations.\n                                  ____\n\n       The following transcript of the Question and Answer period \n     has been provided by the Council on Foreign Relations. The \n     moderator is former Congressman Vin Weber.\n       VW: Thank you. It's my job to screen questions for the \n     Senator without trying to get too much between the questioner \n     and the answer. Under the rules of these engagements, when I \n     call on you will you please stand up and state your \n     affiliation, and try to state your question as concisely as \n     possible. To get things going, though, I'm going to take the \n     prerogative of the Chair and ask the first question.\n       Senator, you talked at some length about some possibilities \n     in terms of relationships around Russia and other places. \n     Talk about a place where there might be some strains, the \n     American people at least are being fed a significant diet of \n     negative information about our relationship with the Saudi's \n     and their relationship to terrorism over these past many \n     years. Is there a deeper problem there than we thought, and \n     how should the American people and the government think about \n     that relationship?\n       JB: I've been admonished to make the answers very, very \n     brief, so I will make them brief, if you want me to expand I \n     will attempt to do that. Number one, I do not doubt the \n     pressure that the Saudis are under, like other Arab states in \n     the region, having to essentially buy off their extreme \n     groups in order to maintain themselves. But the Saudis have \n     gone above and beyond the call in destabilizing the region, \n     in my view, in terms of essentially funding a significant \n     portion of what we are now dealing with in the extreme \n     example of Islam gone awry. It's one thing to decide you're \n     going to export Wahhabi Sunnism, by setting up Madrassas \n     around the region. Okay, I get that. But what I don't get is \n     setting them up where they have a third feature: that they're \n     a hate-filled, anti-American breeding ground.\n       I think we should have a very simple, straightforward \n     discussion with the Saudis and they should understand that \n     they have a hell of a lot more to lose in the break up of the \n     relationship than we do. That is taking a great risk. I am \n     not sanguine about the fact that we get 1.6 million barrels \n     of oil a day from there, but I would be prepared, were I the \n     Secretary of State, or I was in another position, to tell the \n     Saudis: Don't push it. Don't push it. Cease and desist on \n     this activity. There will be consequences. At any rate, \n     that's my view.\n       SR: I'm Steve Robert of Robert Capital Management. As I \n     listened carefully to your address, which I thought was very \n     good, it seems the center of gravity in the debate over \n     missile defense has changed. Because while the opponents of \n     missile defense prior to September 11th would have just \n     probably said it's a foolish idea and the wrong priority, \n     what you seem to be saying is that, it's almost inevitable if \n     we also cut nuclear arms stockpiles, renegotiate the arms \n     control treaty and the strategic arms treaty and so forth. So \n     is this in fact what you mean to communicate, that we're now \n     just talking about how we get to missile defense, as opposed \n     to whether we should have missile defense at all?\n       JB: What I'm suggesting is, and it's a very good question, \n     what I'm suggesting is, we should be prepared to explore, \n     assuming we can amend the ABM Treaty to do the exploration, \n     whether or not a viable missile defense system is feasible \n     without starting a new arms race, and without producing an \n     economic hemorrhage of a half a trillion dollars with little \n     return on our investment.\n       Right now we're caught between the rock and the hard place. \n     In order to go forward, according to this administration--and \n     I think they're inaccurate--but the gentleman sitting behind \n     you has forgotten more about this issue than I am going to \n     know. But in order for them to go forward with the testing \n     program they have in mind, they can do it without having to \n     violate the ABM Treaty. But it has become sort of religious \n     doctrine on the right that the ABM Treaty is, per se, bad. \n     I'm hopeful that we're at a place now, where the President, \n     if we in fact--and I happen to support significant further \n     reductions in all offensive capability--if we get the Joint \n     chiefs to agree upon a number significantly below where we \n     are, I'm willing to go along with an amendment of the ABM \n     Treaty, assuming that we have scrubbed this in a way that we \n     understand what the likely response in China will be to such \n     a system.\n       If in fact, notwithstanding the fact that the Russians \n     would agree, this will start a significant--and our \n     intelligence agencies publish widely, and I can only tell you \n     what was in the paper, only confirm . . . I won't confirm, \n     I'll state what's in the paper--that they will do ten times \n     as much as they would have otherwise done in offensive \n     capability if we build such a system. If we cannot get \n     through that wicket, then it seems to me it is not worth a \n     candle. The cost is not worth it, and the consequence of \n     going forward with the limited benefit that would flow from \n     it may very well start that arms race which I worry most \n     about in the most dangeorus part of the world. It was \n     dangerous before, and it's considerably more dangerous now.\n       So I cannot fathom India sitting by if China rapidly racks \n     up their nuclear capability, and I cannot figure Pakistan \n     doing the same, and so I see it as a disaster. But this is a \n     beginning step, and I guess the polite way of saying this, \n     I'm happy the President seems to be moving in the direction \n     where he may not unilaterally walk away from the ABM Treaty. \n     That's a big deal.\n       VW: I want to go to Rita next, but if there are other \n     questions on either strategic defense or the ABM Treaty, I'll \n     take them now, before we leave that topic. If not, we'll go \n     to Rita.\n       RH: Rita Hauser. You didn't mention Iraq. Do you see Iraq \n     in the second stage as a target for the terrorists counter-\n     offensive, and what is your view on the continuation of our \n     policy of sanctions?\n       JB: I happen to think that the sanctions policy needs to be \n     changed. The Secretary of State has discussed a smarter \n     sanctions policy. I thought he was going in the right \n     direction, I was hoping that it would be embraced, although I \n     now think there's an opportunity to embrace it because the \n     dynamics have changed in Moscow, and the dynamics have \n     changed in France, and the dynamics have changed in China \n     somewhat, and I would further explore going back to that \n     approach, that is, a smart sanctions policy.\n       I'm of a view that what has changed has all been bad from a \n     Iraq standpoint, for the Iraqis. The idea now that we are \n     going to just disregard what Saddam has done, walk away and \n     just seek economic opportuinty, as some of our friends and \n     allies have done, I think is being reconsidered in those very \n     capitols. Rather than have a second phase, the way in which \n     the press uses it, and I assume you're talking about, that \n     is, after we finish with Afghanistan, do we invade Iraq? I \n     think that is not the prudent approach. I think what we \n     attempt to do is to build a coalition, reconstruct a \n     coalition that is tighter and stronger and with more demands \n     placed upon the behavior of Iraq.\n       My view is, if we're able to do that, and the behavior is \n     still as bad as it has been in the past, you will be able to \n     much more likely generate a consensus on at least standing by \n     as we took action, or having multilateral action. But to just \n     go from here to there I think would be a disastrous mistaken \n     in the near term.\n       VW: Go back to that table. I'm going to try to move the \n     audience as best I can.\n       FW: Frank Wisner from the American International Group. The \n     current crisis . . . (Overlap)\n       JB: Why are you taking folks out of Delaware? We want to \n     talk about that . . . (Laughter) . . . I want to know this, \n     Mr. Ambassasdor, this a parochial, this a serious stuff. \n     (Laugher) I'm only joking . . . (Overlap)\n       FW: . . . we have commitment . . . (Overlap)\n       JB: . . . I just want to kind of throw you off. (Laughter)\n       VW: . . . He's not really joking. (Laughter)\n       JB: . . . Former Congressman, I can tell you, I'm worried \n     about it, but . . .\n       FW: Senator, coming back to the subject of your terrific \n     speech today, (Laughter) . . .\n       JB: It went from good to terrific. (Laughter)\n       FW: This crisis has brought to light other tensions, and \n     among them has been the sparking of tension between India and \n     Pakistan, with very heavy Indian shelling, acts of\n\n[[Page S10974]]\n\n     terror in Kashmir. As you look at that aspect of the \n     challenge to American diplomacy, what message do you have to \n     the parties in the region, how they can get on top of the \n     problem they have and the role the United States can play?\n       JB: Let me answer it in reverse order. The role of the \n     United States. The United States should stay engaged the way \n     the Secretary has gotten engaged in the last week. It's made \n     a difference already. I think there has to be a clear \n     understanding, both in Delhi and Islamabad that we are \n     interested, we are looking and we are watching.\n       Secondly, I think a message should be delivered very \n     strongly to the Indians, do not attempt to take advantage of \n     the circumstances this moment, it's against your interests \n     across the board. And thirdly, we have to make clear to the \n     Pakistanis that, notwithstanding the fact we need you very \n     much right now, you are in a position where if you are going \n     to continue to foment the terror that does exist in Kashmir, \n     then you are operating against your own near term interests, \n     because that very viper can turn on you. And I think we have \n     to talk and talk and talk and talk, and engage and engage and \n     engage. Because as you well know, part of the cry on the part \n     of India has been, just somebody pay attention . . . or \n     excuse me, in Pakistan, someone pay attention.\n       And on India, we don't want any part of anybody being \n     involved and looking at any of this problem. The truth of the \n     matter is, the whole world is looking at their problem now in \n     Kashmir, not just us, the spotlight is on and the \n     consequences for how they will be treated relative to all \n     other nations in the world is very much up in the air right \n     now, and they should be made constantly aware of how tenuous \n     the circumstance is for both of them. In this case, \n     particularly India . . . in my view, particularly India.\n       VW: Can I follow up on that myself? Because at the \n     beginning of this administration, the administration seemed \n     to be tilting, to use a term, toward India, the Indian \n     Foreign Minister was given a meeting with the President, and \n     it seemed as if the administration was going to try to, as \n     one of the cornerstones of their foreign policy, build a much \n     better relationship with India than we've had in the past. In \n     view of what you just said, do you think that that was then, \n     and this is now, or is there still an opportunity going \n     forward to forge a much closer relationship with the Indians?\n       JB: I think that was then, and it's almost still that way \n     now. (Scattered Laughter) And let me explain what I mean by \n     that. I may be mistaken, and I may be a bit cynical, but I \n     think the initial, quote, tilt toward India was related to \n     Beijing more than it was to Pakistan or anything else. And I \n     think that the relationship with Beijing was going south very \n     rapidly. And continued to move south in a precipitous way \n     until Powell made his visit.\n       I coincidentally happened to take a small delegation of \n     Senators to some very high level meetings for six days in \n     China, just on the heels of that visit, and you could \n     literally see, maybe a mild exaggeration, a sigh of relief on \n     the part of the Chinese, that maybe this collision is not \n     inevitable, it is not inevitable. I think it chastened the \n     Chinese a little bit, I think it made them focus on the \n     precipice, as well as us.\n       Now what's happened is, I think, you have, and it's a . . . \n     I cannot prove this, I think what you have in India now is a \n     look north and saying, whoa, it looks like these guys are \n     talking again. We may have moved past our opportunity to make \n     a substantial change in the relationship. That would be a \n     mistake on their part, to think that. Because I think that \n     there is a desire in the administration to actually, \n     genuinely better relations with India. I think it is an \n     absolute essential element of American foreign policy that \n     that be done. And part of that is simply engaging . . . \n     engaging them and treating them like what they are. They \n     will, in not too long, be the largest, most populous nation \n     in the world. They are a democracy, as flawed as you may \n     think it is. They are someone with whom we should and must \n     have a much, much, much better relationship and \n     understanding.\n       And the whole world has changed for India. It has changed \n     not only when the Wall came down, and when their protector \n     evaporated, it changed now as the relationship with China \n     begins to mature, and they're going to have some great \n     difficulty internally figuring out how to deal with that. But \n     we should be engaged at the highest level on a daily basis, \n     literally with India. So I don't think the administration is \n     jettisoning India, but I think they're beginning to look at \n     India in a different way, not as cynically as just a card to \n     have been played against Beijing.\n       VW: Questioner behind Frank, then I'm going to try to go \n     the back of the room for a question.\n       ME: Monsoor Ejaz. Senator, it's always good to hear you \n     speak so frankly, so I'm going to try and get you on the \n     record on another sensitive issue. Does the United States \n     need a military policy to deal with an eventuality in which a \n     Taliban-like force would hold control over Pakistan's nuclear \n     weapons? And if it does, what should that policy look like?\n       JB: Well, I think we're engaged in that policy right now. \n     And I have every reason to believe from my conversations with \n     the President, and I don't pretend to be his confidant, I \n     don't want anyone . . . I know you all know that, but the CNN \n     audience might think I'm trying to foist myself off as the \n     President's close advisor. I've been flattered the President \n     has engaged me as the opposition and as Chairman of the \n     Foreign Relations Committee, and we've had, as they say, full \n     and frank discussion, probably five, six hours worth in the \n     last several months, and . . . but my impression and my \n     understanding is, coming from both the Secretary of State as \n     well as the Secretary of Defense and as well as the President \n     of the United States personally, that that is the essence of \n     their policy at the moment.\n       It is reflected in certain ways. You see, and I'll be very \n     parochial, and I'm going to give you a specific example. \n     Right now there has been, and continues to exist, a real \n     dissatisfaction on the part of the Northern Alliance that we \n     have not done, which is fully without our capability to do \n     now, and that is with air power, essentially provide air \n     cover that could decimate the Taliban capability of holding \n     them back, not only from Mazar i Sharif, but also holding \n     them back from the capitol.\n       And the President has not been as blunt as I'm going to be, \n     because I don't speak for him, so I can say it, I believe the \n     President's actions have been somewhat circumspect for very \n     good reasons. He understands that if in fact the Northern \n     Alliance marches into Kabul and sets up a government, that we \n     will have the potential for a disintegration in Islamabad, \n     and that Pakistan may very well, and Musharraf may in fact \n     collapse, it may be gone.\n       And so I think that . . . I'll give you that as one example \n     of my view of the President's understanding of how difficult \n     this is. We have also done things which were not particularly \n     comfortable for me to do, quite frankly. I'm the guy, as \n     Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, that was \n     responsible for either facilitating and/or proposing the \n     lifting of all the sanctions, of which I have supported \n     relative proliferation, not to proliferation questions, as \n     well as democratization. And we've even looked at Section \n     508, and so my point is that we have taken extraordinary \n     actions, which is sort of against our instincts, with only \n     the promise, only the promise of elections a year from \n     now, with the commitment to be kept, and only the hope, \n     the hope that we will be able to stabilize, that the \n     region will, with our help and others, be stabilized in \n     such a way that we don't have to face that God awful \n     specter of radical Islamic groups taking over a country \n     that is multiple sizes larger than Afghanistan, with \n     nuclear weapons.\n       So I think the administration is fully appraised, fully \n     understands, and is doing everything within its power, \n     understanding, and I don't . . . in defense of the \n     administration, no one has a hole card here. No one that I \n     know, maybe some of you do, and if you do, let me know \n     because I want to nominate you for the Nobel Peace Prize in \n     advance. No one I know has a surefire way to assure that \n     stability in this part of the world will result from the \n     actions undertaken. Conversely, I don't know of anyone who . \n     . . I do know of some, I don't know anyone in this room would \n     like to suggest we should not and need not have taken the \n     action we are taking. We're not going to get into the weeds \n     here. It's going to start to get . . . we talked, and I hope \n     I don't offend anybody saying this, at our table here, we \n     talked about how long the honymoon, how long the \n     unquestioning period of unabashed support for the President's \n     policy will continue. I think everyone . . . I shouldn't say \n     everyone . . . I mean the vast majority of the foreign policy \n     establishment, of the Democratic and Republican sides of the \n     aisle, in fact share the view that up to now the President's \n     done a pretty darn good job of assembling this multilateral \n     force, resisting what were very strong entree's from parts of \n     the administration to bypass Afghanistan and go straight to \n     Iraq, et cetera. I think he's done well. But now we're going \n     to get into the tough calls.\n       Case in point, and I'll stop with this. How much longer \n     does the bombing continue? Because we're going to pay every \n     single hour, every single day it continues, we're going to \n     pay an escalating price in the Muslim world. We're going to \n     pay an escalating price in the region. And that in fact is \n     going to make the aftermath of our, quote, victory more \n     difficult to reconstruct the region. Conversely, the \n     President's in a very difficult spot. How much does he have \n     to do to make the environment in which we are going to send, \n     and we will, American forces, hospitable to the extent . . .)\n\n       (Council on Foreign Relations tape turned to side B . . . \n     several seconds missing . . .)\n       . . . tell you, though, I hope to God it ends sooner rather \n     than later, becasue every moment it goes on, it makes the \n     aftermath problem more severe than it is . . . was an hour \n     ago. And so that's what I mean when I say they're fully \n     appraised of their problem. They are going to engage in \n     activities that we may . . . I may be able to Monday morning \n     quarterback and second guess, but I know of no clear path \n     that suggests how they secure the notion that there is no \n     possibility of Pakistan degenerating into chaos, and us \n     dealing with a problem there. The ultimate answer would be, \n     if that were the case, we would find ourselves with a whole \n     hell of a lot more forces in that region than we have now, \n     which would be a very bad idea.\n       VW: Going to go right straight to the back of the room, and \n     then I have a question at the middle table up front.\n\n[[Page S10975]]\n\n       DG: I'm Davey Gaw(?), with the conference board. Senator, \n     you gave us a picture that was historic, and it raised the \n     question in my mind, to this effect. Is there an advertising \n     problem, is there a genuine insoluble intellectual issue, or \n     simply have we not solved the following? It seems to me that \n     for the past 50 years or so, the U.S. has always been stuck \n     in a corner, on the one hand we launch into the world with \n     noble causes, and then we tie ourselves to ignoble regimes so \n     that we have (Inaudible) for purposes, but people think that \n     we're married to these regimes, and the same thing is \n     occuring now in the Middle East. What's wrong? Why can't we \n     do a dual track strategy? Why can't we send a message that's \n     credible, that we do serve double purposes on the one end, \n     but we also do not want to marry ignoble regimes on the \n     other? Why can't we solve that issue?\n       JB: Because life's tough (Scattered Laughter) There are \n     hard choices. I don't know. I don't want to get him \n     in trouble, but I suspect Les Gelb may remember, about a \n     dozen years ago, my proposing we start to distance \n     ourselves from some of those various regimes, and for \n     example, during the Gulf War, one of the reasons I voted \n     against the resolution that was put forward was, I did not \n     get any commitment from the administration personally that \n     they would in fact make sure that when we freed Kuwait, \n     the circumstance in Kuwait would change. I did not see \n     merely putting the Emir back in power as anything that \n     inured to our great benefit. The territorial principle of \n     not crossing a border was a big deal, and important and \n     oil mattered, but it seemed to me we should have extracted \n     in return for that some commitment toward the movement \n     toward, some movement toward, not outright democracy, but \n     some movement toward a liberalization of the system.\n       I have been the odd man out on that for a long time with \n     regard to Saudi Arabia as well, and other countries in the \n     region. But I acknowledge to you, it is incredibly difficult \n     to do. And you got to be prepared to take a risk, and the \n     risk is serious. The down side is high. The costs \n     economically are severe. But I think we're at the point now \n     where we have to take those risks. But it's not easy. It is \n     not easy because the truth of the matter is, we inherited \n     what was there, we helped make and sustained what was there, \n     but we did it for reasons relating to our immediate self \n     interests that were of consequence to us, enabling us to do \n     other things in other parts of the world that were necessary \n     to be done.\n       So, it's, yes, as a former President once said, life ain't \n     fair. Well, the world ain't fair, and we're left with a lot \n     of Hobson's Choices. If I can elaborate on one piece. This \n     dissemination of information, I put together a proposal that \n     I've been discussing with the administration. I've been sort \n     of the guy who has, and a lot of you have as well, but I mean \n     in the Senate, in the House, I've been sort of the godfather \n     of the radios lately, Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty, the \n     Voice of America, et cetera. It's woefully underfunded. For \n     example, in the largest Muslim state in the world, where they \n     have 220 million people, we spend two million dollars on the \n     radio, for example. So I put together a proposal at the \n     President's urging, quite frankly, because one of the things \n     I discussed with him, that I'm going to present to him when \n     he gets back, is over a half a billion dollar initial \n     investment, 250 million dollars a year, for public diplomacy, \n     and fundamentally altering the way in which we're able to \n     broadcast to that part of the world. As part of this, I asked \n     my staff, and I have some very talented staff people who know \n     the region well, have worked in the region, and are very \n     academically qualified as well as practically qualified, if \n     they would get together some two or three or four of the most \n     knowledgeable folks on Islam in the world, so that we in \n     fact, when I propose this, I was doing something that was \n     counterproductive. So that we wouldn't find we were causing \n     more problems than there were solutions. And I sat with these \n     four folks, I'll tell you what they said to me. Now, they're \n     not the end of the day, but they said to me, they said, look, \n     the idea of winning the hearts and minds of the Islamic \n     world, and the Arab Islamic world is not likely. The best you \n     can do is give some reasons for the moderates within that \n     regime to have a reason to sustain their position against the \n     extremists in . . . did I say regime? I meant to say region, \n     against extremists in the region. And they went on to say, \n     the problem isn't with the American people, it's with \n     American foreign policies, and then they ticked off the \n     foreign policy. Being part of propping up regimes that in \n     fact are anti-democratic and are part of the problem, because \n     again, Osama Bin Laden is after Riyadh, not after Jerusalem.\n       And it's a different problem. And also they then point out \n     Israel, and they say part of the problem relates to our \n     policy relative to Israel. Well, there are certain things \n     we're not going to change. There are certain things we're not \n     going to change, so the question is, what utility would a \n     significant investment in our public diplomacy have? And it \n     seems to me the minimum what it would have, it would give a \n     context in which we were able to . . . they were able to make \n     judgments about the totality of our action, and would not in \n     fact change the attitude in that part of the world toward us, \n     but would moderate it. And so these are very difficult \n     questions, though, but I am going to propose we make this \n     major investment, and I think it will fall on, quite frankly, \n     friendly ears in the administration, based on my \n     conversations with the President.\n       VW: Is there an opportunity to take that a step further to \n     the whole foreign policy budget of the government, the United \n     Nations that you've been involved in, support for our \n     embassies abroad that's been underfunded for some time, \n     foreign aid budget, is that a part of the whole response?\n       JB: No, because . . . and I'm not being . . . I didn't mean \n     to be so sure. (Laughs) I don't mean . . . (Overlap)\n       VW: . . . short answer (?) . . .\n       JB: . . . that's right. (Scattered Laughter) Now, well . . \n     . the answer is no for the following reasons. For the federal \n     government to engage in public diplomacy at home is a very \n     dangerous thing, in my view. For us to fund news \n     organizations that promote a governmental position, it seems \n     to me is not what we need, domestically in the United States. \n     But we do need it abroad. What will change, and has changed \n     that, as Ambassador Negroponte knows, he not only . . . I \n     mean, I love the guy. We held him up for God knows how long \n     before we approved him, so everybody made sure any accusation \n     ever against wouldn't rub off on them, and they all turned \n     out to be false, and we approved unanimously, wasn't it? I \n     don't think anybody voted against it. And he went up there \n     and did something no one's been able to do, including Prince \n     Holbrooke, no one's been able to do this. (Laughter) And you \n     know what he did? He went up and there and got immediately \n     the right wing Republicans to free up the money in the House. \n     You know what did that? The world changed. They did not want \n     to have to, as former Senator Carol Moseley Braun would say, \n     wear the jacket of us not being able to put together a \n     coalition because he was unable to do his job in the United \n     Nations because he had to face the constant charge that we \n     weren't meeting our end of the deal.\n       So I think events alter those kinds of things and I think \n     you're going to see foreign policy much more on the front \n     burner of American domestic politics for the reasons that \n     were stated at the outset, that we'll, in fact, up those \n     budgets and people are beginning to understand the \n     complexity. It's not all military, it's diplomacy. We have to \n     lead in other ways, and I think that will be helped by this \n     terrible circumstance.\n       VW: Senator Biden, thank you for . . . (Overlap)\n       DG: I'm Dick Garwin, Council on Foreign Relations. Thank \n     you for an insightful and constructive presentation. Now, on \n     the ABM Treaty and missile defense, I can just say Amen, but \n     the rest of the topics you mentioned, we need to have not \n     only some priorities, but more than that. That administration \n     and the Congress are going to have to do a number of things \n     together. First, it seems to me that we have to have refugee \n     camps, and the refugee camps have to be training grounds for \n     democracy. So, we need to work with the United Nations to do \n     this, and to accomplish that. We need to provide security, \n     but we need to provide more than security.\n       The next priority I think has to be the chemical and \n     biological weapons conventions, especially the BWC . . . \n     essentially all the nations of the world have signed up, but \n     they're not all obeying it. They're not all doing what they \n     said. Before we have any compliance, we've got to have them \n     say, we're going to do this, we're passing a law, everybody \n     has to stop affiliating with biological weapons and we're \n     going to destroy our stocks. Seems to me that's the next. And \n     finally, in my talk, is the Pakistani nuclear weapons. You \n     read in the New York Times Bruce Wehr(?), saying we ought to \n     provide means of going in, and capturing them in case \n     Pakistan regime falls. Well, we'll get a lot more cooperation \n     if we fund Pakistani regime in order to destroy their own, or \n     render them ineffective if the regime falls, and with uranium \n     weapons that can be done in reasonably expeditious fashion. \n     But how do you solve the problem of priorities, and doing a \n     number of things at the same time which neither \n     administrations nor Congress are good at?\n       JB: Let me tell you, I fully agree with your list, I \n     shortened my speech on the fly here, I'll give you a copy of \n     it, it mentions all three of those things, particularly the \n     biological and chemical weapons treaty and the \n     implementation. And I think you do just what you said. Those \n     discussions are underway with the Democratic Congress and the \n     Republican members of Congress and the President on setting \n     those priorities. The question is, the President has an \n     internal dilemma he has to overcome first. He is focusing on \n     first things first, but then he has to deal with . . . and \n     I'm going to get in trouble for saying this . . . but he has \n     to deal with what has not gone away. There is, for lack of a \n     better phrase, still a Rumsfeld-Powell split on how they \n     look at the world, and how they look at these very issues \n     that you've stated here. I was discussing here at my \n     table, my perception, and maybe, what's that old \n     expression, the father is . . . the wish is the father of \n     the thought, or whatever it is, that maybe I'm just sort \n     of making this up as I go along because I want to feel it. \n     But my impression is, this President is arriving at his \n     own foreign policy. He is arriving at his own foreign \n     policy. I think he accepted wholesale sort of the movement \n     right position on foreign policy issues, because as a \n     Governor he hadn't paid much attention to those. And I \n     think he's finding that those as a prescription don't fit \n     the modern day world as easily as he thought they may.\n       And so I see the first thing that has to happen is the \n     President himself has to decide\n\n[[Page S10976]]\n\n     what he thinks about these issues. And I hope we throw in \n     CTBT here, because I think to me that is one of the . . . \n     that is the single most important thing we could do at the \n     front end. But . . . Vin is looking at his watch, \n     understandably, I happen to agree with you. With regard to \n     priorities, Dick Lugar and I are going to be introducing this \n     week after call for a commission that is, I know we got a lot \n     of commissions, but a commission made up, appointed by the \n     President, the House and the Senate, made up of the leading \n     people in America that we could find with the greatest \n     stature, to come forward with us with a threat assessment, a \n     threat assessment that in fact reflects, for purposes of \n     deciding what priorities we should be focusing on. And so I \n     can talk to you more about that later, but my time is . . . \n     (Overlap)\n       VW: I don't know if we have time for one or two more, but \n     one there, and if there's time for two, it's over there. Les \n     is telling me only one, I'm sorry to say, (inaudible).\n       M: (inaudible) Talbot(?). Senator, thank you for this broad \n     guarded approach to the problems we face. My question is \n     this, do you foresee the need or the expectation of a \n     Congressional declaration of war, which the Constitution \n     calls for, and if so, against whom? (Scattered Laughter)\n       JB: The answer is yes, and we did it. I happen to be a \n     professor of Constitutional law. I'm the guy that drafted the \n     Use of Force proposal that we passed. It was in conflict \n     between the President and the House. I was the guy who \n     finally drafted what we did pass. Under the Constitution, \n     there is simply no distinction . . . Louis Fisher(?) and \n     others can tell you, there is no distinction between a formal \n     declaration of war, and an authorization of use of force. \n     There is none for Constitutional purposes. None whatsoever. \n     And we defined in that Use of Force Act that we passed, what \n     . . . against whom we were moving, and what authority was \n     granted to the President.\n       And why don't you take that question, it's not two o'clock, \n     I'll give a yes or no. He may be from Delaware. (Laughter)\n       RP: Roland Paul, Senator, I concur with everybody else in \n     commending you on your comments, and anyone who's heard you \n     before would certainly not be surprised at how good they \n     were. I would return to a question you answered earlier, and \n     you said as long . . . the bombing, every day it goes on, the \n     harder it may be for us to do something in the past(?). What \n     do you see as the situation if we don't defeat the Taliban in \n     the next four weeks, and winter sets in in Afghanistan?\n       JB: Again, I'm not a military man. I think the American \n     public and the Islamic world is fully prepared for us to take \n     as long as we need to take, if it is action that is mano-a-\n     mano. If it's us on the ground going against other forces on \n     the ground. The part that I think flies in the face of and \n     plays into every stereotypical criticism of us is we're this \n     high tech bully that thinks from the air we can do whatever \n     we want to do, and it builds the case for those who want to \n     make the cause against us that all we're doing is \n     indiscriminately bombing innocents, which is not the truth. \n     Some innocents are (indiscriminately) bombed, but that is not \n     the truth. I think the American public is prepared for a long \n     siege. I think the American public is prepared for American \n     losses. I think the American public is prepared, and the \n     President must continue to remind them to be prepared, for \n     American body bags coming home.\n       There is no way that you can in fact go after and root out \n     al-Qaeda and/or Bid Laden without folks on the ground, in \n     caves, risking and losing their lives. And I believe that the \n     tolerance for that in the Islamic world is significant . . . \n     exponentially higher than it is for us bombing. That's a \n     generic point I wish to make. I am not qualified enough to \n     tell you, although I can tell you what the military guys have \n     said to me, this is not 1948. This is 2001, I'm not at all \n     they're correct, and our ability to wage conflict in the \n     winter, in parts of this region, is within our control, I \n     don't know enough to vouch for that or not, but I do think it \n     clearly makes it more difficulty, and the weather window is \n     closing, as opposed to the tolerance window for a behavior, \n     in my view. Thank you all very, very much. (Applause)\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from Delaware for his clarification, \nalthough there was none required on my part.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I knew it would not be required on the Senator's part.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I have the greatest admiration for the extraordinary \nexperience and leadership provided by the Senator from Delaware. I am \nnot surprised he was misquoted, and I think he is wise. He speaks from \nexperience in coming to the floor to ensure if there is any \nmisunderstanding it has now been clarified.\n  He did it in a way I would expect. He has come to the Chamber with a \ncomplete explanation. I have read some of the remarks because after \nbeing asked the question, I was informed of the Senator's comments. I \napplaud him for the way in which he handled the questions and applaud \nhim as well for his speech. I appreciate his willingness to come to the \nChamber, and I thank him for the extraordinary job he does every day as \nchairman of our Foreign Relations Committee.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Very briefly in response, I thank the Senator. I know the \npublic listening to this would say they expect two guys who are friends \nand in the same party to say the same thing, but the truth is we are \nall going to be tested over the next several months. The President of \nthe United States, who we all think is doing a very fine job, is going \nto have to make some very tough decisions.\n  I, for one, and I know my two leaders and the Senator from Oregon as \nwell are not into Monday morning quarterbacking. Some of the decisions \nwe are going to make are going to turn out to be brilliant. Some we are \ngoing to make are not going to be so good.\n  I would say this: This President, in my view, so far has made the \nright choices. He has done the right thing. He is pursuing the right \nway. This notion of how long we bomb versus how long before we put \nforces on the ground is an incredibly difficult decision. You can be \nassured every single mistake we accidentally make--and by the way, to \nour credit the Defense Department acknowledged today, like no other \nDefense Department would, I think, that, yes, there was an errant bomb, \nand it did take out some innocent people. What other great nation would \nacknowledge that?\n  That is going to happen. It is horrible that it will, but the \nPresident has a series of very tough choices. I want him to know that \nnot only I, but we all wish him well, and as long as he is trying, as \nhe is, to keep this coalition together, to keep it moving, I am willing \nto yield to his judgment in the prosecution of this war.\n  So I thank my friend for his kind comments, and I hope this puts it \nto rest. I am sure the gentleman on the House side who made the \ncomments was probably told by staff, and I think it was kind of like a \ndrive-by shooting because I have never had a cross word with this \nparticular House Member, but I understand things got pretty hot in the \nHouse today. I think I was the first Democrat who came across his \nradar, and I think this would be called a political drive-by shooting--\naccidental, I hope--and it will get straightened out.\n  I am not criticizing or making light of what was said. I want the \nRecord to be straight because it is important the world knows and the \nNation knows we are behind the President and we are not at this point \nsecond-guessing his judgment, particularly about bombing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/24/senate-section/article/S10976-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10976]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

ROBERTSON, JR.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I wish to take this opportunity to \nrecognize and say farewell to an outstanding Air Force officer, General \nCharles T. ``Tony'' Robertson, Jr., upon his retirement from the Air \nForce after more than 33 years of commissioned service. Over the years, \nmany Members and staff have enjoyed the opportunity to meet with \nGeneral Robertson on a variety of joint military issues and have come \nto appreciate his many talents. Indeed, throughout his career, General \nRobertson has served with distinction, and it is my privilege today to \nrecognize his many accomplishments and to commend him for the superb \nservice he has provided the Air Force and our Nation.\n  General Robertson entered the Air Force in 1968 as a graduate of the \nU.S. Air Force Academy. After successfully completing pilot training, \nhe served his Nation by flying 150 combat missions as a gunship pilot \nin Southeast Asia while stationed with the 18th Special Operations \nSquadron in South Vietnam. Lieutenant Robertson was then assigned to \nWright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, where he became a B-52 co-pilot, \naircraft commander, instructor\n\n[[Page S10977]]\n\npilot, and flight examiner with the 17th Bombardment Wing. Moving on to \nOffutt Air Force Base, Nebraska, he first became Assistant to the Chief \nof Staff, then Aide and Executive Officer to the Vice Commander in \nChief, Headquarters, Strategic Air Command. His next assignment was to \nPlattsburgh Air Force Base, New York, as an FB-111 Aircraft Commander, \nFlight Commander, and Assistant Operations Officer.\n  As a lieutenant colonel, he served as a Plans and Programming Officer \nin the Air Force Programs and Evaluation Directorate at the Pentagon \nbefore returning to Plattsburgh Air Force Base, in 1982, as Commander, \n529th Bomb Squadron, and then as Assistant Deputy Commander for \nMaintenance, 380th Bombardment Wing. After completing studies at the \nNational War College at Fort McNair in Washington D.C., he was promoted \nto colonel in 1985.\n  During that same year, Colonel Robertson returned to the Pentagon to \nserve as Executive Officer to the Air Force Vice Chief of Staff, \nHeadquarters U.S. Air Force. He went on to become Commander of the 2nd \nBombardment Wing, Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, in 1987, then \nCommander of the 384th Bombardment Wing at McConnell Air Force Base, \nKansas, in 1989. As Commander of the 384th, Colonel Robertson was \nhonored as the Strategic Air Command Outstanding Wing Commander of the \nYear for 1989. Following his tour at McConnell, he returned to Offutt \nAir Force Base where he served as Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff, \nPlans and Resources, Headquarters Strategic Air Command, and was \npromoted to Brigadier General in 1991.\n  As a general officer, General Robertson excelled in a number of key \nassignments, including Director of Personnel Plans, Headquarters U.S. \nAir Force and then Vice Director of the Joint Staff, Joint Chiefs of \nStaff at the Pentagon; Vice Commander, Air Mobility Command, Scott Air \nForce Base, Illinois; Commander, 15th Air Force at Travis Air Force \nBase, California; and culminating with his current assignment as \nCommander in Chief, United States Transportation Command, USTRANS- COM, \nand Commander, Air Mobility Command, AMC.\n  Over his career, General Robertson demonstrated his skill as an \naviator by safely accumulating over 4,700 hours of flight time in the \nAC-119K, B-1B, B-2, B-52, C-5, C-9, C-17, C-20B, C-21, C-37, C-130, C-\n141, EC-135, FB-111A, KC-10, KC-135, T-1, T-6, T-37, T-38, and T-39 \naircraft.\n  As Commander in Chief, USTRANS- COM, General Robertson's leadership \nhas been indispensable to the readiness of the Defense Transportation \nSystem to accomplish its mission, getting troops to the fight, \nsustaining the fight, and then bringing the troops back home when the \nfight is over. As a tireless ``Total Force'' advocate, his commitment \nto fully integrating guard and reserve forces into all aspects of the \nCommand has reaped great dividends and great praise. Recognizing the \nessential role of our commercial transportation industry in supporting \nthe USTRANSCOM mission, General Robertson lifted this partnership to \nunprecedented levels through such critical programs as the Civil \nReserve Air Fleet, the Maritime Security Program, and the Voluntary \nIntermodal Sealift Agreement. Following the terrorist bombing of Khobar \nTowers, and then again after the attack on the USS COLE, the global \nforce protection programs he developed for his always ``in-transit'' \nforces were held as the model for others to emulate.\n  His factual and pointed testimonies before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee illustrated the professionalism and expertise which has \nenabled him to foster exceptional rapport with all members of the \nSenate and was a clear indication of his ability to work with the \nCongress in addressing the priorities of his Command. Finally, as \nevidence of his clear vision for the future, he diligently labored to \nensure programs such as follow-on C-17 procurement, C-5 modernization, \nand airlift defensive systems were in-place to ensure the \ntransformation of the mobility fleet to meet the challenges of \ntomorrow.\n  An exemplary officer of unmatched skill and talent, General Robertson \npersonifies the Air Force core values of integrity, selfless service, \nand excellence in all things. I offer my congratulations to him, his \nwife, Brenda, and sons, Sean and Jason. The Congress and the country \napplaud the selfless commitment his entire family has made to the \nNation in supporting his military career.\n  I know I speak for all of my colleagues in expressing my heartfelt \nappreciation to General Robertson. He is a credit to both the Air Force \nand the United States and I congratulate him on the completion of an \noutstanding and successful career. May God continue to bless Tony, his \nfamily and the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/24/senate-section/article/S10977-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I rise today to speak about \nhate crimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of \nthis year. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred April 20, \n2000 in Stafford, VA. Thomas Rivers, 18, allegedly attacked a 15-year-\nold gay teenager by bashing him in the back of the head with a metal \npole, almost killing him. The previous year, after Rivers learned that \nthe younger boy was attracted to him, Rivers lashed out by shouldering \nhim in hallways at school, shouting slurs and spitting on him. The \nattack came eight months later when Rivers saw the boy walking in an \narea park.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/24/senate-section/article/S10977-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10977-S10978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF BREAST AND CERVICAL CANCER TREATMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I would like to remind the Senate that \nOctober is not only Breast Cancer Awareness Month, but also the first \nanniversary of the enactment of the Breast and Cervical Cancer \nTreatment Act. As we take time this month to remember all those who've \nlost their lives to this tragic disease, we must also celebrate the \ngreat strides we've made in diagnosing and treating breast cancer in \nwomen from all walks of life.\n  As many of us remember, the Centers for Disease Control has long \noperated a program to provide low-income uninsured women with coverage \nfor cancer screening. Since its creation in 1990, the CDC's Breast and \nCervical Cancer Early Detection Program has proved a great success, \nproviding over one million mammograms to women 40 years or older \nthrough March 1999. Of these, over 77,000 were found to be abnormal and \n5,830 cases of breast cancer were diagnosed. Additionally, through \nMarch 1997, 300 cases of invasive cervical cancer were discovered in \nover 700,000 pap tests.\n  Despite this high rate of success, the Early Detection Program \ncontained a fatal flaw. The CDC program provided no treatment options \nfor low-income, uninsured women who tested positive for breast or \ncervical cancer. Instead of receiving the help they needed, the women \ndiagnosed with cancer under this program were left to find treatment \nfor themselves. Unfortunately, early detection is pointless unless it \nis followed by immediate and vigorous treatment.\n  To address this shortcoming, I joined with Senators Barbara Mikulski, \nOlympia Snowe, and others to sponsor legislation to allow individual \nstates the option of providing treatment through their state Medicaid \nprograms. As enacted, the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act \nprovides enhanced federal matching funds to states that choose to \noperate a treatment plan for women diagnosed under the CDC program. \nInstead of imposing a new federal mandate, the bill offered positive \nincentives and tangible funding options to those states whose \npopulations are most in need.\n  Today, on the 1-year anniversary of the enactment of this momentous \nlegislation, I'm proud to tell you that the Act has been a great \nsuccess. Over the\n\n[[Page S10978]]\n\ncourse of the past year, thirty-three states have already begun using \nthe enhanced federal matching funds to provide treatment to women \ndiagnosed with breast or cervical cancer through the CDC screening \nprogram. Women across America are already benefiting from treatment \nprogram in these thirty-three states.\n  I am especially proud to note that Rhode Island was one of the first \nto join. In fact, Governor Lincoln Almond, his wife Marilyn, and the \nDirector of Rhode Island's Human Services Department, Christine \nFerguson, were strong and tireless proponents of the Breast and \nCervical Cancer Treatment Act. By leading the charge for this bill at \nthe state level, the Governor and his Human Services Director \nhighlighted once again why Rhode Island has one of the best health-care \nsystems in the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/24/senate-section/article/S10978-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL LEE SELVES\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to pay tribute to Oregon native, Michael Lee Selves, an \nAmerican hero and patriot whose distinguished service to our Nation \nspanned 32 years. Michael's life was tragically cut short on September \n11, 2001, when American Airlines flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon. \nMichael Selves served this great Nation as both an officer and civilian \nwith the United States Army. Mr. Selves entered the Army in 1969, and \nduring his illustrious career selflessly defended freedom at duty \nstations in Europe, Korea, and across the United States. Rising to the \nrank of Lieutenant Colonel before leaving military service, he was \nadmired and respected by superiors and subordinates alike as a gifted \nand caring leader of soldiers. His numerous decorations include the \nLegion of Merit and three Meritorious Service Medals.\n  As a Department of the Army civilian, Mr. Selves brought his \nleadership skills to the office of the Administrative Assistant to the \nSecretary of the Army. His vast skills were quickly recognized as he \nwas appointed Director of the Army's Information Management Support \nCenter. Under his leadership, a cohesive team of information technology \nprofessionals was formed that produced the highest score for customer \nsatisfaction within the Pentagon. The actions of his subordinates in \nthe hours immediately following the attack on the Pentagon attests to \nhis leadership. Despite Mr. Selves' absence, and extensive damage to \nthe automation infrastructure, they were able to restore services \nwithin 70 hours.\n  On behalf of his family and many friends, let the record show that \nthe Congress of the United States of America honors the memory of \nMichael Lee Selves and the ultimate sacrifice he made for our grateful \nNation. My thoughts and prayers are with his family members, especially \nhis wife and parents, Jack and Florence Selves, and will remain with \nthem in the months to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/24/senate-section/article/S10978-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10978-S10979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        SENATOR CORZINE'S RECORD\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, on financial matters, our \ncolleague, Mr. Corzine, has an unparalleled record. He worked his way \nto the top of the financial world on his own merit. He started as a \nbond trader and ended up 20 years later as chairman and chief executive \nofficer of Goldman Sachs, one of Fortune magazine's 10 best companies \nin America. In terms of economics and business, he knows of what he \nspeaks. After conquering the hurdles of the financial world, he has \nbrought his expertise to the Senate. Albert Hunt outlined Jon Corzine's \nbackground and philosophy on the economic stimulus package being \nconsidered by Congress in the Wall Street Journal on October 11, 2001, \nand I ask this article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n         [From the Wall Street Journal, Thurs., Oct. 11, 2001]\n\n                    A Senator Who Has Met a Payroll\n\n\n                          politics and people\n\n                          (By Albert R. Hunt)\n\n       Which person is better for advice on stimulating the \n     economy: A professor who has spent most of his adult life on \n     the public payroll, or a business executive who headed one of \n     the world's most successful investment-banking firms?\n       Phil Gramm or Jon Corzine? These two senators have \n     decidedly different approaches to an increasingly faltering \n     economy in the wake of last month's terrorism.\n       Sen. Corzine, a freshman Democrat from New Jersey who used \n     to be chairman of Goldman Sachs, wants a $150-billion-a-year \n     stimulus package focused on security spending initiatives and \n     temporary tax cuts to boost consumption. Republican Sen. \n     Gramm, an economics professor at Texas A before his 23 \n     years in Congress, wants large and permanent individual and \n     corporate tax cuts directed at upper-income Americans.\n       President George W. Bush moved toward Mr. Gramm's position \n     when he declared additional stimulus should be limited to \n     more tax cuts.\n       This appeals to the GOP's ``pitchfork-and-torch'' crowd--\n     indeed, Mr. Gramm is its intellectual leader in Congress. But \n     the Corzine approach is eminently preferable. It is closer to \n     the goals articulated by congressional budget committees, as \n     well as the public and private testimony of Federal Reserve \n     Chairman Alan Greenspan and former Treasury Secretary Bob \n     Rubin: Economic stimulus should pump money quickly into the \n     economy on a temporary basis, not adversely affect longer-\n     term fiscal discipline. President Bush's focus tax cuts fails \n     those tests; Sen. Gramm's proposals are worse.\n       ``The overarching issue,'' said Sen. Corzine over breakfast \n     this week, ``is to get a lot of fiscal stimulus now and avoid \n     fiscal disaster in the long term.''\n       A corporate tax cut now, the investment-banker-turned-\n     senator notes, is misdirected: It rewards previous \n     investments more than encouraging new ones. Better would be \n     short-term accelerated depreciation to encourage new \n     investments.\n       The Bush administration is pushing a ``middle class'' tax \n     cut to reduce the 27% tax rate next year to 25%. That's \n     bogus. This rate applies to everyone with taxable income \n     above $46,700. So for a construction worker making $65,000, \n     with $50,000 of taxable income, the tax cut would total $66. \n     But for anyone making more than $150,000, with taxable income \n     of over $112,850, it'd be a $1,300 tax cut.\n       As economic stimulus, this idea flounders even more on \n     efficacy than equity. Studies demonstrate lower-income people \n     spend more of their disposable income, and what this economy \n     needs is more consumption. Sen. Corzine, worth $400 million \n     earlier this year, rejects the GOP's upper-income-oriented \n     tax cuts: ``The wealthy, including myself, are not going to \n     change spending habits with such tax cuts.''\n       Making new tax reductions permanent would aggravate \n     persistently high long-term interest rates, he asserts. The \n     opposition to temporary tax cuts by the likes of Glenn \n     Hubbard, chairman of the president's Council of Economic \n     Advisers, is situational; only a few years ago Mr. Hubbard \n     co-authored a paper arguing ``temporary investment incentives \n     can have even larger short-run impacts on investment than \n     permanent investment incentives.''\n       Further, the initiatives launched by the White House would, \n     Sen. Corzine notes, ``give almost nothing to the people \n     who've been in the front lines--the cops, the firemen who \n     climbed those stairs at the World Trade Center, the grunts \n     who did the cleanup work. That's wrong.''\n       Sen. Gramm questions whether extending jobless claims ``has \n     anything to do with stimulus.'' It's true the unemployed \n     won't put any added money in the secret foreign bank accounts \n     Sen. Gramm has so eagerly protected, but they'll do something \n     more contributory with the money: They'll spend it. The \n     stinginess of the Bush proposals on this score is stunning. \n     If the economic downturn is comparable to the recession of \n     the early 1990s, the president's proposed $5 billion limited \n     extended jobless claims would be less than one-fifth the $28 \n     billion spent on such measures a decade ago, calculates Bob \n     Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n       Sen. Corzine is sympathetic to support for expanded jobless \n     benefits and more health insurance coverage for the \n     unemployed--although he doesn't suggest, as the White House \n     does, that we should take some of it out of the Children's \n     Health Insurance Program. He thinks a better approach, \n     however, is temporary ``revenue sharing'' with fiscally \n     pressed state and local governments, which would head off \n     counterproductive budget cuts or tax hikes. ``If we don't do \n     this, much of the stimulus at the federal level will be cut \n     away by state and local tax increases,'' he says.\n       He favors major spending investments to bolster the \n     deteriorating economy, geared to the terrorist threat. These \n     include a new federal aviation authority air-control system; \n     major investments in transportation infrastructure, such as \n     bridges and tunnels (``all of which could be terrorist \n     targets''); and assistance for more sophisticated \n     communications systems for local police and fire departments. \n     These spending priorities, he declares, should all be with an \n     eye to greater security.\n       The former banker is leery of bailing out the myriad \n     industries lining up at the federal trough. After a few \n     changes he voted for the airline bailout--``there are tons of \n     airline jobs in New Jersey''--but fears it wasn't well \n     crafted. He'd make at least one exception: You've got to do \n     something for the insurance industry, otherwise insurance \n     rates will be off the charts and unavailable.''\n\n[[Page S10979]]\n\n       On tax cuts, he would support a tax rebate for the lowest-\n     income people--some 30 million lower-income workers didn't \n     get any cuts in the tax bill enacted this year--but is \n     pushing what he believes is much better idea: a two year \n     ``holiday'' on a portion of employees' payroll taxes. It \n     would disproportionately go to those most likely to spend it \n     and, he argues, ``have a much bigger ongoing effect on \n     stimulus than a one-shot rebate.''\n       Jon Corzine agrees generally with his former partner, Bob \n     Rubin, on the shape of any stimulus, but disagrees on the \n     size. ``Bob is too cautious,'' he worries. ``If we're too \n     cautious on the short end, it will come back to haunt us on \n     the back end.''\n       But they're in complete agreement that as central as the \n     need for short-term assistance is the need for long-term \n     fiscal discipline. This is not possible without modifying the \n     huge tax cuts for the wealthy slated to take effect over the \n     next decade. Warns the former top Wall Street executive: ``If \n     we don't change the back end of those tax cuts we will have a \n     fiscal train wreck no matter what we do now.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/24/senate-section/article/S10979-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNITION OF WORLD POPULATION AWARENESS WEEK\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I would like to take this time to \nrecognize the week of October 21-28 as ``World Population Awareness \nWeek.''\n  Rapid population growth and urbanization have become catalysts for \nmany serious environmental problems. They are applying substantial \npressures on infrastructure, manifested especially in pollution, \ntransportation, health, sanitation, and public safety problems. These \nall make urbanization an issue we cannot afford to ignore. Cities and \nurban areas today occupy only two percent of the earth's land, but \ncontain half of the world's population and consume 75 percent of its \nresources.\n  Therefore, it is important for us to recognize the problems \nassociated with rapid population growth and urbanization. Governor \nLincoln Almond has proclaimed the week of October 21-28 as ``World \nPopulation Awareness Week'' in Rhode Island. I ask that Governor \nAlmond's proclamation be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n    State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations--Gubernatorial \n                              Proclamation\n\n       Whereas, world population stands today at more than 6.1 \n     billion and increases by some one billion every 13 years; \n     and,\n       Whereas, the most significant feature of the 20th century \n     phenomenon of unprecedented world population growth was rapid \n     urbanization; and,\n       Whereas, cities and urban areas today occupy only 2% of the \n     earth's land, but contain 50% of its population and consume \n     75% of its resources; and,\n       Whereas, the most rapid urban growth over the next two \n     decades is expected in cities with populations ranging from \n     250,000 to one million; and,\n       Whereas, along with advantages and amenities, the rapid \n     growth of cities leads to substantial pressure on their \n     infrastructure, manifested in sanitary, health and crime \n     problems, as well as deterring the provision of basic social \n     services; and,\n       Whereas, World Population Awareness Week was proclaimed \n     last year by Governors of 32 states, as well as Mayors of \n     more than 315 United State cities, and co-sponsored by 231 \n     organizations in 63 countries; and,\n       Whereas, the theme of World Population Awareness Week in \n     2001 is ``Population and the Urban Future''; now,\n       Therefore, I, Lincoln Almond, Governor of the State of \n     Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, do hereby proclaim, \n     October 21-28, 2001, as World Population Awareness \n     Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/24/senate-section/article/S10979-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MILTON FIRE DEPARTMENT\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, on November 14, 1901, after more than a \ndecade of effort by a group of concerned citizens, the Volunteer Fire \nCompany of Milton, Delaware was organized. The Town Council elected \nCharles H. Davidson as the first Fire Chief, and 26 men signed up as \nvolunteer firefighters. R.B. Hopkins was named President.\n  In remembering the founding of the company, its current president, \nLynn Rogers, rightly noted that, although the formal Ladies Auxiliary \nwas not organized until years later, the women of Milton provided vital \nsupport to the town's fire service from the very start.\n  By a vote of 76 to 33, the citizens of Milton voted to purchase a \nfire truck, and the Town bought a Howe chemical and water engine, with \nthe then hefty price tag of $1,250. In 1902, there was another \npurchase, a Fire King hose cart that can still be found at the Milton \nfire station today.\n  It wasn't long before the resources of the Milton Fire Company and \nits members were tested to their fullest; a disastrous fire struck the \ntown in August of 1909. In just four hours, with the firefighters and \nthe citizens working together against it, the fire raged through the \nlower part of Milton, destroying 18 buildings in the business district.\n  It was the kind of devastation that challenges the spirit and \ncharacter of a community, just as we have been challenged as a nation \nthis fall. And in the tradition of the American spirit and the American \ncharacter, Milton came back, with its Fire Company helping to lead the \nway.\n  The Milton Fire Department has been a leader in the Delaware \nVolunteer Firemen's Association from the first meeting in 1921; the \ncurrent President of the DVFA, Dale Callaway, is from Milton. The \nDepartment's leadership has been marked by incredible dedication, with \nofficers who regularly serve for 25 years or more. Just one of many \npossible examples of this dedication, was when Linwood ``Jim'' Rogers \nasked to be replaced after 41 years as Treasurer, Denny Hughes took \nover, and he continues to hold the office 23 years later.\n  Over the years, the Milton Fire Department has grown with the town, \nwith a new building dedicated in 1950, an additional property purchase \nin the 1960s and a renovation and addition in the early 1980s. An \nambulance service has grown, from the first ambulance purchase in 1948, \nto the dedication of members of the Ladies Auxiliary in the 1970s, who \ntook ambulance attendant courses to ensure quality service.\n  Lynn Rogers made another comment at the 100th anniversary celebration \nthat I would like to cite. He said, ``The fire service of Delaware is a \nfamily. We no longer grow as one department; the fire service grows \ntogether; we depend on each other more every day, with the specialized \nemergencies that we all face.''\n  Even beyond the family of our small State, to the broader community \nof our Nation, we have learned that lesson together in recent weeks--\nthe depths of our bond to one another, how we depend on each other, and \nthe debt and support we owe to those we rely upon in an emergency.\n  The great tradition of the fire service is alive and well in Milton, \nDE, and as we approach November 14th, the 100th anniversary of the \nMilton Fire Department, I am proud to share the pride of Delaware, and \nto convey the congratulations of the United States Senate, to Chief \nJack Hudson, President Lynn Rogers and all the members and friends of \nthe Milton Fire Department and Ladies Auxiliary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/24/senate-section/article/S10979-3", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10979-S10980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:07 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 980.

Focusing \non the NATO Alliance's Prague summit in November of 2002, the bill \nendorses the vision of a Europe whole, undivided, free and secure. \nIndeed, this bipartisan vision has guided U.S. policy toward Europe for \nthe last fifty years.\n  It's a vision that President Clinton helped to make a reality through \nthe integration of Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary into NATO.\n  It is also a vision so powerfully reaffirmed by President George W. \nBush in Warsaw this past June.\n  Some hoped that the tragic events of September 11 would weaken the \nNATO Alliance. In fact, quite the opposite has happened. It has \nreinvigorated awareness on both sides of the Atlantic that NATO, an \norganization of collective defense, remains vital to the interests and \nvalues of the community of democracies. Moreover, the atrocities of \nSeptember 11 have reaffirmed the need for the Alliance to move \ndecisively forward on its agenda of enlargement, military \nmodernization, and enhancements of its capacities against weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  Today, we can build on NATO's fifty years of joint military planning, \ntraining, and operations as the foundation for U.S. and European \ncooperation in the war against terrorism. Consolidating the zone of \npeace, democracy and security in Europe should be the cornerstone of \nour integrated global strategy against the threats of the 21st century.\n\n[[Page S10981]]\n\n  NATO enlargement must, thus, remain a leading priority of American \nforeign policy.\n  Recently, the heads of state of European democracies seeking NATO \nmembership gathered in Sofia, Bulgaria, to explore how they can more \neffectively contribute to Euro-Atlantic security. Even more important \nis the fact that these democracies are conducting themselves today as \nde facto members of the NATO Alliance. Their troops stand shoulder to \nshoulder with U.S. forces keeping the peace in the Balkans. They were \namong the first to offer their services, including not only the use of \ntheir bases, but even the deployment of their own troops in this war \nagainst terrorism.\n  The most recent round of NATO enlargement, which was ratified by the \nSenate with an overwhelming 80 votes, has proven to be a success. \nPolish, Czech, and Hungarian membership have strengthened the Alliance. \nTheir integration into NATO has enhanced European security and \nstability. And contrary to NATO nay-sayers their integration into NATO \nhas helped to normalize not only their bilateral relationships with \nRussia, but also relations between Russia and the West.\n  I am confident that the Alliance's summit in Prague next year will \ninitiate the next round of enlargement, which will strengthen the \nAlliance. It will help reverse the historic wrongs of Yalta, and it \nwill bring us that much closer to fulfilling the vision of a Europe, \nwhole, free and secure.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider supporting the Freedom Consolidation \nAct of 2001, and I urge them to do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/24/senate-section/article/S10981-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1922.
