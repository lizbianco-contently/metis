Mr. President, I ask consent that the pending issue be set \naside temporarily so I may make an opening statement on my leader time, \nwithout anybody losing their rights.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank Senator Daschle and Senator Murkowski for allowing \nme to do this.\n  We are soon going to be proceeding with the amendments on this very \nimportant issue. I have said several times, and I believe it and mean \nit sincerely, that having a national energy policy is one of the two \nmost important things we will try to accomplish this year. After \nproviding adequate needs for the defense of our country and in the war \nagainst terrorism, having a national energy policy is the next most \nimportant. While a lot of other issues are critical and we need to \naddress them, this is a very serious matter.\n  I focus today on my belief that American dependence on foreign oil \ndirectly threatens our national security and our freedom. I think it is \neven bigger than that. It is also about economic freedom. If we do not \naddress this question in a very broad and comprehensive way, the time \nwill come--maybe even this summer once again--when we will have rolling \nbrownouts, and someday, perhaps, blackouts, as well as gas lines again. \nWe need a comprehensive, broad, national policy to avoid that. If we do \nnot do that, we could get to a situation where, for some reason, \nforeign oil imports should be cut off or a high percentage should be \ncut off or we decide we will not continue to be dependent on Iraqi oil, \nor any number of upheavals could affect us immediately. It could affect \nnot only our lifestyles but affect the economy and the jobs on which \npeople depend. Energy is essential to the creation of jobs, whether in \nthe steel industry, the poultry industry, agriculture, or fisheries on \nthe Gulf of Mexico where I live.\n\n  I am beginning to think there are people who believe when you flip \nthe switch and the power comes on, it magically appears out of this \nwire. Somewhere behind that wire are a lot of things we need to have. \nWe need to have transmission lines. We need to have a plant somewhere \nthat is creating that power that is wheeled through those lines. And \nthe energy that fuels that plant has to come from somewhere.\n  In this bill that we are starting off with, I think we have a very \nbad product. I am not going to belabor the process of how we got here, \nbut it seems to be a continuing, changing process. The Energy Committee \ndidn't act. The Commerce Committee couldn't act on the CAFE standards. \nThe Finance Committee did finally get together and it produced a $15 \nbillion tax incentive package, but there is some concern about whether \nor not that should be offset or how it would be offset. So there is \ngoing to have to be a lot of work done on this bill to make it \nacceptable.\n  I think in the bill as it starts out, far too much is dependent on \nconservation and alternative fuels and not wanting to sufficiently \naddress the production side. I think we need both. I am for encouraging \nconservation with incentives. I am for alternative fuels. I am for \nrenewables. I am for using tax incentives to get these marginal wells \nback in production. But I also want the other side of that equation. I \ndon't think we can conserve ourselves into an energy policy or, by \nreducing what we use, not be threatened by this energy area.\n  I hope we will work to come up with a comprehensive package at the \nend that is worth voting on, to send it on to conference. The Senate \nhas been developing a pattern now of starting off with bad bills or \npartisan bills. When you do that, you are almost destined to get to a \npoint where you cannot get a result.\n  We have not been able to move forward on energy for a year but now, \nthank goodness, we are going to have this full debate. I am \nappreciative of that, although I am very worried about the way it is \nstarting. It smells like a stimulus bill or an agriculture bill in \nterms of how it is written. Maybe that will not be the case. I, for \none, have started out by saying: Let's not focus on the negative. Let's \njust go forward and do our work. Let's have amendments, let's have \nvotes, let's improve this bill. I may be disappointed in the end and \nsome people will come to me and say: See, I told you so, you can't fix \nthis thing.\n  But I am like Nehemiah in the Bible in building the wall. He believed \nthe wall could be built. The people didn't believe it, but they trusted \nhim and they kept working and kept working and they built the wall. We \nare trying to build a wall here, and this wall is an energy policy for \nour country.\n  So I do think there is a problem that affects our national security \nin the first instance. There are a lot of explanations why we do not \nhave a national energy policy. We can blame a lot of people. There will \nbe those who quickly say: Blame your neighbor's SUV. I have one. I have \nthree grandchildren. I like them to be able to ride in the same vehicle \nwith me. Or blame the oil companies--oh, the polluters. What do they \nthink we are going to drive the economy with without oil and natural \ngas and coal and nuclear--the whole schmear. Or the automobile makers, \nit is easy to blame the automobile makers.\n  Unfortunately, we blame the domestic ones more than we do even the \ninternational ones--I am not criticizing them because they are putting \ntheir plants in America and we are glad to have them. They can help us, \nperhaps, produce better automobiles that have better fuel economy. I \nhope it is not done just by cutting them in half, which is what you get \nwhen you go in Europe. I can't even get into those things they have \nover there, or any of the other usual scapegoats.\n  Before we do that, just consider this fact. America is one of the \nleading energy-producing countries in the world. This country has the \ntechnology, alternative resources, and enough oil and natural gas to \nmake itself much more self-sufficient. America does not have to revert \nback to the practices of the 1970s. The country is faced with a serious \nproblem because previous Congresses and previous administrations--blame \neverybody--didn't do what needed to be done in this area because it was \ntoo hard. These issues are not easy, trying to come up with an \nagreement that will provide a positive result. Whether it is in the \nfuel efficiency area, in the production area--every one of them is very \ndifficult to work out to an agreement and compromise that will pass.\n  As a result, crude oil production is down significantly in this \ncountry as consumption continues to rise. America now imports 56 \npercent of the oil it consumes, compared to 36 percent at the time of \nthe 1993 Arab oil embargo. We had long gas lines and we had huge \ndebates in the Congress, particularly in the Senate, over what to do \nabout our energy needs. We acted as if we thought maybe we had done \nenough. Obviously it didn't work because our dependence on foreign oil \nhad gone up.\n  At the rate it is going, the Energy Department predicts America will \nbe at least 65-percent dependent on foreign oil by 2020. That alarms me \nand I bet it does most Senators--and most Americans, when you think \nabout it--when we are dependent on oil that comes from some very \ndangerous parts of the world, in many cases, or some cases very \nunstable governments.\n\n  We cannot continue down this path. This bill has to be passed so that \nwill not be what happens. We need a national energy policy that will \nenhance national security by reducing this dependence on foreign energy \nsources. We need a policy that provides incentives for the use of \nnatural gas--a fuel which can burn cleanly in internal combustion \nengines and which is abundant within our borders, especially the Gulf \nof Mexico, right in front of my house where I live. It is out there. \nSome of it is being taken out of the gulf now. A lot more could be \ndone, but we have a huge battle to try to make use of areas such as the \nDestin Dome in the Gulf of Mexico, which I think is at least 100 miles \nfrom the shoreline. There is no\n\n[[Page S1555]]\n\nneed, no reason we should not pursue that. Natural gas is not oil, for \none thing. You don't spill it.\n  We should also call on America to utilize other domestic resources \nthrough incentives which encourage the use of marginal oil wells and \nthe billions of barrels of oil we have in Alaska. Likewise, we should \nnot ignore the use of renewable energy resources such as solar power, \nhydropower, or wind power. Can we get a substantial percentage of our \nneeds out of that area? I doubt it, although I think hydropower can \nproduce significant amounts. Maybe we can get some help from solar or \nwind. I doubt if we will ever exceed 3 or 4 or 5 percent, but that is \nnot small potatoes. Let's do that, too. However, Congress must \nacknowledge that America cannot realistically run only on renewable \nenergy resources. We must be realistic and provide a bridge to our \nenergy future.\n  Despite the most advanced technology and ingenuity, tomorrow's energy \nsources will not answer the energy needs of today. Coal, oil, and \nnatural gas remain our most abundant and affordable fuels, and they can \nbe used in environmentally sound ways.\n  My State doesn't produce a lot of coal. We have some lignite, and we \nare beginning to make use of it. But I believe clean coal technology is \nout there. I believe we can use coal and use it in a much cleaner way. \nWe need to have encouragement to do that. Some 55 percent of the \nelectricity generated in the United States comes from coal-fired, steam \ngenerating plants. Coal can make a significant contribution to U.S. \nenergy security if the environmental challenges of coal-fired plants \ncan be met. Congress should enact legislation which will provide \ncredits for emissions reductions and efficiency improvements.\n  We are going to have that in this bill. Some are in it and I hope \nthere will be even more. Congress must also provide incentives for \nindependent producers to keep their wells pumping. Tax credits for \nmarginal wells will restore our link to existing resources, including \nmany in my own home State of Mississippi. We are not a big oil \nproducing State, but we do have some oil and the wells are pumping now. \nThe wells are marginal, but they can produce five barrels a day which \ncan make a difference.\n  These wells are responsible for 50 percent of the U.S. production. We \nshould give even more incentives to keep that percentage at least in \nplace.\n  We also need to increase the availability of domestic natural gas, \nwhich is the clean alternative for coal in electric power plants. \nFederal land out West may contain as much as 137 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas. Similarly there is Federal land in Alaska which is \nestimated to contain 16 billion barrels of domestic crude oil. None of \nthese facts should be surprising.\n  There has to be a solution to this problem. Some would say that all \nwe need to do is improve energy efficiency and reduce energy \nconsumption.\n  Is that the way we do things in America? No. In America we make \nthings better--more efficient and better. Are we saying you have to \nlearn to live with less and that we can't have it as we did? That is \nnot the American spirit. We can produce more. We can be more energy \nefficient. We can do all of it if we make up our minds to do it.\n  While there is a place for energy efficiency incentives in developing \na natural energy policy, we must not starve our economy of the energy \nit needs to maintain and improve our standard of living. In the long \nrun, a national energy policy that looks at all realistic sources of \nenergy must be developed.\n  This is not the 1970s. America has better technology, more efficient \nand cleaner automobiles, as well as more energy options. The question \nis, How long will we forgo these options and be held hostage to nations \nabroad or extremists at home who do not want us to do what can and \nshould be done? America must tap the vast resources we have. America \ncan solve its energy problems but Congress must act in the interests of \nthe entire Nation, rather than a select few, or with a defeatist \nattitude. Providing families the security and freedom they deserve \ndepends upon stable, reliable, clean, and affordable energy. America \nbadly needs a comprehensive, but realistic, national energy policy, and \nwe need it now.\n  I say again that while I might object to the content of the bill we \nare beginning with and the process used to get here, we are on it. So \nlet us make our opening statements. Let us get the amendments started. \nLet us see if we can't produce a bill that we can send to conference \nand get this job done.\n  The President of the United States wants us to do this. He knows we \nhave to do it. He raised it in a meeting just yesterday. He didn't say \nyou have to do it this way or that way. I know he wants us to get \naccess to oil in ANWR and other places in this country. I know he wants \nus to have a realistic CAFE standard. But he is not saying you have to \ndo it my way to get it done.\n  Mr. Chairman and Senator Murkowski, let's roll.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Republican \nleader for his statement. While there are some things that might divide \nus on the issue, there is a lot he just said that I agree with \nwholeheartedly. This country needs an energy policy. We ought to be \nmoving forward. We can do both in terms of comprehensive conservation \nand comprehensive production incentives. So I thank him for the spirit \nin which he has begun this debate.\n  For those who have expressed some concern about the way this bill \ncame to the floor, I will just say that this is the way the last energy \nbill came to the floor in May and June of the year 2001. But I want to \naddress very briefly the amendment I have just laid down.\n  One of the most significant, responsible ways in which to increase \nproduction and improve our Nation's energy security is to build a \npipeline to bring natural gas from Alaska to the lower forty-eight \nstates.\n  There are 35 trillion cubic feet of known natural gas reserves on the \nNorth Slope of Alaska. Right now, that gas is being pumped back into \nthe ground because we have no way of getting it to people. In the \nenergy bill we are now debating, Senator Bingaman and I have proposed a \n2,000-mile long gas pipeline that would create 400,000 jobs, use an \nestimated 5 million tons of U.S. steel, and ensure that we do not \nbecome dependent on imported liquefied natural gas. If we want to \ncreate jobs, increase our energy security, and help the U.S. steel \nindustry, building this pipeline is the way to do it.\n  Last week, Alaska Governor Tony Knowles suggested some refinements in \nthe legislation that would ensure that American workers, and in \nparticular, Alaskans, get the greatest benefit from this project.\n  In particular, Governor Knowles urged us to ensure that the pipeline \nfollow what is known as the southern route down the Alaska Highway. \nThis will ensure that much of the pipeline is constructed in Alaska and \nthat it avoids the environmental pitfalls that construction could have \non the fragile northern Alaska environment and the Beaufort Sea.\n  Second, he asked that we clarify the rules for State and federal \ncooperation, to ensure that the development of the pipeline proceed as \nsmoothly as possible. Both of these issues are addressed in the \namendment we are offering today. Other changes that Governor Knowles \nhas requested include guaranteeing access to the pipeline for new \nnatural gas producers that may arise in the future, protecting the \nability of Alaskans to have access to the natural gas that will be \ntransported in the pipeline, and establishing a tax incentive to reduce \nthe risk associated with natural gas price volatility.\n  Senator Bingaman is working closely with others to develop language \non these issues, and I would expect the final product of these \ndeliberations to be added to the energy bill prior to final passage.\n  Energy for America, jobs and opportunity for Alaskans, and no damage \nto sensitive environmental areas should all be goals to which we can \nsubscribe. This legislation, and this amendment in particular, allow us \nto do that with even greater confidence.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n     Amendment No. 2980 to Amendment No. 2917, As Further Modified\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have a modification of the amendment at \nthe desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment is modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2980), as modified, is as follows:\n       Insert the following after Section 704(d):\n\n[[Page S1556]]\n\n       ``(e) Prohibition on Certain Pipeline Route.--No license, \n     permit, lease, right-of-way, authorization or other approval \n     required under Federal law for the construction of any \n     pipeline to transport natural gas from lands within the \n     Prudhoe Bay oil and gas lease area may be granted for any \n     pipeline that follows a route that traverses--\n       ``(1) the submerged lands (as defined by the Submerged \n     Lands Act) beneath, or the adjacent shoreline of, the \n     Beaufort Sea; and\n       ``(2) enters Canada at any point north of 68 degrees North \n     latitude.''\n       Insert the following after Section 706(c):\n       ``(d) State Coordination.--The Federal Coordinator shall \n     enter into a Joint Surveillance and Monitoring Agreement, \n     approved by the President and the Governor of Alaska, with \n     the State of Alaska similar to that in effect during \n     construction of the Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline to monitor the \n     construction of the Alaska natural gas transportation \n     project. The federal government shall have primary \n     surveillance and monitoring responsibility where the Alaska \n     natural gas transportation project crosses federal lands and \n     private lands, and the state government shall have primary \n     surveillance and monitoring responsibility where the Alaska \n     natural gas transportation project crosses state lands.''\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me speak very briefly on the same \nissue that the majority leader raised.\n  I also believe it is very important for us in this legislation to \nfacilitate construction of this pipeline from the North Slope of Alaska \nto bring natural gas to the lower 48 States. This is an issue that my \ncolleague from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, has been urging for some \ntime. I know Senator Stevens, as well, strongly supports it. I know \nthat virtually all of us on the Energy Committee have believed \nconstruction of this pipeline needed to be a priority item as part of a \ncomprehensive energy plan. That is why we included it in the \nlegislation that is before the Senate today.\n  The amendment Senator Daschle has now offered would change what we \nhave in the bill in a couple of important respects. The main thing it \nwould do is ensure that the so-called southern route be chosen. This is \nagain something that I know all of the representatives from Alaska have \nurged on us. I know Governor Knowles has urged this in testimony before \nthe Energy Committee. He urged that this be done.\n  The bill we have introduced did not specify that the southern route \nwas the only option. We were route neutral in the bill that is before \nthe Senate because we believed that was an issue and a river we weren't \nready to cross. But at this stage, I think it is clear that this \nsouthern route, which was authorized in the previous legislation that \nwas passed in Congress a couple of decades ago, is part of our \ninternational treaty with Canada. It recognizes that there are \nenvironmental advantages if we follow this existing transportation \nroute.\n  I think there are substantial advantages to be argued in favor of \ndoing this southern route. I know it has been a priority for, as I say, \nthe Governor of Alaska and the Senators and the Representative from \nAlaska for a long time. I think it will improve the bill.\n  It will make it clear that the Senate is anxious to see the jobs \ncreated in Alaska and that it is anxious to see the economic benefits. \nIt recognizes that the environmental benefits are substantial as well.\n  I will support the amendment as it is proposed. I hope we can get \nstrong bipartisan support for it. As I say, it is one of those issues \nwe have debated for a long time. We brought the bill to the floor with \na route-neutral provision in it. Now that would change, but it would \nchange with my support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I hope my name will be added as a sponsor of \nthis Daschle-Bingaman amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have not had an opportunity to speak on \nthis legislation. I am going to speak generally about the legislation, \nbut in particular to this amendment. For those who are interested, I \nthink we have a clear description of what this legislation, as amended, \nwould do. Basically it brings the route down through Alaska. It is a \nroute of over 2,000 miles.\n\n  The amount of jobs it would create is very significant. It would \ncreate 400,000 new jobs. And this is an unbelievably large figure, but \nit is accurate. This is pipe that is more than 50 inches in diameter. \nWe would need 5 million tons of steel. I would hope it would be U.S. \nsteel: 5 million tons. It is hard for me to comprehend that, but that \nis what it would take.\n  The bill would provide $10 billion in loan guarantees for the \nconstruction of this pipeline and would bring 35 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas to the lower 48 States. That is significant.\n  We can all readily agree that the United States needs to lessen its \ndependence on foreign oil. The best way to reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil is to diversify our energy supply by developing renewable \nenergy resources. We also would hope to adopt a CAFE standard. My \nunderstanding is that there is a bipartisan agreement being worked out \nas we speak, if it has not already been worked out. We were close to \nworking it out yesterday. Senator Kerry and Senator McCain are working \nout something on CAFE standards. Another way to reduce our dependence \non foreign oil is to improve the energy efficiency of our homes and \nappliances.\n  That is how we can best lessen our dependence, reduce our demand on \nforeign oil: diversify our energy supply by developing renewable energy \nresources, adopt a CAFE standard, and improve the energy efficiency of \nour homes and appliances.\n  It is also obvious that the demand for natural gas is increasing \nworldwide. In the United States, natural gas consumption is expected to \noutpace current supply sources over the next 10 to 20 years, creating a \nshortfall of more than 6 trillion cubic feet by the year 2020. But \nremember, this legislation would immediately bring to the lower 48 \nStates 35 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. So we would not have the \n6 trillion cubic feet shortfall if we are able to produce this gas \nline.\n  In Nevada, 29 percent of our electricity needs are now met by natural \ngas, and that fraction will only grow over time. There is the \nconstruction now of a number of powerplants in Nevada to meet the needs \nof California and, particularly, Nevada.\n  Clearly, the future favors natural gas as a primary source of \nelectricity in our country. Rightfully, many fear the United States \nwill become as dependent on imported liquid natural gas in the future \nas we are on oil today. That is why this southern route is so important \nto our country.\n  I support the provisions of this act before us. I particularly \nsupport this amendment. This amendment would increase the supply of \ndomestically produced natural gas available to U.S. consumers by \nexpediting the construction of a natural gas pipeline from Alaska's \nNorth Slope to the lower 48 States.\n  I do not think there is a question of whether we are going to build \nthe pipeline; it is a question of where we are going to build it. That \nis why there has been a general agreement we need to go with the \nsouthern route, not the northern route, for a number of reasons, not \nthe least of which is the need to help Alaska as much as we can.\n  There is more than 35 trillion cubic feet of natural gas immediately \navailable in the Alaskan North Slope, gas that is pumped back into the \nground because we have no way of getting it to the people. That is \ninefficient. We save a lot of it by pumping it back into the ground, \nbut we do not save it all.\n\n  It is estimated that the total natural gas available from the Alaska \nNorth Slope is more than 100 trillion cubic feet. The pipeline would \nprovide natural gas to American consumers for at least 30 years, and it \nwould be a stabilizing force on natural gas prices.\n  We have heard a lot from my friend, the distinguished ranking member \nof the Energy Committee, Senator Murkowski, about how many jobs ANWR \nwould create. But the jobs ANWR would create are simply not as great as \nthese 400,000 new jobs. The pipeline would provide a significant \nopportunity for the U.S. steel industry, requiring up to 2,100 miles of \npipe and, as I have indicated before, 5 million tons of steel.\n  The Alaska natural gas pipeline is a responsible way to address our \nNation's growing demand for natural gas. It means energy independence \nand jobs, a winning combination.\n  We may have some disagreement with the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska on whether we should drill in ANWR, but there is no controversy, \ndispute, or question about the fact that we need to do everything we \ncan, as\n\n[[Page S1557]]\n\nquickly as we can, to bring the natural gas from Alaska to the lower 48 \nStates.\n  That is why the Governor of Alaska is totally supportive of what we \nare doing. Senator Stevens--and I am confident Senator Murkowski--\nsupport what we are doing. Of course, if there is something that is \nwrong with this amendment that does not meet the demands of Senator \nMurkowski, we would be happy to speak with him. But as far as I know, \nin the meetings that have been on his staff level, we are headed in the \nright direction.\n  This amendment has two parts. It would ban the so-called ``over the \ntop'' route for the pipeline--what we are talking about is, it would \nban this route shown on the chart here--by prohibiting the issuance of \nany of the necessary Federal permits.\n  Governor Knowles' testimony is significant. He testified before the \nEnergy Committee. Among other things, Governor Knowles said:\n\n       I respectfully suggest there are three essential components \n     of this vitally important legislation. First, the route must \n     be mandated along the Alaska Highway, as provided for in the \n     1976 Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Act. Second, this \n     legislation must build American industry and create American \n     jobs. Third, there must be economic incentives to attract the \n     private capital to the project which when completed will \n     substantially add to the national treasury.\n       There are many reasons why the route of the gasoline must \n     follow the existing oil pipeline from the Alaska North Slope \n     to Fairbanks and then the Alaska Highway through Canada to \n     Alberta.\n       It is currently authorized in ANGTA [Alaska Natural Gas \n     Transportation Act] and a presidential decision. It is part \n     of an international treaty with Canada. It recognizes the \n     environmental advantage of following existing transportation \n     corridors. It allows vitally important access to the gas for \n     the residents and businesses in Alaska. For these reasons, \n     this route has the broadest support among Alaskans of any \n     major project in recent history.\n       Additionally, there are serious concerns over the proposed \n     alternative route commonly known as the northern or ``over \n     the top'' route. This route would originate on the Alaskan \n     North Slope then proceed 240 miles under the ice-choked \n     Beaufort Sea to the Mackenzie River Delta and then up that \n     river drainage to Alberta.\n       First and perhaps the most significant opposition to that \n     route has come from the unanimous objections of the North \n     Slope Inupiat Eskimos. At a recent public hearing, their \n     corporate, community, and tribal leaders vowed they would use \n     every resource available to them to fight this route, which \n     would threaten their cultural and nutritional dependence on \n     marine mammals.\n       Second, both Alaskan and national environmental \n     organizations have said they too strenuously oppose this ill-\n     conceived frontier route. Calling for previously untested \n     technologies and risky ventures underwater, this project \n     could never be considered as a preferred alternative to an \n     existing land transportation corridor.\n\n  This is the Governor of Alaska. I quoted him verbatim.\n  The southern route, as he indicated, is authorized in ANGTA and is \npart of an international treaty with Canada. It recognizes the \nenvironmental advantage of following the existing transportation \ncorridors and allows access to gas for Alaskan residents.\n  There are serious concerns, environmentally and socially, over the \nnorthern ``over the top'' route. As indicated, the Northern Slope \nEskimos strictly oppose this. Environmental organizations oppose this.\n  For these reasons, the Alaskan delegation, to my knowledge, is \nsupportive of the southern route.\n  One of the myths that we have heard is the Alaskan natural gas \npipeline will create less jobs than drilling in the Arctic Refuge. We \ndo not need a battle over which creates the most jobs, but I do say \nthat the Congressional Research Service, which is an investigative arm \nof this body, estimates only 60,000 jobs would be created by drilling \nin the Arctic Refuge--only 60,000 jobs. I recognize that is a lot of \njobs.\n  Certainly, even for Nevada, a State that is probably three times the \npopulation of Alaska, 60,000 jobs would be a lot of jobs. I am sure the \nPresiding Officer, if he lost 60,000 jobs in Nebraska, would take note. \nHe would take further note though that the Congressional Research \nService reports that building the Alaska natural gas pipeline would \ncreate more than 400,000 new jobs according to industry estimates and \nrequire roughly 5 million tons of U.S. steel and 2,100 miles of pipe. \nThe energy bill would provide $10 billion in loan guarantees for the \npipeline.\n  This is a good amendment. It is not only a good amendment, it is a \ngood bill. This bill does some things important for the State of \nNevada. We have been very concerned about the FERC having too many new \nbroad authorities at the expense of State authority. In reality, under \nthis Senate bill, FERC is given limited authorities that both Democrats \nand Republicans have advocated for years to oversee the reliability of \nthe grid and require that all utilities play by the same transmission \nrules. California and Nevada were hurt significantly during the past \nyear by actions of FERC, and this certainly will not strengthen FERC's \nrole.\n  Some loopholes in FERC's merger review authority are filled, but the \nbill does not deregulate the electricity industry. In fact, some needed \nFERC authorities are strengthened, as indicated by both Democrats and \nRepublicans, to ensure markets can be relied upon to provide low-cost \nelectricity.\n  Another myth is that the Senate energy bill fails to exploit the \nNation's potential to produce and use oil and natural gas. In reality, \noil and natural gas will continue to play an integral role in the U.S. \nenergy policy. This bill before the Senate provides $4.6 billion in tax \nincentives for oil and natural gas and $10 billion in loan guarantees, \nas we have talked about this morning, to build the Alaska natural gas \npipeline which will bring 35 trillion cubic feet of natural gas to the \nlower 48 States.\n  Nevada has no coal. We are rich in other minerals. We are the third \nlargest producer of gold in the world behind South Africa and \nAustralia. We produce large quantities of silver and other precious \nmetals. We don't have any coal--good coal or bad coal--but we still \nunderstand the importance of coal in America.\n  The United States is the Saudi Arabia of coal. We have more coal than \nany other country. We want to overcome the myth that some are saying \nthis legislation will limit the use of coal in the United States. Quite \nto the contrary, the energy bill provides $1.9 billion in tax \nincentives for clean coal and establishes extensive clean coal research \nprograms. The bill will ensure the use of clean coal in the United \nStates and clean air in the future.\n  Outside Reno we have a power plant that was initiated with clean coal \ntechnology. It couldn't have been built with clean coal technology \nwithout the Federal Government helping Sierra Pacific Power do that. I \nam a big fan of using coal but using it in a different method than we \nhave used in the past. Clean coal technology is something we have to \nrely on and do more than what we have done before. This legislation \ncrafted by Senator Bingaman will allow us to do that.\n  I hope we can move this legislation as quickly as possible. We have \nso much to do in the Senate. The leader has said we are going to finish \ncampaign finance reform. We have all the many items we talked about for \nso long that we have to do, now that we are a little bit removed from \nSeptember 11, even though that still is our first fixation. \nPrescription drug benefits is something we have to work on. We have all \nthe appropriations bills to pass.\n\n  We recognize we need an energy policy. I commend and applaud the \nSenator from New Mexico, chairman of this committee, for this work of \nart, some would say, he has given to us. He has worked hard. We have a \ngood piece of legislation. I look forward to working with him and \nSenator Murkowski to come up with an energy policy for this country and \nmove this legislation out of the Senate, move it to the House where we \ncan have a conference, and come back with something for the President \nto sign.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the pending business before the Senate \nis Senator Daschle's amendment to the pending underlying bill, S. 517; \nis that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I join with Senator Stevens and certainly our \ncolleague on the House side, Representative Young, and commend the \nmajority for introducing this amendment that selects a southern route \nfor the development of natural gas from the State of Alaska.\n\n[[Page S1558]]\n\n  I believe that while we have supported without exception the \ndesignation of the southern route, the amendment in itself is not \ncomplete and does not represent the total interest of Alaskans. I will \nexplain that further.\n  First of all, it is appropriate to note that as far as the \nresponsibility of the Senate is concerned, we have finally met one \nresponsibility associated with the energy bill; that is, to have \nbipartisan support for the designation of the southern route. It is \nalso appropriate to recognize that the House initiated this some time \nago. It is in H.R. 4, the specific designation of a southern route.\n  I was very glad to see the leader was so anxious to bring this up as \nthe first amendment from the majority. It shows that Alaskans can \nprevail--our Governor, our Lieutenant Governor, Senator Stevens and \nmyself, Representative Young.\n  On the other hand, in the interest of full disclosure, it is \nappropriate to note that my objection, when the majority leader asked \nunanimous consent to terminate reading of the amendment, was that I had \nnot seen the amendment and believed it should have been read. I have \nseen the amendment and, as a consequence, believe that while the \namendment, certainly in general terms, addresses the bottom line--\nnamely, the southern route--it does not address what Alaskans want. \nWhat Alaskans want is a little broader series of alternatives.\n  I will be working with the majority in hopes that we can include that \nin the amendment. Of course, I will be a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  Specifically, what Alaskans want is to have alternatives for that \ngas, that 37 trillion cubic feet of gas that lies beneath the oil \nfields of Prudhoe Bay. What are those alternatives? They primarily are \nassociated with utilizing that gas in Alaska on several alternative \nroutes if, indeed, the economics support routing. As the President is \nwell aware, our oil goes down to Valdez, AK, through the 800-mile \npipeline and moves down the west coast of the United States to \nWashington, to California, where it is refined.\n  There has been for many years promotion of an idea that one of the \npotential markets for Alaska's gas--because there is every reason to \nbelieve we are going to find more gas than the 37 trillion cubic feet \nwe found accidentally hunting for oil--is the ability to liquefy that \ngas and either ship it down the west coast of the United States or ship \nit to the Orient. There have been projects where millions of dollars \nhave been expended exploring the route. Not too many people in this \nbody know that in the early sixties, the first LNG in Japan came from \nAlaska, a million tons a year. That contract has been renewed and a new \nfleet of ships has been built. Alaska is no stranger to exporting LNG. \nIt came from a field near Anchorage, and the reserves there are \nsomewhat limited or we would be exporting more LNG from that point.\n\n  The point of this discussion is to make sure that we are not solely \nbound to this southern route that is offered by the Majority Leader. I \nmight add that we are going to have some charts to show you because I \nthink it is important that you understand that the southern route, as \nit is conceived, from the Prudhoe Bay area, follows an existing \npipeline approximately down to Fairbanks. Then it takes off in \nFairbanks and goes down toward the delta area, where it branches off \nand goes to Valdez.\n  This amendment, in general, would cover the southern route, the \nhighway route. But we want to make sure it does not exclude, if you \nwill--because the possibility of exporting LNG is very real, and it has \nbeen promoted for some time--I want to make sure that is included as an \nalternative.\n  Secondly, we have every reason to believe that in the area associated \nwith Point Mackenzie in the Matanuska Valley, where they are putting in \na port development, that we have the availability of gas to come down \nfrom Fairbanks, perhaps under the railroad right of way, and come into \nthe particular area ahead of Cook Inlet and the Matanuska Valley, where \nthere is a port being built.\n  Then there is the recognition that Anchorage receives most of its gas \nfrom the fields of Cook Inlet and the Kenai area. We want to make sure \nAnchorage has access to this gas. Further, we have large petrochemical \nplants in Alaska--the only year-round manufacturing facilities we have, \nas a matter of fact, so we think they are large, but they are small by \nU.S. standards, like the ones down on the Kenai Peninsula. So I don't \nwant to see this amendment limited to strictly a southern route so that \nwould market the gas only through Canada and into the lower 48. We want \nthe market to dictate where this gas goes. It is important.\n  Unfortunately, the way this was handled, I can only assume that there \nis a process here that might involve a little politics. I was prepared \nto offer, in my amendment--which would mandate a southern route--that \nwould specifically contain alternatives that are certainly in the \ninterest of Alaska. I have not seen the correspondence from our \nGovernor or Lieutenant Governor to the majority. So I cannot comment on \nhow broad the request was from the standpoint of inclusion and having \nalternatives. But I know from my contacts with Alaskans they want \nalternatives, and they don't want to be limited by this amendment to \none specific designated southern route that would not allow the \navailability of those alternatives.\n  Let me put it another way. We want to make sure the market dictates \nthe alternatives of either bringing it down toward Anchorage, bringing \nit down toward the Kenai Peninsula and the Matanuska Valley and the \nport that is under development there, as well as having the \navailability of bringing it further down toward the delta and then down \nto Valdez, where we could liquefy it.\n  So I am very sensitive about this and hope that we can work with the \nmajority to include in this amendment a comprehensive accommodation, \nsince we are so interested this morning--I must say I am very pleased \nthat this isn't the first amendment of the majority where they chose to \nbe responsive to our concerns in our State. Again, I remind my \ncolleagues that H.R. 4, of course, already designated a southern route. \nBut I sense a certain eagerness to accommodate a gas pipeline, and I am \nwondering to what extent. I have the strange feeling that it is at the \nexpense of ANWR.\n\n  We are going to have an opportunity to talk about ANWR and to provide \nan amendment. But I think there is an interesting point that has been \noverlooked. Since the majority was so anxious to accommodate us, in the \nsense that we have had this issue before us relative to the gas \npipeline for so long, I am curious to know why it wasn't in the \nunderlying bill. But beggars cannot be choosers, and it is in here this \nmorning and I am very pleased.\n  I see my good friend seeking recognition. I will respond to his \nquestion.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thought it appropriate that I try to \nrespond to the Senator from Alaska. I tried to explain earlier that my \nthinking at the time we put the bill together for consideration in the \nSenate was that we should bring a bill to the Senate floor that was \nroute neutral. We had received urging that we prohibit use of the \nnorthern route. But it did not seem to me, knowing what we did at that \npoint, that was the right course. Since then, we have gotten more \ninformation from the Governor of Alaska, from the Senators from Alaska, \nfrom the environmental community, and from those who currently hold a \nright of way to construct the pipeline under existing law. It seems to \nme the weight of the evidence is clearly in favor of the amendment that \nSenator Daschle has now proposed and for which I think we have good \nbipartisan support. I point out also that this amendment does not limit \noptions as far as where the pipeline goes, except that it prohibits the \nuse of the northern route. That is what it does.\n  Clearly, I think the consensus now in the Senate among those I have \nspoken to is that is the correct course to follow, and I think that is \nwhat we are trying to do by this amendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I appreciate the response of my good \nfriend, Senator Bingaman, and he is my friend. We have worked on this \nissue. I appreciate his explanation. But I have to refer to the fact \nthat route issue has been around for a while because the House had it \nin its bill. Of course, we were not a party to the process of \ndeveloping the underlying bill as the minority, so we didn't have an \nopportunity to address the route issue, and the bill came in route \nneutral.\n\n[[Page S1559]]\n\n  Today, it is no longer route neutral. We appreciate that fact. We \nwill cosponsor it, but we are going to add a little more to it. I am \nsure the majority would agree it is in the interest of Alaska, since we \nare anxious to make that accommodation. Again, we are most \nappreciative. But it didn't just come up. It came from H.R. 4, and we \nhave always been in favor because, obviously, the other alternative is \nsimply to take the gas over the top, so to speak, as you can see, from \nPrudhoe Bay. You take it along the Arctic Ocean off the 1002 area of \nthe Arctic National Wildife Refuge, over into Canada, and then come \ndown.\n  Obviously, that is in the best interest of Alaska, not in the best \ninterest of jobs.\n  In any event, the amendment is the pending business. We are going to \nhave Members talk this morning, giving their opening statements on the \nenergy bill. I believe there is an effort to accommodate our friend \nfrom Utah for a short statement on the successful Olympics. We \ncertainly congratulate him and his colleague for providing us that \ngreat, extraordinary experience.\n  There are a couple more comments I do want to make relative to the \ncomparison between the gas line development and the prospects of \nwhether or not some see it as a tradeoff for ANWR. I assure the \nmajority that these two issues are not quid pro quo issues; they have \nto stand on their own, as they should. It is unfortunate they have come \nup in the same time sequence, but that is the reality of the way things \nhappen.\n  Again, as we look at where we are in the debate, as we look at the \nreality that the majority has chosen this as their first amendment, had \nwe had an opportunity to offer the first amendment, it would have been \na similar amendment, but it would have been more inclusive for Alaska \nallowing for alternatives.\n  I want to make sure my Alaska friends know the order of preference. \nWhen you are in the minority, you are in the minority. That is the \nharsh reality. The majority has every right to present this as their \nfirst amendment. But I want to make it very clear, had they not, we \nwould have presented this as our first amendment. It would have been \nbroader. It would have been more inclusive.\n  I have a couple more points to make. Again, this amendment does not \naddress the crucial underlying feature associated with this gas line. \nThis gas is on State lands. The leases belong to Phillips, British \nPetroleum, and they belong primarily to Exxon. They are the companies \nthat are going to have to build this pipeline or work with a consortium \nof gas line companies, such as Duke, Williams, El Paso, Foothills.\n  This is going to be a gigantic project. It is going to cost somewhere \nin the area of $15 billion to $20 billion. It will be the largest \nconstruction project in the history of North America. But it needs a \nsafety net.\n  What do I mean by a safety net? If we are going to put out that kind \nof money and the price of gas drops below your cost, as the Presiding \nOfficer knows as a businessman, you cannot stay in business very long.\n  We are not breaking new ground here. We have seen deep water royalty \nrelief, and that is evident in the drilling that goes on in the Gulf of \nMexico. We are going to need something with this pipeline.\n  We have been communicating with the Governor's office. In fact, we \nprovided most of the information that has come back in a rather \nroundabout way to the majority because we work with the Governor's \noffice. From Washington, it goes to Juneau and back and makes a rather \ncircuitous route because it ends up with the majority leader of the \nDemocratic Party. This is just politics, but much of the input is ours, \nand that is an obligation Senator Stevens and I have. We will do it and \ncontinue to do it, even if it makes almost a full circle.\n  The crux of this is the principals have expended roughly $100 \nmillion, evaluating this project, and they say currently, because of \nthe price of gas, it is uneconomical. Mr. President, you know what that \nmeans, and I know what that means, and I am not very happy about it. \nBut at the current price of gas, it is not economical.\n  On the other hand, on the positive side, the prospects for \ndevelopment are good because we are pulling down our gas reserves in \nthe United States much faster than we are finding new gas reserves. \nThere is no question this gas will be marketed. There is a question \nultimately of whether it will be just the U.S. domestic market or an \nLNG market in the Pacific rim. The economics dictate, but in order for \nthis to be built now, there has to be some arrangement that if the \nprice of gas falls below a certain level, there is a safety net.\n\n  Who is going to underwrite that safety net? Obviously, we are looking \ntoward the Federal Government, the same as we do in deep water royalty \nrelief in the Gulf of Mexico. In Alaska, we have a frontier area; we do \nnot have the infrastructure. What is different about our gas is it is \nnearly 3,000 miles away from the Chicago market where ultimately the \nvolume is anticipated.\n  It is not that our gas is different, but it has to be moved further, \nand to move it further costs more money. What we need in this equation \nis a safety net that perhaps could be paid back when the price of gas \ngoes over a certain level.\n  We are not looking for a handout. But the problem we have is the \nmechanics are not done yet. We do not know how it scores. I do not know \nthat the people who are in the business of scoring really understand, \nbut the concept is fair and equitable, and we are going to pursue it. I \nam very happy the majority is going to pursue it with us.\n  While route selection is vital and important, it does not build the \nproject. The only thing that is going to build the project is the \neconomics, and that is what we are working on.\n  We have Exxon, BP, and Phillips as primary partners. However, as you \nknow, they are not all the same size. Some are a little bigger and take \na little bigger risk.\n  I want to make the record very clear on what we have done today as we \nhave designated a route, and we are going to broaden it with \nalternatives, but the real crux is coming up with this safety net.\n  It is fair to close with my wariness, if you will, that suddenly we \nhave this broad support for a gas line, but is it at the price of ANWR? \nAs I indicated, as far as Alaskans are concerned, there is no quid pro \nquo; these have to stand independently. I do not want to hear Members \nsay: I am for you on the gas line but I am against you on ANWR. Members \nshould be making a decision on what is right for America.\n  As a consequence, I point out that perhaps our Governor could \nintervene, as he has in communicating to the majority with regard to \nthe language designating a southern route. I suppose I could send \nsomething up asking the Governor to intervene on ANWR and maybe he \ncould prevail upon the majority to include ANWR in the amendment, but I \nassume that would not stand the test of time. His support might be able \nto overcome the threat of a filibuster by the majority because Senator \nDaschle has already indicated they are prepared to basically \nfilibuster, filing cloture, requiring 60 votes. I hope that if the \nGovernor is as successful this morning on the route designation, he \nmight be able to address the ANWR issue as well.\n  Again, we have to understand politics. So as we look at where we are, \nI think we have to recognize we have a gigantic project that is before \nus that is in the interest of the United States. I am talking about \nboth projects because they are different. The majority whip has made \nhis comments relative to jobs. The interesting thing is we import about \n15 percent of our natural gas in this country, primarily from Canada, \nbut we import 58 percent of our oil. That ought to address some \nconcerns about the vulnerability of the country.\n  I hear a lot relative to jobs in this debate. The jobs in ANWR are \nall American jobs, but if one looks at that pipeline that the majority \nhas in their chart, look how much goes through Canada vis-a-vis how \nmuch goes through Alaska. No question, there is probably two and a half \nto three times more activity that will take place in Canada. Those are \ngoing to be Canadian jobs, but opening ANWR will create all American \njobs. I am sure the majority has been contacted by labor and labor has \nindicated how important those jobs are to America.\n  We need to understand the project a little better. We need to have \nmore\n\n[[Page S1560]]\n\nMembers visit the area. We need to recognize this project is designed \nto be constructed using 52-inch X-80 steel.\n  How many steel mills in the United States make this steel? Zero. This \nis an order that is estimated to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $3 \nbillion to $5 billion. Do you know what they say? We are not geared up \nto it.\n  I do not know about the Chair, but I am inclined to think, as a \nbusinessman, if he had an order that big, he would start figuring out a \nway to try to participate. I certainly would.\n  What happened the last time we built an 800-mile pipeline for oil? Do \nyou know where the pipe was built? In Japan, in Korea, and Italy. Why? \nOur steel mills were not geared up. In other words, they could not \ncompete. Well, that is another argument for another day. We have quotas \non steel, but clearly this is the biggest order ever contemplated \nassociated with the natural gas issue. So I hope this will be an \nawakening to the American steel industry that there is some business at \nhome, big business. They have not had a $3 billion to $5 billion order \nin a century. It would take the entire output of the steel mills in \nKorea and Japan for nearly 2 years to build this gas pipeline.\n  So we are going to have an interesting debate. I hopefully have \ncleared the air on the amendment. I look forward to the debate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Without objection, it \nis so ordered. The Senator will be added as a cosponsor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I hope we will be able to work with the majority to \nexpand the amendment as Alaskans have expressed their desire to have \nvarious alternatives for the marketing of our gas. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know there are other Senators wishing to \nspeak, so I will be relatively brief. I say to my friend from Alaska, \nit would be appropriate on something this important to the State of \nAlaska that we have a vote on it. We want to make sure when this matter \ngoes to the House they recognize the entire Senate supports it. So I \nask my friend if he is ready for a vote, not immediately but sometime \nin the near future?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may respond, it is very possible we may have a \nsecond degree. We have an objection on our side that we have to clear \nas well. So I agree with my colleague ``at some point in time,'' but it \nis premature at this time on our side.\n\n  Mr. REID. What I say to my friend from Alaska is, we understand there \nare always things that can be improved and we will certainly look \nforward to working with the Senator, and Senator Stevens, as to how we \ncan improve this amendment, but in the near future I hope we can vote \non this issue. If there is anything that the Senator needs or believes \nis appropriate to improve it, we can work at the staff level and then \nwith the principals. We will be happy to do that.\n  I say to my friend from Alaska, for whom I have the greatest respect, \nthis is quite interesting. I wish Nevada had the choices that Alaska \nhas today. That is, this bill is going to give Alaska something. It is \na question of how much. It is a question of whether Alaska is going to \nget ANWR and this pipeline or just get the pipeline. But there is no \nquestion that Alaska, after this legislation passes, is going to have \nthe hope of a significant number of new jobs.\n  As the Senator from Alaska knows, I do not favor ANWR and we are \ngoing to have a debate relatively soon on that. I hope we can fix the \ndebate on that issue and resolve it after everyone has an opportunity \nto say what they want and move on to the rest of this legislation. \nWhoever in effect wins, let us move on. It is a question of who has 60 \nvotes, I guess, in this Chamber. So I look forward to that.\n  I also say that not only is Alaska looking to this legislation with \nfavor but there are lots of others looking to this legislation with \nfavor, not the least of which, as the Senator from Alaska has said, are \nthe steel companies and steel workers in America.\n  I agree with the Senator from Alaska we can bring our steel mills \nback into production. With what the President did yesterday, it \ncertainly is a step in the right direction. If we pass this \nlegislation, hopefully they can get geared up to move forward.\n  One of the problems we have, of course, is companies are no longer \njust American companies, they are international companies, and \nsometimes they do not look at building things in America in the right \nlight. So I recognize other issues are important to address with \nrespect to the pipeline, and we want to work with the Alaska \ndelegation, including the Governor, in good faith, in moving these \nmatters forward.\n  The two items in this amendment are noncontroversial and do not \nprejudice other concerns that may come up at a subsequent time. We hope \nthere can be agreement to vote on this amendment soon and continue to \nwork on the other issues. I think it would set a great pattern for this \nlegislation, to have a bipartisan vote moving forward with something \nthat is extremely important.\n  The House bill did not address any of the other issues raised by \nSenator Murkowski. The amendment is broader than the House language--\nnot a lot, but it is broader. The amendment bans the northern route and \ndoes not specify where the southern route will go, but we know it will \ngo through Alaska. So I hope the Senators on the other side will allow \nus to have a vote in the near future and move on to the next amendment \nwhich will be offered by Senator Murkowski.\n  It is my understanding, based upon what Senator Murkowski said, that \nSenator Bennett is wishing to speak as in morning business. Is that \nright? And if I could ask a question of my friend from Utah, who I am \nsure is very proud of being able to talk about the way the Olympics \nwent off--Utah should be very proud--how long does the Senator wish to \nspeak?\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, somewhere between 15 and 20 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield to my friend from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may respond, the Senator from Kentucky seeks \nrecognition also.\n  Mr. REID. I was going to get to that.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. We generally agreed, subject to the Senator's \nconcurrence, that we would do that in the order of the Senator from \nKentucky and then our friend from Utah.\n  Mr. REID. I will bet my friend, the Senator from Kentucky, the hall \nof famer, is not here to brag about Alaska.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, the Senator from Utah be recognized as in morning \nbusiness for up to 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, before I recognize my friend from \nKentucky, I say I think it is rather interesting to reflect on the \ncontentious portions that are in this bill. Everything focuses either \non ANWR or the gas line. The electricity portion could be very complex. \nCAFE is going to be agonizing. Renewables are going to be agonizing.\n  I was somewhat alerted by the whip who indicated this vote will be a \n60 vote. Ordinarily, on issues around here, 51 votes are enough to \ncarry. But it is important to recognize the ground has already been \nlaid, and the reason is interesting. It is contentious. When our \nnational security is concerned, we should do all we can not to limit \nour options. I am fearful we are limiting our options.\n  The House bill only prohibits the ``over the top'' route, which is \nwhat the whip alluded to. This would clearly address this point, and it \nwould provide the alternatives that the economics dictate.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Alaska, I recognize the many \ncomplicated and controversial issues in this legislation that are now \nhere, or will be through amendment.\n  This is not one of the weeks where we say if we finish Thursday we \nwill have no votes on Friday. I know this will take time. I understand \nthat.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am not going anywhere. I want everybody to make sure \nthey understand that clearly from the beginning this whole process was \ndesigned--and I don't think we are fooling anybody--to ensure that the\n\n[[Page S1561]]\n\ncommittee of jurisdiction did not get a chance to vote on it. An ANWR \namendment would have been part of this bill because we had the votes. \nThat is the bottom line.\n  We have gone on from there into this extended synergy, which I do not \nthink is in the best interests of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the pending \nenergy bill. I am glad we're finally having this debate. It has been a \nlong time coming.\n  We desperately need a commonsense energy policy. Ever since the Arab \noil embargoes over a quarter of a century ago, Congress has talked \nabout passing a serious energy bill. Now is the time.\n  Coming after the tragic events of September 11, it is more important \nthan ever that we have a policy that not only helps us meet our energy \nneeds, but also protects our national security. In the past Congress \nhas failed to make progress on energy because we have fallen into the \ntrap of choosing between conservation and production.\n  But now I think that we have escaped that trap and reached the point \nwhere most of us in the Senate understand that a balanced energy policy \nmust do both--it must help boost production of domestic energy sources \nas well as promote conservation.\n  The bill before the Senate today is a decent starting point that \nattempts to strike a balance between conservation and production.\n  There are some parts of the legislation that I support. For instance, \neventually we are going to get a chance to vote on clean coal \ntechnology and ethanol provisions that are important to my State.\n  I also like the tax proposals coming from the Finance Committee that \nwould promote conservation and the expanded use of cleaner burning \nfuels.\n  But overall the bill is too weak on production and contains several \nprovisions that must be changed before the Senate finally passes a \nbill.\n  First of all, we need to look at improving the production side. We \nmust have an energy policy that helps reduce our dependence on foreign \noil. This means that we have to finally get serious about ANWR.\n  We deserve to have a straight up or down vote on ANWR. It's clear \nthat a majority of the Senate supports safe drilling in ANWR.\n  It is the most promising source of domestic energy we have. It is \ncritical to our future and our national security.\n  But because of the procedural gymnastics from the majority, it looks \nlike we're not going to get a fair shot at voting on ANWR.\n  That is wrong. ANWR is too important and the stakes are too high not \nto let the Senate work its will on this matter.\n  I know that there are some in the Senate who are desperate to stop us \nfrom opening up in ANWR. The facts are not on their side. And a few of \nthose facts bear repeating.\n  ANWR is roughly the size of South Carolina, Maine, Massachusetts, \nRhode Island, Vermont, and New Hampshire combined. It is absolutely \nenormous. But when we talk about drilling in ANWR, we are talking about \nclean drilling in an area of less than 2,000 acres--smaller than many \nairports in the United States.\n  To say that drilling in this limited portion of ANWR threatens the \nentire environment of the refuge is far-fetched and alarmist.\n  Recent advances in technology enable us to successfully extract oil \nin ANWR in an environmentally sensitive way. The old stereotypes of \ndirty oil drilling just don't apply anymore.\n  In fact, if we do start exploring in ANWR, the drilling operations \nwould be conducted under the most comprehensive environmental \nregulations in the world.\n  We all want to do what we can to protect our world. But it is just \nnot credible to say that looking for oil in this one small, limited \npart of ANWR is a dangerous threat to the entire region. Many of the \nenvironmentalists fail to see that if we do not begin oil production in \nANWR, oil companies in the Middle East, Russia, and elsewhere--places \nwhere environmental regulations are much less restrictive than ours or \neven nonexistent--will take up the slack.\n  Opening ANWR now might actually end up being more environmentally \nsensitive than the alternative. We also cannot escape the fact that \ndrilling in ANWR, and boosting our domestic energy production, is \nvitally important to our national security.\n  Right now we import 57 percent of the oil we use and the number is \nexpected to jump to 64 percent by 2020. There are more than 10 billion \nbarrels of oil recoverable in ANWR. That's enough to fuel all of \nKentucky's oil needs for 82 years. That is also enough oil to replace \nthe volume we currently import from Saudi Arabia or Iraq for the next \n25 years.\n  Drilling in ANWR provisions would not only make a tremendous \ndifference for our domestic consumption, but would constitute a serious \nstep toward ensuring our national security.\n  If the choice comes down to drilling in ANWR and lessening the chance \nthat we will have to rely on Saddam Hussein and others in Middle East \nfor our oil, then there is no choice at all.\n  Today we produce less oil than we did in World War II. We must \nreverse this trend. Drilling in ANWR won't change things overnight, and \nno single source can totally end our dependence on foreign energy.\n  But opening ANWR and boosting production are vital to this bill and \nto our national security.\n  On a different subject, I also think that we need to take a long look \nat the CAFE provisions in the Kerry/Hollings language in the bill. \nCurrently, the CAFE standards are 27.5 miles per gallon for cars and \n20.7 miles per gallon for light trucks.\n  The Kerry/Hollings provision in the bill would require a combined \nfleet fuel economy standard for cars and trucks to go to 35 miles per \ngallon by 2015. Their provision also would expand the definition of \n``light truck'' to include vehicles up to 10,000 pounds. That would \ncover most SUVs and minivans.\n  Because the Kerry/Hollings provision changes current law by combining \ncars and trucks, that means that even if auto manufacturers can achieve \n28 miles per gallon for their light trucks, some manufacturers will be \nforced to boost their car standards up to 50 miles per gallon just to \nreach the overall 35 miles per gallon average. That's a dramatic jump \nfrom the current standards, and pushes too far too fast.\n  The National Academy of Sciences recently studied this issue and the \nimplications of raising CAFE standards on vehicle safety.\n  NAS found that rapid increases in fuel economy standards for cars in \nthe early 1980's likely contributed to thousands of additional highway \ndeaths.\n  Back then, auto manufacturers reduced the size and weight of their \nvehicles to help meet the new standards. But because the CAFE standards \nwere raised too quickly, it turns out that making cars more fuel \nefficient also made them more deadly.\n  Today, one of the main ways for a manufacturer to increase its CAFE \nstandards is to downsize its fleet. In fact, since 1978 vehicles have \nshrunk in weight on average by more than 1,000 pounds per vehicle.\n  At the same time, the death toll from car crashes has increased. \nStatistics show that in the last 25 years since fuel efficiency \nstandards were first imposed, more than 40,000 people have died in \ncrashes in which they might have otherwise survived had their vehicles \nbeen heavier.\n  While more people have died because of the increased fuel efficiency, \nour fuel economy is not much better than it was in 1970. Much of this \nis because consumers have chosen bigger cars. They want SUVs and \nminivans to haul their children to soccer games and to go on vacations. \nAnd they want larger vehicles because they are safer, more comfortable, \nand more powerful.\n  Consumers obviously are not asking for this mandate because they are \nchoosing to continue to purchase larger vehicles despite other choices, \nincluding less expensive ones.\n  Kerry Hollings would overly regulate consumer choice at the expense \nof safety.\n  Because Kentucky has become one of the leading auto producing States \nin the country, I am also worried that the Kerry/Hollings provision \nwould affect jobs. When the CAFE rules went into effect before, \nmanufacturers spend huge sums of money to comply with the new rules. \nBecause of that, many workers were layed off to help cut costs.\n\n[[Page S1562]]\n\n  Today over 160,000 Kentucky workers are employed in the auto industry \nor in a job dependent on car manufacturing. That's almost 10 percent of \nmy State's workforce. But many of these jobs will be at risk if the \nKerry/Hollings provision in this bill becomes law.\n  I believe in increasing fuel efficiency in vehicles. I think we can \nand should do more on this front. But I do not believe that Congress \npicking a number out of thin air and mandating a target for \nmanufacturers to hit is the way to go. Instead, I think we need to do \nwhat we can to encourage sound science by the industry that makes \nsound, incremental changes in fuel standards.\n  Finally, I would like to say a few words about the procedure that was \nused to bring this bill to the floor. The process that this bill went \nthrough to finally reach the floor was a sham. Last October, when the \nEnergy Committee was finally going to begin marking up the bill, it was \nabruptly pulled at the last minute. Then the Democrats began working on \ntheir own proposal. Now almost 6 months later we finally get a chance \nto see their handiwork.\n  As I said at the beginning of my remarks, there are parts of it that \nrepresent a good starting point. But there are serious problems with \nthe measure, problems that probably would have been fixed in the Energy \nCommittee. But because they did not have the votes in committee, the \nDemocrats short-circuited the committee process and brought the bill \nstraight to the floor.\n  These procedural shortcomings have helped produce a flawed bill. If \nthe legislation had gone through the usual legislative process, it \nwould probably be a stronger, better bill. Many of us have to ask why \ndid the majority do this. The answer appears to be that there was a \nfear that the energy bill coming out of the committee would include \nprovisions such as ANWR for which we have the votes and that the \nmajority leader decided to have this debate on the floor instead.\n  That is fine. That has happened before around here. But that also \nmeans that we deserve to have a fair shot with our amendments on the \nfloor. It's one thing to shut us out in committee, but it's a whole \nother matter to try to do so on the Senate floor as well.\n  Let's have the debate on ANWR, on CAFE, and on other provisions and \nsee where the votes are. If the full Senate is going to work its will \non a sound policy, that's the least we can do. Anything else is going \nto produce a flawed, unbalanced bill that is not going to reflect well \non the Senate and is not going to help the country.\n  We need a sound energy bill and we need it now, and the best way to \npass a constructive bill is to have a full, healthy debate on the floor \nabout all of the issues involved--ANWR, CAFE, and all of the rest.\n  If we have this debate, I think we can produce a balanced bill that \nincreases production and conservation, produces jobs and makes a \ndifference for our national security.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, before the Senator from Utah begins his \nstatement, I ask unanimous consent that following the statement of the \nSenator from Utah, Senator Jeffords be recognized for up to 30 minutes, \nand following that, that Senator Feingold be recognized to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/06/senate-section/article/S1562-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1562-S1567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN UTAH\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity of sharing \nwith my colleagues a summary of what happened in the Salt Lake games \nthat took place the first 2 weeks in February, where the world came to \nUtah and was received in the spirit of the Olympic flame.\n  The Olympic Games are one of the few events, if indeed not the only \nevent, where the world comes together in a non-political arena. There \nwas substantial effort that went into these games, both on the part of \nthe people of Utah and the Federal taxpayer. So I think it is \nappropriate that we have a summary and report to this body on that \nexperience.\n  If I may, I would like to begin with some numbers. I know that is \nusually not the way to begin a public speech that you want anybody to \nlisten to, but there are some numbers that outline the scope of these \nOlympics that I think are irreplaceable as an example of what went on.\n  These were the largest Winter Olympics in history, and Salt Lake City \nwas the largest city to host a Winter Olympics. In the past, they have \nalways been held in relatively small ski villages. This is the first \ntime a major metropolitan area has been chosen as the host of the \nWinter Olympics. Some will argue with that and say Sarajevo was a major \ncity, but Salt Lake City is the largest city that has ever been host to \na Winter Olympics.\n  It was the largest number of athletes who have ever come to a Winter \nOlympics--2,500. They came from the largest number of countries ever \nrepresented at the Winter Olympics, 78, and they competed in the \nlargest number of events--also 78. We kept adding sports to the Winter \nOlympics for this experience.\n\n  Three and one-half billion people watched the opening and closing \nceremonies that were held in the Rice-Eccles football stadium at the \nUniversity of Utah. Sixty-seven thousand people signed up to be \nvolunteers--the largest volunteer pool ever created. Only 24,000 of \nthem could be accommodated.\n  One of the interesting statistics--I don't have the final number--but \nfar into the games, I was told, that of those 24,000 volunteers, only \n77 were forced to withdraw for one reason or another: A health problem, \na family emergency, what have you. The volunteers were a spectacular \npart of these Olympics.\n  There were 9,000 credentialed media that showed up to cover the \nOlympics. It was, as I say, the largest Winter Olympics in history.\n  In recognition of the size of the Olympics, it was declared for the \nfirst time as a National Special Security Event under Presidential \nDecision Directive 62. That directive, issued in the Clinton years, \nestablished national security events where the Secret Service would \ntake the lead in managing the security. This is the first time the \nOlympics have ever been designated a National Special Security Event.\n  The zone of security for the Olympics covered over 900 square miles \nfrom Provo to Ogden. That was the largest coordinated area the Secret \nService and other law enforcement people have ever been asked to \nguard--perhaps with the exception of the District of Columbia as a \nwhole. Even at the State of the Union Message, you don't have an area \nas large as the area covered by these Olympics.\n  In order to meet the challenge of this security responsibility at \nthese Olympics, we had 1,100 FBI agents, we had 2,000 Secret Service \nagents, and there were law enforcement officers from 48 different \nStates.\n  As I went through one venue, I noticed on the sleeve of one of the \nlaw enforcement officers the badge of the Police Department of Gallup, \nNM. Law enforcement officers from 48 States came to help their Utah \ncolleagues provide security for the games. Over 2,400 Utah law \nenforcement officers gathered from all over the State. There were also \n2,400 military personnel--primarily National Guardsmen who came from \nsix different States. And there were 2,200 fire and emergency response \nindividuals. This was an incredible army of security personnel \nassembled to provide security for the athletes and spectators.\n  What did they handle? There were over 3.5 million spectators who went \nthrough magnetometers during that 2-week period--3\\1/2\\ million people \nprocessed on a time-frame. There were some who didn't get to their \nevents on time. But overwhelmingly the ticket holders got to their \nevents, went through the magnetometers, and were properly screened. \nThere were 80,000 spectators processed each day through the \nmagnetometers at Olympic Square. There were over 1,000 trucks processed \ncarrying 250,000 tons of material and product. They were processed. \nThey were screened. They got where they needed to go on time. It was an \nincredible security and logistical performance.\n  When the Attorney General was out there, I was with him, and we were\n\n[[Page S1563]]\n\nchecking in advance the security preparations. At one of the venues, \nthe officer briefing us summarized how good the security really was. As \nhe said to the Attorney General, if you are going to get anywhere near \nthis venue during the Olympics without a credential, you are going to \nhave to be a moose.\n\n  What happened in terms of the threat as a result of this security \nactivity? By comparison--the Atlanta Olympics were the last that were \nheld in the United States--in Atlanta, they routinely had between 100 \nand 200 bomb threats every single day by people who felt confident \nenough to mount some kind of hoax, or threat, or attempt to disrupt--\n100 to 200 every day. In the Salt Lake Olympics, there were a little \nover 100 of those threats through the entire 2-week period.\n  Those are the statistics that give you the size and scope of what we \nwere dealing with--the size and scope of the effort.\n  In an effort to make sure we were getting our money's worth and that \nwe were on top of things, I visited the venue. I went to the Olympic \nVillage where the athletes were. That was a self-contained city of \n3,500 people--the 2,500 athletes plus 1,000 coaches and other team \nofficials. It had its own badge, it had its own health clinic, it had \nits own dining hall and even its own movie theater. This village had \nits own post office, bank, dry cleaners and convenience store--it was \nself-contained.\n  Then I went to the media center, which was another city. As I said, \nthere were over 9,000 accredited journalists there. Here is a city with \nits own store and bank as well as facilities for getting on-line, \nfiling stories, and all of the things necessary for the media.\n  I visited the Public Safety Command Center where over 64 different \nagencies were located, coordinating all of their efforts.\n  I went to the joint intelligence center where all of the intelligence \nagencies--not only from our country, the CIA, the NSA, the DEA but also \nfrom other countries--were gathered together sharing intelligence \ninformation about what kind of threat they might see.\n  There was the joint information center where all of the information \nofficers were gathered so that if there were any kind of an incident \nthat came up, everyone would know about it instantly and be able to \ncoordinate their responses.\n  I visited the Olympic Square and the Medals Plaza and, of course, \nevery one of the athletic venues.\n  Out of all of this, the basic question that I think we should be \naddressing in the Congress is, What is the legacy of the Salt Lake City \ngames? What is the lasting result of having held this event? I want to \nhighlight a few of the items that came out of what I have described \nfrom all of the visitations I made.\n  The first legacy that is the most obvious is the degree of security \nexpertise that has come out of this experience. As I said, I went to \nthe security center and saw these 64 agencies in a room not the size of \nthis chamber. They were sitting at a computer roughly every four feet, \nside by side, watching the computer screens and manning their stations \n24 hours a day throughout the entire 17 days of the Olympics. That \nmeant that anything that came up in the form of any sort of threat \nwould be instantly known in real time and simultaneously to all 64 \nagencies.\n  I was interested to note the labels that were on the little cardboard \nfolders on the top of each computer. Here was a computer with a label \non it that read ``FEMA.'' It was reassuring to know that the Federal \nEmergency Management Administration was present. Next to it would be \none that read ``FBI''--that was reassuring--and on through a number of \nother Federal agencies. In addition, there were various State \nagencies--the Utah Highway Patrol, the local police agencies, and \ncounty sheriffs departments; the Davis County Sheriff's Department.\n  One label caught my eye which demonstrated to me just how significant \nan effort this was. There was a label that said ``U of U Police \nDepartment.'' The University of Utah security guards were in the same \nroom with the Secret Service and FEMA, because if something happened at \nthe University of Utah--the place where the athletic village was \nlocated--the University of Utah police would have to be the first \nresponders. But they were in the same room and were getting the same \ninformation that FEMA was getting--FEMA if it was a major fire; that \nthe FBI was getting if there was a major law enforcement challenge; and \nthat the Secret Service was getting if there were some kind of a threat \nto the President. All were in the same room. All were coordinated. It \nwas a seamless effort, from the Secret Service at the top, all the way \ndown to the smallest--I will not say lowest; smallest--local law \nenforcement agency. Nothing like this has ever been accomplished before \nand, certainly, nothing on the scale like this has ever been \naccomplished before.\n\n  The legacy that comes out of this is a degree of expertise and \nunderstanding of coordination in law enforcement that can be used as a \ntemplate for homeland security and homeland defense.\n  I have made reference of this to Governor Ridge, when he was here, \nand said, ``You need to look very carefully at the experience of the \nSalt Lake Olympic games. It will give you guidance that will be \nabsolutely invaluable as you struggle with the problem of divided \njurisdiction among law enforcement agencies.''\n  While I was there, the man who was running the center turned to me \nand he said: Senator, this is boring. Nothing is happening. In the \nsecurity business, boring is good. I smiled a little at that because it \ndid look as if nobody was doing anything. Then he made an interesting \ncomment. He said, ``Senator, we think that a number of groups that \nwould otherwise have come to Salt Lake City in an attempt to disrupt \nthe Olympics or do even more serious damage. These groups scoped out \nthe security pattern we had here and decided to stay away.''\n  Indeed, he cited one activist group that, on their Web site, \ninstructed all of their supporters around the country: Stay away. \nThey're ready for us in Salt Lake. If you show up, you will be \nimmediately taken care of. There is no point in coming.\n  So the games went on flawlessly from a security standpoint because of \nthe incredible coordination that went on, from the Secret Service down \nto the smallest local law enforcement agency.\n  That is the first legacy that will come out of the Salt Lake City \ngames: that degree of expertise, that understanding of how things \nshould be done.\n  In connection with that legacy, I have to acknowledge the work of \nBrian Stafford, the Director of the United States Secret Service, who \npersonally paid a significant amount of attention to these games. He \nwas in Utah a number of times. Mark Camillo, the special agent in \ncharge, practically became a citizen of Utah. He has been out in Utah \nfor the last 24 months. The FBI, of course, under the leadership of \nDirector Mueller, should be congratulated for an outstanding job. Bob \nFlowers, who is the head of the Utah Olympic Public Safety Command, was \na very significant player in all of this. His right hand person, Dave \nTubbs, Executive Director of the Utah Olympic Public Safety Command, \ndeserves further commendation and congratulations.\n  These are the people who created this legacy from which the nation \nwill draw benefit for years to come.\n  The second legacy that comes out of these Olympics are the facilities \nthat were built. There were already ski facilities in many places in \nSalt Lake, but now we have built facilities that were not there before. \nFor example, the ice skating oval in Kearns; the luge/bobsled/skelton \ntrack and the ski jump at Utah Olympic Park--those things were created \nand upgraded for the Olympics.\n  I had lunch with the President of the U.S. Olympic Committee, Sandra \nBaldwin. She said to me, ``All of our speed skaters historically have \ncome from Wisconsin.'' That is a little bit of an overstatement, but \nshe backed down and said, ``All right, most of them have come from \nWisconsin.'' Why? Because that is where the best training facilities \nare for speed skating. We expect now that many of our gold-medal-\nwinning speed skaters will start to come from not only Utah but the \nentire western United States.\n\n  Then the comment made by some athletes at the lunch, and they were \nnot necessarily Utahns, ``Salt Lake City is easy to get to. Salt Lake \nCity is accessible by a majority airport. It is a\n\n[[Page S1564]]\n\nmajor city with hotel and places to stay. Athletes from all over \nAmerica can come to Salt Lake City to train far more easily than they \ncan in existing training facilities.''\n  One of the legacies of these games will be better prepared, better \ntrained American athletes. These games set the record for Americans \nwinning medals at the Winter Olympics. I expect that record will be \nbroken in the future because of the legacy of the Salt Lake Olympic \nGames.\n  In the process of creating those facilities, we produced yet another \nlegacy. I will talk about what was one of the more controversial \naspects of the Olympic facilities: the creation of the men's and \nwomen's downhill at Snowbasin. In order for that to happen, there had \nto be a land exchange so that Earl Holding, who owned the Snowbasin \nfacility, could get the land necessary to create the venue that worked \nso well in the Olympics and that everyone saw on television.\n  The Forest Service owned most of the land Mr. Holding needed. The \nForest Service said, ``We would be willing to deed that land to Earl \nHolding, but we don't want money in exchange. We want other lands.'' \nThe Forest Service identified 11,000 acres of land in the State of Utah \nwhich, for management purposes, they wanted to acquire.\n  An appraisal was done. The 1,300 acres they deeded to Earl Holding in \nfinancial terms was worth the same amount as the 11,000 acres the \nForest Service acquired. So even though the Forest Service acquired 8 \nor 9 times as many acres as it gave up, in financial terms the swap was \nequal. A careful appraisal was made by the Government to assure that \nthe interest of the public was protected.\n  Without going into the details, this was the legacy that the Forest \nService has as a result of that land swap. In a report they filed in \nMay of 2000, they summarize what they received as a result of the land \nswap that was stimulated by the Olympics: 15.3 miles of perennial \nstreams, 21.5 miles of intermittent streams, a 23-mile reduction in the \nboundaries that they have to police, consolidation of ownership, and \nthe elimination of the threat of development of these lands.\n  They have acquired suitable habitat for threatened and endangered \nspecies--both plant and wildlife--as well as habitat for big game \ncalving and fawning, in both summer and winter. They acquired three \nmiles of existing road access that they did not have before, and there \nare 3.5 miles of existing four-wheel-drive road to be evaluated in Box \nElder County, and 15.5 miles of existing trail access was acquired, \nalong with a wide variety of dispersed recreation opportunities, again, \nfor both winter and summer.\n  I spoke with the Forest Service personnel as I did my visits to the \nOlympic venues, and they told me how delighted they were with the way \nthe Snowbasin venue had been developed.\n  They said it was the finest development they had seen and one which \nthey would hope would be a model for other entities who would deal with \nForest Service land. But they also described to me how delighted they \nwere at the legacy of better management of Forest Service lands in Utah \nthat comes as a by-product of the Olympics.\n  Housing, another legacy from the Olympics is that there will be more \nlow-income housing in Utah as a result of efforts necessary to provide \nhousing for Olympic guests. Frankly, we did not get as much low-income \nhousing in Utah as I would have liked. We did not get as much as we \noriginally thought we would get when we embarked on this program. \nHowever, one aspect of the housing that needs to be talked about has to \ndo with housing on Indian reservations. Housing was provided for the \npress in manufactured units. They came straight from the factory. They \nwere assembled on the place, and they became the housing units for \npeople in the press. They were also at a distant venue in Soldier \nHollow, where they were used for housing Olympic athletes who needed to \nstay there rather than at the Olympic Village.\n  The Olympics are over. What do you do with this housing? Because it \nis manufactured housing and can be shipped easily, these houses are now \nin the process of being dismantled and sent to Indian reservations in \nthe State of Utah to provide affordable housing for Native \nAmericans. That is another one of the legacies of these Olympics.\n\n  We have a security legacy. We have an athletic facilities legacy. We \nhave a land management legacy, and we have a housing legacy. We should \nall be proud of that and grateful for that.\n  There is one more legacy that may be, while intangible, more \nimportant than those I have previously mentioned. Let me give an \nanecdote to illustrate my point. We, of course, were as warm with \nvisitors from foreign countries. As they went around Salt Lake City, as \nthey talked to the volunteers, they had an experience in America.\n  One of them described it this way, ``After September 11 and then the \nwar and the attacks in Afghanistan, we had the feeling that the \nAmericans stood astride the world and we expected, when we were coming \nto America for the Olympics, that the Americans would be pretty cocky, \nthat the Americans would be lording over the rest of us the fact that \nthey were in charge, that the Americans could do whatever they wanted \nanywhere in the world, and now you are coming to our Olympics, and the \nAmericans would be filled with overweening pride and a little bit of \nhubris.''\n  They went on to say, ``We have come into this Olympic atmosphere and \nfound nothing but warmth, graciousness, willingness to be helpful, to \nreach out, and to form relationships around the world. We have found \nnone of the pride and haughtiness we expected. We go away from these \nOlympics with a different view of America and Americans than we had \nbefore we came. We will spread that view in our home countries.''\n  In many ways, that is the most important legacy to come out of these \nOlympics. Coming against the backdrop of September 11th, it was the \ncoming together of people from 78 nations, of 9,000 journalists, to a \nnonpolitical arena and to find the humanity, the friendship, the \nfellowship, and the open nature of human beings regardless of their \ncountry that will bless the world.\n  After September 11, there were proposals to cancel the Olympics. I \nremember having a conversation with Mitt Romney, President of the \nOlympics, about that possibility.\n  I said, ``What will happen if you cancel the Olympics?''\n  He said, ``The first thing that would happen is we will go bankrupt. \nThere will be hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars of default \nbecause we can't pay our bills unless we get the revenue from actually \nputting on the games. We can't cancel the games. More importantly, we \nmust not cancel the games because that would send a signal to the \nterrorists that they truly had won.''\n  Nonetheless, there was the shadow of what would happen if the games \nwent forward hanging over it. A number of my colleagues in the Senate \nexpressed their concern about that.\n  We went forward with the games. Not only did we provide safe games in \nthe way I have described, we provided warm, gathering, closing-of-\nwounds, reassuring kinds of games that told the world we are all still \none family.\n  Enormous thanks belong to a number of people for producing that \nlegacy. Mitt Romney, of course, stands first as the CEO who took over a \nsituation that was challenging and produced the result I have \ndescribed, along with his chief operating officer, Frazier Bullock.\n  I want to thank the American people for their contributions and the \nsense of total American participation. Driving around Salt Lake City, I \nsaw a lot of strange buses from a lot of places I did not recognize. \nFinally, I saw a familiar bus. I thought: Oh, this is a hometown bus. \nThen I realized it was a Washington metrobus, not a Salt Lake City UTA \nbus. The buses came from all over the country.\n\n  On our light rail in Salt Lake, the cars are all white. Suddenly, \nthere were a bunch of yellow cars. I wondered from where they came. The \nanswer was, Dallas, Texas. The folks in Dallas, Texas, sent us their \nrailroad cars to supplement ours for our light rail system.\n  This was truly an American effort that produced the legacy of \ngoodwill and good feelings around the world.\n  I thank the American people for their help. I want to thank Governor \nLeavitt, the Governor of Utah; Bob Garff, chairman of the Olympics--\nthey all deserve special thanks.\n\n[[Page S1565]]\n\n  One individual I will single out, whom many of you have met, is Cindy \nGillespie. She was vice president of the Salt Lake organizing committee \nwho handled governmental relations. She was superb at it. She also \nrepresented a source that we all found valuable. She did the same job \nfor the Atlanta games. She brought an institutional memory of what the \nchallenges had been in Atlanta that helped us do things a little \ndifferently in Salt Lake.\n  Finally, among my colleagues, I must acknowledge the Senate's leading \nsupporter of the Olympic movement, Ted Stevens of Alaska, who put his \nfull energy in backing these games. I am sure he had some residual \nregret that the games did not go to Fairbanks but came to Salt Lake \nCity, but he threw himself into support of the Olympics in a manner \nthat was truly heroic. And other Senators: Senator Inouye, who took \nover chairmanship of the defense subcommittee when there was a change \nin leadership, was every bit as supportive as Senator Stevens. I want \nto thank Senator Byrd the chairman of the Appropriations Committee for \nhis help. Also Senators Gregg and Hollings, who had the responsibility \nof funding the requests that came from the President with respect to \nthe Justice Department and the FBI. Senators Campbell and Dorgan for \ntheir help in providing adequate funding for the Secret Service. I want \nto also thank all of my Senate colleagues for their great support. The \nsupport for the Olympics was very broad based.\n  Finally, while I am thanking, I must acknowledge that the Clinton \nadministration could not have been more supportive, and could not have \ndone a better job in seeing to it that these were in fact America's \nOlympic Games. When the Clinton administration left office and the Bush \nadministration came into power, the transition was seamless. The same \nsupport that came out of the White House and all aspects of the \nadministration made a very significant difference.\n  It is that final legacy, that the support of America has been \nrecognized around the world, and that the goodwill of America will \nradiate from these games around the world, that is the legacy for which \nI am the most grateful. It was summarized at the closing ceremonies by \nJacques Rogge, the new president of the International Olympic \nCommittee. You may know that in the past it has been the habit of the \npresident of the International Olympic Committee to give a scorecard, a \nreport card of how well the Olympics has done. The comment that has \nalways been looked for at every Olympics before is when the president \nof the IOC stands up and says, ``You have given us the finest Olympics \never.'' That is what all of us in Salt Lake were hoping we would get, \nthat accolade.\n  Jacques Rogge said, three or four days before the closing ceremony, \nhe would not say that. He said, ``I am going to remove that tradition \nfrom the IOC. Every Olympics is different. I am not going to create \nthat expectation, and I tell you in advance, don't be expecting \nthat.'' So he came and he gave his formal closing remarks. They were \nwritten in the program and they were wonderful. But he ad-libbed, as he \nwas caught up in the same spirit of good will throughout the world that \nI have described as the Olympic's most important legacy. And off of his \nprepared remarks, he turned to all of us and he said:\n\n       People of America, Utah, and Salt Lake City, you have given \n     the world superb games. That is a legacy of which all \n     Americans can be proud.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to all the men and \nwomen in the State of Utah and this nation whose hard work and \ndiligence made the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics the best in the \nhistory of the Games.\n  I want to pay special tribute to the efforts of my Utah partner, \nSenator Bob Bennett. We owe him a great deal of gratitude for his \nleadership and guidance to ensure that the 2002 Winter Olympic Games \nhad the resources and manpower necessary to be successful.\n  The 2002 Olympics proved that we as a nation can conduct national \nevents where the need for security is balanced with the spirit of the \nevent. In this new age, where terrorism is a constant threat, securing \nthe Olympics was a joint effort. It involved private citizens, Utah \nbusinesses, and federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. The \nresult was a security operation that provided a blueprint for the \nfuture.\n  The 2002 Winter Games were a showcase of American determination, \nresiliency, creativity, and resourcefulness. The challenge of planning \nfor and executing an event of this magnitude was daunting even prior to \nthe tragedy of September 11th. Following the September 11th tragedy, \nhowever, the security of the Winter Olympics became the subject of \nintense scrutiny in this country and throughout the International \nOlympic community. Frequently asked questions included: Can the United \nStates still produce a first-rate event given the new security \nenvironment? Should the Games be cancelled? Should the Games be scaled \nback? Would the event become an armed camp?\n  There was never a question, however, among the organizers and \nplanners of the Games as to whether the Olympics would go forward. They \nrolled up their sleeves and set out, determined to ensure that these \nGames were the best and safest Games ever. Law enforcement officials \nwere confident that they already had an excellent security plan in \nplace. Federal, state, local and private agencies developed and \nstrengthened partnerships so the spirit of the Olympic Games could \nthrive.\n  The nation and, indeed, the entire international Olympic community \nwere blessed that people of courage and conviction were already in \nplace and prepared to carry out their tasks. I would like to take a \nmoment to thank these wonderful men and women for what they did. I am \nvery proud of all of them.\n  First, I want to thank all the strong, brave, and gifted Olympic \nathletes who participated in the Winter Games. I am especially proud of \nthe United States' athletes who performed so magnificently and brought \nhome 34 medals--more than double the bronze, silver and gold the United \nStates brought home from the 1998 Nagano Winter Games. This was 28 more \nthan were won in the 1988 Winter Games in Calgary.\n  I also want to thank Utah Governor Mike Leavitt and Salt Lake City \nMayor Rocky Anderson, U.S. Attorney Paul Warner, Assistant U.S. \nAttorney Dave Schwendiman, as well as, the many other local city and \ncounty officials, and their staffs, who hosted the Games and marshaled \nthe resources which made the Olympics such a success. They represent \nthe great character of the people of Utah.\n  Utahns work very hard to preserve the beautiful natural backdrop that \nthe world admired and enjoyed so much throughout the Games. They also \nworked very hard to build the modern, state-of-the-art infrastructure \nthat made the Games possible. It was Utahns who provided the \nindomitable pioneer spirit which inspired the Games to reach new \nheights. Without the tens of thousand of Utah volunteers, the Games \nwould not have been possible at all, let alone the unqualified success \nthey turned out to be.\n  But this is only part of the success story. The 2002 Winter Olympic \nGames were possible because of well-conceived and well-executed \npartnerships among Federal, state, local, and private organizations. \nNot enough can be said about the way private enterprises partnered \nwith government at all levels. Mitt Romney, President and CEO of the \nSalt Lake Organizing Committee, and Fraser Bullock, the Chief Financial \nOfficer and Chief Operations Officer, are great Americans and heroes of \nthe 2002 Olympic Games. Their collective business acumen, indomitable \nspirit, and eye for beauty and passion brought about a splendid \nproduction from start to finish--that was enjoyed immensely by the \nwhole world. I want to personally thank the entire Salt Lake City \nOrganizing Committee for 17 days of magic!\n\n  For many years, the Salt Lake Organizing Committee Board of Trustees \nwas the backbone of planning the Games. These dedicated men and women \nprovided critical guidance and support in developing the overall \narchitecture and operations for the Games. We all owe a great deal of \nthanks to the able leadership of Frank Joklik, who was also the former \nCEO and President of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, as well as \nformer Chairman of the Board of Trustees. Under\n\n[[Page S1566]]\n\nthe direction and care of Bob Garff, current Chairman of the Board of \nTrustees, the Board has been second to none in keeping the Games on \ntrack over the years. We are very proud of every member who has ever \nserved on the Board of Trustees.\n  The current Board of Trustees have every right to be proud of their \naccomplishments. We salute: Mr. Spence Eccles, Mr. James Beardall, Ms. \nSandy Baldwin, Ms. Teresa Beck, Mr. J. Dwight Bell, Mayor Lewis K. \nBillings, Mr. Luke Bodensteiner, Mr. Kenneth Bullock, Ms. Camille Cain, \nMr. Joseph A. Cannon, Mr. Don Cash, Mr. Keith Christensen, Mr. Forrest \nCuch, Ms. Kathaleen K. Cutone, Ms. Anita Defrantz, Ms. Maria Dennis, \nMr. Randy Dryer, Mr. James L. Easton, Mr. Ed Eyestone, Mr. Rocky \nFluhart, Ms. Maria J. Garciaz, Mr. George Garwood, Mr. Paul George, Ms. \nRachel Mayer Godino, Ms. Joan Guetschow, Mr. Jim Holland, Mr. Tom Hori, \nMr. William Hybl, Mr. Nolan Karras, Mr. Karlos Kirby, Mr. Don J. \nLeonard, Ms. Hilary Lindh, Dr. Bernard Machen, Mr. Bill Malone, Mr. \nLarry Mankin, Mr. Al Mansell, Mr. Henry Marsh, Mr. Jim Morris, Ms. \nCarol Mushett, Mayor Brad Olch, Ms. Grethe B. Peterson, Ms. Margaret \nPeterson, Mr. Dave Pimm, Mr. John Price, Mr. Early Reese, Mr. Chris \nRobinson, Mr. Mike P. Schlappi, Dr. Gerald R. Sherratt, Mr. Bill \nShiebler, Mr. William J. Stapleton, Mr. Marty R. Stephens, Mr. Gordon \nStrachan, Ms. Picabo Street, Mr. James R. Swartz, Ms. Lillian Taylor, \nMs. Diana Thomas, Mr. Richard Velez, Mr. Lloyd Ward, Ms. Ann Wechsler, \nMr. Winston A. Wilkinson, Mr. Marion Willey, Mr. C.J Young, Mr. Ed T. \nEynon, Mr. Kelly J. Flint, Mr. Grant C. Thomas, Mr. Brett Hopkins, Mr. \nJames S. Jardine, and Mr. Lane Beattie.\n  I want to give special thanks not only to the current board but to \npast board members who have also given so much to these Olympics. They \ninclude: Verl Tophan, Earl Holding, Alan Layton, Scott Nelson, Tom \nWelch, Dave Johnson, Fred Ball, Jack Gallivan, former Utah Governors \nCalvin Rampton and Norm Bangerter, former Salt Lake City Mayor, Dee Dee \nCorradini, Palmer DePaulis, Jake Garn and many others.\n  The members of the Utah Olympic Public Safety Command, known as \nUSOPSC also deserve special recognition. I am especially proud of its \nCommander Robert Flowers, Vice Commander Rick Dinse, and Executive \nDirector David Tubbs. This 20-member interagency and intergovernmental \nbody developed and implemented all the public safety and security \nmeasures for the Games. I also want to express my appreciation to Earl \nMorris and former USOPSC member Craig Dearden for their tireless \nefforts. This unique cooperation between the public sector and the \nprivate sector, between federal agencies and state agencies should get \nan Olympic gold medal. Within the UOPSC structure, all these \norganizations focused on the task of making the Games safe and \nenjoyable while leaving organizational biases and petty preferences at \nthe doorstep. I believe that this approach is the blueprint for all \nfuture National Special Security Events and the UOPSC structure may \neven be a model for other states as they continue to implement their \nplans to combat terrorism.\n  When the Olympics were designated a National Special Security Event, \nthree federal agencies were primarily responsible for creating the \nsecurity network for the Games. They were: the Secret Service, the FBI, \nand the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Attorney General John \nAshcroft, FBI Director Robert Mueller, FBI Special Agent in Charge Don \nJohnson, Secretary of Treasury Paul O'Neill, Secret Service Director \nBrian Stafford, Secret Service Olympic Coordinator Mark Camillo, FEMA \nDirector Joe Allbaugh, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nTommy Thompson.\n\n  I also want to take this opportunity to recognize other critically \nimportant members of the Olympic Games partnership. These are the men \nand women, many of whom are unsung heroes, who ensured the safety, \nsecurity, and welfare of the Games participants and spectators. Among \nthese are: the active duty and reserve military personnel who stood in \nthe cold for hours inspecting cars and manning security checkpoints; \nthe military pilots who flew a lonely vigil over Utah venues; and those \nuniformed personnel who manned cold, remote radar sites.\n  The legions of personnel from every level of federal, state, and \nlocal law enforcement who worked 24 hours a day, seven days a week \nvigilantly watching, inspecting, and protecting the Games also need \nspecial recognition. I think about the fire and emergency medical \npersonnel who, like their law enforcement brothers and sisters, were on \nduty around the clock, planning for the worst while praying for the \nbest. Finally, let us not forget the private non-profit organizations \nsuch as the American Red Cross and the AmeriCorps who cared for those \nthat might have been forgotten in the excitement of the Games.\n  We also need to acknowledge the other everyday heroes whose stories \noften did not make the press. It is amazing that in a state as sparsely \npopulated as Utah, there were well over 60,000 applicants for the \n30,000 volunteer positions.\n  And we all have to pay special tribute to the inspirational \nperformances by The Mormon Tabernacle Choir, for their presence at so \nmany events lifted our spirits and touched our hearts. The Church of \nJesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints provided the security for these \nevents, as well as, security at Temple Square. The Church's efforts \nwere lauded by local and federal law enforcement officials alike.\n  I would like to spend a few minutes discussing the preparation and \nexecution of security for the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympic Games. There \nis a great story here. I hope the lessons learned in Utah from the \nefforts of the many men and women in the security community will help \nothers charged with protecting their communities.\n  The most important lesson learned, and one which I can not emphasize \nenough, is that security success depends on the open and willing \ncooperation among agencies at all levels of government and in the \nprivate sector. If I had to point to a one thing that spelled the \ndifference between success and failure for the Olympic Games, I would \nhave to say that is was the open lines of communications among all law \nenforcement agencies, fire and emergency medical services, hospitals \nand universities, and private and non-profit organizations at all \nlevels.\n  More than 60 federal, local, and state law enforcement agencies \ncontributed to the public safety of the 2002 Winter Olympics. Let me \ntell in detail why this experience in Salt Lake City is so unique.\n  In August 1999, the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City was \ndesignated as a National Special Security Event. Once this designation \nwas made, the Secret Service became the lead federal agency for \ndesigning, coordinating and implementing security at the event. With \nresponsibility for protecting over 2,300 athletes from 77 nations, \nscores of foreign officials and dignitaries, and over one million \nspectators, the Secret Service's Major Events Division collaborated \nwith dozens of other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies \nand public safety officials to design a multi-faceted and comprehensive \nsecurity plan. They worked for nearly 16 months to establish a safe and \nprotected environment at an assortment of venues in the Salt Lake City \narea.\n  The tragic events of September 11, 2001, ushered in a new era of \nheightened security, with even more emphasis on precaution and \nprevention. After the terrorist attacks, efforts intensified to enhance \nexisting security plans designed and tailored to the requirements of \neach of the many individual venues at the Winter Olympics.\n  In the end, the 2002 Winter Olympics were a rousing success story for \nnot only the United States athletes, who established a new record for \nAmerican success at the Winter Games with 34 medals, but also for the \nthousands of athletes and hundreds of thousands of spectators who were \nable to compete and attend events in the safest and most secure \nenvironment possible.\n\n  The 2002 Winter Olympics represented the largest coordinated security \neffort in our Nation's history. While most security plans for a \nsporting event may typically include a large stadium and the \nsurrounding area, the Secret Service was responsible for coordinating \nsecurity at 15 different venues consisting of: the Delta Center, Medals \nPlaza, Main Media Center,\n\n[[Page S1567]]\n\nRice-Eccles Olympic Stadium, Olympic Village, Ice Sheet at Ogden, IOC \nHotel, Snow Basin Resort, Park City Mountain Resort, Deer Valley \nresort, Utah Olympic Park, Soldier's Hollow, Peaks Ice Arena, E-Center \nIce Arena, and Ice Oval at Kearns. There also were special security \nrequirements implemented at the Salt Lake International Airport and \nSalt Lake City's downtown Washington Square.\n  Compounding the difficulty of securing such a large and diverse \nnumber of venues was the sprawling geographical coverage of the Winter \nGames. The zone of security stretched for 900 square miles, from Provo \nto Ogden, providing numerous operational and logistical challenges for \nthe Secret Service.\n  The security plan was designed and developed to provide the most \nsecure environment for athletes, spectators, and protected venues. \nThere was an airspace security plan to restrict certain aircraft from \napproaching any protected venue. There was a cyberspace security plan \nto ensure that no electronic intrusions could disrupt communications \nand operations. In addition, there was a physical security plan, \nincluding remote poststanders, magnetometers, state-of-the-art security \ncameras, chain-link fences, and electronic sensors.\n  Notwithstanding all of the technology and electronic monitoring, the \nfoundation of any security plan is the law enforcement personnel \nimplementing it. At the Winter Olympics, over 10,000 federal, state and \nlocal law enforcement and public safety officers stood watch around the \nclock, working in a collective and collaborative effort toward one \nsingle goal: to prevent any incidents that could cause harm to athletes \nor spectators, or create significant disruptions of the Games \nthemselves.\n  The result of this comprehensive and sweeping security plan was \nsecure surroundings that allowed athletes and spectators alike to enjoy \nthe atmosphere of this international gathering without having to \nnavigate any overly burdensome or time-consuming security checkpoints.\n  While there were occasional evacuations or disturbances, none of \nthese matters were deemed serious, and there were only a handful of \nminor arrests during the course of the 17 days of the Games. Although \nat the close of the Olympics, there were no medals for the Secret \nService and its partners in law enforcement and the military, the \nthousands of men and women who participated in the execution of perhaps \nthe most sophisticated and successful security plan in the Secret \nService's 137-year history deserve recognition and gratitude for their \ntireless efforts and dedication to their critical jobs.\n  In sum, the Salt Lake City Olympics provided the opportunity to \ndevelop and execute a plan to protect a 900 square mile part of this \ncountry. I urge that we capture the lessons learned from this \nexperience and incorporate these lesson into our national security \nplanning process.\n  Following the great traditions of this country, the success of the \n2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics was not due to any one individual, \nbut to all who participated. From the spectators at the venues who \nshowed patience, to the athletes who demonstrated the power of sport, \nto the organizers and protectors who gave us outstanding Games, and \nfinally to the American people, including this Congress, who \noverwhelmingly supported the Games, we proved to the World that the \nevents of September 11 will not deter this great Nation.\n  Finally, I want to take this opportunity to thank the staff who \nworked tirelessly with me on the Olympics: Kristine Iverson, Patricia \nKnight, Roslyn Trojan, Christopher Campbell, Scott Simpson, Melanie \nBowen, Heather Barney, and Christopher Rosche. I also owe a special \nthanks to Brandon Burgon who made sure I was always where I was \nsupposed to be, and that I was on time. I appreciate everything they \ndid, and am very proud of them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed).

Mr. President, we will have before us over the next \nseveral weeks a historic opportunity to change the direction of energy \nuse in this country.\n  I know you will hear from many of my colleagues that the events of \nSeptember 11 have changed how we must view energy, and on that point we \nmust all surely agree. An increasing reliance on energy imports from \npolitically unstable areas of the world is not in America's best \ninterests, and we must reassert our dominance over our own energy \nproduction and innovation. One of the most important ways to achieve \nthis is to wean ourselves from foreign oil in our transportation \nsector, and to diversify the energy base for our electricity generation \ninto clean, domestically produced renewable resources.\n  We have before us a piece of comprehensive energy legislation that \nquite frankly is one of the best to emerge from this body in some time. \nSenators Daschle and Bingaman have brought forward, in their \ncomprehensive amendment to S. 517, legislation that would spur the \ndevelopment of renewable energy resources, that will advance efficiency \nin our transportation, building and electricity sectors, and that will \nbegin to address global climate change. I support many of the \nprovisions of this legislation, particularly those that encourage the \nproduction of renewable energy, and those that provide additional \nfunding for energy assistance to low income households.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, I have \nconsiderable interest in several areas within the committee's \njurisdiction. These include issues relating to regulation of commercial \nnuclear power plants, and to air and water quality issues such as \nglobal climate change, the use of reformulated fuels, and air emissions \nfrom the transportation sector. I support the bill's provisions on \nefficiency standards for homes, schools, and public buildings, as well \nas the efficiency standards for appliances and other consumer and \ncommercial products. I also support increased funding for the Low \nIncome Energy Assistance, LIHEAP, program, and for expanded R for \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting efficiency and \nrenewables. I look forward to inclusion of the tax provisions passed \nout of the Finance Committee, particularly those provisions which \nextend and expand the production tax credit for renewables, and provide \ncredit for alternative fuels and alternative fueled vehicles. As \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I have \nparticular interest in those provisions of the bill which address the \nprotection of our environment through reductions of emissions and \npollutants affecting air and water quality.\n  Earlier this Congress, the EPW Committee reported out S. 950, the \nFederal Reformulated Fuels Act. This bill provided recognition of the \nneed to reduce MTBE contamination of water supplies and enhance fuel \nsuppliers' flexibility in meeting market demand. We have also \nrecognized the need to grow the renewables share of the transportation \nfuels market. I commend the leader, Senator Daschle, for convening a \nbroad and diverse group of stakeholders to craft an agreement on these \nissues in the fuels section of S. 517. I support the provisions in the \nDaschle bill that will raise CAFE standards, a long overdue action that \nwill dramatically decrease the amount of gasoline consumed on our \nhighways.\n  Both the reformulated fuels and CAFE provisions will benefit the \nenvironment, and reduce our dangerous dependence on foreign fuels. I am \nsupportive of the provisions in the Daschle bill that set us on a path \nto seriously address global climate change. I am however deeply \nconcerned that administration of the greenhouse gas database is not \nplaced with the EPA, the agency most clearly qualified to run this \nprogram. No other agency has the experience with air emissions data or \ncapability to run such a program more effectively. The agency already \ncollects detailed carbon dioxide emissions information from the utility \nsector, and leads the Federal agencies in preparation of the national \ninventory, pursuant to the Global Climate Protection Act of 1978 and \nother authorities. Placing this responsibility elsewhere in the Federal \nbureaucracy seems duplicative and illogical.\n  As chairman of the Environment Committee, the environmental and\n\n[[Page S1568]]\n\npublic health impacts of emissions are on the top of my list of \nconcerns. These issues are not directly addressed in S. 517. As this \nsession moves forward, the EPW Committee will be considering \nlegislation that would cap greenhouse gas emissions from the \ntransportation sector, which is responsible for approximately one-third \nof U.S. emissions. I support the inclusion in the electricity section \nof the bill of a net metering standard, which would give consumers \ncredit for their own production of solar or wind energy. I am however \nconcerned that the bill fails to include provisions, either through a \npublic benefits fund or an electric efficiency mandate, to ensure the \ncontinuation of programs to encourage electricity efficiency \ninnovations by utilities. Efficiency in electricity generation is a \nvital component of consuming less fuel, and lack of a provision \naddressing this issue is a major failing in the legislation. I am also \nconcerned that the definition of biomass in various places in S. 597 \ndoes not exclude incineration of municipal solid waste, a process which \nresults in emissions of mercury and sulfur dioxide. Measures which seek \nto encourage increased use of clean renewable energy should not provide \nnew incentives for incineration of municipal solid waste.\n  One of the most important aspects of the legislation is its \nprovisions for increasing the use of renewable energy in our nation. \nUnlike the House bill, Senator Daschle's bill includes a renewable \nportfolio standard which will guarantee that a greater portion of \nAmerica's electricity needs are met by renewable energy. To date, the \nadministration, like the House, has not endorsed this most basic of \nconcepts, and I strongly commend Senator Daschle and Senator Bingaman \nfor stepping forward on this crucial issue. This notwithstanding, I \ncannot support the Daschle renewable portfolio standard. My primary \nconcern with his provision is that it does not go far enough to provide \nthe level of environmental protection and market stimulation that a \nnational renewable portfolio standard should provide.\n  S. 597, Senator Daschle's bill, contains a renewable portfolio \nstandard requiring the generation of 10 percent of renewable energy \nelectricity by the year 2020. While moving in the right direction, this \nwill not provide the level of investment and growth achievable by my \namendment. We must be aggressive in finding alternatives to fuels that \npollute, or present unacceptable security risks. I will be introducing \nan amendment today that will ensure that by the year 2020, 20 percent \nof the electricity Americans use will be supplied by clean and safe \nrenewable energy from wind, solar, biomass or geothermal sources.\n  The United States today relies heavily on coal, nuclear power, and \nnatural gas to generate its electricity. Yet the United States is also \nblessed with an abundance of renewable energy resources including wind \npower, intense solar energy, vast sources of biomass, and geothermal \nenergy. These renewable energy resources do not pollute, they need not \nbe bought from foreign markets, they do not leave behind piles of toxic \nwastes, and they will not run out.\n  Because renewable energy has been with us forever, we tend to \ndisregard it. We tend to think of it as too simplistic to meet our \nmodern energy needs. Like this windmill pictured from the old American \nWest, we tend to think of wind, and other forms of renewable energy as \nquaint, but outdated vestiges of our past. We could not be more wrong. \nAccording to the U.S. Department of Energy wind energy has been the \nfastest growing source of electricity generation in the world in the \n1990s.\n  Today, the U.S. wind industry generates about 3.5 billion kilowatt-\nhours of electricity each year, enough to meet the annual electricity \nneeds of 1 million people. The costs of wind energy in the United has \ndropped more than 80 percent in the past two decades, with today's \nprices being competitive with electricity being delivered by fossil and \nother fuels. As you can see in this picture of a modern windmill farm \nin Texas, times have changed. In Texas alone, wind power generation has \nmore than doubled in the past three years, and estimates are that up to \n1,000 megawatts of new renewable energy capacity will be operating by \nthe end of this year. This jump is attributed in large part to a State \nrenewable energy standard signed into law by Governor Bush in 1999.\n  Throughout the country, utilities are installing wind turbines and \nother renewable energy facilities as customer demand for clean energy \ngrows, and costs drop.\n  These pictures illustrate but a few examples, such as this wind farm \nin Colorado; or the Northern States Power wind farm in Minnesota; the \nVanscycle Ridge wind farm in Oregon; this wind facility providing \nelectricity to the people of Traverse City, MI.\n  Wind production can be especially beneficial in rural and remote \nareas, as we can see by this wind turbine in remote Kotzebue, AK, which \ndisplaces diesel fuel generation.\n  Geothermal, biomass and solar are also making increasing \ncontributions to local and regional electricity generation. This Nevada \ngeothermal power plant produces electricity for 100,000 people. This \ngeothermal facility in California has produced the energy equivalent of \nover 250 million barrels of oil, and currently provides electricity to \nover one million people. This geothermal plant in Hawaii provides \nelectricity for 60,000 people. This modern complex in Lousiville, KY is \nheated and cooled by geothermal heat pumps.\n  Energy produced from biomass has the potential to account for almost \nas much renewable energy electricity production as wind. Here a biomass \nfacility in Shasta County, CA converts wood wastes into electricity. \nThis tractor is harvesting switchgrass in Charington Valley, IA where \nfarmers planted over 4,000 acres of switchgrass, which when burned will \ngenerate a continuing 35 megawatt flow of clean burning energy. If \nsuccessful the project will be scaled up to 50,000 acres and involve \n200 to 500 farmers. This bioenergy plant in Fayetteville, AR is testing \nnew bioconversion processes. This photovoltaic charging station in \nTampa, FL recharges batteries for hybrid electric vehicles, then \ncontribute excess generated power back to the electric grid. This \ncattle rancher in Idaho uses wind energy to power his home and ranch \nunder a program sponsored by the Idaho Power Company. This shows the \nsolar array at BP Solarex headquarters in Frederick, MD. BP solar, a \nsubsidiary of BP International, is a leading world developer of \nphotovoltaic technology, with offices and manufacturing sites around \nthe world. This solar concentration system at Sandia National \nLaboratory in New Mexico produces utility grade electric power.\n\n  Despite these exciting advances in U.S. renewable energy, the United \nStates and American businesses still lag far behind advances being made \nin Europe and the rest of the world. Compared to the roughly 1 million \nAmerican homes that are served by renewable energy, installed \ninternational wind capacity is enough to satisfy the electricity needs \nof 23 million people. The U.S. wind industry is actively seeking to \nutilize marketing opportunities outside the United States.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Energy's National Wind Technology \nCenter, these prospective wind energy markets could translate into \nseveral billion dollars in sales for the U.S. wind industry. U.S. firms \nhave already installed turbines in Canada, The Netherlands, Mexico, \nSouth America, Spain, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom. Nonetheless, 90 \npercent of the world's wind turbine manufacturers are European, with a \ncombined annual turnover of more than one billion Euros.\n  These potential markets are only likely to increase. As the European \nWind Energy Association states:\n\n       Whereas the cost of most forms of energy are bound to rise \n     with time, the costs of wind energy are actually coming down.\n\n  Offshore European wind projects at various stages in the pipeline \namount to more than 5,000 megawatts. Even accounting for the \nunderstandable enthusiasm of those in the industry, it is clear that \nboth the international and American wind energy markets have the \npotential for great expansion.\n  The faster expansion in international markets is due in great measure \nto governmental policies that favor such expansion. As the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy states,\n\n       Wind energy is the fastest growing source of electricity \n     generation in the world in the 1990's. However, the majority \n     of growth has\n\n[[Page S1569]]\n\n     been in Europe, where government policies and high \n     conventional energy costs favor the use of wind energy.\n\n  Even with advances to date, American renewables still account for \nlittle more than 2 percent of total U.S. electricity production. There \nis more than enough room for them in the U.S. energy market. The United \nStates is the world's largest single energy market, representing more \nthan 25 percent of world energy consumption.\n  The real question is the extent to which we in this country will take \nadvantage of our abundant renewable resources, and the assistance we \nwill be willing to provide our American companies in competing in this \nmarket. Are we going to allow American companies to miss the boat? Is \nthe United States going to lag behind while the rest of the world makes \ninvestments, develops infrastructure and outpaces us in the profitable \nmanufacture and production of renewable technologies? Will we once \nmore, as we are now for fossil fuels, be dependent on other nations for \nthe means to provide our domestic energy, but this time because the \ntechnology and manufacture of renewable energy rests largely in other \ncountries?\n  My amendment would provide an important step in providing market \nstrength to U.S. renewable industries. It would create a renewable \nportfolio standard under which utilities would be required to gradually \nincrease the amount of electricity from renewable energy resources sold \nto consumers, starting at 5 percent by 2005, and leveling out at 20 \npercent in 2020. This will be achieved by a system of renewable energy \ncredits, that electric retailers can either generate themselves, or buy \nfrom someone else who has generated electricity from a renewable \nresource.\n  Those selling tradeable credits to the retailers need not themselves \nbe connected into the grid. So long as someone has generated \nelectricity from a listed renewable energy resource, and either used it \nhimself or sold it to someone else to use, he can sell the credit to a \nretail electric supplier. My amendment would allow credits from \nexisting renewable energy production, thereby encouraging expansion of \nexisting facilities as well as creation of new sources of renewable \nenergy. It would be hydropower neutral in that it would require the use \nof renewable energy credits to offset only production of non-hydropower \nelectricity sold by the retailer. It would define renewable energy to \ninclude wind, solar, geothermal, landfill gas, certain biomass, and \nincremental hydropower added by increasing efficiency. It would not \ninclude industries which generate substantial amounts of pollution such \nas incineration of municipal solid waste, as renewable energy for which \ncredits could be obtained.\n  This flexible, market-driven system, will help reduce market barriers \nfor renewable energy, and stimulate domestic investment in new \nrenewable energy throughout the nation. It will allow our companies to \ngrow domestically, and establish sufficient stability to compete \nsuccessfully in the world market. It will encourage the successful, \nlong-term integration of these important renewable technologies into \nthe energy sector, and will help grow the U.S. renewable energy \nindustry into a world leader of renewable energy technology. My \namendment will be good for the environment. It will improve air \nquality, by reducing use of fossil fuels which produce nitrogen oxides, \nsulfur dioxide, and mercury emissions. These harmful pollutants are \nlinked to smog, acid rain, respiratory illness, and water \ncontamination.\n  This is an urgent issue. As reported in today's Washington Post, a \nstudy recently published in the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation concludes that long-term exposure to fine particles of air \npollution from coal-fired powerplants, factories, and diesel trucks \nincreases an individual's risk of dying from lung cancer by 12 percent.\n  This is particularly important to my home State of Vermont. We in the \nNortheast live downwind from virtually the entire nation. The \nprevailing wind patterns bring ozone-causing nitrogen oxide straight to \nour front door.\n  There are days I can stand on Mount Mansfield, and not be able to \nmake out the water tower on Mount Elmore barely 20 miles away.\n  My amendment would cut carbon dioxide emissions, a major contributor \nto global warming, by almost 19 percent, or 137 million metric tons by \n2020. The Daschle 10-percent standard would achieve only a 7-percent \nreduction, or 56 million metric tons.\n  A 20-percent renewable energy standard that stimulates investment in \nrenewable energy will be good for our economy. It will create thousands \nof new, high quality jobs and bring significant new investment to rural \ncommunities. It will create an estimated $80 million in new capitol \ninvestment here at home and create new opportunities in the \nmanufacturing and high-tech sectors. The market demand for renewable \nenergy will also bring jobs to rural areas, where it is estimated that \nwind energy alone could provide $1.2 billion in new income for farmers, \nranchers and rural landowners, and $5 billion in new property tax \nrevenues to communities.\n  My amendment will advance national security. Renewable energy \ntechnologies will reduce dependence on fossil fuels, alleviating \npressure on those markets. Because they are domestically produced, they \nwill reduce our vulnerability to foreign threats. Because they are \ndistributed in nature, they will reduce our reliance on centralized \nresources and the vulnerability of our energy infrastructure to \nterrorist attack.\n  Following the attacks of September 11, we can no longer afford to \ntake this responsibility lightly.\n  Mr. President, on September 19, James Woolsey, former Director of the \nCIA, Admiral Thomas H. Moorer, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, and Robert C. McFarlane, former National Security Advisor to \nPresident Reagan, sent a letter to myself and other Members of this \nbody urging in the strongest terms that we take immediate action to \naddress our energy security. Among other recommendations, they state \nthat they ``urge the Energy Committee to immediately adopt the \nRenewable Portfolio Standard. . . .''\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter, signed by all three, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                               September 19, 2001.\n     Senators Thomas A. Daschle, Tom Harkin, Robert C. Byrd, Carl \n       Levin, Jeff Bingaman, James S. Jeffords, Max Baucus, Joseph \n       R. Biden Jr., Trent Lott, Richard Lugar, Ted Stevens, John \n       W. Warner, Frank H. Murkowski, Robert C. Smith, Charles E. \n       Grassley, Jesse Helms.\n       Dear Senators: Americans are aware of the enormous and \n     complicated tasks ahead in dealing with the consequences of \n     the unprecedented September 11th attack against our nation.\n       There are many corrective actions that require lead-times \n     that could be months or even years. But, there are actions \n     that can and must be taken now. One of those critical actions \n     is to advance America's energy security. The Congress will \n     soon act on that issue.\n       It is not enough just to ensure uninterruptible supplies of \n     transportation fuels and electricity. We must also act to \n     advance the security of those supplies, and the nation's \n     ability to meet its needs in all corners of the country at \n     all times. Our refineries, pipelines and electrical grid are \n     highly vulnerable to conventional military, nuclear and \n     terrorist attacks.\n       Disbursed, renewable and domestic supplies of fuels and \n     electricity, such as energy produced naturally from wind, \n     solar, geothermal, incremental hydro, and agricultural \n     biomass, address those challenges. Fortunately, technologies \n     to deliver these supplies have been advancing steadily since \n     the Middle East fired its first warning shot over our bow in \n     1973. They are now ready to be brought, full force, into \n     service.\n       But, while the U.S. Government has committed intellectual \n     and monetary resources to developing these technologies, the \n     status quo marketplace is unwilling to accommodate these new \n     supplies of disbursed and renewable fuels and electricity. \n     Speedy action by the Administration and the Congress is \n     critical to establish the regulatory and tax conditions for \n     these renewable resources to rapidly reach their potential.\n       Fortunately, such actions are under consideration by the \n     Energy, Environment, and Finance Committees. We urge the \n     Energy Committee to immediately adopt the Renewable Portfolio \n     Standard (for electricity) as well as provisions to ensure \n     ready interconnection access to the electric grid, and cost-\n     shared funds to the state public benefit funds to continue \n     essential support for emerging technologies and the \n     provisions of electricity to the truly needy. We urge the \n     Environment Committee to immediately adopt the Renewable \n     Fuels Standard in conjunction with measures to deal with \n     environmental issues. Finally, we urge the Finance Committee \n     to immediately adopt residential solar credits and renewable \n     energy production tax credits, including a provision for\n\n[[Page S1570]]\n\n     fuels (liquid, gaseous and solid fuels), or their Btu \n     equivalent, similar to the fuel provision tax credit made \n     available in Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code.\n       These actions will also develop new industries and jobs, \n     strengthen communities, enhance the environment, and assist \n     in the stabilization of greenhouse gases. On the \n     transportation fuels issue, ethanol, biodiesel and other \n     biofuels will slow the flow of dollars to the Middle East, \n     where too many of those dollars have been used to buy weapons \n     and fund terrorist activities.\n       Consequently, we also recommend a major and concerted \n     effort to assemble the talent and resources needed to launch \n     a ``Liberty Ship'' type program to convert agricultural \n     wastes and cellulosic biomass into biofuels, biochemicals and \n     bioelectricity. The technology to do so is in place; all that \n     is lacking is the political will to deploy it.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     R. James Woolsey,\n       Former Director, Central Intelligence.\n     Robert C. McFarlane,\n       Former National Security Advisory to President Reagan.\n     Admiral Thomas H. Moorer USN (Ret),\n       Former Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. A 20-percent renewable energy standard by 2020 is \naffordable. The Department of Energy's information administration found \na 20-percent renewable energy standard by 2020 would result in only \nmodest increases in consumer electricity bills of up to 4 percent as \ncompared to prices if no renewable energy standard were imposed.\n  Polls have indicated Americans are willing to accept such moderate \nprice increases in exchange for the benefits derived from the greater \nrenewable energy production.\n  These same EIA studies showed that while households will experience \nmodest increases in electric bills, a 20-percent renewable energy \nstandard will actually reduce overall energy costs, which include the \ncosts attributable to home heating and commercial and industrial energy \nconsumption by approximately 0.1 percent by the year 2020.\n  With these very modest costs, the provisions in my amendment will \nincrease renewable energy production by a total of roughly 2 million \nmegawatts. Higher numbers are distinctly possible. In the Sacramento \nMunicipal Utility District, for example, if every new home built in \nCalifornia subdivisions each year had photovoltaic energy roofs similar \nto the ones shown in this chart, they would produce the equivalent of a \nmajor 400- to 500-megawatt powerplant every year.\n  This amendment is the right thing to do. It is supported by the \nConsumers Union, the Consumer Federation of America, along with \nhundreds of businesses, associations, labor and consumer advocacy \ngroups, environmental groups, faith-based organizations, academies, and \nlocal communities.\n  I ask unanimous consent a list of approximately 450 groups and \nindividuals supporting my amendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     Supporters of a 20% by 2020 National Renewable Energy Standard\n\n\n                              Associations\n\n

My standard is achievable. To date, 12 States have \nsuccessfully enacted renewable standards, several of which exceed the \n20 percent by 2020 standard of my amendment.\n\n[[Page S1572]]\n\n  States and utilities, recognizing the cost and environmental benefits \nof clean energy, are setting goals similar to mine for their use of \nrenewable energy. Governor Pataki of New York, for example, recently \nordered all agencies in the State of New York to produce 10 percent of \ntheir electricity from renewable energy sources by 2005 and 20 percent \nby 2010.\n  While good as far as it goes, Senator Daschle's amendment would \nresult in about half of the renewable energy generation that would be \nachieved under my amendment. Yet a 20-percent standard by 2020 is \nreasonable, achievable, and will provide for the important capital \ninvestment, market security, and environmental benefits for which we \nshould be aiming.\n  We have an obligation to act now to take the actions needed to secure \nclean, domestically produced, reliable sources of energy. We must not \nlag behind the weak standards or no standards at all.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for me in favor of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has approximately 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Let me share my long-term interest in this matter. I \ncame into the Congress in 1975. In that year, this Nation was in \nterrible shape. The oil from the Mideast had been interdicted. We had \nlong lines of cars, and everybody was in dire straits. A number of us \nat that time formed a coalition to do something about energy. The \nreason I bring it up is that much of what we are talking about today is \nmuch of what was proposed.\n  First, Norm Mineta, then in the House with John Blanchard of Michigan \nand me, introduced the wind energy bill. It passed. We drew lots as to \nhow it would be named. It turned out to be Blanchard's bill. That was a \nmajor move forward in wind energy.\n  Photovoltaics was another great interest of mine. I have a fond \nmemory of the coalition we put together at that time. We had over 80 \nmembers of the energy coalition, the solar coalition as it was called. \nSo I went on to the House floor to offer an amendment. The amendment \nwould have taken a large step forward in solar energy.\n  The chairman of the subcommittee came to me and said: Son, you do not \noffer amendments to appropriations bills unless you check with me \nfirst. He said: Come in and I will see if I can get you a couple of \nmillion dollars for this project.\n  I said: I am sorry, but I cannot do that.\n  He said: Why can't you?\n  I said: Because I have 80 cosponsors.\n  He said: You have 80 cosponsors?\n  Yes.\n  Well, I guess we are going to have to battle it out.\n  And we did. It passed, although they cut part of it off for other \nsolar energy. So that was the beginning of the photovoltaics industry \nin the United States. It was a proud moment, and it was a fun one to \nlook back upon, especially as to the shock on the chairman's face when \nI told him how many cosponsors we had.\n  At that time also, we went on to form the Alliance to Save Energy, \nwhich included myself, and at that time it was Jeff Bingaman and the \nSenator from Illinois who were with us on that issue, and that has \nproved to be a very interesting and excellent benefit to our energy \nsituation. Chuck Percy was the Senator's name.\n\n  I commend Jeff Bingaman, who is in the Chamber with me, for his work \nover those years. Together we are still working as hard as we can to do \nwhat we can about the energy situation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWisconsin is recognized for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Feingold are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am delighted that we are into the energy \npackage. We have been talking now for some time, of course, about an \nenergy policy in this country. The President has talked about it for a \nvery long time. He has put forth, with the help of the Vice President, \nan energy policy. So I am pleased that we are into that, and I hope we \ncontinue to work on it until we are able to successfully put together a \nbill that will meet our collective notions.\n  I ask unanimous consent several letters I received this morning be \nprinted in the Record. This one comes from the Vietnam Veterans \nInstitute. These are all directed to Senator Daschle in support of the \nenergy program.\n  This one is from the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, \nalso voicing their support for energy policy. This one comes from the \nAMVETS, this one from the Catholic War Veterans, and this one from the \nAmerican Legion.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Vietnam Veterans Institute,\n\n                                                    March 5, 2002.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: As the Chairman and Founder of the \n     Vietnam Veterans Institute, I write today out of a sense of \n     urgency concerning our national security as it relates to our \n     energy supply. Veterans groups with a combined membership of \n     nearly 5 million support the President's energy bill. I am \n     proud to be joined by the American Legion, the Veterans of \n     Foreign Wars, AMVETS, and the Catholic War Veterans of the \n     USA.\n       I respectfully urge you to pass the President's energy \n     bill, H.R. 4, and the provisions it contains. Further, I \n     agree with the President, who during the State of the Union \n     address, said ``We must act, first and foremost, not as \n     Republicans, not as Democrats, but as Americans.'' He went on \n     to say that we must continue at home and abroad with the same \n     spirit of cooperation. I believe it is imperative to our \n     national security that we stand together as Americans. Make \n     no mistake, responsible exploration of ANWR is a matter of \n     national security.\n       You have expressed concern with ANWR, stating that an \n     energy plan should not include opening wilderness areas to \n     oil drilling. Senator, do you know that exploration is \n     already taking place in wildlife refuges in 13 states, \n     including Senator Blanche Lambert Lincoln's state of Arkansas \n     and in North Dakota, Senator Kent Conrad's state? It is \n     important to note that in all of those wilderness areas, \n     there has been no harm to the wildlife caused by the \n     exploration in any of those states.\n       It is crucial for the American public to have the facts. \n     And if the truth is told, the American public will learn that \n     the native peoples of Alaska who actually live in the \n     affected area are 100% supportive of exploration of ANWR--\n     and--do not believe it will be any threat to the environment. \n     Why is it that we are not willing to let the people who live \n     there decide their future and the future of their lands?\n       The native peoples of Alaska who have opposed ANWR do not \n     live in the affected area and have leased their own lands for \n     oil exploration. I do not know if this has ever been \n     reported. I believe the American public has the right to \n     know.\n       Please pass the President's energy bill and help us rebuild \n     America!\n           With the support of our members,\n                                                   J. Eldon Yates,\n     Chairman and Founder.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Veterans of Foreign Wars\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                                 October 29, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: The 2.7 million members of the \n     Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States and its Ladies \n     Auxiliary supports H.R. 4, the ``Securing America's Future \n     Energy Act of 2001'' or SAFE Act of 2001. We applaud the \n     House of Representatives for its bipartisan work in \n     addressing our energy vulnerability by passing H.R. 4. We \n     believe the Senate should consider and vote on H.R. 4 so that \n     our nation has an energy plan for the future and can move \n     forward quickly with a comprehensive plan to develop our \n     domestic energy resources.\n       Keeping in mind the horrific events of September 11 and \n     mindful of the threats we are facing, we strongly believe \n     that the development of America's domestic energy resources \n     is a vital national security priority. We need to take steps \n     to reverse our growing dependence on Middle East oil as \n     quickly as possible. By passing H.R. 4, the Senate will be \n     supporting our troops serving in combat on Operation Enduring \n     Freedom, the American people, and our national security with \n     a comprehensive energy legislation that is desperately needed \n     to diversify the energy for our country and chart a course \n     for the future.\n\n[[Page S1573]]\n\n       The VFW strongly urges the Senate to consider and vote on \n     H.R. 4 as passed in the House in this session of Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Robert E.

Tom Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: AMVETS urges your favorable \n     consideration of H.R. 4, the Securing America's Future Energy \n     Act of 2001.\n       As you know, our current reliance on foreign oil leaves the \n     United States vulnerable to the whim of individual oil-\n     exporting countries, many existing in the unpredictable and \n     highly dangerous Persian Gulf. And it cannot be overstated \n     that energy supplies touch nearly every aspect of our lives \n     from our economy to our national security.\n       H.R. 4, as approved by the House, is a critical part of an \n     overall policy America requires to promote dependable, \n     affordable, and environmentally sound production and \n     distribution of energy for the future. We cannot wait for the \n     next crisis before we act.\n       Thank you for your service in the United States Senate and \n     please remember that this issue is vital to our nation's \n     security and the brave men and women who serve in the Armed \n     Forces.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Richard A. Jones,\n     National Legislative Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      Catholic War Veterans of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                                    March 5, 2002.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: We write today on behalf of our \n     membership to encourage you to pass the President's energy \n     bill, H.R. 4. We support this bill because we believe our \n     national security demands that America be less dependent on \n     foreign oil producers.\n       The September 11th attacks on democracy have expedited the \n     need for increased oil self-sufficiency. Reliance on other \n     countries, especially during these times of war and \n     international terrorism, threatens our national security and \n     economic well-being.\n       The Catholic War Veterans of the USA respectfully urge you \n     to support the provisions contained in the House passed \n     version of the ``Securing America's Future Energy Act of \n     2001.'' The legislation is a major step toward achieving \n     energy independence and ensuring our national security.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Joseph Satriano,\n     National First Vice Commander.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          The American Legion,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 5, 2002.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: On behalf of the 2.8 million members \n     of the American Legion, I urge you to support a comprehensive \n     energy policy that will improve the nation's energy \n     independence and strengthen national security.\n       War and international terrorism have brought into sharp \n     focus the heavy reliance of the United States on imported \n     oil. During times of crisis, such reliance threatens the \n     nation's security and economic well being. The import of more \n     than 55 percent of the nation's petroleum from foreign \n     countries further compounds our foreign trade balance. This \n     is a time when the country's energy demands continue \n     unabated. It is important that we develop additional reliable \n     sources of domestic oil.\n       The American Legion understands the sacrifices being made \n     by the men and women in uniform. The members of America's \n     all-volunteer force have been tasked with the demanding \n     mission of combating terrorism worldwide and strengthening \n     our homeland security. In addition to active-duty forces, \n     seventy-six thousand National Guard and Reserve members have \n     put their lives on hold and left their families, following \n     the terrorists' acts of September 11. Now, it is the duty of \n     a grateful nation to ensure these brave men and women have \n     the resources that they need to successfully carry out that \n     mission.\n       The development of America's domestic energy resources is \n     vital to national security. The American Legion respectfully \n     urges you to support the provisions contained in the House-\n     passed version of the ``Securing America's Future Energy Act \n     of 2001.''\n       I thank you for considering our view on this critical \n     national security issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Richard J. Santos,\n                                               National Commander.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we had a meeting this morning with the \nveterans. Over the last several months we have had a number of press \nconferences and meetings with all kinds of different interests in this \ncountry that support us doing something, in a balanced way, about \nenergy policy. We have heard from agriculture, the Farm Bureau, the \nFarmers' Union. Of course, the labor unions have been very much in \nsupport of what is there so we can get on with energy production. We \nhave had small businesses. We have had Native Alaskans here and the \nveterans associations.\n  I have been impressed with the breadth of support for an energy \npolicy. I think it indicates in some ways the depth of involvement, how \nthis touches everyone in this country, having an affordable, adequate \nenergy supply, and doing it in a balanced way. It touches everyone's \nlife.\n  Unfortunately, in terms of moving on something, when last year we \nwere having all the problems in California, of course, the shortage of \nelectricity and the high prices, and gasoline prices were very high, \nthere was great interest in it. Now gasoline prices are down. The \nCalifornia crisis is over. But I hope we do not lose our intensity, \nknowing that is not going to last unless we have a policy that leads us \nin the direction, in the future, of having an adequate domestic supply \nso we are not 60-percent dependent on foreign imports.\n  Beginning to move towards more diversity in energy certainly ought to \nbe part of our plan. We ought to do that. In a balanced bill, we will \nhave research money to be able to look for new sources of energy, to \nhave clean coal research so we can use those resources more thoroughly, \nand we should have renewables. All of us are interested in that.\n  At the same time, we have to do something about production. I guess \nthat is my main criticism of the bill before us, that it leans so much \ntoward conservation and renewables, but it does not take into account \nwhat our needs are going to be in the next number of years. If nothing \nelse, we have to look at a balanced energy policy that recognizes that \nwe have to modernize and increase conservation, we have to modernize \nand expand our infrastructure, we have to have diversity in our \nsupplies, and we have to improve environmental protection--among other \nthings.\n  We have spent a good deal of time on transportation of electric \nenergy. It is also true of gas and oil, but you can generate all the \nelectricity of the world right here, and if you don't have a way to get \nit to the market, then you have not accomplished your goals. We need to \ndo something dramatic in this whole area of transportation of \nelectricity. We need to build a network. We have an interstate grid \nthat moves wholesale power, and hopefully we would have regional \ntransportation organizations, RTOs, along there to take it into areas--\nrun by the States. These are things that are pretty much accepted as \nbeing necessary ingredients as we move forward with an energy bill.\n  One of the things that is troublesome--I happen to be on the Energy \nCommittee--is the process that has brought us here. The committee did \nnot have an opportunity to deal with these difficult and detailed \nquestions. That should be done at least initially in committees. We did \nnot do that. The majority leader determined to take the bill out of the \ncommittee and bring it here to do this. It has been changed several \ntimes since we have been on the floor. That makes it difficult to deal \nwith the details of an energy bill.\n  Every amendment that comes up here is going to have to be dealt with \nin such detail, you would think, my gosh, that is the kind of thing \nthat ought to be done in committee. But given the situation, the fact \nthat the majority leader chose to do it that way--I happen to think it \nis a flawed process--nevertheless we are here. We have had no hearings, \nno markups, so we are going to be trying to do some of those things.\n\n  We will be dealing right now with an amendment having to do with a \n$20 billion pipeline from Alaska which never had a hearing, never had \nan opportunity to find out the facts. That is not a good way to \nlegislate.\n  We will be pushing forward on those issues. I am hopeful that we can \nmove forward. I am hopeful we will have an opportunity to deal with \nsome of the difficult issues such as CAFE standards. I don't think \nanybody would argue with the idea that we would like to have vehicles \nthat do what we need to do with better mileage. But we cannot be \nunrealistic, moving it over in just several years, given the costs \nassociated with that --particularly to those who live in the West.\n  Live where I live and look on the road and you seldom see anything \nexcept a pickup and an SUV. I realized\n\n[[Page S1574]]\n\npart of the reason for that when I was there. I would never have gotten \nout of my driveway without a four-wheel drive.\n  This is realism. This is the way it is. We can make some changes, but \nwe can't substitute those future movements for where we need to be now.\n  With regard to the security of this country, military security, \nterrorism--these things require that we have an adequate supply of \nenergy. Much of it comes from the Middle East. Because we are having \nthe problems we are having over there--and foreseeably we will be \nhaving them for some time--we have to do more.\n  I live in a part of the country where we are one of the large energy \nproducers in this Nation. We are the highest producer of coal. We have \nlarge reserves of gas, methane gas, and oil. But much of it is very \ndifficult. We need to have access to public lands, among other things. \nWe need to be able to utilize those resources in an environmentally \nsound way. We have done that and can do that.\n\n  So I think the idea that somehow we can substitute production with \nsome kind of renewables or some kind of scientific process that we do \nnot even have before us is a little bit of dreamland, I am afraid.\n  I am hopeful we can move forward and be realistic in what we do. We \nought to have an opportunity, certainly, to be able to deal with these \nissues in a way in which everyone gets an opportunity to have \namendments and to get something together that will be generally \nacceptable to all of us.\n  As I said, I come from a State that is rich in resources. We have \nvery high coal and oil and gas reserves. We also have an adequate \nsupply--sometimes overadequate supply--of wind. We can convert some of \nthat into electricity, of course. We should, indeed, do it.\n  We need a realistic policy that encourages fuel diversity, that \nutilizes all of our domestic resources in a very broad way, that takes \neconomic and environmental factors into account. In relation to \neconomic factors, we need to be realistic about what we are going to \ndo. We need to provide a cleaner and more secure energy future. We need \nan overall energy strategy that increases conservation and energy \nefficiency and boosts supply and promotes alternative energy. I think \nwe can do that.\n  Some of what I hear in this Chamber, however, would indicate that we \ndo not need to worry about increasing our gas and oil supply because we \nare going to take care of it with renewables or with raising the \nstandards in mileage. Fine, but you are not going to do that \nimmediately. There is no way. I hope we are realistic enough to deal \nwith it.\n  One of the areas, of course, that is going to be very controversial \nis ANWR. We will all have to deal with that and see if we can't \ndetermine what the real impact is. I have been to Prudhoe Bay and out \nin that area particularly. I have seen the work they are doing there \nnow, which, by the way, is very impressive. I have a little idea of \nwhat the wildlife refuge looks like.\n  Sometimes we hear in this Chamber it would be a brandnew idea to have \nproduction on a wildlife refuge. It is not a new idea. It is done on a \nnumber of wildlife refuges now. The proposition is to have a very small \nfootprint to be able to have a rather large impact. That is the kind of \ncoming together there has been that makes that a possibility, that \nmakes it a necessity, as a matter of fact, to do something there.\n  We need to move forward with coal. We need to move forward with \nnuclear. We can do that. We can get more clean coal technology. That is \nour greatest reserve of energy for the future.\n  Everyone in this country is affected by electricity, its availability \nand price. So this isn't just theoretical; this is something that \nreally impacts everyone very directly.\n  One of the issues we have to understand as thoroughly as we can is \ntechnology breakthrough. We need incentives for that, but they do not \nhappen overnight. You cannot just regulate that they are going to do \nthat. They don't just happen. That is not the way it is. Furthermore, \nit takes away the choices we have, where we ought to be able to do \nsome things by incentive which I think are very possible. I am hopeful \nwe can move forward through our differences and have legislation that \nwill work.\n\n  One of the areas that some of us have been working on, and I suspect \nwill continue to work on for some time, is the electric component. \nAgain, there have been debates and discussions about this. The House \nbill currently does not have an electric title. But there are a number \nof issues, certainly, that most people would agree need to be reviewed \nand that we need to do some things in the electric area. We have an \nopportunity to deal with some of those issues.\n  One of them is reliability. We have talked about reliability for a \nvery long time. We talked about it in great detail during the time we \nwere having difficulty in California. We really have not done a great \ndeal about that, but we have an opportunity to do so.\n  We are going to have to make some choices about the way we handle \nthese matters. Quite frankly, we have been through this for some time. \nWe have been through it in terms of reregulation and deregulation.\n  I thought we had come to the conclusion that those things that are \nclearly interstate could fairly well be defined and those things that \nclearly belong on the national level with FERC could fairly well be \ndefined, that those things that have to do with retail and distribution \nand the unbundled distribution of electricity to homes and businesses \nwithin the State would be done by the State. Certainly, that is the way \nI believe it ought to be done. Having had a little bit of experience \nand background in the electric business through the rural electrics, I \nreally think that is the way it ought to be. The needs you have in \nPennsylvania and the needs you have in Wyoming are sometimes not the \nsame. So we need to have some flexibility to do that. I am hopeful we \nwill.\n  This bill, as presented to us now, is really heavy on FERC. It gives \nFERC all the decisionmaking authority in almost every aspect of \nelectricity. Many of us do not believe that is the way we ought to \nproceed. Many of us believe we can fix that. There needs to be some \noverall jurisdiction, of course, with FERC, which is the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, but there are also opportunities for the North \nAmerican Reliability Council, for Governors, and others.\n  As a matter of fact, the Western Governors have put forth very \ndetailed ideas of what they would like to do. I happen to agree \ngenerally with what they are doing.\n  So I hope we can deal with this language and deal with how we can \nbest establish a reliable distribution and generation system.\n  Things have changed. It was not many years ago when you had an \nelectric system, you had the service area, and whoever had that service \narea generated the electricity they needed. So it was sort of self-\nconfined.\n  Now we find ourselves more or less deregulated in the generation \naspect of it. You have many private market generators that are dealing \nin it by selling to the distributors. So you have to move it. That is \nsome competition there. I think it can work.\n  We have to recognize times have changed and we have to do the same \nthing.\n  I think we have some unrealistic demands for renewables in this bill. \nWe ought to be moving on renewables, but the idea to put in the bill \nthat it is going to be this percentage or this many tons or this many \nkilowatt hours by renewables I don't think is a realistic way to do \nthat. We ought to offer incentives, that type of thing. But to put \nthose numbers in there, and say this is the way it is going to be, I \nthink is unrealistic.\n  We have a number of areas in which we could modify what FERC's \nauthorities are going to be in terms of some things that could better \nbe done on the State level. There are a number of things in the bill \nthat preempt States' rights. I think most of us, or many of us at \nleast, are not of the mind that that is the way we ought to do that.\n  The Daschle bill basically gives FERC exclusive authority over \nreliability. It has a renewable portfolio mandate, billions of dollars \nin consumer cost. It has FERC authority over State matters. It does not \nneed to be that way.\n  So I think we are in the process of developing a number of amendments \nwhich we hope to file and offer as we go\n\n[[Page S1575]]\n\nforward, particularly in this area. I am sure there will be many \namendments in other areas as well which is proper, particularly since \nwe didn't have committee involvement. We are really doing committee \nwork now on the floor, and that will take some time and effort, but it \nis necessary in order for us to come out of here with a bill that can \nbe accepted by the Senate, can go to a conference committee, can come \nout and be accepted by the President.\n\n  We have a real challenge before us. I look forward to it and hope we \ncan stick with this issue until it is finished and not come back to \ncampaign finance or something in the middle. We ought to stay with it \nand keep working, keep as open as we can to other people's ideas, \nrecognizing that it is going to take a long time. But the way it has \nbeen brought to us, it has to take a long time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, my understanding of the status of \nbusiness is that we are still considering the amendment Senator Daschle \noffered earlier, of which I am a cosponsor, along with Senators Reid \nand Murkowski and others. That amendment is still pending and is being \nconsidered for possible second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I have also been informed by the floor manager for the \nmajority it is his intention that the Senate will go into recess at \n1:30 to allow Senators to attend a briefing Secretary of Defense \nRumsfeld is going to conduct for Senators from 1:30 to 2:30. Then we \nwould be back at the same place we are now. That is for the information \nof Senators.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/06/senate-section/article/S1575-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, Senator Lieberman is here to give an opening \nstatement on the bill. Following his statement, we understand that \nSenator Nickles will be here to give a statement. We are working our \nway through the statements. This is such an important bill. There are a \nnumber of Senators who have strong feelings about it, and they wish to \nlay out their view of what the energy policy in this country should be.\n  While it may appear that we are not making a lot of headway, I \npersonally think we are making great progress. There is an amendment \nnow pending. Senator Murkowski is contemplating a second-degree \namendment to the underlying Daschle amendment. If, in fact, he does \noffer it, and it is about what I have learned, I think we will accept \nthat and have a vote on the amendment--not because we are concerned \nabout where the votes are, as the measure will receive virtually every \nvote but we want the first amendment to come out recognizing the \nimportance of Alaska and the southern pipeline and know that when it \ngoes to conference, we hope there is close to unanimous support of the \nSenate on this measure.\n  Senator Murkowski has indicated he is ready with an amendment. We \nwill be ready to work on that. We hope to complete all of the \nstatements today and have a vote on the underlying Daschle amendment. \nIf Senator Murkowski wants a vote on the second degree, we would be \nhappy to do that also and move to whatever Senator Murkowski wants to \noffer.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the statement of the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, Senator Nickles be recognized to offer an opening \nstatement regarding this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the Senate has begun a very important \ndebate in the last few days on our national energy policy. This is a \ndebate that will literally affect the lives and the quality of the \nlives of every single American, as well as affect our national \nsecurity, our independence in carrying out our foreign and defense \npolicies, and the quality of the environment and the natural resources \nfrom which we derive such pleasure as Americans. So this is a very \nimportant and timely debate.\n  It has been 10 years since we last passed major energy legislation. \nWe are starting with a bill hundreds of pages long, and hundreds--or at \nleast 100--amendments may find their way onto it. We are going to be \ndebating some very big opportunities and some very big problems, as \nwell as many other smaller issues associated with the bill.\n  I saw Senator Bingaman on the floor. I congratulate him and Senator \nDaschle for their superb leadership, along with that of the occupant of \nthe chair, in developing the energy legislation that we are debating.\n  The bill before us out of the Energy Committee coordinates the work \nof many of the committees of the Senate, including the Senate \nGovernmental Affairs Committee which I am privileged to chair, which \nhas contributed a section of this bill. Senator Bingaman and Senator \nDaschle have brought before us a very well-balanced national energy \npolicy, which does have some incentives for the development of \nremaining energy resources in the United States, but makes a turn and \nacknowledges and acts on the acknowledgment that our energy future is \nin new technologies being applied to create new sources of energy-\nefficient, environmentally protected sources of energy. Of course, that \nwill include renewables as well.\n  Mr. President, this great country became an industrial power for many \nreasons, including, of course, the skills and ingenuity of our people. \nBut the availability of inexpensive and abundant sources of energy also \ncontributed to the remarkable growth and success of the American \neconomy during the industrial age.\n  Prior to the mechanization of our society, we relied on wood, water, \nand horses for much of our energy need. ``King Coal'' powered the early \npart of our industrial development and still plays a critical role. \nHopefully, it will continue, with the application of new technologies, \nto play a critical role in generating electricity for our homes, \nschools, offices, and our factories.\n  From the time oil was discovered in Pennsylvania in 1859, the \npetroleum industry has grown enormously--at first, displacing whale oil \nfor lighting and, eventually, powering the world's transportation \nsystems. Enormous deposits of oil spurred development of oil fields in \nmany parts of our country, including Texas, Oklahoma, and California. \nThe 1930s witnessed the enormous expansion of hydropower in various \nparts of our country, including, of course, the Tennessee Valley and \nthe northwest section of America. In the middle part of the 20th \ncentury, we began to harness the atom and develop nuclear power, which \nwas going to be, in the view of many at that time, ``too cheap to \nmeter.'' In other words, it would be so inexpensive you would not even \nbe able to keep track of it to base costing on.\n  Nuclear power continues to be a significant part of our energy mix. \nIn a State like mine, it is most significant. We have two plants up and \noperating that have been decommissioned. I hope we can find a way \nforward to build a next generation of safe nuclear powerplants.\n  The oil price shocks of the 1970s brought home to us our dependence \non foreign markets for oil, on which so\n\n[[Page S1576]]\n\nmuch of our country and its economy have become dependent. With those \nshocks came an understanding of the ability of foreign countries to \nseriously disrupt our economy and our lives through higher prices, \nbringing higher inflation, and unemployment. We began to think and do \nmore about reversing this trend by pursuing energy efficiency and \ndeveloping alternative sources of energy, including renewable energy.\n  Yet we have remained largely dependent on--some would say addicted \nto--fossil fuels, which has exacerbated our dependence. We have also \nfound out along the way that our energy has a cost beyond that of \ndiscovering, producing, and transporting product to market. It has \nhealth and environmental costs. The smokestacks of our powerplants, \nfactories, and the tailpipes of our cars and trucks spew out millions \nof tons of pollutants in great quantity, including sulfur dioxide, \nnitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, mercury, and carbon dioxide. Our \ncitizens --especially our youngest and our oldest--are subject to a \nvariety of diseases associated with their lungs, particularly, \nincluding fine particles and ozone.\n  There is quite a remarkable article in the press today about a study \nthat has been completed--I believe it appeared in the Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association--which draws a powerful and unsettling \nlink between certain pollutants and higher degrees of disease and, in \nfact, projected numbers of premature deaths. That is, people would have \nlived longer had they not been inhaling the emissions from power plants \nand some of the rest of our society.\n  Our lakes and streams have suffered under the assault of acid rain. \nOur bays are being choked by nitrogen loadings that come from cars and \npowerplants. People throughout the country cannot eat fish out of lakes \nnearby because of mercury contamination. The great vistas of our \nnational parks are despoiled by haze created by motor vehicles, \npowerplants, and the fossil fuels they are burning creating emissions.\n  We are heating up the planet through greenhouse gases. We face \npotentially catastrophic consequences over time associated with sea \nlevel rise and increased threats from airborne diseases that migrate \nnorth toward our country or within our country as we heat up the \nplanet's atmosphere as a result of the use of fossil fuels.\n  We cannot continue to use the atmosphere as a dumping ground for \nwaste coming out of smokestacks and tailpipes on a business-as-usual \nbasis. It is our responsibility as stewards of the Earth that we are \nblessed to inhabit as temporary residents, trustees for the generations \nand generations that will follow us over the centuries ahead, to \nestablish a framework, a system for meeting our energy needs without \nharming public health or destroying the environment in the process.\n  We must consider both of those important policy factors as we go \nforward with this energy legislation. Energy policy and environmental \npolicy are, if you allow me to put it this way, like a gas pedal and a \nbrake pedal. They only make sense when they are used together and used \nsensibly.\n  As we consider energy legislation, we have a clear choice between \ndeveloping an innovative and independent new energy policy or \ncontinuing the same policy--a policy that will continue our energy \ndependence, deprive us of national independence and compromise the \nhealth of our people and the openness and condition of our environment.\n\n  We all know that America needs a lot of energy. It takes energy to \nmove our cars and trucks, to cool our refrigerators, and power the \nterrific technological tools that drive our innovative economy. The \nchallenge is--and it is a challenge--how do we get that energy in a way \nthat does not do the kind of damage I have just described?\n  The biggest challenge is in transportation. Cars and trucks are \nresponsible for two-thirds of all petroleum use in the United States. \nThat overreliance not only harms public health and the environment, but \nalso hastens global warming. The overreliance forces us on a course of \nforeign policy dependence because it entangles us in unstable regions \nand forces us to deal in a much less demanding way than we otherwise \nwould with regimes that do not reflect our values, human rights, \nreligious tolerance, openness, and democracy.\n  Some people think we can drill our way out of this imbalance, but we \nhave to do the math, and the math is powerful. We have 3 percent of the \noil reserves left within our control, yet we consume 25 percent of the \nworld's oil. Two-thirds of the world's oil lies in countries in the \nPersian Gulf, even though we have developed other sources of energy and \noil from Latin America, from Africa, and increasingly from central \nAsia.\n  We cannot just drill our way out of the problem. The more oil we use, \nthe more dependent we will be on oil that other countries have and own. \nThat is one of the lessons we have to learn from world events and \nconsider as we go forward on this energy legislation.\n  America's strength is not in our oil reserves. That is the painful \nfact. America's strength is in our reserves of innovation and technical \nknow-how. An energy strategy that is good for America will exploit \nthose reserves of innovation and technical know-how to produce smart \nenergy-saving technology and cleaner modern fuels.\n  Unfortunately, many would have us extend our dependence on oil, and \nbecause other countries overwhelmingly control the oil reserves, that \nmeans extending our dependence on foreign oil.\n  They have even, in addition, proposed the despoiling of some of our \nmost precious places in the process. And for what? We will obviously \nwill have a debate, as we have had before, on the question of whether \nto drill in that remaining 5 percent of the North Slope of Alaska. If \nwe opened up, God forbid, the Arctic Refuge to oil exploration, there \nwould be, as we have said over and over, a blip of oil to meet the \nenormous need we would have. It just does not do it for us.\n  We should say no to oil development in the Arctic Refuge. We should \nprotect a most unusual, unique, magnificent, inspiring piece of \nAmerica, piece of God's creation, which is the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge. We have to go in a new direction. We need to spur aggressive \ndevelopment of both new and proven energy sources and technologies, \nwhich would include natural gas, the subject of the amendment before \nthe Senate now.\n  We should encourage hybrid vehicles. Some of those are out and \nselling very well. There are waiting lists of people who want to buy \nthem and cannot get them rapidly enough.\n  We must pave the way for renewables, fuel cells, and other barely \nimagined technologies. I am convinced we have the brain power and the \neconomic power to develop them if we put our mind and will to it. Of \ncourse, we should develop our remaining oil deposits that can be \ndeveloped without hurting the environment, and there are some \nremarkable new technologies that will help us do that.\n  Fuel cells are a particularly promising technology, and I hope we in \nGovernment will work with industry and others to develop a credible \nbusiness plan, that is what I would call it, for fuel cell technology \ndevelopment, a business plan that would have clear goals and timetables \nby which we would develop and deploy fuel cells.\n  I support the progressive tax incentives for alternative fuels and \nclean and renewable energy that are part of the package that came out \nof the Finance Committee. I thank and commend Chairman Baucus and \nSenator Grassley on crafting a responsible and forward-looking set of \nincentives to transform our energy mix and make us more independent and \nefficient.\n  The bill before us does open doors to innovation. It sets up a new \nframework for the kinds of innovative energy policy we need. That \nreally should be the commitment of our generation, a single-minded, \nall-out drive to protect our security by developing a new framework for \nenergy use in our country.\n  We have to start with energy efficiency standards. Over the last 20 \nyears, we have made magnificent efficiency gains which lay a firm \nfoundation for future progress. Increasing the fuel efficiency of cars \nand trucks by just 3 miles per gallon, well within our reach \ntechnologically, would save 6 billion gallons of gasoline per year. As \nI understand it, by the best estimates, that is about two times the oil \nthat would come out of the Arctic Refuge if we drilled.\n  That 3-miles-per-gallon increase in fuel efficiency would also save \nAmericans $9 billion a year in annual spending. Imagine that, $9 \nbillion in savings.\n\n[[Page S1577]]\n\n The increase would also reduce carbon emissions by 15 million tons a \nyear, that much less contributing to the pollution of our air and the \nwarming of our planet.\n  We can clearly do, in my opinion, better than 3 miles per gallon. \nThat obviously will be the topic of debate that will occur on the \namendment on this bill regarding so-called CAFE standards. We were all \nshocked in the 1970s by the steep increase in the price of oil as a \nresult of the Arab oil embargo in 1973 and 1974 and the Iranian \nrevolution in 1979. Gas prices were approaching a dollar a gallon, and \nwe thought the price would only continue to rise.\n  We made some real efficiency gains in our economy and in our \ntransportation fleet, but the price of oil collapsed in 1986. Despite a \nfew price spikes along the way, gasoline is now not that much over a \ndollar a gallon, making it cheaper, certainly when adjusted for \ninflation, than it was in 1980. New sales of vehicles are increasingly \ncharacterized by sport utility vehicles and light trucks--great \nvehicles, but our overall fuel efficiency has therefore and thereby \ndeclined.\n  We are caught in a policy bind. We have less expensive fuel, \nproviding little incentive to conserve, and industry remains opposed to \nincreased fuel efficiency standards. So gas prices remain low, our fuel \nefficiency averages are declining, and therefore we continue to \nincrease our reliance on imports of oil. I hope this legislation before \nus will provide the opportunity to break that gridlock and that we will \nsupport increased fuel efficiency standards for our vehicles.\n  I believe people who oppose the increases in fuel efficiency may well \nunderestimate the resourcefulness and ingenuity of our researchers and/\nor industry. For example, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is \ndeveloping a most promising new technology for economically reducing \ngasoline engine vehicle emissions and fuel consumption. It could reduce \nsmog-producing nitrogen oxide emissions from gas engines by 90 percent, \nand it has the potential to increase engine efficiency by 25 percent \nand reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent.\n\n  We should take advantage of the many advances that have been made \nunder the aegis of the Partnership For a New Generation of Vehicles, a \nprivate-public partnership between the Federal Government and the \nautomobile industry to improve the fuel efficiency of our vehicles. The \nadvances we have made in these hybrid technologies that have already \ncome out of that partnership are dramatic. The administration has \nembraced fuel cells fueled by hydrogen, and I welcome that, but the \nresults are still some time away. That is why we need to make advances \nin fuel economy sooner, as well as later.\n  We must also reform our energy system to give renewables and \nalternative energy fair access to the market, both by ensuring they can \nmake a physical connection to the grid and by enacting tax credits that \nwill ensure the market is open and welcoming to them; in other words, \nto give consumers and businesses a tax credit for use of some of the \nrenewable and alternative energy systems coming on board, including \nfuel cells.\n  We should also require electricity generators, I believe, to account \nfor a portion of their output through renewable energy sources, and I \nsupport the inclusion of a renewable portfolio standard in this bill.\n  I understand many existing industries are resistant to change because \nchange involves risk. Fortunately, many companies are ready to accept \nsome risk because they know there is reward in that, that nothing \nultimately ever stays the same. Many businesses have developed new \ntechnologies and are willing to do so even more if given a clear, \nlasting signal from our Government as to what we are going to ask and \nin which direction we are going. If Government leads by establishing \nclear goals, objectives, and incentives, as this bill does, progress \nwill follow. Government can act as an innovation spur, not an \ninnovation barrier.\n  I know there are some who will argue the energy bill is not the place \nto address climate change. I disagree. I see climate change as probably \nthe biggest long-term environmental challenge that we as Americans and \neveryone else on the planet face. Some would argue climate change is \nseparate from energy, but I respectfully disagree; they are \ninextricably linked. The overwhelming majority of greenhouse emissions \ncome from producing and consuming energy, whether in our powerplants, \nour factories, or our cars and trucks.\n  I particularly salute the pioneering bipartisan work done by Senators \nByrd and Stevens to promote research and development on climate change, \nto require an office in the White House which will have the \nresponsibility of developing and overseeing the implementation of \nhopefully a national climate change policy.\n  I am proud to say the Governmental Affairs Committee unanimously \npassed the Byrd-Stevens legislation and it has become part of the \nenergy bill we are debating. The provision does not create any \nmandatory programs to address climate change--that debate has been \nreserved for another day--but it puts a strategic planning and research \nand development foundation in place so we can understand the nature of \nour problem and begin to work aggressively on solutions.\n  In particular, the Byrd-Stevens legislation would create a \ncomprehensive effort within the executive branch that would provide \ncreative thought, the creative thought that global warming requires, \nincluding a new White House office to develop a peer reviewed strategy \nto stabilize the levels of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere to safe \nlevels. Now that is an objective on which I hope we can all agree. In \nfact, the Senate has already agreed on that goal because it is the \nstated objective of the 1992 Rio Treaty on Climate Change, which this \nbody ratified.\n\n  Finally, I again compliment the comprehensive nature of the Byrd-\nStevens provision. In crafting a climate change strategy, the White \nHouse office would be instructed to consider four key elements: \nEmissions mitigation, technology development, adaptation needs, and \nfurther scientific research. Very often in our debate on this issue all \nfour of these topics do not make it into the discussion, but they must.\n  To quote Senator Byrd, his bill is meant to complement, not replace, \nother mitigation measures by creating a process by which we receive \nexpert evaluation of the challenge we face. I hope this legislation \nwill be the tree off which other critical climate change measures will \nbranch.\n  This is a challenge of great import to us and to all who will follow \nus on the planet. As Senator Stevens starkly reminded our Governmental \nAffairs Committee at a hearing last year, we can already see some \ndeeply unsettling signs of climate change in the Arctic. Permafrost is \nmelting, glaciers are disappearing, boreal forests are moving north, \nand the migrating habits of many species are being disrupted.\n  The provision these two leading Senators, Messrs. Byrd and Stevens, \nauthored is an important first step in examining and reacting to the \nclimate change crisis. To me, it is one every Member of the Senate \nought to be able to support, and I hope because it is part of this \nlegislation before us that all will.\n  I am thankful for the opportunity to make this opening statement. I \nrepeat what I said at the beginning: This is a bill whose importance to \nevery single American and to our country in general cannot be \noverstated. I look forward to the debate. I hope we can find common \nground to achieve what I believe is our commonly held goal, which is to \nmake America more energy independent than it is today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). Under the previous order, the \nassistant Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  I wish to make a few remarks regarding the energy bill. Let me first \ncompliment my colleague and the former chairman of the committee, \nSenator Murkowski, for his leadership on this issue and for the \nstatement he made both yesterday and today.\n  Let me also express my very strong displeasure with the process that \nleads us here today. I am glad we are debating energy. I am glad we are \ngoing to have an energy bill that will be amended and discussed. But I \nam very upset about the procedure and how we arrived here today.\n\n[[Page S1578]]\n\n  I served 22 years on the Energy Committee. I worked with Democrats \nand Republicans to pass historic legislation, to deregulate the price \nof natural gas. I worked with Senator Bennett Johnson, Wendell Ford, \nJim McClure, and other Senators. It was bipartisan, historic, important \nlegislation. We passed other legislation.\n\n  My point is, we passed historic, meaningful legislation in a \nbipartisan manner through committee markups, some of which, as in the \ncase of natural gas deregulation, took years. We worked on it, we \namended it, and brought a bill to the floor. We did not do that in this \ncase. I cannot recall in my Senate career a legislative proposal this \nsignificant where it bypassed the committee. The committee proposal we \nhave before the Senate had no Republican input. I have not had one \nchance to offer one amendment to this bill. I am offended by that. I am \noffended by the process. I am offended by the fact that people think we \ndo not want markup in the committee because we cannot control the \ncommittee. Since when do we say, we will not have markups if we cannot \nwin?\n  That is exactly what happened. I have heard some say, that is not \nreally what happened--we just rule 14 bills all the time. We do not, \nall the time, take significant legislative action and say we don't want \nthe committee to mark it up; we do not want to have bipartisan input; \nwe do not want to allow people to offer amendments; we do not want them \nto have an amendable vehicle.\n  The fact is we did not have a legislative markup in the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee for months. I am offended by that. Why am I \nserving in the Senate? Why did I select the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee? Why am I one of the senior members on that \ncommittee and not even have a chance to offer an amendment to express \nsome positive or negative points about some provisions that affect \nevery single American? I did not even have a chance to offer an \namendment. I did not even have a chance to say this is good or bad. Now \nwe have to do it on the floor.\n\n  There are a lot of items in this bill that a lot of people do not \nknow about. I wonder if my colleagues are aware there is a $10 billion \nloan guarantee in this bill. Most people do not know that is included. \nWe never had a hearing on it. We did not have a hearing on it in the \nHouse or in the Senate and it is in the bill. I understand they will \nchange it. That is interesting. That has not been discussed.\n  When Senator Murkowski was chairman of the committee, we had a lot of \nhearings dealing with the issue, and we were going to mark up the bill. \nWe started marking up the bill last year but we stopped. Why did we \nstop? The Washington Post says in an October 11 headline, ``Daschle \nStops Panel's Consideration of Energy Bill.''\n  Then it goes on to say: ``Majority leader, Tom Daschle, yesterday \nabruptly halted further committee consideration of major energy \nlegislation after Democrats concluded there were probably enough votes \non the panel to approve the Bush administration's plan for drilling in \nAlaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.''\n  In the Washington Times, the headline, ``Daschle Takes Control of the \nEnergy Bill; Republicans decry bid to stall Alaskan drilling as \n`partisan' maneuver.''\n\n       Daschle yesterday took control of the energy bill in a move \n     to strengthen his opposition to the administration's proposal \n     to drill for oil in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, \n     which President Bush says is critical to national security.\n       In an unusual legislative action . . .\n\n  It is more than ``unusual.'' I don't remember it happening. I have \nbeen here 22 years, and maybe others who have been here longer can say \nit has happened, but I can't remember a majority leader saying: Stop, \ndon't work, don't mark up, I will come up with something on my own.\n  That does not happen.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I recall when we saw the budget resolution last year \nthat contained the President's enormous tax cut, that came from the \nBudget Committee without markup. That was brought by Senator Domenici \nto the floor, at the request of the majority leader at the time, \nSenator Lott. Am I not correct that was a major piece of legislation \nthat came to the Senate floor without ever having a committee markup?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Let me answer the Senator's question. I thank the \nSenator for the point.\n  There is a difference between a budget resolution that is not even \nlaw--a budget resolution does not even go to the President for \nsignature. Budget resolutions are entirely different matters. That is \nnot the same. A budget resolution does not have the impact. A budget \nresolution authorizes committees to say: Here is how much you spend. \nBut it is not a tax cut. You still have to pass a tax cut; you still \nhave to pass the legislation.\n  This is legislation. This is a bill that will become law. This is a \nbill that has the potential of increasing the cost of vehicles for \neverybody in America by $2,000 or $3,000. Are people aware of that? Do \nI recall a hearing on that provision, the so-called CAFE standards? No. \nDid the Commerce Committee have a hearing on it? Did the Commerce \nCommittee have a markup on it? Did it pass by bipartisan majority out \nof the Commerce Committee? The answer is no.\n  Where is the committee report? One of the reasons we have markups in \ncommittees is to have everybody on the committee who has expertise on \nthe issue to have input, to support it or oppose it--to issue a \ncommittee report so we can find out what is in it, so you can read what \nis in it in English, not just the legislative language which is \ndifficult to decipher. Our competent and capable staff prepare a \ncommittee report explaining in English, here is what this provision \ndoes, here is what this provision means.\n  On most legislative issues I can remember we have had a committee \nreport. There is no committee report because the committee did not \nreport on this bill.\n  This bill has enormous potential impact on American citizens, but no \none knows what is in it. I didn't know what was in it and still don't, \neven today. I pride myself on doing a little homework on legislative \nissues. I kind of like to read bills. The bill introduced by Senator \nDaschle did not come through the committee. Maybe it is supported by \nSenator Bingaman, but it is not supported by this Senator. It was \nintroduced February 15. It is 436 pages. I wanted to get the yeas and \nnays because I had an idea it might be changed. I was not successful \nand could not do that. But it was introduced and I thought at least I \ncan now start reading it and do homework.\n  The more I read, the less I liked. It is a pretty crummy energy bill, \nin my opinion. I started to say you couldn't do much worse, but maybe \nyou could, surely you could. It is not much to my liking, but I had no \ninput on this bill whatsoever. And I think I happen to be No. 3 in \nseniority in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee--No. 3 or 4.\n  Then the bill was changed. That bill was introduced on February 15, \nand it was 436 pages. On February 26, the bill was introduced, just a \nweek or so ago, and it was 539 pages. It grew by over 100 pages in a \ncouple of weeks. I don't know what the differences are. I am trying to \nfind out. I thought, now I have a printed copy. I had to ask consent to \nget this copy printed, so I did. So now it would not be just in loose-\nleaf form, and now we can get some work done. I can do my homework and \ntake this home.\n  I started reading it. I didn't like this one either. And I didn't \nhave any impact on this. I didn't get to vote on one single page of \nthis bill--not one. I am offended by that process.\n  Then it was changed yesterday. We have version No. 3. This was dated \nMarch 5. It is 590 pages. That is only another 51 pages more than the \nbill that was on the floor a week or so ago. I have not analyzed that. \nI don't know what is in the 51 pages. I have not figured that out yet. \nBut I do know I had no impact, no input, no amendment--nothing.\n  We have a terrible process where the majority leader shuts down the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee and says: We do not care if you \nhave 20 members who have experience on these issues. We don't care if \nyou have had a lot of hearings in the past on these issues--issues such \nas electricity, CAFE standards drilling in Alaska. We\n\n[[Page S1579]]\n\ndo not care if you have expertise because we do not want your input. \nThe Democrats are going to put together a bill. We will decide what you \nwill mark up.\n  Sure, there is a reason. They said: If you want to change it, go \nchange it. We will give you some amendments. And we will have \namendments. Yes, we will just fix it. That is almost the size of the \nBible, and unlike the Bible, it contains no good news.\n  This is a problem. Now we have to fix it. We will fix it paragraph by \nparagraph. There are a lot of paragraphs in 590 pages. I keep reading \nthings in here I don't like. What is my alternative? I didn't have a \nchance to offer an amendment. I do not like the loan guarantee. I don't \nlike any loan guarantee. For the most part I opposed the steel loan \nguarantees. I lost on that one. Now there are loan guarantees for oil \ncompanies in here. I don't like loan guarantees for oil companies \neither. It is in here. Now I have to strike it, I have to replace it.\n\n  I don't like the CAFE standards. Some people think: Let's just \nincrease CAFE standards; we'll go from 27.5 to 35. Wait a minute, in \nthis other version it was 36. But we are going to increase CAFE \nstandards.\n  Does that include SUVs and pickups? Do they have a different \nstandard? Yes.\n  How much will that cost? Some people say it costs a couple of \nthousand dollars a vehicle. It may cost a lot more. It may cost \nthousands of lives.\n  Who had a hearing? Where is the committee report? Where is the \nscientific analysis? Where is the data we have from the Department of \nTransportation that this is a good change? It is not here.\n  Where is the committee report, where you can study the pros and cons, \nthe supporting opinions and dissenting opinions that we usually have in \nthe back of the report? It is not here. I don't recall a committee \nreport.\n  We are going to consider legislation of monumental importance, \nprobably the most important issue we will consider this year--maybe \nnot. Maybe it is in the eyes of the beholder. Maybe some people think \ncampaign reform is more important. I don't. This will impact every \nsingle American because energy security is national security. If you \ndon't have energy security, you don't have national security. If you \ndon't have energy security, you don't have economic security.\n  We have seen that happen in the past. We have found ourselves, in the \npast, when we have not prepared properly, to have made serious \nmistakes, to have been really vulnerable to curtailments. We had a \ncurtailment, I might remind my colleagues. In 1973 we had a \ncurtailment. It was called the Arab oil embargo. Some of my colleagues \nmight remember it. I remember it. I was in the private sector back in \nthose days. There were lines; there were shortages; we had brownouts; \nwe had schools that were closed; we had people lined up for blocks to \nbuy gasoline. There was a real shortage. It was caused by an oil \nembargo because there was a real crisis in the Middle East.\n  At that particular point in time, we had gross crude oil imports of \n26.1 percent. Today we are over 60 percent. In 1979 we had another \nshortage. It was during the Iranian hostage situation. There was an \nembargo. At that time we were importing 44.5 percent. Today we are \nimporting 60 percent.\n  Today we have a real problem in the Middle East. It is flaring up \nevery day in Israel. It could expand. I hope and pray it does not. But \nwe are a lot more vulnerable today than we were back in 1973 and 1979. \nSo now, finally, we have an administration that has put together a \npackage after a lot of work, promoted that package, passed that \npackage, by and large, in the House of Representatives.\n  Did the Senate have a hearing on the House-passed package and use \nthat as a markup vehicle? We do that a lot, but we didn't in this case.\n  Did we hold the House-passed bill at the desk and use that as a \nmarkup vehicle? We do that a lot. No, we didn't do it in this case.\n\n  We started with an entirely different bill, one that has never seen \nthe light of day, one that has never gone through a legislative markup, \none that has never had a Republican amendment considered.\n  Basically, what you have is a couple of people who put this bill \ntogether, making a whole lot of special interest groups very happy in \nthe process. There are lot of special interest groups that, because of \nthis bill, are very happy. But it is a pathetic excuse for an energy \nbill, and it is a very poor excuse if we want to do something that will \nhelp solve some of our national energy problems. Even worse than that, \nit is a terrible legislative process.\n  If we are going to tell two major committees--the Energy Committee \nfor the energy components of this bill and the Commerce Committee for \nthe CAFE standards--don't mark up, then you have just disenfranchised \n47 Senators: We don't want your input; one or two people will decide \nwhat we are going to do, and if you don't like it, amend it; and, \nincidentally, if you try to amend, we are going to filibuster your \namendments so now you have to have 60 votes to change this bill.\n  What is the difference? If a committee markup was held you would have \ninput from Democrats and Republicans. You would probably come a lot \ncloser to having consensus, a bipartisan bill. You would have a \ncommittee report so people could understand it, they could read what it \nis, what people are trying to do, what they are doing in the \nlegislative language. Then, if you disagreed with what the committee \ndid, a group of 40 Senators--in this case, 20 from the Energy Committee \nand 20 from the Commerce Committee; maybe 42 or 43--you could offer \namendments to try to change it.\n  Instead, we are acting as if we have some type of totalitarian \ngovernment or some type of kingdom over here that says: Committees \ndon't operate. I'll decide what is in your bills. Maybe one or two \npeople, maybe three--I don't know how many; a few people, not \nRepublicans--put together the bill. It is 590 pages. Oh, we will amend \nbut if you offer a couple of amendments, we are going to filibuster \nthose amendments. You need 60 votes. Good luck.\n  If you marked it up in the committee and put ANWR in the bill--which \nwe would have--then somebody would have to strike it out of the bill. \nIt is totally different. Then you are talking about a majority vote, \nyou are not talking about 60 votes. There is a big difference. Or if \nsomebody wants to set new CAFE standards, new CAFE standards that have \nbipartisan support that come out of the Commerce Committee, we didn't \ndo that. It is a terrible legislative process. Shame on the Senate for \nthis legislative process. Shame on the Senate.\n  I have only been here 22 years, but we have not done this. It is not \nthe same thing as the budget resolution. It is not the same thing as a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution. This is very comprehensive, significant \nlegislation. It is similar to legislation with which we wrestled in the \nlast Congress dealing with the Patients' Bill of Rights. It is a tough \nbill.\n  I was in charge of a lot of it. I disagreed with a lot of the ideas \nthat were floating around. But we had a markup in the Labor Committee. \nWe had a markup in the Labor Committee that lasted days. We had 30, 40 \nvotes on amendments; more amendments, that many votes.\n  The committee passed, with Senator Gregg's leadership, with Senator \nCollins' and others, a Patients' Bill of Rights. Senator Jeffords was \non the committee at that time. They passed a pretty decent Patients' \nBill of Rights, and we considered it on the floor and amended it on the \nfloor, and we passed it.\n\n  I didn't agree with everything that was in it, but I agreed with the \nfinal package. It was a decent package. It brought a lot of people \ntogether. Some people said it was not enough. But anyway, it went \nthrough the legislative process. It wasn't easy. We could have said: We \nare in the majority, the heck with the committee; we will come up with \nwhat we have deemed is the right package and run with it.\n  I think that is a violation of Senate protocol, spirit--basically \ntelling the minority they don't matter. It doesn't make any difference \nif there are 49 Members on the Republican side, you don't matter; you \nhave no input.\n  I just very strongly disagree with that. It means a lot to people who \nhave not looked at this legislation. Usually a lot of Senators haven't \nlooked at it but they rely on the committee, the authorizing committee, \nfor their expertise and for their homework, and they can rely on them \nfor their judgments.\n\n[[Page S1580]]\n\n  It is kind of hard for us, many of us on this side of the aisle, \nbecause we have not looked at this. I keep finding things in there at \nwhich I am kind of shocked: Where did this come from? Well, some \nlobbyist or somebody had some idea, so he stuck it in the bill. We have \nall kinds of mandates and subsidies and loan guarantees.\n  Now there is an amendment that says that we, in our infinite wisdom, \nare going to choose which pipeline route to go for a natural gas \npipeline in Alaska. The underlying bill says there is a $10 billion \nloan guarantee. I question that. But I also question why we are trying \nto choose which pipeline route should be involved in building the \nAlaska natural gas pipeline.\n  Let me see. Let me count the number of days we have had hearings on \nthis. This is about a $20 billion project--a pretty good size project, \nover which we should have held several hearings on at the least.\n  Did they have a hearing in the House of Representatives? No.\n  This language or similar language is in the House bill. I am not \ngoing to fault the House. I think they did a pretty good job.\n  I question the wisdom of putting this in without hearings. Should we \ndictate which pipeline route? I hate to say this, but what about the \nmarketplace deciding which route? Why don't we use the route that would \nbe most economical? Why don't we use the route that makes most economic \nsense? Why don't we use the most feasible route?\n  Is that language in here? No. The language that Senator Daschle is \nproposing now--in addition to the $10 billion loan guarantee that came \nfrom somewhere, just appeared in this bill--it says: Oh, we are going \nto take the southern route. The southern route--if you look at the \nchart; that is the one shown in orange--swings through Fairbanks and \nthrough Alaska. It is several hundred miles longer than the other \nroute. The other route looks a lot cleaner, a lot shorter, a lot \nstraighter, and it is also in plains, maybe marsh. It is parallel to \nthe Mackenzie River. The other one goes through about 900 miles of \nmountains.\n  I used to work for a pipeline company. I helped lay pipe in some of \nmy private sector days. I know a little bit about it. I know it is \nexpensive. Man, it is a lot more expensive to do it in the mountains \nthan it is on the plains. There may be pluses and minuses on both. I do \nnot know all the pluses and minuses.\n  I know one thing: I probably do not know enough yet to say this is \nthe right route or this other one is. I have not studied it enough. I \ndon't recall a hearing. I have not met with all sides. I have met with \na couple people. I have constituents who have an involvement. I have \nconstituents who have some minerals or gas in the project, and they \nwould like to get it to market. I would like to get it to market. It \nwould be good for the economy to get it to market.\n  But why are we going to mandate which way to go? Why are we going to \nmandate which way to go under Senator Daschle's amendment without even \na hearing? Whose special interest group is this?\n  I just question the wisdom of acting this way, of having this bill up \nin this manner. We have not had a hearing on this bill. No one knows \nwhat is in it except for a few people. And now here is an amendment \nthat says: Oh, in our infinite wisdom, we are going to dictate you go \nthis route. Let's go the longer route, the route that looks a lot more \nexpensive because it is several hundred miles longer than the other \nroute. We are going to dictate that?\n  I don't think we should. Maybe I am in the minority on that. I want \nto defer to my friend from Alaska, Senator Murkowski. I have great \nrespect for him. But I really question the wisdom of Congress trying to \ndictate this, and it just goes with the whole process of this bill.\n  I am more offended by the process and the way this has come to the \nfloor than anything procedurally in the Senate in my career, and \ncertainly out of this committee. I have not been on other committees. \nMaybe other committees have tried a little end run like this in the \npast, but I can't remember. But I know they have not in the Energy \nCommittee because I have been on the committee. I would have been very \noutspoken. If our side tried to do it, I would say: No, that is not \nright. We have to run it through committee. You have to have input from \nDemocrats and Republicans.\n  You may have party-line votes once or twice, but most of the time on \nthe Energy Committee we didn't vote on party lines. We tried to vote \nfor what was right and in the best interests of the country.\n  This is 590 pages of all kinds of little subsidies for alternative \nfuels, mandates. Oh, we already have a big mandate for ethanol, about \n53 cents a gallon for ethanol. Now we are going to mandate not only the \nsubsidy, but we are going to mandate that they have to produce so many \ngallons; I think it is something like 5 billion gallons in another 10 \nyears or something. Wow. How much are we going to do? Then on and on \nand on.\n  The more I see--oh, we have subsidies for wind energy, you name it. \nThere are all kinds of things that are in this bill, some of which are \nvery questionable economically, some of which are going to greatly \nincrease consumer prices.\n  Then let me just touch on the other side of it, and that is the issue \nof CAFE. The Federal Government is going to mandate that we raise the \nfuel average economy standards from 27.5 miles per gallon to 35 miles \nper gallon, and do that over the next 13 years. In a previous bill it \nwas over 11 years. Now that has been adjusted.\n  My wife happens to drive a Pathfinder, an SUV. We should send out \nsignals to SUV moms all across the country: Hey, the Senate Democrats, \nunder this bill, are going to raise the price of your vehicle by at \nleast a couple thousand, if not $3,000 or $4,000. Notice to soccer \nmoms, notice to SUV vehicles: It is in here. It is going to increase \nthe price of your vehicle.\n  Maybe I should have an amendment that says Senate cars should meet \nthese standards, because they do not. But we are going to make every \nsoccer mom in America pay for this because it is in this bill.\n  Oh, soccer moms: One of reasons you like these SUVs is that they are \nkind of big, kind of safe. My son has two kids, and he has one. He has \nthe baby seats in it, and he likes it because it is safe. It is not \ngoing to be nearly as safe if this bill passes because this bill is \ngoing to mandate--well, the vehicle is going to have to have a much \nsmaller engine, it is going to have to be a lot lighter, it is going to \nresemble something more like a Volkswagen than it is an SUV, and we are \nsorry about that.\n  Will the fatalities go up if we pass this bill? The answer is yes, by \nthe thousands. How many? What scientific studies do we have? We don't \nknow. We have not had a hearing. We were not able to ask the safety \nexperts. We were not able to ask the experts who build this: Can this \nbe done? Can it be done safely? And how much will it cost?\n  I would love to ask the automobile manufacturer: How much is this \ngoing to cost? Can we comply with these standards? How much more will \nSUVs cost in 8 years if they meet this standard?\n  I will tell you, it is going to be in the thousands. We do not know \nbecause we have not had the hearing. We have not asked those questions. \nWe have not gone the legislative route. There is no committee report. \nThere was no homework done. This is put together and changed almost on \na daily basis.\n  It is a crummy way to legislate. And this first amendment is a crummy \nway to legislate, a very poor way. Shame on the Senate if, oh, we are \njust going to decide this is the way we are going to build this \npipeline, we are going to dictate you have to take this route.\n  That is not the way it should be done, not when you are talking about \n$20 billion, not when you are talking about Federal loan guarantees \nthat should not be in the bill in the first place. Oh, now we are going \nto have loan guarantees and we are going to dictate which route to go. \nWe never had a hearing. We do not know which way is the best as far as \nprotecting the environment is concerned. We do not know which is best \nas far as the economy is concerned. One might cost twice as much.\n\n  I would think to build a mile of pipeline through the mountains would \nprobably be several times as expensive as building one on the plains. \nYet we have an amendment offered by Senator Daschle, the first \namendment up: Here is what we are going to do. Maybe\n\n[[Page S1581]]\n\nthere are political considerations behind his amendment. I don't know. \nBut I am just astounded by this process.\n  I am very disappointed in this process. This process should not be \nrepeated. It should not be repeated by Democrats or Republicans. We \nhave committees for a purpose. We have committees for a purpose: So we \ncan have bipartisan input, so we can have the legislative process work, \nso we can have hearings on legislation so people can know what they are \nvoting on, to where they can try to improve it, to where any member of \nthe committee has an opportunity to read the bill and to amend it, to \nchange it--win or lose, at least they have the opportunity to try.\n  No one has had an opportunity to amend this bill--no one. A few \npeople might have been able to get their special interest provisions \nin, thanks to the majority leader and to the chairman of the committee. \nBut no one, no Member of the Senate, has offered an amendment to this \nbill because it has not had a markup.\n  Right at about half the Senate has been disenfranchised because we \ndid not have a markup on the CAFE standard and did not have a markup on \nthe energy package. So now we are presented with an energy bill: Here \nit is. Go get it. Have at it. See if you can improve it. Oh, yes, if \nyou have an amendment we don't like, get 60 votes. That is not the way \nthe Senate is supposed to work.\n  The Senate is a great institution. People are violating the thrust of \nthe Senate. Totally ignoring the committee process should not be done \nlightly. So I am critical of it.\n  I want my colleagues to know of the problem of how we are situated. \nSo we have a bad bill. Some of us are going to try to make it better. \nIt may take a while. We may have to ask a lot of stupid questions: What \nis this in here for? How much is it going to cost? I would like the \nproponents to know I am going to be asking those questions because I \ndid not have a chance to ask them yet. I did not have that chance to \nask them in committee, so I am going to ask them on the floor. So this \nmarkup may take a little while.\n  This amendment may take a little while. I do not want to filibuster \nthis amendment, but I want to know how much it is going to cost. I want \nto know why this route is preferred over the other route. I want to \nknow why there is a $10 billion loan guarantee in the bill. Why? Who \nbenefits from that? What is the purpose? Is that the best way to do it? \nShould it be done? Is it necessary for it to be done? Could we build \nthe other route even without a loan guarantee? Without price supports? \nIs that possible? Does it need to be? Or does the marketplace dictate \nwe have to go this way?\n  Aren't those decent questions? Shouldn't those questions be asked? \nThey have not been asked before. Yet we are getting ready to commit to \na $20 billion project? This is a crummy way to legislate. The Senate \nleadership should know this is not the way to operate.\n  We should not disenfranchise 40 some Senators from the committee \nprocess. I hope we won't do it in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if I could respond to some questions that the \nSenator from Oklahoma, the minority whip, brought up because I \ncertainly agree with his contention that these matters have not been \naddressed in a committee process. They are being addressed on the \nfloor.\n  As I indicated earlier in my opening statement, we have quite a \nresponsibility before us to educate Members. I think the questions my \nfriend from Oklahoma posed deserve consideration. I wonder if I could \nperhaps offer an explanation as to why the proposed route that has been \nsupported by the State of Alaska is the preferred route.\n  As my colleague knows, the concentration of capital necessary to \nbuild either route is going to be substantial, somewhere in the area of \n$15 to $20 billion. Clearly, the companies that are going to build this \npipeline are interested in a return on their investment. I don't think \nmy colleague is aware of the particulars associated with the northern \nroute.\n  It would require roughly 400 miles of pipeline at sea. If I can refer \nto the map, I think it is important to recognize that this is an area \nthat is extraordinary because it runs roughly from Prudhoe Bay, where \nthe gas has been discovered about 400 miles off the Arctic coast. This \nis an area that is only ice free about 40 days of the year. We are well \nabove the Arctic Circle here. As a consequence, the technology is \nobviously achievable, but there is still a question of at what price.\n  As the Senator from Oklahoma is well aware, we have been trying for \ndecades to get permits and the authority to open up ANWR, which is on \nland, for oil and gas exploration. The consideration has been whether \nwe could do it safely. The problem we have in laying this pipeline in \nthis particular body of water is access because much of the year it is \ncovered with very heavy ice.\n  Theoretically, most pipelines are laid with a trench being dug on the \nocean floor and then covered up, and so forth. We are talking probably \nabout this pipeline being 3 to 4 miles offshore where you would get the \nadequate depth. The unique problem you have with the engineering is \nthis scouring of the bottom when the ice moves because, as you know, \nabout seven-tenths of the ice is underwater. So these present some \nengineering problems.\n  They also present some problems associated with the concern over the \nNative people, the Eskimo people of Alaska and their concern over the \nmigratory bullhead whale which they are dependent on from the \nstandpoint of subsistence. They support drilling on land and support \nactivity on land, but they are reluctant to see activity offshore that \nmay change the route of the migratory whale movement of the bullhead \nwhale. So they are opposed.\n  I can cite for the record comments I received in opposition to \nanything out at sea that might affect them.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the comments in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Comments on Proposals for a Natural Gas Pipeline From the North Slope \n   of Alaska by George N. Ahmaogak, Sr. Mayor, North Slope Borough, \n                             Barrow, Alaska\n\n(Submitted to the United States Senate, Committee on Energy and Natural \n                      Resources, October 2, 2001)\n\n       I want to thank Chairman Bingaman and the Committee for \n     inviting comments on North Slope natural gas development from \n     residents of the regions, because we will be most affected by \n     the impacts of development. As Mayor of the North Slope \n     Borough. I represent the people who live in eight communities \n     scattered across the top of Alaska. The majority of our \n     residents are Inupiat Eskimos, whose ancestry is traced back \n     thousands of years along this stretch of the Arctic Ocean \n     coastline.\n       For more than a quarter of a century, the people of the \n     North Slope have played an active role in Alaska's oil and \n     gas development. After our initial fears about the \n     environmental safety of oil and gas operations were calmed by \n     experience, we struck a stance on development that has not \n     wavered. We have supported onshore projects when they contain \n     adequate environmental safeguards for the land and animal \n     populations and when they do not jeopardize our traditional \n     subsistence hunting and fishing activities, which are so \n     crucial to the continuation of our Native culture.\n       We have pursued these goals in our interactions with the \n     oil industry largely through our local powers of planning and \n     zoning within the oil fields. We have also sponsored \n     extensive biological research and worked with state and \n     federal agencies to gauge the continuing health of wildlife \n     species in the region.\n       Twenty-five years later, we remain committed to the \n     stewardship of our homeland as we work in partnership with \n     state and federal agencies and the industry to extract the \n     oil and gas resources our nation so clearly needs. Our \n     commitment to a culturally sensitive development approach \n     leads us to a very firm position on natural gas development. \n     We recognize the need to export the North Slope's vast \n     natural gas supplies, and we believe there is only one \n     environmentally sensible transportation path--along the \n     route of the existing Trans-Alaska oil pipeline. Most of \n     the issues associated with pipeline routing have already \n     been identified and successfully resolved through years of \n     experience with the TAPS oil pipeline. Using the existing \n     corridor is more environmentally efficient than any \n     alternative and is unlikely to result in significant \n     surprise impacts related to land or wildlife. It is \n     clearly the safest and most acceptable transportation plan \n     in our opinion.\n       For these reasons, we support the State of Alaska's \n     insistence on a southerly (Alaska Highway) route. We also are \n     adamant in our opposition to any project that would involve \n     an offshore pipeline to the McKenzie Delta on the Canadian \n     side of the border. We believe this ``over-the-top'' scenario \n     is technologically arrogant and offers substantially\n\n[[Page S1582]]\n\n     greater risk of environmental and cultural damage.\n       Our elders and our subsistence whalers are the true experts \n     on the seasonal movements of sea ice along the arctic coast. \n     They have spent decades studying the forces of pack ice as it \n     piles upon itself to create huge pressure ridges the size of \n     tall buildings. They have witnessed the results of current-\n     driven ice scouring the ocean floor. They have heard stories \n     about these forces, stories that represent the oral \n     preservation of empirical science handed down from generation \n     to generation.\n       At the same time, the industry has repeatedly tried and \n     failed to show its ability to clean up an oil spill in broken \n     ice conditions. Demonstration of such ability should be an \n     absolute requirement before any offshore oil development is \n     allowed to occur.\n       Our opposition to an over-the-top route is not conceived \n     lightly. We have proven ourselves to be both willing partners \n     and environmental stewards. When we stand up against a \n     proposal, our objection cannot be dismissed as environmental \n     dogmatism. Nor can our support for a project be written off \n     as pro-development fanaticism. Ours is a more complex \n     position, stemming from a cultural perspective that \n     acknowledges the advantages of development, clings to an \n     inherent environmental ethic, and has as its highest goal the \n     continued health of the original culture attached to this \n     part of the world. The southerly route offers the best \n     solution in light of this trio of concerns.\n       While we support the southern route, we do not believe that \n     a natural gas pipeline should be supported at any and all \n     cost. A successful project must have the inherent fiscal \n     strength to preserve existing arrangements for local property \n     taxation of energy infrastructure. We have heard rumors of \n     tax concessions associated with a gas pipeline project, but \n     we have not been asked for our opinion on such a scheme. We \n     do not support tax concessions at the local level.\n       Additionally, we are concerned about the cumulative impacts \n     of oil and gas development. Federal project permits are based \n     in part on an analysis of potential environmental impacts on \n     land, wildlife and human inhabitants of the area. However, \n     this analysis is project specific, and while it has been \n     discussed for years, no provision has ever been made for \n     alleviating the cumulative effects of industrial activity on \n     local communities.\n       We see the effects in a constant level of stress in our \n     villages. Health problems, family dysfunction, alcohol abuse \n     and other symptoms require intervention. We need help in \n     assessing and addressing these impacts, and we look to the \n     government for impact aid or some other form of assistance \n     aimed at combating these social stresses.\n       Discussion of a natural gas pipeline necessarily exists in \n     the larger context of North Slope resource development. With \n     that in mind, I would like to reiterate our support for \n     careful exploration in a small portion of the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). This is in keeping with our belief \n     that activity in onshore areas of strong potential is more \n     responsible than offshore exploration and development. \n     Directional drilling and other technical improvements make \n     low-impact activity on the edge of ANWR feasible. \n     Accommodations for seasonal caribou migration can be achieved \n     in ANWR as they have been elsewhere in the region.\n       Again, I appreciate the committee's interest in the \n     perspective of people who live on the North Slope. I hope my \n     comments assist you in your deliberations. Ours is certainly \n     not the only perspective, but it is a view that springs from \n     the landscape whose future you are considering. I honor the \n     difficulty of your task, and I hope that faith, determination \n     and the good of the people guide you.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. As the Senator from Oklahoma has expressed, we have \nnot had any hearings. We don't know what the scientific answer is. But \nthere is the fear of the people and therefore an objection to any \noffshore activity.\n  Then there is the question of trying to get permits to do something \nfor which we don't know what the impact will be. We have never been \nable to get permits even on land, let alone the difficulty of offshore.\n  There is also a considerable discussion that has taken place in the \nengineering community about the prospects of having to loop the line at \nsea because if you had a break or a fracture and the tremendous amount \nof volume of somewhere in the area of 4 to 6 billion cubic feet a day \nflowing through that into a market in the Midwest, perhaps in Chicago, \nif there was a fracture, you would have a devastating supply situation. \nAnd your ability to get at it in the winter with the heavy ice, which \nis 4 and 5 and 6 and 9 feet thick, would mandate a duplicate route. \nThese are all theoretical, but nevertheless they are concerns \nexpressed.\n  I will highlight the concern associated with this route. It is \ncertainly a route that is less from the standpoint of distance. There \nare a couple other aspects we should point out. This is not necessarily \na mountainous route. This is a route that parallels the highway and \nalso is a route proposed in 1941 for a railroad to Alaska. The Senator \nfrom Oklahoma knows we don't have a connection with the \ntranscontinental railroads of the United States or Canada. But this \nroute is a relatively low elevation. There is one pass in here where \nthe pipeline goes. But as the Senator knows, you increase pressure, and \nit is not nearly as bad at picking up friction as an oil pipeline.\n  There are a couple other points I do want to make that are relevant \nto our consideration. That is the realization that since this is Alaska \ngas, not found on Federal land but Alaska State land, we obviously want \naccess to the gas for petrochemical and development within our own \nState, as opposed to the northern route which would simply move the gas \noffshore with very little secondary industry opportunities for Alaska \npetrochemical employment, and so forth.\n  Furthermore, we have been exporting gas out of Kenai to Tokyo, to \nTokyo Gas and Electric since about 1966. That gas has come from Cook \nInlet. The reserves are running lower now, and we are concerned in \nAnchorage about only two year-round manufacturing plants for urea and \nammonia, and an LNG plant having access to gas. If it goes this way, \nthe majority population centers will not be afforded the opportunity of \nthis gas.\n  I don't disagree with the Senator from Oklahoma. I think he knows me \nwell enough to recognize, as businessmen, the market dictates. But \nAlaska is a little different than Oklahoma. We are isolated from the \nUnited States by Canada. If we don't put our foot forward in the area \nof development, we are simply going to be a State where our resources \nare exported. We have no residential capital base of any kind so \ncapital comes in, exploits the resources, takes them out, and leaves \nnothing. Our oil companies are good citizens that come to Alaska. They \nsupport our efforts. But they are not domiciled in Alaska.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is fortunate in having oil companies \ndomiciled in his State even though I guess some of them are moving to a \nlittle bigger State--not the biggest State. I would like to see them \nmove to Alaska rather than Texas. He has a lot of independent oil \ncompanies, oil and gas. We don't have that in Alaska because we have \nnever been able to accumulate residential wealth nor the availability \nof private land.\n  This is a public lands State. As you know, the wealth that is \naccumulated in our State is public wealth. It is not private. So we \ndon't have domiciled capital ventures that develop our State. We are \ndependent on outsiders coming in with a lot of money. When they take \nthe resource out, they don't leave much more for it.\n  This has been the constant history of Alaska. It has been \nexploitation. First, it was the copper at Kennicott near Cordova. They \ntook the copper out for years and left nothing, absolutely nothing \nexcept an abandoned railroad. The canned salmon industry exploited the \nfishing in southern Alaska. It was all controlled out of Seattle. They \nleft, and there is nothing left in Alaska. We have had the oil \nindustry, and we see our oil going down to Valdez and shipped out of \nthe State. It benefits Washington and Oregon and California.\n  We are at the point of saying: Wait a minute. We have a resource in \nour State. We want to make sure we are involved in utilizing this \nresource to employ our people. We had 30,000 of our young people, ages \nroughly 19 to 35, leave our State in the last 10 years because we are \nnot able to offer good paying jobs in blue-collar resource development. \nYet we are the State with the largest resource base: Oil, gas, timber, \nthe fish, the minerals. But as the Senator from Oklahoma notes, in our \neffort to open up ANWR, we are taking on the whole public posture of \nAmerica's environmental community. It is a different set of \ncircumstances.\n  I trust that my friend from Oklahoma will get a little better \nunderstanding.\n  This isn't just a simple matter of a shorter pipeline. It is a matter \nof jobs in Alaska, resident opportunities in Alaska because, as this \nroute goes, the jobs and activity are virtually all in Canada. You have \nthe Yukon Territory, Northwest Territory, Alberta, British Columbia, \nand so forth.\n  I don't dispute the reality that economics dictate how things happen. \nBut\n\n[[Page S1583]]\n\nremember one thing, and this has been overlooked in this debate: This \ngas belongs to the State. It doesn't belong to Exxon; it doesn't belong \nto BP; it doesn't belong to Phillips. They hold the leases. When this \ngas is developed, one-eighth of the gas can be taken by the State in \nkind. We should have something to say about where our gas goes and how \nit benefits our State.\n  So that is the action that was taken in the House of Representatives \nand they designated the route that would be most beneficial to the \nState of Alaska. That is why I have cosponsored the amendment offered \nby the majority leader this morning.\n  But I totally agree with my friend from Oklahoma about the manner in \nwhich the majority leader circumvented the committee process and, as a \nconsequence, we are here now educating one another on the merits of \nthis bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for 1 minute?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my friend and colleague, Senator Murkowski. I \nunderstand his situation. We are dealing with $20 billion projects, $10 \nbillion worth of loan guarantees, and we haven't had nearly the number \nof hearings necessary to consider proponents of both sides and \nenvironmentalists. In addition, we should have people who are going to \nbe granting permits, and so on, to give us some input and some \nestimates on how much it will cost and what the time delays would be, \nand so on. I haven't seen that being done.\n  The chairman of the Energy Committee is not here, but I want to have \nthis hearing--and I may not get this hearing before this bill is taken \ncare of, but I want to have a hearing on this before we get a \nconference report. So he is not here, but I will insist on it. We are \nnot going to have a conference report until we get to have some \nhearings. I think if we get to the conference, I might have something \nto do with what is going to be in the conference report. To have this \nkind of issue and ask Senators to vote on it when we haven't properly \nreviewed its substance in committee, that is a real procedural mistake. \nWe need to have more significant input from many more experts before \nmaking these decisions. I think it is a mistake for us to dictate which \npipeline we should be building, without more information.\n  With that comment, I yield the floor and thank my colleague from \nNevada.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, if I may make one clarification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my two dear friends leave--and \nperhaps they are not leaving--I would like to have the opportunity to \nclear the record on a few things. First, my friend from Oklahoma, for \nwhom I have the greatest respect, talked about a number of bills. We \nknow that last time we talked about the energy bill. It got to the \nfloor the same way this bill got here. We know that on the budget \nresolution the same thing happened, and also on the Patients' Bill of \nRights. They got to the floor the same way.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I will in a minute. I want the record to reflect the fact \nthat after Senator Bingaman took charge of the committee, a number of \nhearings were held: June 26 of last year, July 12, July 13, July 17, \nJuly 19, July 24, July 25, July 26, August 1, August 2. On August 1 and \n2, there was a markup of provisions of this bill.\n  I also say to my friend from Oklahoma, there have been hearings on \nthis. We have had extensive hearings on this.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I will in a second. I am trying to lay out something on the \nrecord, and we can elaborate on it later.\n  In fact, we had just one hearing where we had 15 witnesses, including \nthe Governor of Alaska, the State Senators from Alaska. We had people \nfrom Exxon and BP. Senator Murkowski told us how important this is to \nthem. We have had 15 people talk about this. We had 4 different panels.\n  Senator Bingaman is doing something now and is out of the Chamber \nmomentarily, but I want everybody to understand that Senator Bingaman \nhas done an outstanding job of holding hearings. My friend from \nOklahoma should not in any way feel that people have not had knowledge \nof what goes on.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I think there are factual inaccuracies here.\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to talk about that in a second.\n  H.R. 4, which they say is a great bill, has the same stuff in it that \nwe are talking about today. I don't understand why they are upset when \nwe are following the example that the Republicans used when they were \nin control of the Senate. If the Republicans are wrong and we are wrong \nin doing that, the bill is here and it is open for amendment. People \ncan talk as much as they want.\n  As I said, I will bet Oklahoma wished they were in the quandary that \nAlaska is in today. Alaska has a chance of getting the southern route \npipeline that would create 400,000 jobs. That is a pretty good deal for \na small State like Alaska, or even a big State like New York. It would \nbe a great deal for Nevada.\n  This is an economic development program for Alaska that I support. I \nthink it is great. But I want everybody to know that I think Senator \nBingaman has done an outstanding job. I think he is an exemplary \nchairman and we should not complain about how we got here; we are here.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the Senator mentioned that we had \nhearings. Can he give me the dates? Have we had a hearing on the two \nalternatives for pipelines for Alaska?\n  Mr. REID. We had a hearing to receive testimony on the status of \nproposals for the transportation of natural gas from Alaska to markets \nin the lower 48 States, and on legislation that may be required to \nexpedite the construction of a pipeline from Alaska, Tuesday, October \n2, 2001, 10 a.m.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am surprised. I don't recall that. I don't recall \nconsidering the two alternatives. I asked staff did we have a hearing \nand they said no. I asked if there was a House hearing; they said no. \nOn something this controversial, I am just not so sure we did. Maybe my \nmemory is short, but for a $20 billion project, I kind of think I would \nknow about it. Maybe that is not the case. Maybe I am wrong, but I \ndoubt that hearing was set up in a way that said let's consider these \ntwo alternatives.\n  I will do a little more homework to find out what happened on October \n2. I want to find out if we were in session. This doesn't ring a bell.\n  The Senator said the Republicans brought up Patients' Bill of Rights \nunder this procedure. That is wrong. We had a committee markup on \nPatients' Bill of Rights. It was marked up, amended, voted on. It was \ntough, difficult, and it was a very challenging thing, but we marked up \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights. We passed it in committee and on the \nfloor.\n  The Senator mentioned a budget resolution. That is not a law; that is \na guideline for the Congress. Maybe my colleague is right. Maybe we \nshould not have done that. But, at least in my 22 years in the Senate, \nwe have never had substantive, major, significant legislation out of \nthe Energy Committee where we had a day or two of markup and the \nmajority leader said ``no more'' and we have no more input or \nconsideration of amendments. That has not been done, I am absolutely \ncertain, in my 22 years in the Senate.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder----\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I had the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. May I ask my friend a question?\n  Mr. REID. In a minute. I want to explain that we have here from the \nCongressional Record the fact that the hearing was held on the Alaska \nnatural gas pipeline. The committee concluded hearings to examine the \nstatus of proposals for the transportation of natural gas from Alaska \nto markets in the lower 48 States, and on legislation that may be \nrequired to expedite the construction of a pipeline from Alaska. After \nreceiving testimony from--and it lists well over a dozen people, \nincluding the Governor of Alaska, whose testimony I read into the \nRecord today.\n  So this was shortly after September 11. We all had a lot of things on \nour minds, and I know how heavily involved the Senator from Oklahoma \nwas on matters that leadership was involved in. Maybe he missed this, \nbut\n\n[[Page S1584]]\n\nthis was an extensive hearing that took a long time.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. I may well stand corrected, and October 2 is pretty \nclose to September 11. Maybe I missed it. My guess is that hearing did \nnot consider the two alternatives. It may have been promoting one \nalternative. It may have been promoting the alternative that the \nGovernor wanted, but other people--I don't know.\n  I happen to think there is a lot of interest in two alternatives, and \nI do not know which is right. I will readily admit that I do not have \nthe answer to which is the best, which is the most economical, which is \nfeasible. My colleague from Alaska was saying we may have to go \noffshore and build that pipeline; it is a challenge. I do not know that \nwe have to go offshore. These are things that need to be discussed and \nneed to be explored. We did not do that.\n  My point is, though, we began markup on this bill and that markup was \nstopped. Again, I will go back to my little 22 years; I cannot remember \na substantive legislative item, certainly in the Energy Committee, \nwhere we started a markup and then were stopped and were told: No more \ncommittee markup; i.e., we do not want input from other people; we are \njust going to come up with a bill on the floor.\n  That has not been done, and the process is terrible. I am going to \nmaintain my criticism of it. I look at the 590 pages, and it has grown \n100 pages--actually it has grown 154 pages in the last 3 weeks--and I \ndo not know what is in it because we did not have it in committee. \nThere is no committee report. I am fumbling around here. I do not see a \ncommittee report. There is no minority report.\n  That is very unusual for something that is going to increase people's \nbills, that is going to increase the cost of electricity. We ought to \nknow something about it. It is not out there.\n  I stand corrected. I always want to be factual. I may have strong \npassions, but I want to be factual. If we had the hearing and I said we \ndid not, I stand corrected, and I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, also, there were witnesses talking about the \nnorthern route at the hearing. Among those testifying was Forrest \nHoglund, chairman and CEO of Arctic Resources Company in Houston, TX.\n  Maybe the Senator is upset about the procedure, but he should back \noff a little bit because he has clearly been wrong in the statement \nabout not having a hearing. It was a long hearing; it took a long time.\n  I state again we are in the Senate working on this most important \nlegislation. I have in my hand S. 1344, which is the Patients' Bill of \nRights. This came to the Senate without a single hearing. There were \nhearings on the Patients' Bill of Rights but not this bill. It was the \nsame with the energy bill we had on the floor when the Republicans were \nin control of the Senate.\n  We went one step further than they did. My friend from Oklahoma said: \nI have never known in 22 years they started a markup and then got the \nbill here this way. The Republicans would not allow us to even start a \nmarkup. We at least started one.\n  Mr. President, this seems to be getting a little silly. We are here. \nIt is Wednesday. We have to move this legislation. We have other things \nwe need to do. We only follow the lead of the Republicans. If they were \nwrong, then maybe we should have followed somebody else's lead. The \nfact is we are here; let's do the best we can on this legislation. If \nthere is something people do not understand--and I am sure my friend \nfrom Oklahoma, who is an astute legislator, and he does read \nlegislation and understands it--that he may not have had the time. He \nhas one of the best staffs in the Senate. I am sure very quickly they \ncan bring him up to snuff.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a question? Since there was a \nhearing and my able staff pointed out that, yes, there was a hearing, \nit happened to be on October 2, did that hearing involve the necessity \nof loan guarantees? Where did the $10 billion loan guarantee come from? \nThis is a surprise and, to my knowledge, was not considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I do not believe there was substantial \ntestimony on the issue of loan guarantees. Frankly, this is a proposal \nwe included to make the point to the Senate that some type of risk \nsharing might well be possible if this project was going to be viable, \nif the construction of a pipeline was going to be viable.\n  As I understand it, the ranking member of the committee is in favor \nof pursuing a different course. I am certainly working with him jointly \nto see if there is any other way to reduce the risk involved to the \ncompanies, if they decided to go ahead with a pipeline.\n  I can understand there are different points of view about whether or \nnot that would be an appropriate thing to do. We will have an \nopportunity for a debate on that, I am sure, if the bill finally does \ncontain some kind of financial incentive or support provision like \nthat.\n  If the Senator from Oklahoma is opposed to that loan guarantee, he \nought to propose to delete it. That is certainly an option.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think I still have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while the Senator from New Mexico is here, I \nsay to him that I very much enjoyed telling everyone what a great \nchairman he is in his absence. I think he has done a tremendous job \ngetting the bill to this point. This bill and this provision is so \nimportant to people of Alaska and our country.\n  I agree with the Senator from New Mexico. If someone does not like \nparts of this very important amendment, then move to delete it. But I \nthink we are going to have the support of Senator Stevens and Senator \nMurkowski on this, as they should support this.\n  I say to my friend from Oklahoma, I repeat, maybe there is blame to \ngo around about how legislation happens, but we only follow the example \nset by my friends in the minority. However we got here, we are here \nnow. It is legislation that is important for this country, and I \nacknowledge changes probably should be made. It is imperfect, but I \nthink it is really a strong step forward.\n  I look forward to working with my friend from Oklahoma in any way he \nthinks is appropriate to improve this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, before my friend from Nevada leaves, let \nme clarify a couple things. One, he referred once or twice to the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. We had a markup on the Patients' Bill of \nRights. I am absolutely positive of that. No matter how poor my memory \nis, I know there was a markup on it.\n\n  Mr. REID. Not this one.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I do not care how many times the Senator from Nevada \nwaves that bill around, I remember there was a markup. I remember \nputting several people in our committee through a very difficult markup \nto pass legislation, which they did.\n  My colleague says, if you do not like the loan guarantees, strike it. \nThe point is, we did not have a committee markup. If we had had a \ncommittee markup, I would have had an opportunity to strike it in \ncommittee. We would have had 20 people around the committee who would \nhave maybe participated in this hearing and maybe had some impact, but \nwe did not have that chance. I pointed out the $10 billion loan \nguarantee because I do not know where it came from.\n  The point is, it would have been nice to have a markup so we could \nhave discussed it. Maybe I would support it. I do not doubt it is a \nreal national energy plus if we can get all the gas reserves that are \njust being pumped into the ground to the lower 48. That would give us \nsome energy security. That is positive. I would like to see that \nhappen. But I know one thing: I did not have any chance in committee to \ndebate should we have a loan guarantee? Should we have cost shares? \nwhat kind of protection do we have for the Government? Is that the best \nway to go? I am interested in these things. Is this the correct \nalternative?\n  I do not believe the hearing was to consider which alternative is the \nbest. Maybe it was, and maybe it was just too close to September 11 and \nthere were other things going on. I am not sure.\n\n[[Page S1585]]\n\n  We did not have a markup, and I know if we had a markup and somebody \noffered amendments which said we are going to dictate which route we \ngo, I think I would say why not let the marketplace decide which route \nto go.\n  My colleague from Alaska may be exactly right, maybe the southern \nroute is the way to go, but I am saying let's let the marketplace \ndecide.\n  We have pipelines running all over my State, and I have never voted \nonce on where they should go. We have sort of let the marketplace work. \nAlaska is a little unique, but should we not find out how much these \ntwo routes cost?\n  My colleague says if I do not like the $10 billion, strike it. Part \nof our problem right now is we are taking this whole bill up on the \nfloor and now we have to try and fix it. It would have been nice to \nhave had a markup where we could have debated this in committee instead \nof, oh, I am reading through the bill and, oh, there is a $10 billion \nloan guarantee. That is interesting. I wonder where that came from?\n  It is very interesting some of the things one will find in this bill. \nI am going to be reading more of the bill, much to the chagrin of the \nmanager of this bill. I hope we do not pass a bad bill. I question the \nwisdom of a $10 billion loan guarantee, but my point is we should have \nhad a markup on it so these issues would have been resolved. If in the \ncommittee markup a loan guarantee was supported, I might have been \nconvinced in the process it was the right thing to do so we would have \nbipartisan support for it, and maybe we do.\n  The problem is no one knows. I asked my caucus: How many of you know \nthere is a loan guarantee? Nobody, except for Senator Murkowski. The \npoint is, we should have had a markup so we would not have to go \nthrough an educational process on the floor and go through a lot of \nthis. Again, clearly the Senator from Alaska knows what he is talking \nabout but I would imagine about 90-some percent of the rest of the \nSenate does not, and that is kind of unfortunate.\n  I wish we would have had a markup on the entire bill. It would have \neliminated a lot of the process and a lot of the mess that we are in \ntrying to pass an energy package that is 590 pages and, in my opinion, \nstill needs a lot of improvement before we are finished.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Maybe I can enlighten my two colleagues. I see the \nmajority whip has left our midst. He told me he is going to talk to a \nRepublican Governor. That may help his frame of mind, but maybe not.\n  In any event, in reviewing what took place in October, it was not \naddressing the issue specifically of routing. It was to consider how to \nmarket Alaska's natural gas, and there were proposals for LNG, there \nwere proposals for the boroughs of the North Slope, the Fairbanks \nborough, the Valdez borough, to come together. There were about half a \ndozen proposals. It is fair to say, and I want the Record to note, that \nI was not aware, nor did I request, the $10 billion guarantee that is \nin the underlying bill. This was put in, I think, as an explanation \noffered by my good friend from New Mexico, to try and address some kind \nof a safety net that was expressed primarily by one producer from the \nState of Oklahoma.\n  That being what it is, I was of the opinion, after talking to the \nproducers--Exxon, BP, and Phillips--that this $10 billion loan \nguarantee that was put in--and I assume it was put in probably by staff \nin their willingness to try to come up with something that would \nprovide a safety net--would not provide the assurance they need \nrelative to the magnitude of this project. This is a $20 billion \nproject. So I think the record should note we are going to have to \naddress the necessity of this, and the Senator from Oklahoma has \nalready indicated he questions it.\n\n  There has not been a hearing held on it. I hope before this debate is \nover, we could get a position from the producers, namely the companies \nthat hold these gas leases, on whether they think it is necessary and \nwhether it would be beneficial. That is pretty important relative to a \ndetermination of this nature.\n  I intended to ask, and I will for the record, my good friend from \nNevada, who indicated we kind of had a choice--we had a curtain that we \ncould have an ANWR, we could have a gas line, and that sounds very \nencouraging. I ask if he would give us an up-or-down vote on either \none, a 50/50 vote. I will have an opportunity to pose that to him \nlater, or maybe Senator Daschle can provide that.\n  I also ask him, since he was so accommodating, to provide me with an \nanswer of what the position of the committee was on ANWR. What was the \nposition of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee on ANWR? I think \nthe Record should reflect it. I do not think we are going to get an \nanswer, and I think the Senator from Oklahoma would agree with me that \nwe are not going to get a committee position on ANWR, which is as a \nconsequence of the manner in which the whole bill was constructed, \neliminating the committee process and eliminating the opportunity to \nhave a debate and voting on it one way or another out of committee. It \nwas designed to circumvent the committee process.\n  I ask the majority whip if he could provide us, in his opinion, what \nthe committee position was on ANWR. I think that may enlighten some of \nmy colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, to answer the question, I think it was \nobvious the reason why we did not complete markup on the bill is \nbecause the votes were in the committee to have an ANWR provision, and \nI think obviously the majority leader did not want that to happen. So \nhe basically told the committee not to mark up the bill.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on committee amendment No. 2917.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It takes unanimous consent to ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent that the yeas and nays be \nordered on amendment No. 2917.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on the \nbill for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to make a few comments on the \nenergy policy in the form of an opening statement. It is something \nwhich should take a couple of weeks for us to decide given the bill was \nnot taken through committee. We need to do a lot of work, and I hope we \ncan have a very open amendment process so we can work through the \nissues and at the end of the day arrive at a bill we are all satisfied \nwith, one that we can be proud of for an energy policy because I think \nan energy policy has been neglected for too long. It is too important, \nand it is something we need to act upon.\n  We are driving a lot of foreign policy based on our lack of an energy \npolicy, and we are having to do some things in regions of the world we \nprobably should not do because we lack that energy policy, because we \nare so dependent upon the foreign sources.\n  I particularly point out that the areas upon which we are so \ndependent for oil are so volatile, we could almost count on the fact \nthat at some time within the next couple of years we are going to see \nenergy disruptions from the Middle East.\n  We are having some difficulties with Saudi Arabia now, a key place of \nenergy supplies. If we do not act to diversify and get more domestic \nsources of oil and energy, we are setting ourselves up for a problem \nthat we know is coming, so we need to get a bill through. We need to \nget a bill through this Congress.\n  Our energy policy has been neglected for far too long. We see the \neffects of this neglect in the sporadic high gas prices at the pump \nduring the summer,\n\n[[Page S1586]]\n\nin the fact that we import 57 percent of the petroleum we use, and in \nthe complexities we must endure in our foreign policy because of that \nenergy dependency. To alleviate these problems, the U.S. must produce \nmore domestic oil and natural gas while diversifying our energy sources \nwith renewable energy sources, as well. Accomplishing this goal means \nwe engage in a thorough debate on the matter.\n\n  I am pleased the Senate is finally addressing such an important \nissue. I urge my colleagues to resolve our differences so we can get a \nbill passed.\n  The Democratic bill before the Senate has some noble goals, \nparticularly with regard to increasing renewable energy, encouraging \nconservation, fuel efficiency, and addressing global climate change.\n  However, I am concerned that the specifics in this bill will not get \nthe United States to the shared goal we all have: greater energy \nindependence and improving our energy infrastructure. At issue is a \nreal philosophical difference between the two parties as to how we \nshould meet these goals. As I look at the bill before me, I am \nconcerned the main objectives are accomplished through mandates that \nmay not be achievable by the industry we are trying to grow. Whether it \nis the CAFE issue or climate change, we need to focus more on \nincentives, market-based mechanisms, to meet our shared goals.\n  There are some basic tenets that our conservation energy policy \nshould address that are not included in this bill. The prime issue is \nour domestic oil and gas production. The bill has some positive \nmeasures encouraging renewable energy, particularly ethanol, biomass, \nand biodiesel, of which I am very supportive. It neglects to address \nthat we need to expand oil and gas in this country. As a result of not \nhaving that base in this country, we are forced for reliance on foreign \nenergy. That has numerously dangerous consequences. Increasing our \ndomestic production of oil and gas cannot be left out of the energy \nsecurity equation. Conservation is important, but it will not solve the \nproblem alone.\n  The problem is larger than just our domestic situation. It greatly \naffects our foreign policy, as I noted at the outset. If we were freed \nfrom our Middle East dependency on oil, there would be important \nsecurity benefits for our Nation. Regrettably, at this point, \nrenewables alone cannot accomplish this task, but a combination of \nincreased focus on renewable energy, along with increased domestic \nproduction and increased imports from new energy exporters such as the \ncentral Asian countries--and I hope we will be working with other \nnations, too--can yield a formula for accomplishing our mutual energy \nsecurity and independence goals. It is not a simple equation, but I do \nthink we can see through to a solution.\n  I commend the work done by the Finance Committee in putting together \nwhat looks to be a very positive energy tax package. The tax component \nis a critical part of making this work. My friend, Senator Grassley, \nhas worked hard to ensure a positive approach to achieving the goals I \nhave described, particularly in support of renewable fuels such as \nethanol. Specifically, I am pleased to see the inclusion of tax credits \nfor marginal oil and gas production as part of our important need to \nincrease domestic production. We have many of the marginal oil and gas \nwells in my State, and this will help bring those online or, in some \ncases, keep them in production.\n  We must encourage an infrastructure to serve as a barrier against \nhigh prices OPEC may inflict. Independent oil and gas producers are \nthis country's safety net for energy security, and it is in our \nnational interest to preserve and enhance that infrastructure.\n  Further, the bill provides tax incentives to consumers to buy hybrid \nvehicles which pollute less and consume less energy. These are positive \nmeasures. I am hopeful we can push them through this body, along with \nsome support for other alternative methods of energy production.\n\n  As I mentioned, regarding biomass, we can have coal-fired plants that \ncan burn a portion of biomass in their energy production. That can help \nwith our carbon dioxide emission problems but also help having \nlocalized sources for energy.\n  Securing comprehensive energy policies is one of the most important \nefforts this Congress should undertake this year. We should take the \ntime, we should take the effort, and we should not just vote along \npartisan lines but work back and forth in the amendment process to come \nup with a good bill at the end of the day. Let the body work its will.\n  Regarding how this bill got to the floor, we need to have the body \nitself work its will and not get tied down on partisan lines. Then at \nthe end of the day we can come up with a national energy strategy that \nis as broad based as this Nation and the desires here--although our end \nobjective for all of us, energy security, is shared by every Member of \nthis body.\n  Energy is a key engine that drives our economy. Neglecting it forces \nus into international dilemmas that can conflict with our security and \ncounterterrorism agenda. I urge my colleagues to work out our \ndifferences and pass legislation on this vital topic.\n  I am hopeful in one other area that I would like to discuss, the area \nof carbon dioxide emissions. There are important parts of the bill, and \nI will submit amendments with other Senators, to reduce carbon dioxide \nloading into the atmosphere. I strongly believe we should go forward \nwith a policy of a trading system, where we go to least cost methods \nand we put in place a marketplace to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in \nthis country. We have done it previously on issues such as acid rain. \nWe need to do this with carbon dioxide so we can reduce the \nCO2 level at the least cost base as others trading for those \ncarbon credits.\n  There have been innovative programs put in place. I traveled to \nBrazil to look at one program the Nature Conservancy is implementing \nthere. It is innovative, helping the environment by reducing carbon \ndioxide. We should incorporate it as part of our energy strategy. I \nlook forward to this process. I think it is important.\n  As I noted, this is one of the most important bills we can consider \nthis year.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2982 To Amendment No. 2980\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Stevens and \nmyself, I send a second-degree amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski], for himself and \n     Mr. Stevens, proposes an amendment numbered 2982 to amendment \n     No. 2980.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To protect the jurisdiction of the State of Alaska and \n                    provide for workforce training)\n\n       At the end of the amendment insert the following:\n       On page 142 after line 20 insert a new section as follows \n     and renumber all following sections accordingly:\n\n     ``SEC. 708. STATE JURISDICTION OVER IN-STATE DELIVERY OF \n                   NATURAL GAS.\n\n       ``(a) Any facility receiving natural gas from the Alaska \n     natural gas transportation project for delivery to consumers \n     within the State of Alaska shall be deemed to be a local \n     distribution facility within the meaning of section 1(b) of \n     the Natural Gas Act, and therefore not subject to the \n     jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\n       ``(b) Nothing in this Subtitle, except as provided in \n     subsection 704(e), shall preclude or affect any future gas \n     pipeline that may be constructed to deliver natural gas to \n     Fairbanks, Anchorage, Matanuska-Susitna Valley, or the Kenas \n     peninsula or Valdez or any other site in the State of Alaska \n     for consumption within or distribution outside the State of \n     Alaska.''.\n       On page 148 after line 2 insert:\n\n     ``SEC. 714. ALASKAN PIPELINE CONSTRUCTION TRAINING PROGRAM.\n\n       ``(a) Within six months after enactment of this Act the \n     Secretary of Labor (hereinafter referred to as the \n     `Secretary') shall submit a report to the Committee on Energy \n     and Natural Resources of the United States Senate\n\n[[Page S1587]]\n\n     and the Committee on Resources of the United States House of \n     Representatives setting forth a program to train Alaska \n     residents in the skills and crafts required in the design, \n     construction, and operation of an Alaska gas pipeline system \n     that will enhance employment and contracting opportunities \n     for Alaskan residents. The report shall also describe any \n     laws, rules, regulations and policies which act as a \n     deterrent to hiring Alaskan residents or contracting with \n     Alaskan residents to perform work on Alaska gas pipelines, \n     together with any recommendations for changes. For purposes \n     of this section Alaskan residents shall be defined as those \n     individuals eligible to vote within the State of Alaska on \n     the date of enactment of this Act.\n       ``(b) Within 1 year of the date the report is transmitted \n     to Congress, the Secretary shall, directly or through grants \n     or cooperative agreements, establish within the State of \n     Alaska, at such locations as the Secretary deems appropriate, \n     training center(s) for the express purpose of training \n     Alaskan residents in the skills and crafts necessary in the \n     design, construction and operation of gas pipelines in \n     Alaska. The training center shall also train Alaskan \n     residents in the skills required to write, offer, and monitor \n     contracts in support of the design, construction, and \n     operation of Alaska gas pipelines.\n       ``(c) In implementing the report and program described in \n     this section, the Secretary shall consult with the Alaskan \n     Governor.\n       ``(d) There are authorized to be appropriated to the \n     Secretary such sums as may be necessary, but not to exceed \n     $20,000,000 for the purposes of this section.''.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, if I may just give a brief explanation.\n  This amendment makes it explicitly clear that the State of Alaska has \ncomplete authority when it comes to regulating in-state distribution of \nnatural gas coming off the Alaska Gas Transportation System.\n  It also directs the Secretary of Labor to design and establish a \nprogram in the State of Alaska to train Alaska residents in the skills \nand crafts necessary to enhance their ability to compete for jobs and \ncontracts associated with gas pipeline construction.\n  These amendments are needed because the first degree amendment \noffered this morning by the majority leader falls short of protecting \nAlaskan's prerogative to regulate in-State distribution of gas coming \noff the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System. I want to highlight \nin-State distribution.\n  This ability to control their own destiny is critical to the long-\nterm creation of jobs and the establishment of a gas based industry in \nmy State.\n  The economic future of Alaska rests with the development of its \nnatural resources--key to the utilization of these resources is the \nability of the State to manage their in-State use.\n  My amendment accomplishes this with respect to North Slope natural \ngas--it puts Alaskans in a position to guide their own future.\n  They will decide how and under what conditions gas will be \ndistributed within the State of Alaska.\n  It will provide locations across Alaska like Anchorage, Fairbanks, \nthe Kenai Peninsula, Delta Junction, and Valdez and Point Mackenzie in \nManuska Valley, with the opportunity to pursue gas based opportunities \nwhen, and if, they work out the economics.\n  Like the remaining states of the union, Alaska needs access to a \nreliable and economic source of clean burning energy. North Slope gas \nanswers this need for the Nation and my State.\n  The second part of my amendment directs the Secretary of Labor to \ndesign and establish a program in the State of Alaska to train Alaska \nresidents in the skills and crafts necessary to enhance their ability \nto compete for jobs and contracts associated with gas pipeline \nconstruction.\n  Because the impact of this project will fall upon Alaskans in a \ndisproportionate manner, it is only fair that they be provided with the \ntraining necessary to compete for pipeline jobs in the State.\n  These training opportunities will be available to all Alaskans \nregardless of where they live in the state.\n  I point out to my colleagues that there is nothing in this amendment \nthat gives Alaskans a priority selection right for pipeline related \njobs. Rather, it gives them the training which will allow them to \n``compete'' for those jobs.\n  My amendment calls on the Secretary of Labor to come up with a plan \non how to best accomplish the goal of enhanced employment opportunities \nfor Alaska residents.\n  This plan will be transmitted to the Congress for our review. This \nwill ensure that this investment will produce the desired results.\n  The greatest investment we can make in any project is investment we \nmake in the people who will design, build, and operate the system.\n  Senator Reid said this morning that Alaskans should be grateful that \nthey are likely to end up with at least the gasline. That comment \ndemonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding of the economy of \nAlaska. Our economy does not rely on one resource any more than this \nNation can rely on a single energy source. The gas pipeline, if \nconstructed, will provide the foundation for the potential development \nof a petrochemical industry in my State. ANWR, on the other hand, is a \nresource destined for consumption in the lower 48. In addition, ANWR is \ncritical to the economic, health, and education future for the peoples \nof northern Alaska, especially the Inupiat who live on the Coastal \nPlain. These are entirely separate issues and both offer considerable \nbenefits to the State and to this Nation if we simply have the \nunderstanding and courage to do what is right.\n  While this amendment will rectify some of the shortages in the \noriginal proposal put forward by the majority leader, it will be \nnecessary to offer several additional amendments that we are still \ntrying to work out.\n  For the moment, however, I urge my colleagues to join with me in \nsupport of this second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me speak in favor of the amendment \nSenator Murkowski is offering. I think it does improve the underlying \nDaschle amendment. I strongly support it.\n  I note one thing with regard to the job training aspect. There is a \nFederal job training program that is set up under the Workforce \nInvestment Act that makes funds available to each State for job \ntraining. I think we are in agreement that is a very important \nactivity. We need to be aware of that as we put the budget together \nthis year and as we do the appropriations bills because those job \ntraining programs are being threatened with major budgetary cuts under \nthe administration's proposed budget. I hope the program authorized in \nthis amendment that Senator Murkowski and Senator Stevens have offered \nwill be consistent to the maximum extent possible with the existing \nworkforce training programs in the State of Alaska.\n  I was requested to ask unanimous consent that Senator Stevens be \nadded as a cosponsor of the underlying Daschle amendment. I do not \nbelieve he has been so listed as yet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. As far as I know, there is strong support for the \namendment on our side and we could proceed to a vote.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the committee chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I do not think I overlooked adding Senator Stevens on \nthis morning. So he is on both the second-degree and the Daschle \namendment.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2892) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could address my friend from Alaska and \nthe manager of the bill, Senator Bingaman, we now have the Daschle \namendment pending. We have been talking about it most all the day. I am \nwondering if we can agree on some time to vote on it. We have a number \nof people wishing to speak, but we cannot do that until we have this \namendment disposed of, or at least a time set for the vote. The Senator \nfrom Georgia wishes to speak. The Senator from South Carolina has an \nextremely important piece of legislation he wants to introduce and \nspeak about that for awhile. Until we have a time to vote, I don't \nthink we can move off this legislation.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I have no objection to trying to set a time.\n  Mr. President, we understand there is another Member coming over who \nmay\n\n[[Page S1588]]\n\noffer a second-degree. I guess we will have to wait.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have checked with my counterpart, Senator \nNickles, and the two managers of the bill, and they are in agreement \nthat the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign, can speak as in morning \nbusiness for a period up to 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Ensign and Mr. Reid are printed in today's Record \nunder ``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken to the Republican manager of \nthe bill and my friend the Senator from Oklahoma. They have graciously \nconsented to allow the chairman of the Commerce Committee to speak for \nup to 15 minutes as in morning business relative to introduction of a \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the most distinguished assistant \nmajority leader.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hollings pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1991 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Reid, Senator Bingaman, \nand Senator Murkowski for their courtesy. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npreviously agreed to amendment No. 2982 be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Miller, \nwishes to make a statement now in regard to this bill, and he has an \namendment which he is not going to offer but wishes to talk about. I \nask unanimous consent that he be allowed to speak--we have received \npermission from the Senator from Alaska, even though we probably do not \nneed it other than to call off the quorum; we appreciate his courtesy--\nfor up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Georgia.\n  Mr. MILLER. Madam President, I rise today in defense of that great \nAmerican workhorse: The pickup truck. I am proud to sponsor, along with \nmy friend, Senator Gramm of Texas, an amendment that would exempt all \npickup trucks from the higher CAFE standards that have been proposed.\n  This is a very simple and short amendment. Pickups are now required \nto meet a standard of 20.7 miles per gallon, and our amendment would \nsimply freeze pickups at that standard. All pickups would be exempt \nfrom any higher mileage standard proposed in this legislation.\n  Some have said we should only exempt the very largest pickups from \nthe higher standards. That would only cover a small percentage of the \npickups that are on the road, and I do not think that is good enough. \nOur amendment says all pickups will be exempt from the higher CAFE \nstandards.\n  We absolutely should not impose these higher mileage standards on our \npickups. We absolutely should not impose the undue safety risk and \nextra cost of these CAFE standards on our farmers, our rural families, \nand our small businesses that rely so heavily on the pickup.\n  We have had a lot of conversation about the state of the economy \nthese days, and we hang on every word of Alan Greenspan, Robert Rubin, \nand the like, about the recession and when we are coming out of it. I \nknew a fellow back in Georgia. He did not have a Ph.D. in economics; he \nwould have thought Ph.D. stood for ``post hole digger.'' But he was one \nof the wisest men I ever knew. He told me years ago that if you really \nwant to know when times are bad, take notice of the number of people \nhaving to sell their pickups. Look at the ads in the paper and the \n``for sale'' signs in the yards. The more you see, the worse it is \nbecause pickups are the very symbol of the working man. As the pickup \ngoes, so does the working man and the very heart of this country.\n  Madam President, a pickup truck has two ends to it: A working end and \na thinking end. Of course, the working end is the engine in the front. \nI would like to tell you about the thinking end in the back.\n  I submit that the back of a pickup is the think tank of rural \nAmerica. I suspect more problems have been solved on the tailgates of \npickup trucks after a long day's work than have been solved anywhere.\n  I do not rise to speak often in this hallowed Chamber. I am still \nlearning the complexities of being a Senator. I envy my learned \ncolleagues who can speak with such great assurance on so many subjects. \nBut, Madam President, on this one you can trust this man from the \nmountains of North Georgia. If this amendment fails, the tailgates of \nrural America are going to drop, and it will be a clank that will \nreverberate from now through November because then the conversation at \nthe end of the day on the back of a pickup as the Sun goes down will \nnot be about the farm or the family or the State or the Nation; the \nsubject will be how to get rid of us in the next election.\n  Every election year we talk a lot about all those soccer moms out \nthere and how they vote in such high percentages. Well, there is \nanother group out there that votes in a very high percentage. They are \nthe pickup pops. In fact, I would bet pickup pops go to the polls in \nhigher percentages than any other Democratic group out there, and they \nalso have long memories.\n  If these higher CAFE standards are applied to pickups, they will be \nmade unaffordable for many, and unsafe for all, and that will hurt \nthose pickup pops. It will hurt the working man. It will hurt rural \nAmerica.\n  We are big on acronyms in Congress, and quite frankly they can be a \nlittle deceiving and confusing. I cannot even keep up with all of them. \nWhen we talk about CAFE and CAFE standards, most folks think we are \ntalking about restaurants.\n  People in rural America also understand what an acronym is, and I \nthink on this issue they would say that ``pickup,'' P-I-C-K-U-P, is an \nacronym for ``People in Congress Keep Us Perplexed.'' Let us not keep \nthem perplexed anymore.\n  One of the first things I noticed when I came to Washington, DC is \nthat you hardly ever see a pickup. They are scarce in Washington, DC, \nbut they are not scarce outside the beltway, out there in middle \nAmerica.\n  I want to show this chart. In 1999, pickup trucks accounted for \nalmost 18 percent of all registered vehicles in this country. In 29 \nStates, these red and blue States--that is more than half of our \nStates, of course--pickups amounted to as much as 20 to 37 percent of \nall the registered vehicles. In the year 2000, drivers in this country \nbought 3.18 million pickup trucks. That makes pickups the third most \npopular choice of vehicle for American drivers.\n  So pickups may not be prevalent in Washington, DC, but pickups are \npopular across the rest of America. When all this talk about CAFE \nstarted last year, I got worried Washington was going to stick it to \nthe pickup owners of this Nation, so I tried to write a song about it. \nI am no Orrin Hatch, but I tried to write a song about it with\n\n[[Page S1589]]\n\nmy good friend, Jack Clement, in Nashville. It is called the ``Talking \nPickup Truck Blues.'' I will spare everyone the agony of my singing, \nbut I want to share one verse. It goes something like this:\n\n       Sure, an SUV is classy travel, but it ain't much good for \n     hauling gravel, or hay seed or bovine feces. So please do not \n     make my pickup truck an endangered species.\n\n  Now, I will be the first to admit that song has not climbed to the \ntop of the charts, but here is the point we are making: Do not mess \nwith the working machine of the American road. Do not mess with \npickups. Farmers depend on them. Families in rural America depend on \nthem. Small businesses across this country depend on them, small \nbusinesses such as construction companies and home builders.\n  One of the greatest economic engines we have in this country is the \nhousing industry. You can go to any construction site across America \nand see at least a half dozen pickups. Plumbers drive them. \nElectricians drive them. Painters drive them. Carpenters drive them. \nRaise the cost of a pickup truck and more than just pickup owners will \nbe harmed; entire industries will be hurt--the housing industry and \nothers that rely heavily on pickups.\n  Folks buy pickups not because they are affordable and they are safe. \nThey buy them because they get the job done, whatever that job may be, \nwhether it is pulling a trailer full of cattle or hauling lumber to a \nconstruction site or driving on gravel and dirt roads in rural America. \nThere are times when only a pickup will do.\n  So I urge my colleagues, who represent the millions of pickup owners \nacross this country, when this amendment comes up at a later date to \nvote for this amendment. We must exempt the American workers, the \npickup truck, from these higher CAFE standards.\n  Like the last verse in my song goes:\n\n       So help us, Lord, and let there be a little wisdom in D.C.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak for 3 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Domenici are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we are in the process of getting agreement \nfor a vote in the next few minutes on the underlying Daschle-Murkowski \namendment. We hope that will be accomplished soon. We are waiting to \nhear from one person whether or not we can proceed with that vote. \nMembers should be alerted we are going to see if we can have a vote \nthis evening.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I would like to express my appreciation to \neveryone for their cooperation at this point in this debate. There has \nbeen some very good debate. It has been heartfelt on both sides. But I \nthink we are moving forward with this legislation.\n  As Senator Murkowski said earlier today, this is only preliminary. We \nhave many difficult issues on this bill that are going to come forward \nin the next few days. So we have to recognize we may have some late \nnights. We may have to work long and hard on this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent the time until 5:50 today be divided equally \nand controlled for debate with respect to the Daschle amendment No. \n2980, as modified and amended, and at 5:50 p.m. today the Senate vote \non the amendment, with no further second-degree amendments in order \nthereto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the unanimous \nconsent agreement I just propounded be amended to begin the vote at \n5:45 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2980, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2980, as modified and amended.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on that \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, for the information of our colleagues, \nwe are going to be voting momentarily. I appreciate the cooperation of \nmy friend from New Mexico for postponing the vote for just a moment.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Daschle amendment, which was \nalso modified by my friend and colleague, Senator Murkowski, because it \nmandates that we pick the southern route for a major gas pipeline to go \nthrough Alaska. That may be the best route. There are other \npossibilities, other alternatives.\n  There is a northern route. It is several hundred miles shorter. It \nmay be more economical. Most of the northern route goes through the \nMackenzie River Delta which is on a pretty flat plain and would not \nrequire going through 900 miles of mountains.\n  I do not know which one we should choose. I do not think that \nCongress should choose it. I do not think we should mandate it without \nmore significant oversight and discussion.\n  I would like to hear the experts. I would like to hear the \nenvironmentalists. I would like to have some input from a lot of \npeople. And I would like to have an idea how much the alternatives \nwould cost.\n  I have heard that the pipeline route that Senator Daschle is trying \nto mandate, the southern route--going through Alaska, and then going \nthrough Canada--would cost about $20 billion. I do not know. I do know \nthat in the underlying bill there is a $10 billion loan guarantee. We \nhave never had a hearing on the loan guarantee. We have never had a \nhearing on how this is going to be financed, whether it needs \ngovernmental assistance or not.\n\n  I think it is wrong for us to dictate we go this particular way and \nother options cannot be considered. I would like to think we believe in \nthe free market system enough to where we would let the marketplace \ndecide what is the best route, what is the most economical route, what \nis the route that will do the least environmental damage. Instead, we \nhave people coming up and saying: Oh, wait a minute, I have talked to a \ncouple politicians. We are going to mandate the southern route with \nvery little discussion or debate.\n  Let's let the marketplace decide. Let's get some input from a lot of \npeople. I do not think we are doing that in this case. I do not think \nthis is a good way to legislate.\n  I do not think we know how much it will cost. I do not think we have \nan idea of the environmental impact. Instead, we are just going to have \na 2-\n\n[[Page S1590]]\n\nhour debate on the floor, and then we are going to say: Let's go make a \ndecision on a $20 billion pipeline.\n  Do we need a loan guarantee? Do we need Federal assistance? Do we \nneed to have Federal financing for this project?\n  I think we are moving pretty quickly here. I would hope we would be \nsilent and assume we could go through the regulatory process.\n  We have built hundreds of miles of pipeline through my State, and we \nhave never had Federal legislation designating what you have to do, nor \nhave we had State legislation designating what you have to do.\n  I question the wisdom of us mandating one particular route at this \nparticular time. So I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Daschle \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I am sad to disagree with my friend \nfrom Oklahoma. I point out to the Senate that this oil and gas is \nproduced on State lands, with State leases. And our State law prohibits \nthe rights-of-way for this gas to be moved on the northern route. It is \nwithin our province to guide the course of this asset of our State so \nthat we might enjoy part of it.\n  If this gas goes east from Alaska, Alaskans will never enjoy one \nsingle benefit from it except a portion of the wellhead price coming to \nus as royalties. We will not have any right to use it in our second \nlargest city, in Fairbanks, along the Alaska highway going out of \nAlaska into Canada. This is a very dynamic area from the point of view \nof tourism.\n  In addition to that, we have two major bases there, Wainwright and \nEielson, and the national missile defense system is right alongside \nthat road. This gas must come south. My State has recognized that and \nhas now passed legislation, signed by the Governor, that specifies that \nno route will be allowed going east on these State lands. This gas must \nexit State lands before it can go either east or south.\n  We have spoken as a State. We understand there may be some problem \nfor us downstream. The Senator from Oklahoma would know, it may well be \nthat the wellhead price of this gas will be lower and our share of that \nwellhead gas will be lower. But we will have access to the gas. We will \nhave a chance to build the industry that might well utilize this gas in \nour State.\n  This is the same problem that came up in the oil pipeline. When the \npipeline route came through, there was an argument whether we should be \nable to take oil out of that pipeline around Fairbanks. As a matter of \nfact, we have won that argument. We do take out oil. We run it through \ntwo different refineries, and it is one of the greatest sources of \naviation fuel for our country. It is available in the Nation's largest \ncargo landing port at the international airport at Anchorage.\n  I disagree with my friend from Oklahoma. I think we have every right \nto say we should enjoy a portion of this resource that comes from under \nour own State lands and to utilize it in a way that will mean a future \njob base and future low energy costs for the one area of our country \nthat pays the highest energy costs, and that is the area that this \npipeline will come through and down to the border of Canada.\n  That is the only route that is going to be built. I hate to tell my \nfriend this. I told the industry that that line would go east over my \ndead body. I am not about ready to leave this world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is my understanding there has been a \nvote ordered at 5:50; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. REID. So the regular order would be for us to begin voting; is \nthat right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom New Mexico be given 2 minutes. So Senator Nickles, 1 minute; \nSenator Bingaman for 2 minutes; and then we vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my friend and colleague.\n  I tell my friend from Alaska, I have no desire whatsoever for him to \ndepart this world at this particular moment or any time in the not too \ndistant future. Also, it is not my intention to say that the northern \nroute is preferable to the southern route. I just don't think we should \nmandate that it be the southern route. It may well be, due to the \ninformation our colleagues have had, the southern route is the \npreferred route. I am not saying it is not. I just don't think it \nshould be mandated by this legislation that it be the southern route, \nwhen we may find out that it costs twice as much as some other \nalternative.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I strongly support the amendment on \nwhich we are about to vote. It has the support of the Alaska \ndelegation, as Senator Stevens indicated, as Senator Murkowski has \nindicated. It has the support of the Governor of Alaska. It is totally \nconsistent with the action this Congress took in 1976 with the Alaska \nNatural Gas Transportation Act. It is clear to me that this is the \ncorrect policy for the Congress to adhere to at this point. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I thank my colleagues, Senator \nBingaman and Senator Reid, the majority leader, and others for their \ncooperation in seeing that the basic Daschle amendment, which was laid \ndown, and the second degree, which was accepted, clearly make this \nproject much more feasible because it gives Alaskans the option on the \nsouthern route that suggests we will benefit the State in many ways, \nnot only for Fairbanks but for all utilization of gas within the State, \nfor Point Mackenzie, for the Kenai area, for Valdez, and for the \nMatanuska Valley.\n  As Senator Stevens indicated quite strongly in his opinion on the \nnecessity of this happening, it clearly gives us an opportunity to have \nsome secondary industries in Alaska to support our young people, the \ngreatest natural resource we have--I am most appreciative--as well as \nthe job training that is provided in this bill. I encourage my \ncolleagues to vote in favor of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). All time has expired. The \nquestion is on agreeing to amendment No. 2980, as modified, as amended.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner) \nand the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Roberts) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 93, nays 5, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 41 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--93\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--5\n\n     Gramm\n     Hutchison\n     Kyl\n     McCain\n     Nickles\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Roberts\n     Warner\n       \n  The amendment (No. 2980), as modified, as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n\n[[Page S1591]]\n\n  Mr. KYL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Arizona has been patient during the day, \nand he wishes to speak on the bill for up to 10 minutes. Although we \nneed to leave, he has indicated he has a very difficult day tomorrow. I \nask unanimous consent the Senator from Arizona be allowed to speak on \nthe bill for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator from Nevada for his courtesy. I will \nsummarize my remarks and try to find another time to expand on some of \nmy thoughts. I appreciate his courtesy.\n  There is a big difference between what the President has proposed in \nterms of an energy policy and the bill we are beginning to debate on \nthe floor of the Senate. The President's energy policy, I believe, was \na very well balanced set of recommendations that would have helped \nachieve the goal of energy efficiency, less dependence upon foreign \nsources of oil, and a series of steps of progress toward changes in our \npolicy that would result in more environmentally friendly fuels and a \nvariety of reforms almost everybody is willing to support.\n  Unfortunately, the President's proposals were not met with support by \nmany on the other side of the aisle. As a result, even though I believe \nthere was sufficient support in the Energy Committee, on which I sit, \nfor many of the reforms that the President has proposed, our committee \nwas not allowed to deal with this matter. The only hearings held were a \nlong time ago and did not deal with most of the specifics of the \nlegislation. We were never permitted to mark up the legislation. In \nfact, the bill that is on the floor today has undergone iterations, and \nI am not precisely sure I have the very last version.\n  In terms of process, we are suffering under an inhibition of the \nprimary committee of jurisdiction never having had the opportunity to \nwork out details, to try to smooth out rough edges, and resolve \ndifferences that probably could be resolved if we had taken the time to \ndo that in the committee structure. It is hard to write a complex bill \nduring its consideration on the floor of the Senate. Yet that is what \nwe will have to do. As a result, I am afraid we are not going to end up \nwith a product that would be nearly as good as it would have otherwise \nbeen.\n  Let me mention several aspects of the bill that are going to need a \nlot of work. I will briefly address four or five of them. The bill is \nwritten to restructure the electric energy industry. This is a very \ncomplex and difficult subject. I think it is done in a very clumsy way. \nIt preempts a lot of State authority. It gives a lot of authority to \nFERC, largely at the expense of the States. It gets the Federal \nGovernment involved in retail matters, with a utility serving its \ncustomers in matters such as real-time pricing, net metering, and \nconsumer protection issues. That is not the business of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  It gives FERC broad authority with respect to the interstate \ntransmission grid. There is some authority here. One can make the case \nthat on interstate matters FERC should be able to help open up the \nmarket for easier transmission of energy. I think we can work some \nprovisions out that provide broader authority to FERC even in that \narea. We have to be careful that we do not ``socialize the costs,'' \nwhich is the term used by one official, with respect to how the costs \nwill be allocated. We are going to have to treat the costs in a \nvery fair way and make sure the existing customers are not the losers, \nthat a utility that currently serves them can continue to do that, and \nthey will not have to pay the cost of someone else coming to connect to \nthe grid.\n\n  There are a lot of issues with respect to this electric restructuring \nto which we are going to have to pay attention that we could have \nresolved in committee if we had the opportunity.\n  The second has to do with nuclear power. The bill itself, \nunfortunately, does not adequately deal with the need to modernize the \nlaw with respect to the provision of nuclear power. It does extend the \nPrice-Anderson Act for 10 years but only for DOE contractors. For those \nnot aware, that is the liability protection that has historically been \nprovided to nuclear generators to ensure that they would be able to \nprovide the power and not have to worry about the insurance costs for \nsome catastrophic accident.\n  There will be an amendment offered to add the NRC licensees, which \nare the commercial powerplant operators, to this Price-Anderson \nprotection. I believe that will pass. I think most recognize that is \ngoing to be necessary.\n  There are 103 nuclear powerplants operating in the United States \ntoday, including 3 in my home State of Arizona. They supply almost a \nquarter of the power in the United States in a very environmentally \nsafe manner--no emissions, no gases such as nitrogen oxide, sulfur \ndioxide, or other gases that threaten the environment. Nuclear energy, \nof course, is the most efficient. It costs 1.83 cents per kilowatt hour \ncompared to 2.08 per kilowatt hour for coal-fired plants. We need to \nwork to ensure that the nuclear provisions of the bill are modernized. \nWe will have amendments to present to do that.\n  One of the most contentious parts of the bill relates to increasing \nour ability to generate oil and gas production in the United States so \nwe do not have to rely so much on foreign sources of oil. This gets \nprimarily into the question of whether we should be able to explore for \noil in an area of Alaska that was set aside for that purpose by the \nU.S. Government some years ago, an area called the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge or ANWR.\n  The facts have gotten very confused by people who do not support this \nproposal. The area we are talking about is about the size of the State \nof South Carolina. But the amount of land that would actually be \nexposed to exploration is no larger than the footprint of an airport in \nmost of our communities, including, if you want the exact acreage, \nDulles Airport outside of Washington, DC, or Sky Harbor Airport in my \nhome State of Arizona. Out of an area the size of South Carolina, we \nhave an area the size of an airport in which the drilling would occur.\n  It is simply not possible to have the degradation of the environment \nthat some claim with the modern technology that would be used to \nprovide for this production and the small area and the environmentally \nfriendly ways in which it would be done. The drilling pads are 80 \npercent smaller than they were a generation ago. You can literally get \noil 6 miles away by drilling down 2 or 3 miles and drilling out 2 or 3 \nmiles and in that way keep your footprint to a very small area.\n  The critics have said there is not very much oil, so it is not worth \nthe effort. I will state how much: It is 600,000 barrels of oil per \nday, which is almost the same amount of oil we are importing from the \ncountry of Iraq. It is the supply of oil we get from the country of \nIraq for 40 years. That is a lot of oil. If we get into a conflict with \nIraq, we will wish we had an alternative source so we would not have to \nrely upon purchasing it from Iraq.\n\n  Suffice it to say, if we are going to be serious about increasing our \nenergy production, we are going to have to be able to drill for oil in \nAlaska.\n  There is a provision of the bill dealing with CAFE standards, setting \nthe miles per gallon that cars have to meet. While all Members are \ndesirous of trying to improve the miles per gallon that our cars meet, \nthe only way we have found to do that has, as a result, caused an \nincreased number of automobile fatalities. The National Academy of \nSciences, certainly an unbiased source, found that previous fuel \neconomy measures likely resulted in 1,300 to 2,600 additional crash \nfatalities annually, which is the equivalent, according to the National \nSafety Council, of wiping out the recent hard-won gains of safety belt \nuse, airbags, or drunk driving legislation.\n  The point is we have had a lot of people unnecessarily killed on our \nhighways because we have had to make cars lighter in order to meet \nthese CAFE standards. It seems to me we have to weigh the benefits that \nmight be achieved--might be achieved--in terms of fuel savings on the \none hand and the saving of lives that would be achieved on the other \nhand if we do not carelessly move forward with these CAFE standards.\n  Once again, we will have an amendment that will have to deal with \nthat.\n\n[[Page S1592]]\n\n I will have amendment also to deal with other subjects. There will be \nother amendments that will attempt to improve the underlying bill.\n  My bottom line is this. In this brief opening set of comments, I just \nwant to make the point that the bill before us is not the bill that the \nPresident recommended. It is not the bill that I think could have come \nout of committee. It is a bill that requires a lot of work. It is going \nto take a lot of time. When we try to do the amending process on the \nfloor of the Senate, we don't necessarily end up with the best of \nproducts--just because of the way we have to proceed. It is regrettable \nwe have to do it that way, but since we are opened up to a series of \namendments, then I think we will have to have the indulgence of \neveryone as we present and debate those amendments and hopefully get \nthem passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is a very sad day because Nevada lost \none of its great citizens--Howard Cannon died today.\n  Howard Cannon served in the Senate for 24 years. He left the Senate \nin 1982. He was a wonderful man. I have great memories of him when I \nworked as a police officer, when I was going to law school. Howard \nCannon had been a bar examiner before coming back here. He was a very \nfine lawyer, had a great legal mind. He tutored me, as busy as he was \nas a Senator, to help me pass the bar. I am always grateful for that. I \nam grateful for all he did for me as I moved up the political ladder to \ndifferent offices.\n  I remember the first political office I ran for was the hospital \nboard. His chief of staff, Jack Conlin, through Senator Cannon, gave me \nsome money for this race. He was always very caring about me, and I \ncared a great deal about him. I do have, though, some satisfaction \nbecause just a couple of weeks ago, on his 90th birthday, I came to the \nSenate and talked about what a fine man he was, how much he had done \nfor the State of Nevada. I talked to him that day on the telephone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/06/senate-section/article/S1592-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1592-S1593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              COMMEMORATING SENIOR AIRMAN JASON CUNNINGHAM\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I rise today to commemorate a fallen \nhero from my home State of New Mexico--I see Senator Bingaman so I \nthink it is appropriate to say ``our home State''--Senior Airman Jason \nCunningham. He lost his life this week while trying to save the life of \nanother serviceman in eastern Afghanistan.\n  I express my heartfelt condolences to Jason's wife Theresa; his \ndaughters, 2-year-old Hannah and 4-year-old Kyla; as well as his \nparents Larry and Jackie. I know I speak for all New Mexicans when I \nsay how proud we are of your husband, father, and son, and that our \nthoughts and prayers are with you.\n  Jason was a member of the Air Force's elite pararescue team whose \nmission is to rescue downed pilots in hostile territory. He joined the \n38th Rescue Squadron because it was his passion to save lives, and that \nis exactly what Jason and his comrades were doing this week when he \ncame under heavy fire from the al-Qaida force.\n  During an attempt by our forces to land a reconnaissance team in a \nmountainous region known to be inhabited by al-Qaida and Taliban, one \ntroop fell from a helicopter when it was hit by enemy fire. Later, it \nwas Jason and his rescue team who bravely went into the area where the \ntrooper and helicopter were down in an attempt to extricate him. A \nheavy fire-fight ensued and Jason and five other Americans lost their \nlives.\n  I know that words are of little consolation at such a difficult time \nfor Jason's loved ones, but I want his family to know that all New \nMexicans--this Senator, and I am certain my colleague, Senator \nBingaman--mourn with them today. I am sure that for Jason's heroics his \ncountry will bestow upon him one of the most highly respected honors it \ncan give, the Purple Heart. Such valor deserves no less.\n  The loss of such fine Americans as Jason in the war on terrorism can \nbe heartrending, but as a nation we must honor the sacrifices of men \nand women like Airman Cunningham and remain steadfast in our resolve to \nprotect our freedoms and liberty from terrorism.\n  President Bush has told us many times that this war would not be \nquick or easy, and it would be good to remember that while we mourn the \nloss of a good man like Jason Cunningham.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a detailed statement surrounding the \nyoung man and his family headlined ``New Mexican Dies Trying to Save \nOthers'' from the Albuquerque Journal, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 New Mexican Dies Trying to Save Others\n\n                           (By Miguel Navrot)\n\n       Jason Cunningham was one of the best the Air Force had to \n     offer.\n       Cunningham served as a pararescueman--trained to rescue \n     downed pilots from the most hostile of enemy areas--in one of \n     the military's elite teams, sometimes compared to the Navy \n     SEALs.\n       Cunningham, who grew up in Carlsbad and Farmington and \n     recently lived in Gallup, once considered becoming a SEAL as \n     a Navy petty officer. He had passed the Navy's fitness test \n     but decided to move to the Air Force.\n       ``I didn't want to kill people,'' Cunningham told Airman \n     magazine, an Air Force publication, in October 2000. ``I \n     wanted to save them.''\n       Cunningham, 26, died trying to save another serviceman \n     Monday. He was one of eight soldiers killed in renewed \n     fighting in eastern Afghanistan.\n       The remains of seven of those servicemen arrived Tuesday at \n     Ramstein Air Base, Germany.\n       Jason's parents, who live in Gallup, learned of their son's \n     death Tuesday morning.\n       ``We're very proud of our baby,'' Jackie Cunningham said of \n     her son as she tried to hold back tears at a family news \n     conference on the lawn outside their blue ranch-style home.\n       ``Jason died doing what he liked to do, save lives,'' said \n     his father, Larry ``Red'' Cunningham, choking on his words as \n     he read a brief statement.\n       Since last summer, Cunningham, a senior airman, was \n     stationed at Moody Air Force Base near Valdosta, Ga., with \n     his wife, Theresa, and two daughters, 2-year-old Hannah and \n     4-year-old Kyla. He was deployed Feb. 1, his family said.\n       ``We last heard from him on Saturday,'' the father said.\n       Cunningham was the middle child of the family. Standing \n     next to his parents were his brother, Chris, 29, of \n     Washington state, and his sister, Lori, of Farmington.\n       The family said memorial services will be in Georgia and in \n     Carlsbad this week. A funeral and burial are planned for next \n     week in Camarillo, Calif., where his wife is from.\n       Cunningham was born and raised in Carlsbad. The family \n     moved to Farmington just before his high school years. After \n     graduating from high school, Cunningham went into the Navy \n     for four years before moving to the Air Force.\n       Cunningham began the Air Force's pararescue school, a \n     grueling 21-month training program that few finish, about \n     2\\1/2\\ years ago.\n       Training for pararescuemen, or PJs, concludes at Kirtland \n     Air Force Base. Cunningham graduated from the school on July \n     7, when he donned the group's maroon beret, Kirtland \n     officials said.\n       He belonged to the 38th Rescue Squadron.\n       Tech. Sgt. Tim Donovan, a supervisor for air operations \n     with the school at Kirtland, called Cunningham ``kind of \n     silly, kind of goofy,'' with a heart totally dedicated to the \n     pararescue mission.\n       ``He had several setbacks that he overcame and persevered \n     through all the training,'' Donovan said. ``He never quit. He \n     was totally focused. . . .\n       ``A lot of times you have kids who don't feel they have \n     their hearts into it or they're just in it for the beret or \n     they're doing it for something other than the motto (That \n     Others May Live). That wasn't him at all.''\n       Cunningham is the fourth pararescueman the Air Force has \n     lost in the past three months. The Air Force has about 300 \n     pararescuemen.\n       ``They're a small, tight-knit community, and all of them \n     will most assuredly feel the loss of one of their own and \n     mourn his passing,'' Kirtland spokeswoman 2nd Lt. Kelley \n     Jeter said Tuesday.\n       Theresa Cunningham spoke to her parents early Tuesday.\n       ``She was hysterical. She talked to her mom and said, \n     `Jason is dead.' That's it,'' said her father, Lito D'Castro.\n\n[[Page S1593]]\n\n       ``He's a nice guy. He loves the service,'' D'Castro said \n     from Camarillo.\n       D'Castro said the last time he saw Cunningham was when he \n     visited Camarillo at Christmas-time.\n       Cunningham was one of seven Americans who died in the \n     bloodiest operation of the war in Afghanistan. They were \n     killed as troops were being taken into the battle area on two \n     different missions, the Pentagon said Tuesday.\n       Early Monday, a two-helicopter team was ferrying in \n     reconnaissance troops south of Gardez when one was hit by \n     enemy fire, said Brig. Gen. John W. Rosa Jr., deputy director \n     of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n       One soldier fell from a helicopter and later died, Rosa \n     told a Pentagon news conference.\n       Cunningham was killed during a subsequent rescue mission \n     involving special forces on two helicopters. Once on the \n     ground, those forces got into a firefight in which at least \n     11 were wounded and six died.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I join my colleague, Senator Domenici, \nin expressing condolences to the family of Jason Cunningham. I also \nread with great sadness the report of his death in Afghanistan. It was \nemphasized in the report which I read that he was part of this para-\nrescue team and that he had made a very conscious decision in choosing \nhis career path in the military to be on a para-rescue team rather than \non a different type of military team because he did want to commit his \nlife to saving other people's lives. That is the exact activity he was \nengaged in in Afghanistan when he came under enemy fire and was killed \nin that combat.\n  This is a reminder to all who serve in the Senate, as well as, of \ncourse, to his family. It is an enormous responsibility we take on as a \nnation when we send our best young people into battle to do the work of \nthis country, to put these men and women at risk, as has been the case \nin Afghanistan. It is an enormous undertaking. His sacrifice is the \nultimate sacrifice and his family's sacrifice, as well. We join with \nthem in mourning his death.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/06/senate-section/article/S1593-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1593-S1594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR RWANDA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I rise today to voice my support for \nthe International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda which is the often-\nneglected sister court to the International Criminal Tribunal for the \nformer Yugoslavia at the Hague. While the international media carries \nregular coverage of the Milosevic trial and the NATO efforts to arrest \nindividuals wanted by the ICTY, much of the world, it seems, has \nforgotten about the ICTR. This week, as the UN's fifth committee \nconsiders the tribunal's budget, I want to make plain my continuing \nconcerns about the tribunal, but I also want to be crystal clear about \nmy continued support for its work.\n  In 1994, an unspeakable horror unfolded in the tiny central African \nsite of Rwanda. Despite the initial references to ``ancient tribal \nhatreds'' at the source of violence, we now know that the genocide was \nnot a series of spontaneous acts; it was not about crowds gone wild or \ntribal bloodlust. It was carefully planned and centrally directed. \nExtra machetes had been imported, militia groups were in place, and \nincitements to murder had become a regular element of programming on \nthe hate-radio station. The planners targeted not only ethnic Tutsis, \nbut also politically moderate Hutus who threatened their grip on power. \nWe know today that individual people--leaders and planners--are \nresponsible for the deaths of some 800,000 people, and that the blame \nfor these atrocities cannot be heaped on some imagined cultural \nfailing.\n  Two weeks ago, I had an opportunity to visit the International \nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha during a weeklong trip to Kenya, \nTanzania, and Mozambique that I undertook in my capacity as Chairman of \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Subcommittee on African \nAffairs. During my brief visit, I was able to meet with the Deputy \nRegistrar, with Judge Navanetham Pillay, who is the President of the \nICTR, and with some members of the Prosecutor's office. I was also able \nto sit in on one of the trials underway--that of Laurent Semanza, a \nformer mayor of Bicumbi who is charged with several counts of genocide, \nconspiracy to commit genocide and crimes against humanity, including \nrape. I heard some of the wrenching testimony in that case, and was \nastounded at the strength of the tribunal officials, whose work \nrequires them to confront the horrible facts of the Rwandan genocide \nevery day of their work.\n  For many years, I have strongly supported accountability measures in \ncases where crimes against humanity have occurred, and I think that \ninternational support for such measures is particularly important in \nAfrica, where too often the international community fails to respond to \natrocities the way we would if such acts occurred in Europe or North \nAmerica.\n  For this reason, I have been a supporter of the Special Court for \nSierra Leone. I have long supported the ICTR. In the last Congress, I \nauthored legislation that was signed into law that would extend the \nU.S. rewards program to allow our government to offer and pay rewards \nfor information about individuals wanted by the tribunal. The reason \nthat we did this is because this provision had already existed for the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia--an example \nof how a double standard relating to the courts was at one time \ninstitutionalized in our government.\n\n  What had happened since the Arusha tribunal's inception is nothing \nshort of groundbreaking. The ICTR was responsible for the very first \ninternational convictions for the crime of genocide. Many people do not \nrealize this, although the international community adopted the \ndefinition of the crime of genocide following the holocaust, it was the \nICTR that launched the first successful investigation and prosecution \nfor that crime. It was the first-ever international tribunal to convict \nan individual of rape as a crime against humanity and to rule that rape \ncan be a crime of genocide. The Tribunal was the first such institution \nto actually convict a national leader, the former Prime Minister of \nRwanda, of genocide. The court has established principles of \ninternational law that will be studied in law schools around the world \nfor generations to come.\n  And more importantly, it is establishing, in the minds of African \nleaders and African elites and African societies, the possibility that \nthose responsible for crimes against humanity may one day be held \naccountable for their actions. In central Africa in particular, this \ngoal is essential to ending the culture of impunity for gross \nviolations of human rights, whether they occur in Rwanda or Burundi or \neastern Congo. The people who have been laboring in Arusha to hold \nthose most responsible for the genocide and for crimes against humanity \nin Rwanda in 1994 deserve recognition, and respect, and support.\n  Now, there are a number of steps that the international community can \ntake to help this worthy effort. First, we can ensure that the \nprosecutor's office is adequately staffed. It is almost appalling that \nthe post of Deputy Prosecutor has been vacant since the middle of last \nyear. I was informed that vacancies exist throughout the office. The UN \nhas to speed up its recruitment process, priortizing the expeditious \nplacement of competent applicants in important jobs, rather than \nstarving the court of staff for the overriding goal of even geographic \ndistribution of personnel. UN member states must also help to address \nanother problem--that of sentence enforcement. Currently, few of the \nAfrican countries willing to house persons convicted by the ICTR in \ntheir jails can meet international standards for prison conditions. Of \ncourse I am not suggesting that the international community refurbish \nthe prisons of an entire continent. But I am suggesting that perhaps \nthere are small and reasonable steps that we can take to help.\n  And the US and the rest of the international community I think should \nsupport the tribunal's request for ad litum judges. They have already \nsupported a similar request for the ICTY for the former Yugoslavia. All \nobservers have been concerned about the pace of the tribunal. It makes \nsense to provide it with the capacity to move more quickly through its \nwork.\n  Mr. President, must has been made in recent days of the \nAdministration's decision to publicly push for the ICTR and ICTY to \nfinish their work in the next few years. And the need to wrap-\n\n[[Page S1594]]\n\nup the Tribunal's work is not in dispute--in my meetings with Tribunal \nofficials, no one suggested that the Tribunal should not aim to finish \nits work by 2008. This consensus, however, does not change the fact \nthat much important still remains to be done, and the tribunals will \nneed continued support to complete it.\n  Some have also suggested that the existence of tribunals has given \nthe international community a rationale for neglecting developing of \nindigenous justice systems in countries subject to the tribunals. And I \nagree that this is a pitfall that must be avoided, and I strongly \nsupport efforts to strengthen the capacity and independence of the \njudiciary in countries that have suffered from wide-scale human rights \nviolations. Last week, Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Pierre \nProsper told the House International Relations Committee that ``the \nUnited States stands prepared to assist the states in rebuilding their \nshattered judicial systems to make them capable of dispensing truth-\nbased justice and establishing systematic respect for the rule of \nlaw.'' I certainly hope he is right, because this is an indispensable \nelement in the global effort to bring some stability to the heart of \nAfrica. But I am not yet convinced that our actions will match this \nrhetoric, and I am specifically concerned that no funding is being \nrequested in 2003 for the Great Lakes Justice Initiative. And while I \nam encouraged by the Rwandan Government's efforts to address the \nmassive backlog of genocide-related cases through a system of community \ncourts known as gacaca and believe that the international community \nshould help the government in Kigali to ensure the integrity and \nefficacy of this effort, I also respect the Rwandan's decision not to \nattempt to try those most responsible for the genocide--known as \nCategory One suspects--in these untested courts in which judges have \nvery little training and where only limited safeguards exist for \nvictims and for the accused.\n\n  Madam President, it is important to acknowledge that much of the \ncriticism that has been leveled at the tribunal is fair, and it \nreflects real, and in some cases ongoing problems with the ICTR. Too \noften in the past, allegations of waste and mismanagement proved to be \naccurate, and the tribunal must exercise constant vigilance to fight \ncorruption and abuse. Decisive steps must be taken to address the issue \nof fee-splitting between those on trial and defense counsel. I was \npleased to learn about some of the efforts currently underway during my \nvisit. I have raised these issues with the Chief Prosecutor, I have \nraised them with U.N. officials in New York, I raised them in Arusha, \nand I will continue to raise them. And overall, the tribunal simply has \nto pick up the pace of its work. I believe that this, too, is being \naddressed. During my visit there were three cases being heard \nsimultaneously. And as I have mention, providing additional judges to \nthe ICTR will help to address this problem.\n  Madam President, because this tribunal is so important, the \ninternational community must keep working to get it right. The ICTR \nstill has a great deal of work to do, and the international community, \nincluding the United States, must ensure that they are operating with \nall the necessary support, and operating under clear demands for \naccountability and integrity.

Madam President, I rise to speak of a brave young \nnevadan, PFC Matthew Commons, who was killed in combat in Afghanistan. \nI am humbled and grateful that he was willing to make the ultimate \nsacrifice to preserve our freedom.\n  For he is one of the noble soldiers of whom Thomas Jefferson spoke \nwhen he warned that ``the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time \nto time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants.''\n  In doing his duty for God and country, he gave up all so that we \ncould grow and thrive and learn and love in the greatest Nation in the \nworld.\n  He is our fallen hero. A grateful Nation should never forget, he had \nfamily, friends, and plans for the future. He was just 21 years of age, \nold enough to dedicate his life to protecting our country, but too \nyoung to have a family of his own.\n  His mother told me that one of the hardest burdens she now has to \nbear is the knowledge she will never get to hold Matthew's children.\n  Matthew was an all-American kid, growing up in Boulder City. He ran \ntrack and played soccer at Boulder City High. He was elected secretary \nof his senior class.\n  On September 11, al-Qaida terrorists attacked the United States.\n  On March 4, Matthew Commons sought to make sure that would never \nhappen again.\n  He died to make sure that no American was left behind at the mercy of \nal-Qaida. His mission was a success. And his fellow soldiers endured \nheavy fire so that he, too, ultimately would come home from the front.\n  In fighting for our Nation, he ensured that we would be free.\n  In dying, he left in his wake the grief of those who knew and loved \nhim, including his mother, Patricia Marek and his father, Greg Commons.\n  God bless you, Matthew Commons.\n  And God bless America.\n  Would the senior Senator from Nevada like to make some comments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I certainly applaud my colleague from \nNevada for making his heart-felt statement. I am not much for calling \npeople when there is a tragedy. I tend to write letters. It is \ndifficult for me to speak to people upon the loss of a loved one \nbecause it brings back memories of those loved ones of mine I have \nlost. So I normally just write a letter.\n  But I thought it was appropriate yesterday, when I learned about the \ndeath of Matthew, that I call and speak to the parents; and I did that. \nCertainly, it was not a pleasant call in the sense that you call and \ntalk to grieving parents, but it was a call I will never forget.\n  His mother asked me if I would write her a letter. I said I would be \nhappy to. She said: The reason I want the letter is because I will have \nthat to refer to. I will not have my son anymore. And she broke down \nand cried a little bit about that.\n  As I just indicated, I talked to his mom, Patricia, who lives in Las \nVegas. I also talked to his dad, Gregory. Gregory, as do most fathers, \nput up a very brave front during the first part of our conversation. \nLike all dads, toward the end of it, his emotions got the best of him. \nHe shed a few tears, I know. I could tell by his voice that he was \ncrying on the other end of the line.\n  I talked to him about Matthew's brothers. Matthew had three brothers. \nMatthew was the oldest. And his dad said: Matthew always looked out for \nhis brothers, that if anyone tried, in any way, to get the better of \nhis little brothers, he was always standing there making sure that they \ndid not.\n  And I said to Mr. Commons: You have to explain to your sons that they \nhave a great example to live up to because their brother gave his life \nfor our country.\n  So I was saddened to see that one of those who died was from Bolder \nCity, NV. As indicated in the Washington paper today, in their comments \nabout his death, Matthew was the youngest of those who were killed, but \nthe parents and the wives of the other men who were killed are grieving \njust as Matthew's parents, no matter where they live in this great \ncountry of ours.\n  But I do say that as a result of the courageous act of Matthew, who \nwas actually going to the aid of one of his comrades, we are going to \nwin the war on terrorism--because there are people all over America \ntoday like Matthew Commons willing to give their lives for their \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/06/senate-section/article/S1594-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1594-S1595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           GENETIC INFORMATION NONDISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2002\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nintroducing the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2002. I am \nparticularly grateful to Senators Snowe, Jeffords, Frist and Gregg for \ntheir\n\n[[Page S1595]]\n\nleadership on the extremely important policy matter of protecting \nindividuals from genetic discrimination.\n  This bill would effectively and fairly protect against genetic \ndiscrimination in health insurance and employment. The group of members \nassembled to introduce this bill is bipartisan. We all worked together \nin the past on a bill that dealt strictly with genetic discrimination \nin health insurance, and today are introducing a bill that includes a \nnew title to also protect individuals from genetic discrimination in \nemployment. During the last Congress, our bill dealing with health \ninsurance discrimination passed the Senate three times. I hope this new \nbill just has to pass once before the President can sign it into law.\n  As I have previously stated, I believe there is unanimous support for \nenacting legislation which prohibits discrimination in both health \ninsurance and employment. The promise that genetic information holds \nfor revolutionary advances in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases \nsuch as cancer, Parkinson's disease, heart disease and diabetes should \nnot be hindered by fears about the discriminatory use of this \ninformation.\n  As a result of a lot of hard work and a hearing held by Chairman \nKennedy on February 13, 2002, we are able to introduce a bill today \nthat reflects the cutting edge knowledge about genetic science and also \nreflects the current regulatory state with respect to medical records \nprivacy. Both the original Snowe bill and the alternative Daschle bill \nwere drafted years ago. The Human Genome has since been mapped. \nComprehensive medical records privacy regulations, which will cover \ngenetic information, have since been promulgated. And, the Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission, EEOC, has since stated the need to \nexpressly protect individuals from employment discrimination based on \ngenetic information.\n  In other words, this bill provides the most informed policy to meet \nthe goal of protecting individuals from discrimination without denying \nthe promise of genetic science. Here are just a few examples of how our \nbill has been improved.\n  First, the definition of genetic information correctly reflects the \nscience of genetics as the best minds know it today, not 4 years ago. \nSecondly, the medical records privacy regulation called for under the \nKennedy-Kassebaum Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act \nof 1996, HIPAA, is nearly final. The Kennedy-Kassebaum law clearly \nintended that genetic information be considered medical information, \nand, therefore, should be equally protected under the same privacy \nstandards. The Snowe bill we're introducing today codifies that intent.\n  The President has also called upon Congress to pass legislation \nprohibiting discrimination on the basis of genetic information that is \nfair, reasonable and consistent with existing discrimination statutes \nwhen it comes to protecting individuals against employment \ndiscrimination. Consistency is mandated to protect the rights of \nemployees and employers alike. Consistency is mandated to protect the \ncarefully designed process for enforcing and redressing employment \ncivil rights legislation.\n  Therefore, I believe that federal legislation prohibiting employment \ndiscrimination based on genetic information must not deviate from other \nemployment discrimination laws, namely Title VII of the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, with regard to \nenforcement and remedies.\n  Furthermore, we cannot enact new employment discrimination \nlegislation without examining its interaction with existing laws. We \nmust be careful to avoid enacting legislation that places employers \nbetween a rock and a hard place. That is, in order to comply with one \nlaw, an employer violates another. For example, an employer should not \nbe placed in the impossible position of violating genetic \ndiscrimination legislation by virtue of its requirement to comply with \nthe ADA or Family and Medical Leave Act. Nor should employers be held \nto conflicting standards governing the disclosure of genetic \ninformation.\n  Let me briefly address the issue of enforcement of employment \ndiscrimination claims on the basis of genetic information. Under Title \nVII and the ADA, Congress gave the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission the role of investigating and enforcing complaints of \nviolations of these laws. Under both of these laws, a claimant must \nfirst file a complaint with the EEOC before being able to file a \nprivate suit in court.\n  The EEOC plays a critical role in the compliance with and enforcement \nof employment nondiscrimination laws. The EEOC's mediation activities \nalso serve to expedite resolution of employment cases and reduce the \nbacklog of such cases in our courts.\n  Federal legislation on genetic nondiscrimination that would allow a \nclaimant to bypass the vital role that the EEOC plays undermines the \nefficacy of such legislation. Furthermore, what is the justification \nfor allowing an individual claiming genetic discrimination to \ncircumvent the complaint process that claimants of other basis of \nemployment discrimination must follow?\n  With regard to remedies for employment discrimination based on \ngenetic information, federal legislation should not disregard the \nremedy structure of other employment discrimination laws. The Civil \nRights Act of 1991, which applies to remedies available under Title VII \nand the ADA, places a cap on consequential and punitive damages that is \nprogressive with the size of the employer.\n  I cannot see the justification for allowing unlimited damages for \nemployment discrimination based on genetic information. Why should \nsomeone claiming genetic discrimination, but who is asymptomatic, be \nable to recover greater damages than someone who is actually disabled \nin the present or who is a claimant of race discrimination? We must \nguard against enacting legislation that, in an effort to protect \nindividuals who have been subjected to one type of discrimination, \ncreates inequities for individuals who have been subjected to another \ntype. Unfortunately, I read the alternative bill sponsored by Sen. \nDaschle to create just such an inequity.\n  The issue of confidentiality of genetic information in the employment \ncontext in relation to existing privacy laws might seem very complex. \nHowever, I think that the issue is not as complex as we make it out to \nbe. First and foremost, an employer should not be held to conflicting \nlegal requirements regarding the confidentiality of such information.\n  The HIPAA medical records privacy regulation I mentioned before \ngoverns the disclosure of all medical information, including genetic \ninformation, by health plans, health care clearinghouses and certain \nhealth care providers. Therefore, an employer who is acting in its \ncapacity as a group health plan will be subject to the HIPAA privacy \nregulation. Federal legislation that prohibits discrimination in health \ninsurance and employment on the basis of genetic information should not \ncreate confidentiality requirements for employers acting as group \nhealth plans that conflict with the privacy regulation. Again, Sen. \nDaschle's bill would create this kind of conflict.\n  On a subject as important as the use and disclosure of genetic \ninformation, we must understand and build from existing federal laws \nand regulations. With this foundation and the benefit of today's \nunderstanding of genetic science, I look forward to passing legislation \nto prohibit discrimination in health insurance and employment of the \nbasis of genetic information.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/06/senate-section/article/S1595-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1595-S1596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

FAIRBROTHER.\n\n Mr. McCain. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a great \nAmerican patriot, Brigadier General William H. Fairbrother, USAF, Ret. \nGeneral Fairbrother passed away on January 27th at Air Force Village II \nin San Antonio. My deepest sympathies go out to his wife, Patricia, and \nhis daughters, Bonnie and Nancy.\n  William Herman Fairbrother was born in Endicott, NY, on March 28, \n1923, the son of Lieutenant Herman and Caroline Fairbrother. He grew up \non a variety of Infantry Posts, to include the Panama Canal Zone and \nManila, Philippine Islands. Bill entered the United States Military \nAcademy at West Point on a Congressional appointment from the 34th \nDistrict of New York. When he arrived at West Point he knew the \nprepared sling, the hasty sling, and had qualified with the 30-caliber \nwater-cooled machine gun which made it easy to shoot expert with the M1 \nGarand plebe year. Academics, however, were something else. With the \nhelp of ``Sully's Cram School'' in Washington, DC the previous year he \ndid fairly well in the first half year. But after that it was a \ncontinuing struggle to stay proficient. Because of many moves, high \nschool had been rushed and spotty, and four years of Academy study \nbeing rushed into three because of World War II made the task even \nharder. On the other hand, flying, which was his first love went \nsmoothly. Primary flight training in Texas and then Basic and Advanced \nat Stewart during the three years went without problems. It was during \nthe Plebe year that he picked up the nickname ``Fair-B'' in keeping \nwith the academy tradition to reduce the spoken word to its simplest \nform.\n  Fair-B graduated with the class of 1944, the D-Day class, albeit \nrather far down the list. On the very next day, in the Cadet Chapel, he \nmarried his childhood sweetheart, Patricia Ross of Kenmore, New York \nand they lived happily ever after. P-40 and P-47 training, together \nwith those of the class selected for the Fighter business, followed \nwith time at many different bases, as the Service endeavored to cram as \nmuch military experience into the class as they could before sending \nthem overseas. Shortly thereafter it was off to Ie Shima Flying P-47's \nagainst the Japanese. After the war the unit moved over to Okinawa and \nPatricia joined him there in 1946. They, along with many other pioneer \nsouls, set up housekeeping in a Quonset hut. , Bonnie, his first \ndaughter, was born in Okinawa in 1947. In December 1947, Fair-B brought \nthe family back to the U.S. to Selfridge, Michigan. The duty was with \nthe 56th Fighter Group flying F-80's and F-86's, where he was squadron \nadjutant and group adjutant. It was during this time, in 1948, that his \nsecond daughter, Nancy, was born. In 1951 it was off to Minneapolis in \nthe Air Defense Control Center business. There he was assigned as an \naircraft controller and control center chief with the 31st Air \nDivision. Flying time was cadged from the local guard squadron, which \nwas equipped with P-51s. Then in 1953 cold weather assignments \ncontinued, this time to Rapid City, South Dakota and the 54th Fighter \nInterceptor Squadron at Ellsworth Air Force Base. This was probably the \nhappiest assignment in his career, with over two years of the time \nthere being in command of the squadron. Initially, the airplanes were \nP-51s, then F84Gs and finally F-86Ds. He had always said that next to \nbeing a Captain and Fighter Squadron Flight commander, the position of \nFighter Squadron Commander was the best job in the Air Force.\n  Exchange duty with the Royal Air Force at RAF Manby, England followed \nin June of 1956. The assignment was attendance at the RAF Flying \nCollege. The family thoroughly enjoyed this short tour living in the \nsmall East Anglia town of Sutton-on-Sea, going to English Schools, \nlearning the language, dealing with pounds, schillings and pence, and \ndriving on the left side of the road. Fair-B accumulated a respectable \namount of time in British Aircraft to include the Gloster Meteor, \nHawker Hunter and British Electric Canberra. In January 1957 the family \narrived in Rabat Morocco. The assignment here was Chief, Combat \nOperations in the 316th Air Division. Further broadening and true \nsophistication took place during this time. Not only was the Division \npartially manned with French Air Force personnel but also, the family \nlived in a French villa. In addition, flights with the family on \nmilitary aircraft up to the European continent were allowed once a \nyear. They took full advantage of this privilege and managed to visit \nSpain, Portugal, Italy, France, Germany and Switzerland during their \nMoroccan stay. The Division Fighter Squadrons were equipped with F-86D \nand F-100 aircraft so Fair-B was able to keep his hand in flying. There \nwere many trips to Wheelus Air Force Base in Tripoli, Libya, where the \nsquadrons went TDY for gunnery and rocketry training.\n\n  The three and a half years in North Africa went by quickly, and the \nreturn to the US happened in June 1960 with attendance at the Air War \nCollege. Following graduation from the Air War College he spent a long \nfive years in the Pentagon, first on the Air Staff in War Plans and \nthen as Executive Assistant in the Office of the Air Force Chief of \nStaff. One year with Curtis LeMay and one year with John McConnell \nprovided rare and valuable staff experience.\n  After the fast pace of the Washington area, duty on the CINCPAC staff \nin Hawaii, starting in 1966, seemed slow indeed. Here Fair-B served on \nthe staff of the Commander in Chief, Pacific, at Camp Smith. Not only \ndid they take off for the weekends, but Wednesday afternoons as well. \nThe duty was good, with many evaluation trips to the MAAG supported \ncountries in the Far East. This, together with quarters on Hickam, and \nthe benevolent Hawaiian weather made for a delightful tour.\n  Patricia stayed in Hawaii when Fair-B went to the Republic of Vietnam \nto join the 14th Special Operations Wing. As Vice Commander and then \nCommander he was kept busy monitoring the varied activities of the \nWing, which were performed from nine separate bases. The little command \nO-2 aircraft spent a lot of time touring the country. In addition to \nthe clandestine operations, the Wing had the AC-47 and AC-119 gunships, \nthe psychological warfare business with O-2s and C-47s and the only \narmed helicopter squadron in the Air Force, flying UH-1Ns. He served \nthe Wing from September 1969, to September 1970.\n  After Vietnam the next assignment as Deputy Chief of Staff at \nHeadquarters Air Force Logistics Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force \nBase, Ohio with the job of DCS Distribution. The assignment was not \nawarded because of any logistics experience buy mainly because the boss \nman wanted some operational talent on the staff. The job was \nfascinating and of enormous scope. Fair-B jumped in with his typical \nenthusiasm and his performance helped in getting him promoted to \nBrigadier General on April 1, 1972. Separation from the Air Force came \nin 1974 with Fair-B being allowed to keep the wife and kids and the Air \nForce keeping the airplanes. His decorations and awards include the \nLegion of Merit (2), Distinguished Flying Cross (2) with oak leaf \ncluster, Air Medal (3) with two oak leaf clusters and the Meritorious \nService Medal. He was a command pilot.\n  Fair-B and Patricia, hand-in hand then returned to Hawaii, their \nchoice of all the places they had tried throughout the years. They \nmoved into an apartment on Waikiki beach and then took the time to read \nwhat there wasn't time for before and work on the projects that had \nlong ago been put aside. Other activities during this eight-year idyll \nincluded working with the House Republican Whip in the Hawaii State \nLegislature, activities with the Retiree Affairs Council at Hickam and \nwork with the Oahu Chapter of the Air Force Association. 1982 found \nthem in San Antonio, Texas, and in 1987 they made their next-to-the-\nlast move into a cottage at Air Force Village II. Fair-B served three \nyear as a Trustee on the Board of the Air Force Village Foundation, and \nover three years as a Director on the Air Force Village II Board of \nDirectors.\n  Fair-B is survived by his wife of 57 years Patricia; daughters and \nsons-in-\n\n[[Page S1597]]\n\nlaw Bonnie and Jerold Kreidler, Nancy and James Councilor and \ngranddaughters Katherine and Patricia Councilor.\n  While it can be said he never single handedly moved the world around, \nFair-B certainly participated in many worthwhile events that did. As a \nresult, those who knew him well can look back over his busy years and \nsay, ``Not too shabby, old son, not too shabby.'' \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/06/senate-section/article/S1597-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           IN APPRECIATION FOR MAJOR GENERAL PHILIP G. KILLEY\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, today I express appreciation for \nthe work that Major General Philip G. Killey has done as the Adjutant \nGeneral for the South Dakota National Guard. Today, General Killey and \nother members of the National Guard come up to the Capitol for their \nannual trip to Washington, and I wanted to take this time to thank the \ngeneral for the terrific leadership he has provided to the Guard over \nthe past four years.\n  General Killey reports that South Dakota has continued its high \nrankings in terms of readiness of its Guard and Reserve units. South \nDakota's units are also tops in the Nation in the quality of its new \nrecruits. I commend the South Dakota Guard for its continued \nexcellence, and General Killey for his leadership, which has led to the \nmaintenance of this high standard. National rankings only confirm the \nquality that has come to be expected of the Guard and Reserve of a \ngreat State.\n  Most South Dakotans know at least one of the 4,500 current members of \nthe South Dakota Guard and Reserves or the thousands of former \nGuardsmen and Reservists. Sometimes, the connection is even more \ndirect. Before joining the Army, my oldest son Brooks was a member of \nthe South Dakota Army Guard in Yankton.\n  Almost every community in my State benefits from the work of these \nGuardsmen. Following the tragedies of September 11, Guardsmen were \ncalled to assist in the campaign against terrorism and have performed \nsecurity duties at airports around the state. From Aberdeen to Yankton, \nthe Guard and Reserves are active members of the South Dakota \ncommunity.\n  In addition to the support the Guard and Reserves give to South \nDakota, they have also supported overseas operations including those in \nCentral America, the Middle East, Europe, and Asia. The South Dakota \nAir Guard performed admirably in their deployment to the ``no-fly \nzone'' over Iraq late last year.\n  These latest activities, and the professionalism that our South \nDakota Guardsmen have shown, are a testimony to the leadership of \nGeneral Killey. Before becoming the Adjutant General in 1998, General \nKilley served with distinction in both the active duty Air Force and in \nthe South Dakota National Guard.\n  General Killey received his commission in 1963 through Officer \nTraining School, at Lackland AFB in Texas. He served a tour in \nSoutheast Asia in 1967-1968 flying the F-4 with the 8th Tactical \nFighter Wing at Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. He left \nactive duty in 1969 and joined the Air National Guard in 1970. He held \nvarious positions with the South Dakota Air National Guard before \nbecoming the Adjutant General. He was recalled to active duty as \ndirector of the Air National Guard from 1988 until 1994. General Killey \nwas the first Guardsman to serve as commander, 1st Air Force, Air \nCombat Command, and Continental United States North American Aerospace \nDefense Command Region, Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida from 1994 until \n1998.\n  I commend General Killey for his many years of service, and thank him \nfor all that he has done for this nation and for our great state of \nSouth Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/06/senate-section/article/S1597-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO COLONEL EDWARD D. BISHOP\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, it has come to my attention \nthat Colonel Edward D. Bishop is retiring after 30 years of exemplary \nactive military service in the United States Army. He served his \ncountry with dignity, honor, courage and integrity.\n  Colonel Bishop is concluding his career as the Chief, Congressional \nAffairs, U.S. Army Materiel Command, AMC, from August 2000 to May 2002. \nThe Colonel's extraordinary insight into congressional affairs has \ngreatly assisted the United States Army Materiel Command with the tough \nbefore the United States Congress. AMC is the one place in the Army \nwhere technology, acquisition, and logistics are integrated to assure \nArmy readiness. Colonel Bishop as the Chief, Congressional Affairs, AMC \nwas able to work the hard issues for the Army in order for AMC to \ncontinue to sustain the nation's defense industrial base.\n  Ed Bishop is a world-class logistician who served our nation in \nnumerous logistical assignments throughout his career. From January \n1996 to August 2000, he was assigned as the Director of the United \nStates Central Command, CENTCOM, Liaison Office. He was the commands \nrepresentative to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint \nStaff, the Service Staffs, Congress, and numerous Federal Agencies on \npolitical-military, operational, and logistics issues affecting 25 \ncountries in Southwest Asia, Central Asia, and Horn of Africa.\n  Ed's other assignments included Division Chief in the Joint Logistics \nand Security Assistance Directorate from June 1993 to January 1996. \nDuring this period, he negotiated host nation support agreements with \nselected Gulf countries, monitored the readiness of prepositioned \nmateriel, and provided interface with CENTCOM and the Joint Staff \nCrisis Action Team. Prior to this period, Col. Bishop was assigned to \nU.S. Forces Command and Joint Task Force, Somalia.\n  Colonel Bishop is a native of the great state of Alabama and a \ndistinguished graduate of Jacksonville State University, Jacksonville, \nAlabama in 1972, and commissioned as a Second Lieutenant of Infantry. \nLater, he earned a Master of Business Administration, MBA, in Business \nAdministration in 1982, from Florida Institute of Technology, and is a \ngraduate of the Industrial College of Armed Forces at Fort McNair, \nWashington, D.C.\n  Colonel Bishop's military decorations include the Defense Superior \nService Medal, Army Meritorious Service Medal with five oak leaf \nclusters, a Joint Service Commendation Medal, Army Commendation Medal \nwith three oak leaf clusters, the Army Achievement Medal, the United \nNations Service Medal, and the Army Humanitarian Service Medal. \nThroughout his career, Colonel Bishop has brought astute judgment, bold \nrecommendations and selfless service to our Army.\n  Mr. President, Colonel Bishop deserves the thanks and praise of the \nnation that he faithfully served for so long. I know the Members of the \nSenate will join me in wishing him, his wife, Linda, two sons, Ryan and \nTroy, their daughter-in-law Sonya, and their lovely grandson Dylan, all \nthe best in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/06/senate-section/article/S1597-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1597-S1598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO ROBERT HODGES, THE OLDEST AMERICAN VETERAN\n\n Mr. EDWARDS. Madam President, today I pay tribute to an \nincredible North Carolinian, Mr. Robert Hodges.\n  On Friday, the Department of Veterans Affairs will host a ceremony in \nPamlico County and officially recognize Mr. Hodges as the oldest \nAmerican veteran. According to VA records, Mr. Hodges celebrated his \n111th birthday last June. But if you ask Mr. Hodges, he'll tell you he \nis actually 114 years old.\n  As remarkable as his age is, it's not how long he's lived, but how he \nhas lived those 111 or 114 years that is so inspiring.\n  Mr. Hodges is truly an example of living history. His life has been \ntouched by almost every struggle this nation has endured. He was born \nin 1888, the same year Benjamin Harrison was elected President. His \nfather, a runaway slave who lived to be 112 years old, often told him \nstories of the Civil War. He grew up on a former plantation in Beaufort \nCounty. He was never offered the chance for a formal education, so he \nhelped his mother and father raise corn, cotton and peanuts on land \nthat just decades before had been tended by slaves.\n  Shortly after America entered World War I, Mr. Hodges volunteered to \nserve his country. Mr. Hodges was one of nearly 20,000 African-American \nsoldiers from North Carolina, men dedicated to\n\n[[Page S1598]]\n\nprotecting a nation that treated them as second-class citizens at best. \nMilitary life offered no escape from the racism and segregation of \ncivilian life, but Mr. Hodges didn't let that deter him. He served his \ncountry with distinction as a medical corpsman, ordnance technician and \nsupplymaster. Mr. Hodges even became friends with General John ``Black \nJack'' Pershing, commander of the U.S. Allied Expeditionary Force.\n  Following his service, he returned home to his mother and father's \nfarm. He married Malinda, and despite the economic hard times, the two \neventually saved enough money to buy their own land and build a home in \nStonewall. He and Malinda had eight children. Sadly, after more than 50 \nyears of marriage, Malinda died in 1997.\n  Time has not touched his incredible spirit. In fact, if you ask him \nto, he can still describe his feelings at the moment he heard an \norderly shout to the front lines ``The war is over!\"\n  Several years ago, a reporter covering a Veteran's Day celebration in \nStonewall asked Mr. Hodges why it was so important for him to tell his \nstory. Mr. Hodges replied because ``so many people . . . didn't get to \ncome home.''\n  Mr. Hodges' story is remarkable. He overcame discrimination and \nprejudice and served his country with honor. He raised a loving family \nand has become a pillar of his church and community. I am proud to help \ntell his story of service and patriotism today, and I'm certain it will \nserve as an inspiration to all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/06/senate-section/article/S1598-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CONGRATULATIONS TO ULUS JOHNSON OF SYMSONIA, KENTUCKY\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, today I congratulate Ulus \nJohnson of Symsonia, KY on being named by the Benton Kiwanis Club this \nyear's Grand Marshal of events for the annual Tater Day Parade.\n  Mr. Johnson, who was with the Navy Seabees during WWII and served 28 \nmonths in the South Pacific, is believed to be the first non-Marshall \nCountian ever to be named Grand Marshal in he Parade's 159 years of \nexistence. Like Mr. Johnson, Tater Day has survived the various twists \nand turns of history. During the 1950s and 1960s, many believed the \nparade was on the brink of being canceled. But with the help of \nfriends, Ulus Johnson was able to revive the tradition of Tater Day for \nfuture generations.\n  Tater Day has its origins on the first Monday in April because this \nday also happened to be County Court Day and a good time for farmers to \ngather from across Kentucky in Benton to stock up on supplies, \nincluding sweet potatoes, for the upcoming planting season. They could \nalso visit with neighbors, swap horses, dogs, knives and more than a \nfew quality stories and tales. Johnson vividly remembers pretending to \nbe ill on this day as a young boy so that he could miss school and \nattend the events of Tater Day. For many years, Johnson even drove his \nstagecoach to the parade for the sake of tradition, but now this item \nstands in a glassed-in enclosure at the rear of his home, where school \nchildren often come to learn about modes of transportation from the \npast. Ulus Johnson has been a vital figure for the Tater Day Parade \nalmost his entire life and will certainly do a great job carrying on \nits tradition and legacy.\n  I once again congratulate Mr. Johnson for this honor and wish him and \nthe rest of the participants a glorious Tater Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/06/senate-section/article/S1598-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/06/senate-section/article/S1598-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a \nwithdrawal and sundry nominations which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/06/senate-section/article/S1598-4", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 3, 2001, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on March 5, 2002, during the recess of the \nSenate, received the following message from the President of the United \nStates, together with the accompanying papers; which was referred as \nindicated:\n\n       PM-72.

To establish a national rail passenger transportation \nsystem, reauthorize Amtrak, improve security and service on Amtrak, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the National \nDefense Rail Act on behalf of myself and some 19 co-sponsors. This \nlegislation will establish a strong and efficient national passenger \nrail system. For far too long, we have neglected investing in our \nNation's passenger rail system. We have taken an active responsibility \nin developing the infrastructure of all other modes of transportation, \nwhether it has been federally funding the development of the interstate \nhighway system, subsidizing airport construction, or taking the \nresponsibility for dredging harbors and channels or building locks and \ndams. Now it is time to build a world class passenger railroad system \nin the United States. We know it can be done. Japan and France provide \ntwo models of successful passenger railroad service. The time to move \nahead is now. We cannot wait for highways and airports to become so \nclogged that they cannot operate any longer. Rail systems are not built \nin a day. We need to engage in long-term planning to address future \npassenger transportation growth and show forethought in crafting \ntransportation solutions--not wait for an impending crisis. My \nlegislation provides the vision to begin to do this.\n  The atrocious events of September 11, 2001, and the aftermath which \nfollowed, exposed the vulnerability of our society and our economy when \ntransportation choices are limited and our mobility is diminished. In \nthe aftermath of the horrific attack on the World Trade Center and the \nPentagon, we were forced to adjust to a transportation system that was \nwithout access to aviation. That should make us all evaluate the \nproblems inherent in a policy that results in overall dependence on any \none particular mode of transportation. We need to have a more balanced \nsystem of transportation for passengers in this country. Our economy \ndepends on it; our travelers deserve it; and our roads and airports\n\n[[Page S1601]]\n\ncould operate more efficiently in a balanced system.\n  After the Federal Aviation Administration grounded all flights \nfollowing the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, travelers \nflocked to Amtrak. Whether people had to travel for business, to help \nwith rescue efforts, or just to get home, Amtrak kept our American \ncitizens moving during a time of national emergency.\n  The situation not only proved that Amtrak works, but that passenger \nrail is a critical part of our transportation infrastructure during a \nnational emergency or security crisis. Amtrak provided a critical \ntransportation link, carrying 35,000 passengers along the Northeast \ncorridor every day, and hundreds of extra carloads of mail for the U.S. \nPostal Office in the days following the terrorist attacks.\n  Transportation security--an essential part of our national security--\nrequires a balanced and competitive system of transportation \nalternatives. In September, we found that our dependence on the \naviation system almost crippled us. We cannot afford to rely on any \nsingle mode of transportation; we need to ensure that we have a \nbalanced system that includes a sound passenger rail system. We also \nknow that passenger railroads use less fuel per passenger mile than \nhighway vehicles and commercial airlines. During these times of oil-\nconsciousness, a larger presence of passenger rail in our \ntransportation system would reduce our Nation's dependence on foreign \noil.\n  Passenger railroads, the interstate highway system, and our national \naviation network have all taken different paths to their current roles \nin our national transportation system. The tales of their development \nstand in quite a stark contrast from each other.\n  The interstate highway system has received significant attention and \nfederal funding since the construction of the Lincoln Highway in 1913 \nand the Rural Post Roads Act of 1916, and later during World War II \nwith the Federal Highway Act of 1944. It was not until 1956, however, \nthat the Government began heavily promoting highway transportation with \nthe passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956. The act established \na Highway Trust Fund based upon Federal user taxes, in order to finance \nup to 90 percent of State construction costs of the $25 billion plan to \npay for new roads, and the construction of the Eisenhower National \nInterstate and Defense Highway System.\n  Similar policies and Federal attention for aviation resulted in a \nstrengthened infrastructure, and follows much the same story of the \nhighways system.\n  Passenger rail service was once a vital instrument in the \ntransportation needs of our Nation. For instance, during World War II, \nnot only did the railroads transport 90 percent of all defense freight, \nbut also 97 percent of all defense personnel on their way to theaters \nof action. By the end of the war, railroads accounted for three-\nquarters of the common carrier share of intercity traffic, with \nairplanes and buses sharing the remaining quarter of traffic. However, \nwith national focus turned to aviation and highways, by the late 1960s \nmost rail companies were petitioning the Government to discontinue \npassenger services because of losses.\n  Amtrak was created as a Federal corporation in order to relieve the \nrailroad industry of these unprofitable passenger operations, and in \nthe interest of maintaining a national passenger rail network. But in \nretrospect, Amtrak was set up not to thrive and expand passenger rail \nservice, but really to just maintain the status quo of 30 years ago. \nThat attitude persists even today. Since 1971, Amtrak has received only \n$25 billion in public subsidies; during that period, the United States \ninvested $750 billion on highways and aviation.\n  So one problem becomes all too clear--that U.S. passenger rail \ninfrastructure has no stable funding source in contrast to highways, \naviation, and transit. In fact, per capita spending on passenger rail \nis much lower than many other countries: the U.S. ranks behind Britain, \nFrance, Japan, Canada, Luxembourg, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, \nSweden, Denmark, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Norway, Czech Republic, \nFinland, Slovakia, Portugal, Poland, South Africa, Greece, and Estonia. \nImagine that of the 23 industrialized nations with rail service, we are \nat the bottom. Including these countries, no passenger rail service in \nthe world has built and operated a passenger rail system at a profit. \nAll have required Government support for construction and maintenance, \nor operating support, or both. That same principle holds true for \nhighways and aviation, which have required substantial Federal spending \nsince their beginning and continue to receive generous Federal \nsubsidies today.\n  Those who want passenger rail to operate without Federal assistance--\nultimately forcing more travelers onto cars, buses and airplanes--argue \nthat we should not ``subsidize'' passenger rail. But we subsidize the \nbuilding of roads and highways with tax dollars. We subsidize the \nbuilding of airports and pay for all of the equipment and people needed \nto run our air traffic control system. We consider those subsidies to \nbe worthwhile investments in our economy and our quality of life. We \nmust make the same investment to create a world-class passenger rail \nsystem in order to see the same kinds of benefits.\n  While that argument should stand on its own, here's something the \nhighway and airline crowd can take to the bank: moving more short-haul \ntravelers to rail service reduces congestion on our already overcrowded \nhighways and eases congestion at airports. It also provides real \ncompetition to airlines on short-haul trips.\n  Over the past 30 years, the lack of investment and attention to the \nneeds of passenger rail infrastructure has resulted in a weak passenger \nrail network, and has caused a strain on the capacity of other modes of \ntransportation in many areas of the country. The Amtrak Reform and \nAccountability Act of 1997, and preceding statutes, resulted in \ncreating conflicting missions for Amtrak: serve a public function by \noperating unprofitable long-distance routes, but also attempt to \noperate at a profit. To add insult to injury, Amtrak has been forced to \ndelay capital improvement projects having important long-term benefits \nin order to attempt to meet the mandate of the 1997 Act. Congress \npassed this misguided law in 1997, requiring Amtrak to operate without \ngovernment support by the end of fiscal year 2002. But there is no \ntruly national passenger train service in the world that makes a \nprofit. Requiring Amtrak to make a profit has forced the railroad to \nforgo long-term capital investments in favor of short-term, bond \npayment shell games. Instead of investing in modern trains and \ninfrastructure upgrades, Amtrak was forced to mortgage Penn Station \njust to pay the electric bill.\n  From this, it is evident that we need to reevaluate our Nation's rail \npassenger policy, and clearly define a role for Amtrak. A strong \nFederal role was required to establish the interstate highway system \nand the Federal aviation network. And now Federal investment in \npassenger rail infrastructure is critical; once again, Federal \nleadership is required to address the needs of a reliable, safe, secure \npassenger rail network.\n  This legislation provides a blueprint for the future of passenger \nrail in the United States. The bill will help develop high-speed rail \ncorridors, which are the building blocks for a national passenger rail \nsystem. This will allow regional transportation solutions to play a \npart in the national system. It will also aid in the development of \nshort distance corridors between larger urban centers, as well as \nprovide funding to preserve longer distance routes for those \ncommunities that do not have the population densities to merit air \nservice--sometimes the train is their only alternative to driving. \nFinally, it will provide Amtrak with the tools and funding it needs to \noperate efficiently.\n  This legislation authorizes $1.255 billion in emergency spending for \nAmtrak's security and life safety needs. Similar language was included \nin the Rail Security Act, S. 1550, which was favorably reported by the \ncommittee on October 17, 2001. In that legislation, we authorized funds \nto be spent on immediate rail security needs, such as hiring more \npolice officers across the entire Amtrak system and modernizing the \nsafety infrastructure of old tunnels.\n  This bill will give the Federal Government the script for the role it \nneeds\n\n[[Page S1602]]\n\nto play in establishing a national rail passenger system. It would not \nrequire any State contribution, and would give preference to projects \nhaving right-of-way dedicated to passenger rail, involving high-speed \npassenger service of 125 mph, although operations of 90 mph speeds or \nmore would be eligible for funding, and those connecting to other modes \nof passenger transportation, including airports.\n  The bill authorizes $1.5 billion annually for corridor development. \nThese funds are needed for infrastructure acquisition, highway-rail \ngrade crossing improvement/elimination, acquisition of rolling stock \nand track and signal equipment. Development of a national passenger \nrail system carries a high cost, and the Federal Government must take \nthe lead role in funding it.\n  This bill will also fund $35 billion in loan guarantees. This money \nwill dramatically expand the current Railroad Rehabilitation & \nInfrastructure Financing loan and loan guarantee program. But we also \nmust restructure that program. Since it was created in 1998 as part of \nTEA-21 bill, the program has processed only a few loans due to \nunreasonable constraints imposed by OMB. Our bill eliminates the \nartificial limits on loan amounts, impossible collateral requirements, \nand unworkable loan cohort structures.\n  This bill identifies existing high-speed corridors in 29 States and \nthe District of Columbia for priority consideration. Many of these \ncorridors are in areas where people are now driving cars or taking \nairplanes on trips of 300 miles or less. In these areas, like the East \nCoast, travelers could take a high-speed train instead and arrive at \nabout the same time. But right now they don't have that rail option, \nand they won't until we build it.\n  The passenger railroad system that has worked well in the Northeast \ncan work in other highly-congested areas of the country: the South, the \nMidwest, California and the Northwest. Thirty years ago, those areas \ndid not have the population to support high-speed intercity rail. But \ntoday those areas are growing by leaps and bounds. As the highways in \nthose areas clog up and the planes run 3 hours late, their Governors--\nmany of them Republicans--are asking us for help to build high speed \nrail.\n  A short-term benefit of this legislation will be stimulation of the \neconomy by providing jobs in developing new corridors. This bill \nensures that fair labor standards for all projects receiving funds \nunder it, including payment of prevailing wages and allowance of \ncollective bargaining over wage rates.\n  Another immediate benefit will be the closing/improvement of highway-\nrail grade crossings in high-speed rail corridors. Under this bill, \nfunds are set aside specifically for these important safety \nimprovements.\n  This legislation will provide the necessary funds of $1.31 billion \nfor Amtrak to repair and upgrade the track it owns and operates in the \nNortheast corridor. This corridor is a prime example of the benefits we \ncan attain when there are transportation choices for travelers. The \nNortheast corridor has become an invaluable asset to our national \ntransportation system, and it should not be left in disrepair. This \nbill authorizes funds to enable Amtrak to eliminate its capital backlog \nof projects, maintain ongoing projects to capital infrastructure, and \nimprove capacity to accommodate projected growth in traffic. It also \nallows Amtrak to reinvest revenues from operations in the Northeast \ncorridor back into the backlog of capital infrastructure projects.\n  In a nutshell, this is our long term plan to make passenger rail a \npart of our balanced transportation system. But in the short run, we \nmust make sure Amtrak's financial foundation is strong at a time when \nwe are relying on them more than ever. Amtrak's ridership has increased \nconsistently, and they now carry over 22 million passengers per year. \nThis legislation will give Amtrak the tools and funding they need to \ncreate a modern, efficient passenger railroad. The bill reauthorizes \nAmtrak for 5 years, and fully funds their capital needs and the \noperating losses with respect to long-distance service.\n  This legislation repeals the unrealistic operating self-sufficiency \nrequirements. It also authorizes funding for compliance with \nenvironmental standards, and the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  This legislation will further aid Amtrak to operate more efficiently. \nIt will require Amtrak to reinvest revenues from non-passenger \noperations into growth projects outside the Northeast corridor. It will \nrequire revenue from the Northeast corridor to be reinvested into \ncapital projects on the Northeast corridor. Finally, it will require an \nannual independent audit of Amtrak, to be reviewed by the Department of \nTransportation's Inspector General.\n  I am pleased my colleagues have joined with me in sponsoring this \nbill. By developing passenger rail as part of a balanced transportation \nsystem, this legislation will lead to the creation of jobs in the short \nrun to stimulate our economy. In the long run, high-speed rail \ncorridors will become a key foundation for our national rail passenger \ntransportation system, which is critical to the strong backbone of a \nprosperous economy.\n  Like the interstate highway system, the benefits of passenger rail \nand Amtrak could be immeasurable, so we have much at stake. While I \nhave outlined an ambitious blueprint, I keep in mind that 50 years ago, \nthe National System of Interstate and Defense Highways was ``pie in the \nsky.'' Now our successful Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and \nDefense Highways and national aviation network are used by many, so \nmuch that in many places they are congested and strained to capacity. \nWe should not wait until our current transportation problems reach \nepidemic proportions; our economy cannot afford it.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill and an outline \nof the finances of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1991\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n\n[[Page S1603]]\n\n       (1) Financial investment in passenger rail infrastructure \n     is critical, and Federal leadership is required to address \n     the needs of a reliable safe, secure passenger rail network, \n     just as has been used in establishing the interstate highway \n     system and the Federal aviation network.\n       (2) Lack of investment and attention to the needs of \n     passenger rail infrastructure has resulted in a weak \n     passenger rail network, and has caused a strain on the \n     capacity of other modes of transportation in many areas of \n     the country. According to the Department of Transportation, \n     in 1999 the cost of wasted time and extra fuel consumption \n     due to delays on congested roads was estimated at $78 \n     billion.\n       (3) Passenger rail is an integral part of the United States \n     transportation system, and, as can be evidenced in the \n     Northeast Corridor, relieves the pressures of congestion on \n     highways and at airports, and creates a more balanced system \n     of transportation alternatives.\n       (4) Passenger rail service has been a vital instrument in \n     the transportation needs of our Nation. For instance, during \n     World War II, the privately owned, operated, and constructed \n     railroad industry transported 90 percent of all defense \n     freight, and 97 percent of all defense personnel transported \n     to points of embarkation for theaters of action. By the end \n     of the war, railroads accounted for three quarters of the \n     share of the common carrier share of intercity traffic, with \n     airplanes and buses sharing the remaining quarter of traffic.\n       (5) Significant attention and Federal funding were required \n     to construct the Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense \n     Highways. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 established a \n     Highway Trust Fund based upon Federal user taxes in order to \n     finance up to 90 percent of the costs of the $25 billion \n     dollar highway construction plan.\n       (6) Federal policies with respect to investment in aviation \n     resulted in a strengthened aviation industry and the rapid \n     development of air passenger service, and by the late 1960's \n     most rail companies were petitioning the Government to \n     discontinue passenger services because of losses.\n       (7) Amtrak was established in 1971 by the Rail Passenger \n     Service Act of 1970 to provide passenger rail services in the \n     United States as a public service; at the time of Amtrak's \n     formation, freight railroads were losing money on \n     unprofitable passenger rail operations. Since 1971 Amtrak has \n     received only $25 billion in public subsidies; during that \n     period, the United States invested $750 billion on highways \n     and aviation.\n       (8) The Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997, and \n     preceding statutes, resulted in creating conflicting missions \n     for the National Railroad Passenger Corporation of both \n     serving a public function by operating unprofitable long-\n     distance routes while also attempting to operate at a profit. \n     This policy has also restricted Amtrak's profit potential on \n     the Northeast Corridor by limiting the capital expenditures \n     to help defray other costs.\n       (9) Due to a lack of capital investment, the Northeast \n     Corridor has accumulated a backlog of repair needs, including \n     life safety and security needs. Investment in the capital \n     needs of the Northeast Corridor would result in capacity \n     improvements which would result in greater utilization of the \n     existing infrastructure.\n       (10) The Department of Transportation Inspector General's \n     2001 Assessment of Amtrak's Financial Performance and \n     Requirements (Report #CR-2002-075) found that Amtrak's lack \n     of available capital has impeded its efforts to achieve \n     financial goals.\n       (11) In order to attempt to meet the mandate of the Amtrak \n     Reform and Accountability Act of 1997, Amtrak has been forced \n     to delay capital improvement projects and other projects \n     which would produce long-term benefits.\n       (12) The Department of Transportation Inspector General's \n     2001 Assessment of Amtrak's Financial Performance and \n     Requirements (Report #CR-2002-075) found that Amtrak's most \n     profitable operations are on the Northeast Corridor, where \n     Federal investment in passenger rail infrastructure has been \n     significantly higher than anywhere else in the country.\n       (13) Federal investments in capital projects to support \n     passenger rail in areas other than the Northeast Corridor \n     would result in improved service and increase profitability.\n       (14) The need for a balanced interstate and international \n     transportation system that provides a viable alternative to \n     travel by private automobile or commercial aircraft is \n     particularly evident after the events of September 11, 2001.\n       (15) As a matter of national security, a strong passenger \n     rail network would provide travelers an alternative to \n     highway and air travel, which could lead to reduced United \n     States reliance on foreign oil imports.\n       (16) In fiscal year 2001, the United States spent less than \n     1 percent of all transportation modal spending on intercity \n     passenger rail, and since 1998, Amtrak has received only \n     $4.59 billion of the $8.42 billion it has been authorized to \n     receive by Congress.\n       (17) Passenger rail in the United States has no stable \n     funding source, in contrast to highways, aviation, and \n     transit.\n       (18) Per capita spending on passenger rail is much higher \n     in other countries than the United States and, in fact, the \n     United States ranks behind other countries including Canada, \n     Japan, France, Great Britain, Italy, Spain, Austria, \n     Switzerland, Belgium, Sweden, Luxembourg, Denmark, Ireland, \n     Norway, the Czech Republic, Finland, Slovakia, Portugal, \n     Poland, South Africa, Greece, and Estonia.\n       (19) The United States needs to engage in long-term \n     planning to foster and address future passenger \n     transportation growth and show forethought regarding \n     transportation solutions rather than be forced to act due to \n     an impending crisis.\n       (20) It is in the national interest to preserve passenger \n     rail service in the United States and to maintain the \n     solvency of the National Railroad Passenger Corporation.\n       (21) Long-term planning and support for passenger rail will \n     help offset the emerging problems created by transportation \n     congestion, and contribute to a cleaner and more \n     environmentally-friendly transportation system.\n       (22) A comprehensive re-evaluation of our nation's rail \n     passenger policy is required and a clearly defined role for \n     Amtrak and a connected rail passenger network must be \n     established.\n       (23) The Federal government must take the primary \n     responsibility for developing national railroad passenger \n     transportation infrastructure, and help ensure that it \n     functions as an efficient network. Privatization of the rail \n     passenger industry in Great Britain has been disastrous and \n     passenger service has suffered overall.\n       (24) The Nation should be afforded the opportunity to \n     receive safe, efficient, and cost-effective rail passenger \n     services, taking into account all benefits to the Nation as a \n     whole.\n\n                 TITLE I--RAIL TRANSPORTATION SECURITY\n\n     SEC. 101.

RAILWAY-HIGHWAY CROSSINGS IN HIGH-SPEED RAIL \n                   CORRIDORS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The entire cost of construction of \n     projects for the elimination of hazards of railway-highway \n     crossings in designated high-speed rail corridors, including \n     the separation or protection of grades at crossings, the \n     reconstruction of existing railroad grade crossing \n     structures, and the relocation of highways to eliminate grade \n     crossings, may be paid from sums authorized by subsection \n     (k). In any case when the elimination of the hazards of a \n     railway-highway crossing can be effected by the relocation of \n     a portion of a railway at a cost estimated by the Secretary \n     of Transportation to be less than the cost of such \n     elimination by one of the methods mentioned in the first \n     sentence of this section, then the entire cost of such \n     relocation project may be paid from sums authorized by \n     subsection (k).\n       (b) Classification of Projects.--The Secretary may classify \n     the various types of projects involved in the elimination of \n     hazards of high-speed rail corridor railway-highway \n     crossings, and may set for each such classification a \n     percentage of the costs of construction which shall be deemed \n     to represent the net benefit to the railroad or railroads for \n     the purpose of determining the railroad's share of the cost \n     of construction. The percentage so determined shall in no \n     case exceed 10 per cent of such costs. The Secretary shall \n     determine the appropriate classification of each project.\n       (c) Liability of Railroad.--Any railroad involved in a \n     project for the elimination of hazards of railway-highway \n     crossings paid for in whole or in part from sums made \n     available under this section shall be liable to the United \n     States for the net benefit to the railroad determined under \n     the classification of such project made under subsection (b). \n     That liability to the United States may be discharged by \n     direct payment to the State transportation department of the \n     State in which the project is located, in which case such \n     payment shall be credited to the cost of the project. The \n     payment may consist in whole or in part of materials and \n     labor furnished by the railroad in connection with the \n     construction of the project. If any such railroad fails to \n     discharge such liability within a 6-month period after \n     completion of the project, it shall be liable to the United \n     States for its share of the cost, and the Secretary shall \n     request the Attorney General to institute proceedings against \n     such railroad for the recovery of the amount for which it is \n     liable under this subsection. The Attorney General is \n     authorized to bring such proceedings on behalf of the United \n     States, in the appropriate district court of the United \n     States, and the United States shall be entitled in such \n     proceedings to recover such sums as it is considered and \n     adjudged by the court that such railroad is liable for in the \n     premises. Any amounts recovered by the United States under \n     this subsection shall be credited to miscellaneous receipts.\n       (d) Survey and Schedule of Projects.--Each State shall \n     conduct and systematically maintain a survey of all high-\n     speed rail corridor railway-highway crossings to identify \n     those railroad crossings which may require separation, \n     relocation, or protective devices, and establish and \n     implement a schedule of projects for this purpose.\n       (e) Funds for Protective Devices.--The Secretary shall give \n     priority under this section to the elimination of high-speed \n     rail corridor railway-highway grade crossings, but shall make \n     funds authorized for obligation or expenditure under this \n     section available for the installation of protective devices \n     at high-speed rail corridor railway-highway crossings where \n     appropriate.\n       (f) Apportionment.--The Secretary shall apportion funds \n     available for obligation and expenditure under this section \n     between high-speed rail corridor railway-highway crossings on \n     the Northeast Corridor and such crossings outside the \n     Northeast Corridor in an equitable fashion, taking into \n     account traffic volume, traffic patterns, frequency of \n     trains, adequacy of existing hazard warnings, and such other \n     factors as the Secretary deems appropriate.\n       (g) Annual Report.--The Secretary shall report to the \n     Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and \n     the House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and \n     Infrastructure not later than December 30 of each year on the \n     progress being made to implement the railway-highway \n     crossings program authorized by this section and the \n     effectiveness of such improvements.

Madam President, as my good friend Senator Hollings has \njust stated, we are on the brink of a very important decision. Do we \ncontinue to underfund a national passenger rail system? Or do we \nfinally stand behind the system, committing to it once and for all?\n  I agree with my good friend, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, \nand that's why I joined him in introducing this important bill. For 30 \nyears, I have witnessed Congress dangling a carrot in front of Amtrak's \neyes, funding it just enough for it to limp along. And I'll tell you, \nthis has to stop. Now is the time to commit politically and financially \nto a strong, safe, and efficient passenger rail system. And now is the \ntime to determine once and for all, what exactly it is that we want out \nof passenger rail service in the country. Should this be a truly \nnational system? And should we devote the resources necessary to \nmaintain and expand this networks?\n  Senator Hollings and the rest of my colleagues know that I support \nfunding the highway and aviation networks, our Nation has relied upon \nthem for years, and they have served us well. But I look around today \nand I see crowded skies and congested roads. At the very same time, I \nsee empty rails, with the potential to relieve this transportation \nburden and serve as a useful alternative for Americans.\n  As Senator Hollings discussed just now, the events of September 11 \nfurther demonstrated, in stark and rigid terms, the necessity of \ntransportation choices. For years I have argued that we need to sit \ndown together and begin an honest and frank discussion in order to \ncreate a blueprint for the future of passenger rail.\n  And, let me tell you this, this bill that I am introducing with \nSenator Hollings is a good, solid start. Instead of maintaining the \nstatus quo, the bill offers a vision and a set of priorities for the \nfuture of passenger rail in this country. It says: we need to make sure \nthis system is safe, as September 11 demonstrated it must be. It says: \nwe need to seriously invest in the future of this system, which is \nhigh-speed rail. And it says: the Federal Government will need to \nadequately fund a national passenger rail network, no matter how the \nsystem is structured.\n  And that is something that has always mystified me. When it comes to \nother forms of transportation, highways and airplanes, we have given \nthem all they ask for, consistently providing full Federal backing. \nSince 1971, in fact, we have given $750 billion to highways and \naviation. In the same period of time, since the birth of Amtrak, we \nhave only given $25 billion to our national passenger rail system. \nThat's only 3 percent of all transportation funding in that period. \nThat is appalling.\n  If we want a national passenger rail system, and most Americans do, \nas all the polls indicate, then we are going to have to pay for it, and \nunderstand the long-term commitment it takes to get this kind of system \nup and running. Passenger rail in this country has never had a stable \nfunding source instead, it has been subjected to the whims and follies \nof the political process, and it has lost this battle time and time \nagain.\n  Every single industrialized country, France, Japan, Germany, \nsubsidizes a national rail system. For years, we have been living in a \nfantasy - that somehow, we can have our cake and eat it too: that we \ncould mandate Amtrak to be self-sufficient without giving it nearly \nenough money to do so. But Amtrak cannot run a national rail network, \nwithout adequate levels of Federal investment, and still be expected to \nbe commercially self-sufficient. That is just not rational.\n  There are two steps, then, in ensuring the future of passenger rail. \nShort-term, we have got to make sure that we do not allow Amtrak to go \nbankrupt, or worse, mortgage off their future in a desperate attempt to \nstay afloat. That is why, alongside many of my colleagues, I have \npushed for the full $1.2 billion appropriations amount that Amtrak has \nrequested for next year. This bare-bones minimum will give them the \nability to maintain the current state of passenger rail, nothing more, \nnothing less.\n  And in the long-term, we need a new vision for the future of national \npassenger rail so these one-time, bare-bones funding requests are no \nlonger an issue. This bill represents just such a vision. It would \ninvest seriously in the planning and implementation of high-speed rail \ncorridors, which provides the most bang for the buck and which almost \nevery State Governor, Democrat or Republican, has been clamoring for \nfor years. It would provide money for debt payments, which Amtrak has \nincurred as a direct result of Federal underfunding. It would authorize \ncapital investment funds, to begin to correct the $5.8 billion capital \nbacklog Amtrak faces today. And it would fund operating costs for the \nlong-distance trains that provide essential service to rural areas of \nthe country.\n  Moreover, it would address the serious security concerns that plague \nour rail system today. I stood up here months ago, right after one of \nthe worst events in our Nation's history. I stood up here in order to \ncall attention to what I thought, and continue to think, is a dire \nsituation. And that is this matter of rail security. The events of \nSeptember 11 dramatically and starkly revealed how essential it is that \nthe United States have a national, effective, and secure railroad \npassenger system. It also exposed how vulnerable that system is right \nnow to terrorist attacks. I have traveled through the train tunnels \nthat Amtrak uses, and let me tell you, these tunnels are just plain \nfrightening, poor ventilation, poor lighting, inadequate evacuation \nroutes.\n  This reauthorization bill would help the system deal with these \ntunnels and other gaps in our passenger rail security. A one-time \ninvestment of $1.4 billion would provide security fencing, closed \ncircuit television, tunnel rehabilitation, increased security \ninspections, essential security-related improvements. The Department of \nTransportation itself has warned several times in the last few years \nabout the necessity of quickly and fully funding Amtrak's security \nneeds. $1.4 billion is a small price to pay to avoid a repeat of \nSeptember 11.\n  Finally, this bill would bring a greater level of accountability to \nthe whole structure. As Senator Hollings indicated, the $1.55 billion \nin funds for high-speed corridor planning and implementation would be \nrun through the Department of Transportation, so that the Federal \nGovernment can work together with state and local agencies in promoting \nthe future of our rail system.\n  This bill, together with the $1.2 billion appropriations for next \nyear, will bring us closer to the type of passenger rail system that \nour Nation deserves and needs. As my good friend Senator Hollings \nalluded to, 50 years ago, our leaders had the vision and foresight to \nstand up and say, we need an interstate highway system, and we need to \nfund it appropriately. Let us today go forward with this blueprint in \nhand and create a similar network for passenger rail.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CARNAHAN:\n  S. 1993. A bill to authorize a military construction project for the \nconstruction of a Weapons of Mass Destruction Responder Training \nFacility at Fort Leonard Wood Missouri; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Madam President, I rise today to introduce important \nlegislation for homeland defense, the Weapons of Mass Destruction \nResponder Training Facility Act of 2002. America's war against \ninternational terrorism has increased the need to prepare against the \nthreat of weapons of mass destruction, known as WMDs.\n  Currently the Army's frontline of defense against WMD threats, Fort \nLeonard Wood, does not have the ability to conduct full-scale, joint \ntraining year round. This preparation gap must be closed. Our national \nsecurity depends on the ability to effectively respond to a WMD attack. \nThat is why I have introduced legislation to create a permanent \ntraining facility at Fort Leonard Wood.\n\n[[Page S1612]]\n\n  Fort Leonard Wood has no dedicated facility for training active duty \nand National Guard WMD responders. This prevents both joint training \nand the expansion of coordination among all WMD responders.\n  Last October, we in this body learned first hand the importance of a \ncoordinated response to WMD attacks. When letters, filled with anthrax, \nwere mailed to members of Congress, 50 of our colleagues in the Senate \nand their staffs were evicted from the Hart office building for over \nthree months. Experts from several agencies and departments, who never \nprepared together to respond to a WMD attack, worked to overcome \nsetbacks and difficulties to make sure the Hart building was safe \nagain. I thank them for all their hard work. But we now know that to \nprepare for future threats, those responsible for responding to WMD \nattacks must train together.\n  Constructing of a permanent facility will enable joint training and \ncooperation of WMD Civil Support Teams; Department of Defense Emergency \nResponders; Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Instillation \nSupport Teams; and Active and Reserve Component Chemical Units. The \nneed to conduct joint operations and training year round is important \nand immediate. It is vital to national security. This is why the Army \nhas placed the highest priority on building a permanent facility at \nFort Leonard Wood.\n  This legislation will compliment S. 1909, which was introduced by my \nfriend and colleague from Missouri. Senator Bond's legislation calls \nfor the establishment of a unified command for homeland defense, a post \nboth the President and the Secretary of Defense support.\n  S. 1909 will allow the Department of Defense to more effectively \nmanage homeland defense resources by centrally locating the unified \ncommand within the United States, away from a major population center \nat an Armed Forces facility already in use for WMD training.\n  Fort Leonard Wood meets all of these requirements and seems like an \nideal candidate to fulfill this new and important national security \nrole. But Fort Leonard Wood is not yet ready. While it has taken the \nlead in preparing WMD responders, there is yet another step to take. We \nmust ensure that the country is prepared for future attacks by \nestablishing a permanent training facility now.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 1994. A bill to establish a priority preference among certain \nsmall business concerns for purposes of Federal contracts, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, today I am introducing legislation to \nhelp our nation's 8(a) Business Development, BD, and HUBZone firms \ncompete more effectively in the Federal marketplace.\n  This bipartisan legislation, cosponsored by Senator Kit Bond, stems \nfrom a 1997 commitment Senator Bond and I made to each other to seek \nequality between the Small Business Administration's, SBA, 8(a)BD \nprogram and the HUBZone program.\n  Much has been made lately of the SBA's proposed rule to establish \n``parity'' or equality between these two important programs. Some in \nthe contracting community have opposed the proposed rule because they \nhave concerns about the decline in the number of contracts and contract \ndollar values being awarded to 8(a)BD firms. I share the concerns of \nthe contracting community in this regard, but I do not blame the \nHUBZone program for this decline. Rather, I blame the current \nprocurement environment.\n  In 1997, working with then-Chairman of the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness, Senator Bond, I took the necessary steps to protect the \n8(a)BD program. In my negotiations with Senator Bond, he agreed to \nchange the legislation creating the HUBZone program from one of HUBZone \npriority to one of equality between the 8(a)BD and HUBZone programs. \nFurther, we negotiated a 3 percent increase in the Federal Government's \nsmall business goal, raising it from 20 percent to 23 percent, in order \nto accommodate the HUBZone program, which when fully phased in for \nFiscal Year 2003 will have a 3 percent governmentwide goal. This \nincrease was put in place specifically to accommodate the HUBZone \nprogram and ensure that 8(a)BD firms did not lose Federal contracts to \nthe HUBZone program.\n  The fact remains, however, despite these protections, that 8(a)BD \nfirms are experiencing a decline in Federal procurement, which some \nplace as high as 34 percent since 1997. The cause of this decline has \nits roots in the new procurement environment created by the reforms in \nthe mid-1990s, such as passage of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining \nAct and the Federal Acquisition Reform Act, the regulatory changes to \nprocurement programs in response to the Adarand Inc. v. Pena decision, \nand reductions in the acquisition workforce. Because negative trends \nhit minority-owned firms first and hardest, these small businesses have \nborne a disproportionate share of the percentage decline in Federal \ncontract dollars being awarded to small businesses.\n  To help combat the negative effects of procurement reform, I have \nbeen taking a very close look at the SBA's programs to assist small \nbusinesses, especially small businesses owned by socially and \neconomically disadvantaged individuals. The legislation being \nintroduced today is the first step in halting and reversing the decline \nbrought about by procurement reform.\n  This legislation specifically addresses two critical areas of the \n8(a)BD and HUBZone programs. The first deals with the relationship \nbetween the two programs when a small business has received both an \n8(a)BD and a HUBZone certification, the second deals with the sole-\nsource threshold issue for these firms.\n  First, an important factor in my decision to support the HUBZone \nlegislation with the negotiated changes to protect the 8(a)BD program \nwas the concept known as ``super-priority'' or ``priority-preference.'' \nThe priority-preference stems from Congressional intent that firms that \nare both 8(a)BD and HUBZone certified receive a preference over a firm \nthat has a certification in only one program. In addition, the \npriority-preference was intended to allow these firms to combine the \nprice evaluation preference available to them under each program, with \nthe understanding that any offeror would still need to meet a \n``responsiveness'' test in terms of their offer. Unfortunately, the new \nrule proposed by the SBA does not include the priority-preference, and \nthe SBA has issued guidance that states that the priority-preference \nhas no statutory provision to support its creation.\n  Although I strongly disagree with the SBA's decision to end the \npriority-preference, this legislation will rectify the situation by \ncreating a statutory priority-preference for firms that have both an \n8(a)BD and a HUBZone certification. Such a provision will help combine \nthe benefits of each program and bring additional jobs and \nopportunities to underdeveloped areas. I view this provision as a win-\nwin for the 8(a)BD and HUBZone contracting communities.\n  Second, this legislation makes an important update to both the 8(a)BD \nand HUBZone programs by raising the sole-source thresholds. One of the \nmost important attributes of both of these programs is the authority \nfor small businesses to receive contracts on a sole-source basis. This \nexcellent benefit is limited, however, by a cap on the dollar amount \nfor sole-source contracts. Currently, contracts for goods and services \nare limited to $3 million, while manufacturing contracts are limited to \n$5 million. This legislation updates those limits by $1 million for \neach category--an update that has been needed for some time and that \nSenator Bond and I nearly succeeded in including in the Small Business \nReauthorization Act of 2000. By increasing the sole-source thresholds, \nthe Federal government will immediately put more contract dollars into \nthe hands of 8(a)BD and HUBZone firms.\n  As I mentioned earlier in my statement, this legislation is merely \none step in the process to help reverse the negative trends procurement \nreform has had on our nation's small businesses.\n  It is my hope that we can move this legislation through the Senate \nquickly, and I would urge all of my colleagues to lend their support.\n\n[[Page S1613]]\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to come to the \nFloor once again on another bipartisan matter with the distinguished \nchairman of the Small Business Committee. We have such a constructive \nworking relationship in the Federal procurement issue area, and I \nalways welcome the opportunity to work with the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kerry, to advance small business participation in \nGovernment contracting.\n  This bill we are introducing today will further clarify the \nrelationship between the HUBZone and 8(a) contracting programs. This \nrelationship has been a strongly debated topic lately, although we \nthought our Committee provided clear guidance on the matter in the 1997 \nHUBZone Act. In the matter before us, we are clarifying what happens \nwhen firms are eligible for both programs and become certified.\n  The original Small Business Administration regulations on the HUBZone \nprogram called for the highest contracting priority to be given to \nHUBZone 8(a) ``dual status'' firms. That is, if a firm has been \ncertified in both programs, it moves to the head of the class in \ngetting Government contracts. The HUBZone regulations said that, in a \nHUBZone set-aside, an 8(a) firm should win over non-8(a) firms. \nUnfortunately, a comparable change was not included in the 8(a) \nregulations, to give HUBZone firms a preference in 8(a) set-asides. In \na letter to SBA's Acting General Counsel last year, I asked SBA to \nresolve this inconsistency.\n  Robert Gangwere, the Acting General Counsel, stated he did not think \nSBA had the statutory authority to grant a ``superpreference'' to \nHUBZone 8(a) dual status firms. Currently, SBA has a proposed \nrulemaking in progress that deletes the ``superpreference'' language.\n  This bill would restore that. In a HUBZone set-aside (a competition \nrestricted only to firms that are HUBZone firms), an 8(a) bidder would \nhave priority over non-8(a) HUBZone bidders. A comparable change would \nbe made in the 8(a) set-aside, giving HUBZone firms priority. I think \nthis is reasonable, in that it encourages firms to take advantage of \nboth programs.\n  I do have one reservation with this bill. Both the HUBZone program \nand the Small Disadvantaged Business program, of which 8(a) is a part, \noffer a 10 percent price evaluation preference under certain \ncircumstances in full-and-open competition. The old SBA rules called \nfor HUBZone 8(a) combined firms to get a 20 percent price evaluation \npreference, combining both the HUBZone preference and the Small \nDisadvantaged Business preference. I think 20 percent is excessive.\n  One of the goals of the small business program is to try to help \nsmall firms stabilize and develop, so they can survive in a competitive \nmarketplace. Government contracts are supposed to be a means toward \nthat end. But if a firm requires a 20 percent preference to win a \ncontract, it probably has not done what it needs to do to become \nefficient and ready for the competitive marketplace. I am concerned \nthat a 20 percent preference will be an unreasonable subsidy for \ninefficient firms. If a small business bidder is not even able to get \nwithin 20 percent of the lowest bidder, it probably is not a viable \nenterprise, and subsidizing its existence is not the highest and best \nuse of taxpayer monies.\n  With that reservation, I am happy to cosponsor this measure with the \nSenator from Massachusetts. I am confident we can come to some kind of \naccommodation on the price evaluation preference, and look forward to \nworking with him to do so.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Frist, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Enzi, Ms. \n        Collins, Mr. Hagel, Mr. DeWine, and Mr. Gregg):\n  S. 1995. A bill to prohibit discrimination on the basis of genetic \ninformation with respect to health insurance and employment; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Genetic \nInformation Non-Discrimination in Health Insurance and Employment Act \nof 2002. I am joined in introducing this bill by Senators Frist, \nJeffords, Enzi, Collins, Hagel, DeWine, and Gregg.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is the culmination of several \nmonths work, though it is, in fact, the second part of an effort that \nstarted several years ago. Specifically, in April 1996, I introduced \nthe Genetic Information Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance Act, \nlegislation that was designed to protect people's genetic information \nand results of genetic testing, or requests for genetic testing, from \nbeing used against them by their health insurers. Back then, time was \non our side as the completion of the Genome was years off.\n  However, four years later, in June 2000, everything changed with the \nannouncement that the first working draft of the Human Genome was \ncompleted. And since that time, science has continued to hurry forward, \nfurther opening the door to early detection and medical intervention \nthrough the discovery and identification of specific genes linked to \ndiseases like breast cancer, Huntington's Disease, glaucoma, colon \ncancer and cystic fibrosis.\n  Unfortunately, like so many other scientific breakthroughs in \nhistory, the completion of the Genome not only brought about the \nprospect for medical advances, such as improved detection and \nintervention, but also potential harm and abuse, as the knowledge of \nindividual genetic information could be used against the very same \nperson it is invented to help.\n  Accordingly, the need for protections against genetic discrimination \nby both health insurers and employers is becoming more urgent everyday. \nIf, because of concerns about the way the information could be used, \npeople are unwilling to use the potential unlocked by the Genome \nproject to take proactive steps to protect their health and that of \ntheir loved ones, then we will never reap the true benefits of this \ndiscovery.\n  While we cannot yet prevent diseases such as breast cancer, genetic \ntesting makes it possible for carriers of these diseases to take extra \nprecautions. In fact, early detection is the best weapon we have to \ncombat many of these diseases we can now identify, and for breast \ncancer it is a critical component when one considers that almost \n192,000 women were struck by the disease last year. Technological \nadvances in screenings coupled with the ability to identify who carries \nthe gene linked to breast cancer can help us in our efforts to reduce \nthis number. The possibilities for this discovery are limited only by \nthe willingness, or unwillingness, of people to use this knowledge.\n  In 1997, a woman from Maine brought the reality of this dilemma home \nfor me when she wrote of her very real fear of the repercussions \nassociated with genetic testing. Bonnie Lee Tucker has nine women in \nher immediate family who were diagnosed with breast cancer, and she \nherself is a survivor. She wrote to me about her fear of having the \nBRCA test for breast cancer, because she worries it will ruin her \ndaughter's ability to obtain insurance in the future.\n\n  Bonnie Lee isn't the only one who has this fear. When the National \nInstitutes of Health offered women genetic testing, nearly 32 percent \nof those who were offered a test for breast cancer risk declined to \ntake it citing concerns about health insurance discrimination. What \ngood is scientific progress if it cannot be applied to those who would \nmost benefit?\n  Dr. Francis Collins, the Director of the National Human Genome \nResearch Institute, has testified before Congress about the next step \nfor those involved in the Genome project. He explained that the \nproject's scientists were engaged in a major endeavor to ``uncover the \nconnections between particular genes and particular diseases,'' to \napply the knowledge they just unlocked. In order to do this, Dr. \nCollins said, ``we need a vigorous research enterprise with the \ninvolvement of large numbers of individuals, so that we can draw more \nprecise connections between a particular spelling of a gene and a \nparticular outcome.'' However, this effort cannot be successful if \npeople are afraid of possible repercussions of their participation in \ngenetic testing.\n  The bottom line is that, given the advances in science, there are two \nseparate issues at hand. The first is to restrict discrimination by \nhealth insurers and the second to prevent employment discrimination, \nbased upon genetic information.\n\n[[Page S1614]]\n\n  With regard to health insurance, the issues are clear and familiar, \nand something the Senate has debated before, in the context of the \nconsideration of larger privacy issues. As Congress debated what is now \nthe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, we \nalso addressed the issues of privacy of medical information. And any \nlegislation that seeks to fully address these issues must consider the \ninteraction of the new protections with the newly promulgated privacy \nrule which was mandated by HIPAA, and our legislation does just that.\n  Now we must ensure that we protect genetic information, genetic \ntests, as well as information regarding a request for genetic testing, \nfrom being used by the insurer against the patient. Genetic information \nonly detects the potential for a genetically linked disease or \ndisorder, and potential does not equal a diagnosis of disease. However, \nit is critical that this information be available to doctors and other \nhealth care professionals when necessary to diagnose, or treat, an \nillness. It is the difference that we must recognize as we discuss \nlegislation to protect patients from potential discriminatory practices \nby insurers.\n  Unlike our legislative history on debating health privacy matters, \nthe issues surrounding protecting genetic information from workplace \ndiscrimination is new. And to that end, the legislation I introduce \ntoday creates these protections in the workplace. As demonstrated by \nthe Burlington Northern case, the threat of employment discrimination \nis real and therefore it is essential that we take this information off \nthe table, so to speak, before the use of this information becomes \nwidespread. While Congress has not yet debated this specific type of \nemployment discrimination, we have a great deal of employment case law \nand legislative history on which to build.\n  As we considered the need for this type of protection, we agreed that \nwe must extend current law discrimination protections to genetic \ninformation. We reviewed current employment discrimination law and \nconsidered what sort of remedies people would have for instances of \ngenetic discrimination and if these remedies would be different from \nthose available to people under current law, for instance under the ADA \nor the EEOC.\n  The bill we introduce today creates new protections by paralleling \ncurrent law. In addition it addresses changes in the law that have \noccurred since the original introduction of my bill and the other bills \non this subject. The momentum to address this issue has finally reached \na critical mass. Clearly this is an issue whose time has come.\n  It has been more than eighteen months since the completion of the \nworking draft of the Human Genome. Like a book which is never opened, \nthe wonders of the Human Genome are useless unless people are willing \nto take advantage of it.\n  It's my sincere hope that the bi-partisan legislation I introduce \ntoday is the beginning of the end of the debate in our effort to ensure \nthat every one of us is just as protected from discrimination because \nof what is in our genes as we are from our heritages, our genders and \nour impairments.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I rise once again today to speak on the \ncritical issue of genetic discrimination and to proudly join my \ncolleagues, Senators Snowe, Jeffords, Collins, Enzi, DeWine, Hagel, and \nGregg in introducing the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of \n2002.\n  The threat of genetic discrimination, both in the workplace and with \nrespect to health insurance coverage, is one of the most troublesome \nCongress faces. As our scientific knowledge has improved, the threat of \ndiscrimination has increased. As a physician, as a medical researcher, \nand ranking member of the Subcommittee on Public Health, I have a long \nand deep interest in this issue, and I believe we have a unique \nresponsibility to ensure that medical and scientific progress does not \nresult in individual harm.\n  For example, I am deeply troubled by reports of women declining \ngenetic testing out of fear that they may lose their health insurance, \neven though a genetic test might reveal that a woman is not at high \nrisk and therefore allow her to make more informed health care choices. \nWhen I first joined Senator Snowe to introduce legislation banning \ngenetic discrimination in health insurance in 1998, almost one-third of \nwomen offered a test for breast cancer risk at the National Institutes \nof Health declined, citing concerns about health insurance \ndiscrimination. If unchecked and unregulated, this fear of \ndiscrimination clearly has the potential to prevent individuals from \nparticipating in research studies or taking advantages of new genetic \ntechnologies to improve their medical care.\n  Scientific advances hold the promise of higher quality medical care, \nyet there is a pressing need for federal legislation to reassure the \npublic that learning this information will not result in a loss of \nhealth insurance coverage or in the loss of a job. I am committed to a \nbipartisan legislative solution, and have worked extensively towards \nthis goal with Senator Snowe, Jeffords, and a number of the members of \nthis Committee over the past several years. I believe that, together, \nwe have made an important step in addressing this through the Genetic \nInformation Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance Act, which has been \npassed by the Senate on three separate occasions.\n  Today, we are building on that work, and on the solid foundations \nestablished in law by the Civil Rights Act, Americans with Disabilities \nAct, and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. The \nGenetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2002 builds upon our \nprogress in the health insurance area and expands our previous \nlegislation to address the threat of employment discrimination and \nhealth insurance based on genetic information. Moreover, the bill \nincorporates the most recent scientific understandings in the field of \ngenetics research in establishing protections and defining relevant \nterms.\n  I believe that it is incumbent upon us to pass legislation this year \nthat is comprehensive, consistent, reasonable and fair. I am troubled \nby some legislative approaches that would place these new protections \noutside of the established framework of our time-tested civil rights \nlaws and that would establish separate protections against genetic \ndiscrimination than exist for other types of discrimination. The bill \ntoday meets that standard of providing strong protections that are \nconsistent with the current state of scientific knowledge, as well as \ncurrent law.\n  I commend my colleagues for their commitment to this issue. I also \ncommend President Bush for his commitment to ensuring strong \nprotections against genetic discrimination and for calling attention to \nthis critical matter. Through this important legislation, we have the \nopportunity to dispel the threat of discrimination based on an \nindividual's genetic heritage, and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to enact this legislation this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/06/senate-section/article/S1614-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 217--RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF THE HONORABLE HOWARD W. \n          CANNON, FORMERLY A SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEVADA\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Reid, and Mr. Ensign) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.
