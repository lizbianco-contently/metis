Of course, we will try to \naccommodate Senators who will be coming in and others who will be \nwanting to leave. We do plead with all Senators to give us your best \nmeasure of cooperation because we are trying to be sensitive to all \nkinds of special events, including graduation ceremonies and weddings \nand commitments of longstanding. It is not always easy to accommodate \nthem all. I know some Senators are agitated that they have already been \ninconvenienced, and for that we apologize. But I commend the leadership \non both sides of the aisle. We have said to each other, let's stay; \nlet's get this done; and we are going to do that. We will notify the \nSenators as soon as an agreement can be entered into as to the time \nsequence. We are hoping we can get something that could get to a vote \neither before noon or hopefully by 1 o'clock. That is not agreed to, by \nany means, but that is the goal we are pursuing.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/26/senate-section/article/S5768-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition this morning to \ncomment on Senator Jeffords' announcement that he will vote with the \nDemocrats on organization of the Senate. I have delayed in expressing \nthese thoughts to further reflect upon them and perhaps avoid saying \nsomething that I would later regret. I have written them down, which is \nunusual for me because I believe that floor statements, as speeches \ngenerally, are best made from the heart rather than text.\n  When I first heard last Tuesday that Senator Jeffords was considering \nthis move, I told the news media: ``It shouldn't happen--it won't \nhappen--it can't happen.'' Well, I was wrong.\n  When Senator Jeffords confirmed that he was about to vote with the \nDemocrats, I joined five other Senators who tried to dissuade him in a \nmorning meeting last Wednesday. The group reconvened for an afternoon \nmeeting, with some ten other Senators and Senator Jeffords. Between the \ntwo meetings, we conferred with the Republican leadership on what \nsuggestions we could make to Senator Jeffords to keep him in the fold.\n  For 13 years, Jim Jeffords has been one of my closest friends in the \nSenate and he still is. We have had lunch together every Wednesday for \nyears. First, with Senator John Chafee, and later with Senator Olympia \nSnowe, Senator Susan Collins, and Senator Lincoln Chafee. He had never \ngiven any hint to me of such a move.\n  Before discussing the suggestions which would be made to Senator \nJeffords, we first pleaded with him, saying his change would disrupt \nthe Senate, it would change the balance of power in the Federal \nGovernment generally, it would severely weaken the Republican Party--of \nwhich he was a lifelong member, it would hurt his Senate friends, and \nlikely cost many staffers to lose their jobs.\n  Senator Jeffords replied that he was opposed to the party's policies \non many items and believed he could do more for his principles by \norganizing with the Democrats.\n  We then told Senator Jeffords that we were authorized by the \nRepublican leadership to tell him that if he stayed, the term limits on \nhis chairmanship would be waived, he would have a seat at the \nRepublican leadership table as the moderate's representative, and IDEA, \nspecial education, would become an entitlement which would enrich that \nprogram by billions of dollars for children across America.\n  At the end of our second long meeting, I felt we had a significant \nchance to keep him. On Thursday morning, I was deeply disappointed by \nhis announcement that he would organize with the Democrats. My \nimmediate response to the news media was that it felt as if there had \nbeen a death in the family. Other Senators from our close-knit group \nwere, candidly, hurt and confused. For some, that has turned to anger. \nMost of the Republican Senate caucus has had little to say, trying to \nput the best face on what is really a devastating loss.\n  The full impact has yet to sink in. It will undoubtedly be the topic \nof much contemporaneous columnist comment and beyond that for the \nhistorians.\n  Well, the question now arises, Where do we go from here? The Senate \nleadership, notwithstanding Senator Jeffords' departure from our \ncaucus, has created a moderate seat at the leadership table to address \nsome of Senator Jeffords' concerns. More needs to be done. And I think \nmore will be done.\n  How should these issues be handled by the Senate for the future? I \nintend to propose a rule change which would preclude a future \nrecurrence of a Senator's change in parties, in midsession, organizing \nwith the opposition, to cause the upheaval which is now resulting.\n  I take second place to no one on independence voting. But, it is my \nview that the organizational vote belongs to the party which supported \nthe election of a particular Senator. I believe that is the \nexpectation. And certainly it has been a very abrupt party change, \nalthough they have occurred in the past with only minor ripples, none \nhave caused the major dislocation which this one has.\n  When I first ran in 1980, Congressman Bud Shuster sponsored a \nfundraiser for me in Altoona where Congressman Jack Kemp was the \nprincipal speaker. When some questions were raised as to my political \nphilosophy, Congressman Shuster said my most important vote would be \nthe organizational vote. From that day to this, I have believed that \nthe organizational vote belonged to the party which supported my \nelection.\n  When the Democrats urged me to switch parties some time ago, I gave \nthem a flat ``no.'' I have been asked in the last several days if I \nintended to switch parties. I have said absolutely not.\n  Senator Phil Gramm faced this issue when he decided to switch \nparties. He resigned his seat, which he had won as a Democrat, and ran \nfor reelection as a Republican. As he told me, his last vote in January \n1983 was for the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and he voted \nfor Tip O'Neill with the view that he was elected as a Democrat and \nshould vote that way on organizational control. Even though, he \nintended to become a Republican and would have preferred another person \nto be Speaker.\n  To repeat, I intend to propose a Senate rule which would preclude a \nchange in control of the Senate when a Senator decides to vote with the \nopposing party for organizational purposes.\n  One other aspect does deserve comment, and that is the issue of \npersonal benefit to a changing Senator. In our society, political \narrangements avoid the consequences of similar conduct in other \ncontexts.\n  For example, if company A induces a competitor's employee to break \nhis contract with company B and join company A, company B can collect \ndamages for company A's wrongful conduct. If A gives a benefit to an \nemployee of B to induce the employee to breach a duty, that conduct can \nhave serious consequences in other contexts which are not applied to \npolitical arrangements.\n  On the Lehrer news show on Thursday night, the day before yesterday, \nSenator Harry Reid and I sparred over this point. I expressed my \nconcern about reliable reports that Democrats had told Senator Jeffords \nthat Senator Reid would step aside so Senator Jeffords could become \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. Senator Reid \nreplied that there was no quid pro quo, an expression I had not used.\n  Accepting Senator Jeffords' decision was based on principle for the \nreasons he gave at his news conference on Thursday morning, a question \nstill remains as to whether any such inducement was offered and whether \nit played any part in Senator Jeffords' decision. Questions on such \noffers and counteroffers should be considered by Senators and by the \nSenate in an ethical context, but at this moment I do\n\n[[Page S5769]]\n\nnot see any way to effect such conduct by rulemaking or legislation.\n  This week's events raise very profound questions for the governance \nof our country as well as the operation of the Senate. I intend to \npress a rule change which would preclude a recurrence of this situation \nand will be discussing with my colleagues the whole idea of inducements \nas an incentive for a party switch.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves, I was off the \nfloor and am disappointed that the Senator saw me here and decided to \nspeak after I left the Chamber, using my name on several occasions. \nWould the Senator from Pennsylvania tell the Senator from Nevada, is he \nsaying that Senator Jeffords did something wrong in switching parties?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have been very careful in my selection of words. I \nhave not said anybody did anything wrong.\n  Mr. REID. OK.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am a little surprised to hear the Senator from Nevada \nexpressing some concern about the statement which this Senator has just \nmade. This is the floor of the U.S. Senate and these are matters of \ngrave concern for the Senate. I have spoken with great modulation on a \nsubject where a great deal more could have been said by me and by \nothers.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the Senator's statement. It seems to me that, \nno matter if it was a matter of importance or nonimportance, if I was \ngoing to speak about the Senator from Pennsylvania, I would tell the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, ``I am going to say a few words mentioning \nyour name; do you want to be on the floor?'' The Senator decided not to \ndo that. I appreciate that.\n  It is my understanding that the Senator from Vermont, prior to his \nleaving the Republican Party, was chairman of a pretty big committee, \nthe HELP Committee?\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is true. And one of the concerns which Senator \nJeffords had, as expressed to a number of us, was his term limitation.\n  But if I might respond to an earlier point by Senator Reid, I saw \nSenator Reid on the floor. He is the assistant majority leader. \nPerhaps, I might have said to Senator Reid: ``I am about to mention \nyour name.''\n  I did so really to accommodate his statement that there was no quid \npro quo. There had been a statement that there was nothing done in \nexchange for something. So that in saying that, it was not said in any \ncondemnatory, derogatory, or critical manner.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the statement of the Senator from \nPennsylvania. I am one of the biggest fans of the Senator from \nPennsylvania. I am one of the few people here, probably, who have read \nhis book from cover to cover.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That number is growing, I say to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. It takes a long time to read. I am a fast reader. That is \nthe reason I am ahead of most people. I say to my friend from \nPennsylvania, I appreciate not only what he said but how he said it. I \nam sorry if I in any way mistook the Senator's statement.\n  This is a time, as the Senator indicated, of some tenseness around \nhere. I wanted to make sure the Senator and I understood each other, \nwhich we do. I thank him very much.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I seek recognition in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first let me address the comments of the \nSenator from Pennsylvania.\n  The Nation and perhaps many parts of the Western World will be \nfocused on the comments of Senator Jeffords this week. They are \nparticularly important not because a man who was a lifelong Republican \nhas declared that he would become an Independent but because of the \nimpact of that decision on this institution and on the Government in \nWashington.\n  For people to change political parties is rare in this American \npolitical scene but not unheard of. In fact, the Senator from \nPennsylvania, on his side of the aisle, on the Republican side of the \naisle, has at least four colleagues who have done that:\n  Senator Strom Thurmond, first elected as a Democrat, Governor of \nSouth Carolina, then ran as a candidate for the U.S. Senate as a \nDemocrat and decided to change parties and become a Republican. That \nwas his decision.\n  I served with Senator Phil Gramm in the House when he was a Democrat. \nHe made the decision to change parties and stood for reelection in \nTexas as a Republican to let the people make their decision as to \nwhether or not they would validate his choice of the new party.\n  Then there is Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, once a Democrat, now \na Republican on Senator Specter's side of the aisle.\n  Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, once a Democrat, is now a \nRepublican.\n  So I find it interesting that now is the moment that the Senator from \nPennsylvania wants to suggest we have to change the rules to militate \nagainst this change of party sponsorship, when there is a change of \nparty allegiance. The difference, I think, is obvious. In the four \nprevious examples, it did not result in the change of control of the \nSenate. I think perhaps that is why more attention has been paid to \nSenator Jeffords' decision. I honor his decision. I think he is an \nhonorable man. I don't believe he made this decision lightly. I think \nhe reflected on it. He made the decision to be an Independent and to \njoin the Democrats in organizing in the Senate. I think the statement \nhe made in Burlington, VT, in front of the people he will represent was \none of the better statements I have heard in my public career. It was \nclearly a decision of conscience.\n  To suggest that there was any quid pro quo or any other reason \ndemeans the integrity of one of our colleagues whom we both respect \nvery much. So I hope we will put this in some historical perspective \nwithin this institution, where half a dozen Members have either \ncontemplated or changed political party. They have a right to serve, \nand they will ultimately answer to the people of their State about \ntheir decision.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. For a question, I am happy to yield, retaining my right \nto the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, my response is not really a question, \nalthough it can always be articulated in the form of a question which \nis our custom. The Senator from Illinois has the floor, and I \nappreciate his yielding to me. I just have a brief comment to make \nwithout any articulation of a question, if I may, reserving the \nSenator's right to the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I do not object, but I retain my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I will formulate it as a unanimous \nconsent request that I may reply very briefly, retaining the status of \nthe Senator's right to the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in what I have had to say here, I have \nsaid it as carefully as I can. I have written it all down and I read \nit. I think it may be the first speech I have ever read on the Senate \nfloor in the 20 years and 5 months I have been here. I wanted to be \nvery precise.\n  I believe Senator Jeffords is a man of the highest principle and \nintegrity. I have enormous respect for all of what he has done, \nincluding the statement made in Vermont on Thursday morning.\n  When the Senator from Illinois comments about the change in parties \nof others, what he says is true. I have said in the prepared text that \nSenator Gramm went to the unusual extent of actually resigning. Senator \nGramm told me, as I recounted, that his last vote in early 1983 was for \nthe Speaker of the House of Representatives. He voted for Congressman \nTip O'Neill. I think Senator Gramm said he was elected as a Democrat.\n  I think the examples of Senators Shelby, Campbell, Thurmond, and \nthen-Congressman Phil Gramm/now Senator Gramm are really irrelevant to \nwhat happened here. This is really a very, extraordinary matter. As the \nSenator from Illinois knows, we have had a change in the governance of \nthe Senate, and each of us can attest to how hard it is to get to the \nSenate, and then how hard it is to get party control of the Senate. \nWith that historical\n\n[[Page S5770]]\n\nelection and a 50/50 balance, any one of the Senators on either side \ncould tip the balance. Republicans had control by virtue of the Vice \nPresidency.\n\n  When Senator Jeffords made a switch for organizational purposes, he \naffected the governance of the country. The ability to set the agenda \nhere is of enormous consequence. To have the Democrat as the majority \nleader, he gets the first recognition. Then you have the President's \nagenda. Some people are glad that the President's agenda will not have \nan advocate in the Senate and the majority leader as a Republican to \nput that agenda forward. The Senate chairmanships we need not focus on \ntoo long.\n  But there were people in the Senate family who were weeping--staffers \nwho are going to lose their jobs. I said on the ``Jim Lehrer Show'' \nthat what happened was ``seismic.'' Senator Dorgan agreed with me that \nit was an ``earthquake''.\n  So in seeking a limitation on organizational change, I am not moving \nto the point to say that if a Senator wants to change parties, there \nought to be any rule against that. He can find his peace with his \nelectorate, where there may be a political price to pay or there may \nnot be. But when so many others pay a price, it is my very firm view \nthat the rule ought to be changed, and I will be submitting an \nappropriate rule shortly.\n  I thank my colleague from Illinois and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois has the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have the floor, but I would like to know \nif the Senator from Iowa would like to make a request.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. No.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will accept the statement of the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania. I understand there is change, and with change there \nis pain. I hope we can do our best to be positive and constructive as \nthe Senate leadership does change. I hope we can continue to show \nmutual respect for our colleagues, as I have great respect for the \nSenator from Pennsylvania. I think that is an important hallmark of \nthis institution, and I think we should all make an extra effort to \npreserve that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/26/senate-section/article/S5770-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5770-S5796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n ECONOMIC GROWTH AND TAX RELIEF RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2001--CONFERENCE \n                                 REPORT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     1836), to provide for reconciliation pursuant to section 104 \n     of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year \n     2002 having met, have agreed that the House recede from its \n     disagreement to the amendment of the Senate, and agree to the \n     same with an amendment, and the Senate agree to the same, \n     signed by a majority of the conferees on the part of both \n     Houses.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will proceed to the \nconsideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord (continuation) of May 25, 2001.)\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, about 15 minutes ago I was handed this \nstack of paper. It is not uncommon for us to receive bills of great \nconsequence and great moment only a few minutes before we are asked to \nvote on them. We rely on good staff work and hope they give us some \ninsight into what the legislation means.\n  This piece of legislation, of course, represents the proposed tax \nbill--457 pages. I will hazard a guess that very few Members of the \nSenate will have a chance to study it or reflect on it or even ask for \na response from others before we are asked to vote in a very few \nminutes. That is not unusual.\n  I don't want to suggest that this is an extraordinary situation, but \nit is extraordinary in this respect: What we are being asked to vote on \nin this tax bill will literally have an impact on America for 10 years, \nlong after many of us have gone from the scene. Long after this \nPresident has finished his tenure in the White House, the impact of \nthis bill will still be felt. So it is important for us to pause and \nreflect on what we are doing. We are being asked to sign onto a tax cut \nproposed by the White House, originally, and now crafted by the leaders \nin the House and the Senate, which will have a dramatic impact on the \neconomy of this country.\n  It is a tax bill which doesn't affect just next year but in fact goes \ninto effect sometimes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 years from now. Someone noted \nthat the marriage tax penalty provisions, which I believe under the new \nbill go into effect in 2009 or 2010, will go into effect after many \ncurrently married couples are no longer married; many who are \ncontemplating marriage will have been married and perhaps will no \nlonger be married. The provisions about the estate tax will go into \neffect about 10 years from now after many people who are watching this \ndebate are long gone.\n  The reason I raise this point is to try to put in some historic \nperspective the vote we are about to take this morning. I think this \ntax bill is a serious mistake. The Congress of the United States made a \ngrievous error in the early 1980s under President Reagan when we \naccepted his message--and many voted for it--that called for a massive \ntax cut. It is easy to preach the gospel of a tax cut. What could be \neasier for a politician than to go to people and say, I want to reduce \nyour taxes. There can't be anything more appealing.\n  But we have a responsibility in the Congress to reflect on what the \ntax cut means and whether or not it is the right thing to do. In the \nReagan years, when many yielded to the siren call for a tax cut, they \ncreated a deficit situation in this country which crippled our economy \nfor more than 10 years. History tells the story. With the Reagan tax \ncut and with the increase in spending on military affairs and other \nthings, America did not have enough money to meet its basic needs for \nSocial Security, Medicare, education, transportation, for the things \nwhich people expect this Government to provide in a civilized society.\n\n  As a result, we took the accumulated debt of America when President \nReagan became President and saw it explode to the point where it is \ntoday of $5.7 trillion--$5.7 trillion in national debt, a national debt \nwhich requires us to collect in taxes $1 billion a day across America \nsimply to pay the interest. That was a serious mistake. The bill we are \nconsidering today, unfortunately, could jeopardize our future just as \nmuch.\n  This morning's Washington Post gave us information about the \nproductivity over the last several months in America. The projected \nproductivity we hoped for did not occur. In this time of slowdown, in \nthis time bordering on recession, we have seen our economic activity \nand growth reduced in America.\n  Many people who only 8 or 10 months ago were sure we were in \nprosperity and expansion were proven wrong. It was only 8 or 10 months \nago when Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, who is \nviewed as the wisest man in all of Christendom when it comes to our \neconomy, guessed wrong. He was raising interest rates because he was \nafraid of inflation. Now Alan Greenspan is struggling and running as \nfast as he can to reduce interest rates. He was wrong.\n  This bill on which we will be voting is based on the best guess of \nthe economists for President Bush that we will have continued \nprosperity for the next 10 years--10 years. There is no economist who \nwould wage their reputation on where we will be 10 months from now, let \nalone 10 years. It is based on pure speculation about anticipated \nsurpluses, and that is a significant shortfall in the logic behind this \ntax cut.\n  It is important we have a tax cut, but we should go carefully to make \ncertain we do not go out too far or too big and jeopardize our economy. \nThat is what is at stake.\n  Most Americans will tell you: A tax cut is important to me; even more \nimportant to me is what is going to happen to the economy, how will my \nfamily do in just the next few years, how will small businesses do.\n  We have seen an unparalleled period of economic prosperity over the \nlast 8 or 9 years: 22 million new jobs in America, a recordbreaking \nnumber of small businesses created, record home ownership, the lowest \ninflation in decades,\n\n[[Page S5771]]\n\nwelfare rolls coming down, crime rolls coming down, a clear indication \nwe were on the right track. This bill puts it all at risk. This bill \nsays we will give a tax cut to some in America and hope we are right \nthat the money will be there over the next 10 years.\n  I will give some illustration of what this bill does. The Senate tax \nbill gave 35 percent of all of the tax cut benefits to the top 1 \npercent of taxpayers. What does that mean? A $44,000 tax break for \npeople with incomes above $373,000 a year. I do not believe that was \nresponsible. Quite honestly, if there is to be a tax cut, it should be \na tax cut for all Americans, not heaped on the wealthiest in this \ncountry. But hold on. The new bill, this product of a conference \nreport, does not make this tax cut any fairer.\n  Under the conference agreement, the average tax cut for these same \npeople making over $373,000 a year has increased by 23 percent. Instead \nof a $44,000 tax windfall for the highest 1 percent of taxpayers in \nAmerica, it is now a $54,000 tax windfall for those with incomes in \nexcess of $373,000.\n  Some come to the floor and say: Wait a minute, the top 1 percent of \ntaxpayers pay the most taxes; shouldn't they get the most when it comes \nto tax cuts. Those in the top 1 percent pay about 22 percent of Federal \ntaxes. The Senate bill gives them 35 percent of the benefits of this \ntax cut. This conference agreement raised that share to 38 percent. \nThey paid 22 percent of the taxes; they receive 38 percent of the \nbenefits. There is no fairness here.\n  I suggest that sending a $300 check to a taxpayer sometime this year \nas an indication of good will with this tax cut is cold comfort when \none considers the wealthiest in this country will receive $54,000 a \nyear in tax benefits under this proposal we are considering.\n  Quite honestly, we should have a tax cut, but one that is fair. This \nis not fair.\n  I also reflect on the fact that this tax cut does nothing to protect \nfunding for Social Security and Medicare. The Senator from North \nDakota, Mr. Conrad, is in the Chamber. He will speak in a moment. He \nhas said to us repeatedly that in 10 years the baby boomers will show \nup for Social Security and Medicare. When they show up, we had better \nbe prepared. We promised them those programs would be ready and funded, \nbut there is absolutely no way to fund this tax bill without raiding \nthe Social Security trust fund, as well as Medicare benefits. That is \ntotally irresponsible. For us to offer $300 checks to people today and \nrun the risk that 10 years from now, when they show up for Social \nSecurity or Medicare, it will not be adequately funded is totally \nirresponsible. This bill raids Social Security and Medicare, and for \nthat reason alone it should be defeated.\n  The final point I will make is this. This bill eliminates our ability \nto make necessary investments in the future of this country, the most \nimportant being education. All the speeches that have been given about \nbipartisan commitment to funding new education programs really \ndisappear in a heartbeat when we vote to pass a tax cut which takes \naway the money that is absolutely essential for us to make sure that \nour kids in the 21st century are well prepared to lead the world.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to oppose this bill, to vote for a \ntax cut for American families that is fair, one that does not go too \nfar and jeopardize our economy, Social Security, or Medicare.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. Senator Schumer and Senator Gregg \nare seeking recognition.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, finally, finally, the American people are \ngoing to get some of their money back. The American people have been \npaying more money into the Federal Government than we need to operate \nthe Government.\n  Over the next 10 years, it is projected they are going to pay $5.6 \ntrillion into the Federal Government that we do not need. But the other \nside of the aisle does not want to give any of that money back. They do \nnot want to let the American taxpayers keep some of their hard-earned \nmoney. No, they want to spend it. They have programs; they have ideas; \nthey have initiatives; they have things on which they have to spend \nmoney.\n  There are a lot of good things to spend money on as a government, but \none of the best things we can spend money on as a government is the \ntaxpayers, by allowing the taxpayers to keep some of their hard-earned \nincome so they can make decisions with their dollars, so they can make \nthe decisions as to whether or not they want to buy a new car, spend \nmore money on their children's education, improve their home, or save \ntheir money.\n  It is about time we return to the American people some of this \nsurplus.\n  I congratulate the President; I congratulate the chairman of this \ncommittee; I congratulate the ranking member of the committee, the \nSenator from Montana, who will soon be the chairman of the \ncommittee for pulling forward a bill which is to some extent \nbipartisan--although, obviously, not a majority on the other side \nsupport it--which returns to the American taxpayers their hard-earned \nincome. Hallelujah, it is about time.\n\n  Let's look at what this tax bill does. For people in the lowest \nrates, they get the highest percentage cut, from 15 percent down to 10 \npercent. For people who don't even pay taxes today but have families \nand have issues with raising their children, they are going to receive \na direct payment. Not an income tax refund, because they are not paying \nincome taxes, but a direct payment to assist them in raising their \nchildren, a child tax credit.\n  This is a bill which is directed at the middle-class Americans--\nAmericans who are working hard every day to make ends meet, some of \nthem in a low enough tax bracket so they don't pay taxes but still they \nneed assistance; Americans who know the dollars they are sending to the \nFederal Government, to some extent, are not needed down here anymore. \nThey are not needed in Washington because Washington has this huge \nsurplus. They are needed at home. Americans across this country need \nthose dollars to manage their family budgets better.\n  The representation was made on the other side of the aisle that we \nhave this huge debt and we need to pay this debt off. Every projection \nwe have says this debt will be paid off by, at a minimum, the year \n2011. The public debt of the Federal Government will be zero by the \nyear 2011 and will probably be zero long before then. We will pay down \nmore debt faster than at any time in this country's history while still \ncutting these taxes. Why? Because the surplus is so large. So this debt \nargument is a red herring.\n  The argument has been made on the other side that we are not \nprotecting Social Security with these funds. That is totally \ninaccurate. The fact is, the Social Security trust fund is running a \n$2.5 trillion surplus over this period. Not only can you protect the \nSocial Security trust fund--and it is protected under this proposal--\nbut we are actually going to be in a position, as a result of those \nsurpluses in the trust fund to, I hope later down the road, allow \nAmerican citizens who are paying Social Security taxes to save those \ntaxes and actually own the assets which they have in the Social \nSecurity trust fund through some sort of personal or individual savings \naccount.\n  The Social Security system is in a very healthy situation. It is \ngetting stronger for the next few years. Regrettably, in the outyears, \nit has serious problems which need to be addressed. But this tax bill \ndoes not in any way negatively impact the surplus of the Social \nSecurity trust fund, nor does it impact the surplus of the Medicare \ntrust fund.\n  First off, there is not a surplus in the Medicare trust fund; there \nis only a surplus in Part A. Part B is running at a deficit. If they \nmerge the two, they run a deficit overall. The fact is, money is in \nthis account; it is there for the purposes of Medicare, and we are \ntalking about a significant increase in Medicare funding so we can fund \nthe prescription drug benefit.\n  After we have done this--paid down the debt, protected the Social \nSecurity and Medicare trust funds, after we put in place preserving \nfunds for prescription drugs--we still have a surplus at the Federal \nGovernment level because we are running so much more in revenues than \nwe are in expenditures.\n  What do some of my colleague on the other side of the aisle say? They \ndo not\n\n[[Page S5772]]\n\nwant to return the dollars to the American taxpayer but spend it and \ncreate more programs.\n\n  This is not a debate as to whether or not the money is available. It \nis a debate about what we should do with the money. The President has \nset the correct course. He has said, when the Federal Government takes \nin more money than it needs to operate, after it has committed to \nprotecting Social Security, Medicare, and paying down the debt \ncompletely, then those dollars should be returned to the American \ntaxpayer because it is their money, not our money. That is the \ndifference. We understand it is the taxpayers' money; it is not \nWashington's money.\n  I congratulate the leadership of this committee in putting forward a \nbalanced, fair, and appropriate bill, one which will give much needed \nrelief to the taxpayers of this country who for too long have been \nasked to pay too much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo.). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my friend, the soon-to-be chairman of the \nCommittee on Finance, for yielding and for the work he has done.\n  At the outset, let me say I will oppose this conference report out of \nstrength of conviction. There are some good things in it. I think the \nchild tax credit is good. I think tax relief, particularly for middle-\nclass people, is good. I am particularly proud of the tuition \ndeductibility. While I have wished it would go further, there is $5,000 \nof tuition relief, tuition deductibility. It is aimed at middle-class \nfamilies.\n  For far too long we have ignored middle-class families, not only in \ntax relief but in the biggest financial nut they face--if God gives \nthem good health--and that is paying for tuition for the kids. To have \nthat in there is really important.\n  I salute the leaders of the bill. I will vote against it but with a \nlittle bit of sadness because that provision is in the bill, something \nfor which I have worked long and hard. I salute my colleague from New \nJersey, Mr. Torricelli, for working hard to get it included, as well. I \nthank him for that, as well as the other Senators who pushed hard for \nthat legislation.\n  I am opposing this bill for five reasons. First, it is filled with \ngimmicks. This is not tax policy--put a provision in, sunset it; put \nanother provision in, sunset it. The most laughable provision is the \nestate tax. Under this new proposal that has come back to us, the only \nyear in which you can die and have your estate free from tax is 2010. \nIf you die in 2009, you pay an estate tax. If you die in 2011, you pay \nan estate tax. All those who are so strongly for repeal of this ought \nto hope that, if God is going to take them, he takes them only in 2010, \nbecause that is the only year that the estate tax is repealed. What \nkind of policy is that?\n\n  In my city of New York, we have hundreds, probably thousands, of \nlawyers who are busy planning estates. Boy, are they going to be happy \nbecause they will have to plan estates aimed at an estate tax bill that \ngoes up, that goes down, that goes up, that goes down. We do the same \nfor many other provisions. The bill is filled with gimmicks. It is not \ntax policy. It is politics--to have to reach $1.35 trillion, no more, \nno less.\n  The writers of this bill tied themselves in a knot like a pretzel. We \ncannot have a policy, even for tuition, that expires in 2006. We cannot \nhave a policy that tells American parents, you might have your tuition \ndeductible in 2005 or 2006 but not 2007.\n  Second, the relief is disproportionate for well-to-do people. I do \nnot believe in class warfare. I think people who work hard and earn \nmoney should, indeed, get relief. I voted for a capital gains cut \nbecause I would like to see the encouragement to channel that money \ninto job creation, build a new business, invest in equity, invest in a \nbond.\n  I hear on the other side we are talking about working families. I \nlisten to the speeches; I listen to the speeches in the House. Tell the \ntruth: Working families get small relief. The most well-to-do in \nAmerica get large relief.\n  It is said they pay the taxes. Yes, they pay more of the income \ntaxes, but if you add in payroll taxes, if you add in sales taxes, the \npeople making $50,000 pay about the same percentage of taxes as the \npeople making $500,000. So why is the relief so disproportionately \ndirected at the high end?\n  This bill is befuddling and confounding in that way. Let us assume \nyou believe Government has too much money. Let us assume and believe \nyou think we should send it back. Why do we send so much of it back to \nthe highest end when, if you look at their total Federal tax bill, it \nis working people who pay as high a proportion as high-end people. We \nare not even doing it in a way to encourage investment and savings. \nThat is the second reason I am against the bill.\n  Third, needed programs. Perhaps the greatest hypocrisy in this budget \nwe have passed is this: Our President says he is the education \nPresident as he is going around the country. When the good Senator from \nVermont became an Independent, he said: That is not true. I am fighting \nfor education. Yet his budget has no money for education.\n  The President last week gave an energy speech and he, again, cut all \ntax credits for energy.\n  I yield my time because I know we have important business to do. I \nask when we resume business I could be given 3 minutes to finish up my \nspeech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered. The Senator from New York will reserve 3 \nminutes when the time comes. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the time between \nnow and when we vote be divided for debate as follows: Mr. Baucus, 5 \nminutes; Mr. Kennedy, 5 minutes; Mr. Dodd, 5 minutes; Mr. Conrad, 10 \nminutes; Mr. Grassley, 5 minutes.\n  I further ask consent that at the expiration of this time the Senate \nproceed to a vote on the adoption of the conference report with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CORZINE. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has the floor. The \nSenator from New Jersey cannot suggest the absence of a quorum. He may \nstate his objection.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I withdraw the objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will yield myself a very short period of \ntime because there is a Senator who very desperately needs to vote \nquickly and get home. In deference to him, I will speak briefly.\n  The British statesman Benjamin Disraeli said that, ``in politics, a \nweek is a long time.''\n  The past week or so is a good example.\n  On the tax bill, we have gone from a handshake deal, through a day-\nlong markup in the Finance Committee, through 43 votes on the Senate \nfloor, and then through a brief but difficult conference that, more \nthan once, veered close to a breakdown.\n  It is almost always difficult to reconcile two different bills in \nconference. That was the case here. The stakes were high, time was \nshort, and some of the differences were profound.\n  But I am delighted to join our chairman, Senator Grassley, in \nannouncing that we have a conference agreement that embodies a solid, \nbalanced, bipartisan compromise.\n  Let me describe the key elements of the compromise.\n  The centerpiece of the Senate bill was the immediate creation of a 10 \npercent rate, to cover the first $12,000 of taxable income. This \nbenefits low and middle income taxpayers the most.\n  And it provides a boost to the economy.\n  The conference report adopts this provision lock, stock, and barrel.\n  Another key element of the Senate bill was the set of provisions \ngeared to low and middle income families. Here, again, we did well.\n\n[[Page S5773]]\n\n  The conference report expands, and simplifies, the earned income tax \ncredit. And it incorporates the Senate proposal to make the child \ncredit refundable.\n  Putting the 10-percent rate, the EITC, and the child credit \nprovisions together, we have, to my mind, written one of the best tax \nbills ever for middle income working families.\n  That's an accomplishment we all can be proud of.\n  On top of that, the Senate bill included new incentives for \nretirement savings and for education, and the conference report \nincludes a large measure of each.\n  Let me step back for a minute, and describe why, to my mind, this \nbill represents a balanced package.\n  In the first place, everybody who pays income taxes will get a tax \ncut. The government has a surplus. We can afford to give some of it \nback. That's good news, not bad.\n  The President deserves credit for making this point.\n  But his proposal fell short, in one critical respect.\n  The President's proposal was aimed primarily at society's winners. \nPeople in the top tax brackets. People with large estates.\n  We should not begrudge these people their success.\n  But, at the same time, we should not stop there. In writing a bill of \nthis scope, we have an unique opportunity to reach out. To lend a hand, \nand give an incentive, to families that are working hard, raising kids, \nand dreaming dreams.\n  The Senate bill did that. And so does this conference report.\n  As I have explained, we cut taxes for working families.\n  We create new incentives for education, like the new deduction for \ncollege tuition.\n  We create new incentives to save for retirement, through IRAs, \n401(k)s, and the new low income matching program.\n  These are important provisions that create new opportunities.\n  And there is more. For example, thanks to Senator Landrieu, we expand \nthe tax credit for adoption.\n  Thanks to Senator Kohl, we create a new tax credit to encourage \nemployers to provide child care for their employees.\n  All told, the conference report contains dozens of positive \nprovisions.\n  Does the conference report have flaws? Sure.\n  As the debate has gone on, I have taken heed of the warnings of \nSenator Conrad, who fears that the tax cut may use up too much of the \nsurplus.\n  I hope he's wrong. But I agree that we must watch the budget closely, \nand make corrections if necessary.\n  There are other flaws. For example, I don't think we should have cut \nthe top rates so steeply. I don't think we should completely repeal the \nestate tax. I wish we could have made the R tax credit permanent.\n  But, putting all of the provisions together, I believe that this is a \ngood compromise that deserves broad bipartisan support.\n  At this point, let me say a few things about the bill's impact on my \nstate of Montana.\n  From the very beginning, the impact of the tax cut on Montana has \nbeen something of a paradox.\n  On one hand, Montanans are rugged individualists. We do not like \nregulations and we do not like taxes.\n  On the other hand, Montana's economy is hurting. Incomes are low. A \ntax cut like the one proposed by the President, that was aimed \nprimarily at high-income folks would not help us very much.\n  In fact, under the President's proposal, Montana would have received \nless of a tax cut, per capita, than any other state in the nation.\n  Fortunately, the conference committee has produced a bill that, for \nMontana, improves dramatically on the President's proposal.\n  We cut taxes, across the board. But we pay special attention to \nworking families.\n  As a result, the conference report will give Montanans a tax cut that \nis, on average, 15 percent higher than under the President's proposal.\n  And we will cover almost 70,000 more Montana children, under the \nchild credit, than the President's proposal--70,000.\n  Just as important, the conference report retains key incentives for \neducation, which is at the very heart of our work to generate new jobs \nfor the new economy.\n  And it creates new incentives to help small businesses set money \naside for their employees retirement.\n  These incentives will help with the most important task in Montana, \neconomic development.\n  All in all, you might say that this is a tax cut that was made in \nMontana.\n  Pulling it all together, this bill is good for working families. It \nis good for education. It is good for the economy. It is good for \nMontana.\n  This legislation is good for the country, it is good for America. It \nis much better than the legislation we would otherwise have before us.\n  I worked with Senator Grassley, the chairman of the committee, to \nproduce a Finance Committee bill which has provisions that are much \nbetter from a Democrat's perspective than we would otherwise be faced \nwith on the floor. I worked with Chairman Thomas, chairman of the House \nWays and Means Committee, and produced a conference report that is much \nbetter than what we would otherwise be voting on on the Senate floor \nfrom the point of view of most Democrats. This is a much better bill.\n  This conference report is much less backloaded--less backloaded by a \nthird compared with the House-passed bill. It is, in terms of the \nfrontloading/backloading, the same as the Finance Committee-passed \nbill.\n  It retains the child credit refundability provisions so important to \nso many people, particularly the children in our country who otherwise \ndo not get benefits. This proposal was championed by Senator Snowe, \nSenator John Kerry, and many others. We are proud to have that \nprovision in the bill.\n  It also very much helps the distribution of this bill toward middle- \nand low-income Americans. Every American gets a tax cut from this bill. \nThe most wealthy get a greater tax cut because they pay the most taxes. \nBut I might say middle-income Americans also get a very significant tax \ncut. In fact, they receive proportionately more than current law. The \nonly exceptions to this proportionality are the estate tax provisions \nand, of course, many Senators favor those estate tax provisions whether \nthey oppose the rest of the bill or not.\n  All in all, this is a bill which is fair. Its provisions are for the \ncountry.\n  In the education section, for example, Senator Torricelli's provision \nis excellent. Senator Mary Landrieu's adoption tax credit is an \nexcellent provision as well. The pension provisions, which are very \nimportant to both sides, are in this bill. There is modest--not much \nbut a modest alternative minimum tax cut provision. We, obviously, have \nto address that situation, and we will in the future.\n  The conferees worked off the Senate bill, not the House bill. This \nexplains why we have all the provisions in the Senate bill that were \nnot in the House bill.\n  On upper rates, we moved about halfway toward the House, but, \nfrankly, the House moved more than halfway toward the Senate on upper \nrates. We create a 10-percent bracket retroactive to the first of this \nyear.\n  One final point I would like to make. Some may complain that this \nbill is more expensive than the $1.35 trillion allowed in the budget \nresolution. Their complaint is that the bill sunsets at the end of 2010 \nrather than September 30, 2011.\n  A point of order would lie against this conference report had we not \nmoved the sunset date. As it is before us, all of the tax provisions in \nthis bill terminate in 10 years, which means any estimates of cost over \nthe subsequent 10 years are meaningless. There is no cost from this \nbill beyond 2011 because of the sunset. The change in the sunset date \nwas necessary because of Senate rules. It also helped us make sure we \nhave the provisions that we care about: education, child tax credit \nrefundability, 10 percent rate; widening the bracket of 15 percent, and \nothers.\n  I see my time is expiring. I urge Senators to remember, perfection \nshould not be the enemy of the good. Nothing is perfect, even this \nbill, but it is a good bill.\n  I yield to whomever next seeks time.\n\n[[Page S5774]]\n\n                  CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET ACT COMPLIANCE\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, pursuant to section 313(c) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I submit for the Record a list of \nmaterial in the conference agreement on H.R. 1836 considered to be \nextraneous under subsections (b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B), and (b)(1)(E) of \nsection 313. The inclusion or exclusion of material on the following \nlist does not constitute a determination of extraneousness by the \nPresiding Officer of the Senate.\n  To the best of my knowledge, H.R. 1836, the Economic Growth and Tax \nRelief Reconciliation Act of 2001, contains no material considered to \nbe extraneous under subsections (b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B), and (b)(1)(E) of \nsection 313 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n\n\n  submitting changes to committee allocations, functional levels, and \n                          budgetary aggregates\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, section 310(c)(2) of the Congressional \nBudget Act, as amended, provides the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee with authority to revise committee allocations, functional \nlevels, and budgetary aggregates for a reconciliation conference report \nwhich fulfills an instruction with respect to both outlays and \nrevenues. The chairman's authority under 310(c) may be exercised if the \nfollowing conditions have been satisfied:\n  1. The conferees report a bill which changes the mix of the \ninstructed revenue and outlay changes by not more than 20 percent of \nthe sum of the components of the instruction, and,\n  2. The conference agreement still complies with the overall \nreconciliation instruction.\n  I find that the conference report on H.R. 1836 satisfies the two \nconditions above and pursuant to my authority under section 310(c), I \nhereby submit revisions to H. Con. Res. 83, the 2002 budget resolution. \nThe attached tables show the current 2002 budget resolution figures as \nwell as the revised committee allocations, functional levels, and \nbudgetary aggregates.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5775]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS26MY01.001\n\n\n\n[[Page S5776]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS26MY01.002\n\n\n\n[[Page S5777]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS26MY01.003\n\n\n\n[[Page S5778]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS26MY01.004\n\n\n\n[[Page S5779]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS26MY01.005\n\n\n\n[[Page S5780]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS26MY01.006\n\n\n\n[[Page S5781]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS26MY01.007\n\n\n\n[[Page S5782]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS26MY01.008\n\n\n\n[[Page S5783]]\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I support efforts to provide hard-\nworking Washingtonians and all Americans with tax relief such as \neliminating the marriage penalty, making college tuition tax \ndeductible, providing estate tax relief, and assisting workers in \nsaving for their retirement.\n  That's why I voted for the amendment offered by Senator Daschle that \nwould have provided roughly $900 billion in tax relief, including \nimmediate $300 refund checks for all American taxpayers, given all \nincome taxpayers a tax cut by creating a new ten percent income tax \nbracket, provided marriage penalty relief right away, as opposed to \nyears from now as in the conference report, wiped out the estate tax \nfor the vast majority of taxable estates, established a permanent \nresearch and development tax credit to stimulate research and \ninnovation, provided a deduction for college tuition, enhanced \nincentives for retirement savings, and created a package of energy \nconservation and efficiency tax incentives, among other important \nprovisions. This amendment also made sure that Social Security and \nMedicare are protected and reserved sufficient funds to enact a \nMedicare prescription drug benefit.\n  Unfortunately, that amendment failed and instead the Senate today \nconsidered, and passed, a $1.5 trillion tax cut. When you take away all \nthe gimmicks, some estimate $1.9 trillion. This cost explodes to over \n$2 trillion when you add interest costs and exceeds $4.3 trillion in \nits second ten years. I believe that the bill we have passed today is \nshort-sighted and fiscally irresponsible. Comprehensive tax relief must \nbe measured against the need to maintain fiscal discipline, and \nstimulate economic growth through continued federal investment in \neducation and job training, as well as giving relief to citizens in \ntimes of surplus. The conference report passed today fails this test.\n  The tax cut is based on the promise of budget projections for the \nnext ten years--projections that are notoriously inaccurate. Ten years \nis just about the worst planning horizon possible--too long for \naccuracy, too short for completeness. Moreover, these tax cuts are \npremised on a surplus that may or may not appear. Budget projections \nare notoriously inaccurate and, therefore, highly likely to be wrong, \nespecially when projected out ten years. Indeed, the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office says its surplus estimate for 2001 could be \noff in one direction or the other by $52 billion. By 2006, this figure \ncould be off by $412 billion. It is very likely that we will only be \nable to afford this tax cut by raiding the Social Security and Medicare \ntrust funds.\n  We need to invest in our nation's economic future by making a \ncommitment to research and development to maintain our status as a \nglobal leader. Even though the Senate included a permanent extension of \nthe research and development tax credit in its version of the bill, \nthat provision was dropped in conference. That was a mistake. We need \nto do more, not less, in these times of economic uncertainty to \nstimulate investment and spur our economy forward.\n  The country is at a critical juncture in setting our fiscal \npriorities: our choices are maintaining our fiscal discipline and \ninvesting in the nation's future education and health care needs, or \ncutting the very services used daily by our citizens. I am afraid that \ntoday we have gone down the wrong path. Our approach should be more \nbalanced. We should provide tax relief to all Americans but retain our \nability to invest in our citizens education and pay down the debt. This \nwill best help continue and enhance our long-term economic strength.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the \nconference report to H.R. 1836, the reconciliation tax legislation. I \nstrongly support paying down our national debt. I support fair tax \ncuts, marriage penalty relief, and estate tax repeal. I voted for a \nsubstitute for a $900 billion tax cut, and another substitute which \nprovided for a $1.2 trillion tax cut.\n  But this bill does not meet my criteria that the Social Security and \nMedicare trust funds will not be touched now or in the future. Because \nof the fiscally irresponsible way the bill was drafted, with gimmicks \nlike changing the beginning and ending dates of key tax provisions, \nthis bill is flawed public policy that will in fact cost our country \nmuch more than the $1.35 trillion allowed by the budget resolution.\n  As a fiscal conservative, I cannot in conscience, nor in substance, \nvote for this bill. This legislation is the height of fiscal \nirresponsibility.\n  In order to make the tax cut fit into the limits of $1.35 trillion \nover 10 years imposed by the budget resolution, this bill suspends the \ntax cuts in the ninth year, reverting to the status quo of current law \nwith no tax cuts in the tenth year. This is fiscal deception at its \nworst.\n  If the tax cut is extended in the tenth year by future Congresses, as \nexpected, the cost then becomes $1.53 trillion over 10 years, which \nbreaks the budget agreement, and therefore, throws us into fiscal \nchaos.\n  This legislation greatly increases the likelihood that the Federal \nGovernment will use up all of the projected surplus and there will not \nbe any left over to pay down the national debt without raiding the \nMedicare and Social Security trust funds. That would be tragic.\n  And if there are additional investments needed over the next decade, \nas there certainly will be, such as for education, the environment, \nhealth care, and national defense, then the federal budget will be \nwritten in the red ink of deficit spending.\n  In other words, we would be spending more than we have coming in, and \ntherefore, increasing the national debt.\n  I will not take such a risky course with our economy, and I must \nexpress myself in the strongest possible terms.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this \nconference report.\n  I have been in the Senate for 143 days, and I have felt honored to \nserve with senators from both sides of the aisle. Today, however, we \nvote on a conference report that fails the tests of intellectual \nhonesty, fairness, and fiscal responsibility.\n  The conference report is not intellectually honest. It cynically \nincludes a variety of provisions designed to hide its true costs. Some \nprovisions are not effective for several years. Some are sunsetted \nafter a few years. And all are eliminated after 9 years. In addition, \nthe conference report fails to extend the research and development tax \ncredit, it fails to extend many of the other expiring provisions that \nwe know will be extended, and it fails to provide relief from the \nalternative minimum tax that we all know will be necessary. These are \nnothing more than deceptive inventions to shoehorn tax provisions that \nfar exceed $1.35 trillion, the limit agreed to in the in the budget \nresolution. These deceptions are intended to divert the American people \nfrom the real costs of the legislation. Ultimately, they will only \nreinforce the public's cynicism about politics.\n  The conference report also is fundamentally unfair. It would provide \ntax benefits averaging more than $50,000 for the top one percent, whose \naverage incomes well exceed one million dollars. Meanwhile, the \noverwhelming majority of ordinary taxpayers, 72 million of whom are in \nthe 15 percent tax bracket, will receive no marginal rate relief at \nall. That is not fair, and it is not right.\n  As a matter of fairness, how can the top one percent of taxpayers, \nwho pay 22 percent of federal taxes, receive 38 percent of this \nlegislation's benefits? Where is the tax relief for those working \nAmericans who carry the heavy burden of payroll taxes, sales taxes and \nproperty taxes?\n  Finally, Mr. President, this conference report is fiscally \nirresponsible. In fact, this tax bill returns America to a dangerous \nformula for fiscal affairs which runs the risk of promoting financial \ninstability as this legislation unfolds. We surely jeopardize the \nfinancial stability of Social Security and Medicare by limiting federal \nrevenues which could be used to shore them up for the impending \nretirement of the baby boomers, and to provide a prescription drug \nbenefit for seniors today.\n  But maybe the most important financial consideration is the 180 \ndegree turn from our recent commitment to fiscal responsibility and the \nreduction of our public debt. The return to fiscal irresponsibility in \nthe 1990's led to the\n\n[[Page S5784]]\n\ngreatest expansion we have enjoyed since World War Two. We have \nexperienced thriving entrepreneurship and productivity gains. 22 \nmillion jobs have been created. Two million businesses were \nestablished. And we have enjoyed the longest period of low inflation in \ndecades. All of this is now at risk.\n  Once global financial markets--currency, debt, and equity--begin to \nfully understand the long-term implications for fiscal discipline, I \nfear in the intermediate or long-term we will have instability in these \nmarkets. That instability potentially will limit investment due to \nrising interest rates, a depreciating dollar and lower equity \nvaluations. It may take some time for the full impact of this tax \npackage's implications to be understood, but I believe the analysis \nwill come and the problems will occur.\n  We all support a legitimately sized and directed tax cut. It is \nunfortunate that we have chosen this tax cut, which limits our ability \nto secure Social Security and Medicare for the long-term, which will \nmake it impossible to pay off our national debt, and limit our ability \nto deal with important domestic and defense priorities we all say we \nsupport.\n  I hope that my colleagues will reflect on the concerns I have \noutlined with respect to intellectual honesty, fairness and financial \nstability, and vote no on the conference report.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Conference Report \nfor H.R. 1836, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of \n2001.\n  I commend the leadership and hard work of the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Finance Committee, as well as the many colleagues who \nhave actively helped shape this bill. This bill is a true \naccomplishment, and a truly bipartisan one at that.\n  As an adoptive parent, myself, I especially want to comment on one \nsection: Section 202, for the extension, expansion, and improvement of \nthe adoption tax credit and adoption assistance programs.\n  I am happy to note that this section is virtually identical to the \nSenate floor amendment proposed by the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. \nLandrieu, and myself. This is a perfect example of a bipartisan effort \nthat will accomplish much good for so many people in need.\n  The adoption provisions include the following:\n  Extending the regular adoption tax credit, and the exclusion from \nincome for adoption assistance programs, making them permanent, like \nthe currently-permanent special needs adoption tax credit; Increasing \nboth the tax credit and the income exclusion to $10,000; For families \nadopting special needs children, de-linking the special needs credit \nfrom cumbersome and inflexible IRS regulations that currently exclude a \nwide range of legitimate adoption expenses related to these children; \nProtecting the benefit of the adoption tax credit by allowing the \ncredit against the alternative minimum tax, permanently; and Making \nboth the adoption credit and exclusion for assistance available to more \nfamilies--and more children needing adoption--by lifting the cap on \nincome eligibility to $150,000.\n  It is not possible to overstate the importance of these provision to \nthe many families and many children who have hoped to build an adoptive \nfamily, but have found so many barriers to doing so. In agreeing to \ninclude these provisions in this conference report, the Congress has \ntaken a giant pro-adoption and pro-family step forward. More children \nwill have loving and permanent homes. I thank my colleagues for that.\n  Overall, this bill signals a great day in America. The Congress has \ndelivered the tax relief the American people voted for when they put \nGeorge Bush in the White House, and elected this Congress.\n  There has never been a more important time to reduce the tax burden--\nright now Americans are more heavily taxed than at any time in history \nand pay more in taxes than they spend on food, clothing, and housing \ncombined.\n  This tax relief agreed upon today is a quality example of how \nRepublicans and Democrats can work together to get the job done for the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  This bill means relief for every American who pays taxes. Compared \nwith their current tax burdens, this bill provides the most relief to \nmodest--and middle-income families. It is good for small businesses and \njobs, and it will help jump-start the economy at a critical time. This \nbill means hardworking Americans and their families will have a little \nmore freedom, and the Federal Government a little less control over \ntheir lives.\n  I commend my colleagues for passing this bill, and I applaud our \nPresident for having the vision and tenacity to initiate this tax \nrelief and see it through to becoming law.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nreconciliation conference report currently pending before the Senate.\n  I do so for a simply reason: I strongly believe that when the \nGovernment is in position to be able to return money to the American \ntaxpayers, we should.\n  Likewise, I believe that when times are tough the Government has an \nobligation to consider increasing taxes to meet the need of the Nation. \nThis is what we did in 1993, when I first came to the Senate and we \nwere facing mounting deficits and an increasing national debt.\n  And today, thanks to those hard choices, the budget is in balance and \nwe have surplus projections for the next decade. We are in a position \nto return some of the hard-earned money of the American people.\n  This approach to taxes--that the Government taxes when it must, and \ndecreases taxes when it can--is the approach that I took when I was \nmayor of San Francisco, and it is the approach that I continue to \nfollow to this day.\n  Additionally, I believe that this tax package is important to my \nState, California, which today stands on the precipice of a major \neconomic slowdown.\n  California is the largest taxpaying State in the Nation, with some 13 \nmillion income taxpayers. In fact, California is a net contributor to \nthe federal budget, giving more in taxes than we receive in benefits.\n  Today, as many of my colleagues are aware, a serious and acute energy \ncrisis is causing businesses in California to shut down, and people to \nbe laid off of work.\n  Already this year it is estimated that between $25 and $30 billion \nhave been taken out of the California economy to be spent on increased \nenergy costs. If things continue on the same course this figure will \nmushroom in the months ahead. This is a major problem, and one whose \nimpact will not just be limited to California.\n  In my judgment the benefits provided under this tax package are \nimportant, at this time, to help California and Californians face the \neconomic challenges created by this energy crisis. For example, the \ncreation of the new 10-percent income tax bracket, for example, will \nresult in an annual tax cut of $300 for an individual, $600 for a \ncouple for all California income taxpayers. This new 10-percent bracket \nis retroactive, and for people seeing their energy bills spiral up and \nup, receiving these refunds checks will be a big relief.\n  Likewise, this conference report has accelerated the tax relief in \nthe upper tax brackets, so that middle class families in the 28-percent \nand 31-percent brackets will see their tax bills decrease in 2001 and \n2002, with the lower withholding rates going into effect this July, \njust as the energy crisis in California is projected to reach a new \nplateau.\n  And the child credit provisions, refundable as per the Senate-passed \nbill, will provide much-needed assistance to California families \nearning as little as $10,000--and there are 1.5 million households in \nCalifornia that make between $10,000 and $20,000.\n  As I discussed on the floor earlier this week, I also believe that \nother provisions of this bill--providing marriage penalty relief, \nestate tax relief, providing pension and education incentives, and \nmaking a down payment in addressing the alternative minimum tax \nproblem--are likewise important to assure the continued long-term \neconomic health of the California economy, and will benefit many hard-\nworking American families.\n  I would not argue that this is the perfect bill. Nor would I claim \nthat it is the exact bill that I would have drafted.\n  Some of my colleagues, for example, have raised concerns that the \nsize of this tax package may threaten to undermine future fiscal \nstability. I share these concerns. But I would remind my colleagues \nthat although this bill may be larger than some on our side \ncontemplated at the beginning of the year,\n\n[[Page S5785]]\n\nit is also far smaller than the proposal put forward by the President. \nAnd I would also remind them that this bill contains ``sunset'' \nprovisions--critical to my decision to support this legislation--which \nwill allow us to revisit the components of this bill in the future, and \nmake adjustments if and as need be.\n  The bottom line is that I believe that this is a bill that will \nprovide significant relief to the people of California and the people \nof the United States. I urge my colleagues to join me in support.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to note that on today's vote on \nthe tax reconciliation bill conference report, I will be pairing with \nmy colleague, Senator Domenici. My position on this tax bill is well \nknown, as is Senator Domenici's. Were I actually casting a vote, it \nwould be a ``no'' vote, just as it has been in the Finance Committee \nand on the Senate floor previously. I have grave concerns about this \nbill and its implications for our future budgets, and its implications \nfor New Mexico, and I remain opposed to the substance of this \nconference report.\n  Since he had important commitments in New Mexico during the past 48 \nhours, Senator Domenici is unable to be here for today's vote, and he \nhas made a personal request that I pair with him. As a courtesy to my \ncolleague. I have agreed to do so, and would ask Senate records to \nreflect my position on this bill as a ``no'' vote.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, just as I voted no on the Senate \nversion of this tax bill because it was fiscally irresponsible, raided \nSocial Security and Medicare, and would force cuts in investments in \nworking Americans, including education, so too do I oppose this \nconference report. It is even worse, and if I were able to be present \nfor the vote, I would vote no.\n  The top marginal tax rate--that for the wealthiest of Americans--is \nreduced even more than in the Senate bill. Instead of dropping to 36 \npercent, it drops to 35 percent. And with other changes in the bill, \nthe administration is claiming that the top rate has been effectively \nreduced to 33 percent.\n  The refundability of the child tax credit--a key to helping children \nin low-income families--has been changed. By indexing the eligibility \nthreshold, it will leave children behind.\n  And I continue to oppose the repeal of the estate tax. This \noverwhelmingly benefits the wealthiest Americans. Only 2 percent of \nAmericans are subject to the estate tax.\n  All of this means, that the richest 1 percent of Americans, earning \nan annual average salary of over $1.1 million, will, according to The \nWashington Post, receive about 40 percent of the tax cut. That is \nunfair.\n  Finally, this tax bill plays a game with our fiscal future. To meet \nthe target of $1.35 trillion of tax cuts over the next 10 years, all of \nthe tax cuts in this bill expire in nine years. Why? Because if they \nwere in effect 10 years from now, the cost of this bill would be \nastronomical, and it would be very clear to the American people that \nthis tax bill is nothing but a riverboat gamble with our children's \nfuture.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed with the tax \nbill that we are voting on today. As I have expressed for some months \nnow, I believe that we can afford a significant and responsible tax cut \nand I would very much like to vote for one. However, the bill that we \nare considering today has come back to us from the conference committee \nas an even more irresponsible piece of legislation than the already \nbloated and gimmicky bill that we passed out of the Senate earlier this \nweek. With a wink and a nod, this legislation backloads and sunsets \nprovisions in order to squeeze a tax cut of at least $1.7 trillion into \na reconciliation package requiring a much smaller $1.35 trillion tax \ncut. Even more alarming, because so many provisions of this bill are \nheavily backloaded, the full cost can really be seen only by examining \nthe cost in the second 10 years, from 2012 to 2021. This is the first \nperiod in which all of the measures in the bill would be fully \neffective. This bill would cost more than $4 trillion during its second \nten years.\n  This tax cut squanders the hard-earned prosperity that our country \nhas built over the last several years of historic economic growth. It \nreturns us to the fiscal nightmare of the 1980s. This huge tax cut will \nbust the budget, resurrect the deep deficits of the past, and drive our \neconomy into a ditch. For these reasons I will vote against this bill \nand urge my colleagues to do so as well.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the bipartisan \nconference report on the fiscal year 2002 tax cut reconciliation \npackage that provides much needed tax relief for the American people, \nincluding a provision that I and Senator Lincoln and others fought to \nretain: a new refundable per child tax credit for low-income, working \nfamilies.\n  I first want to thank and commend Chairman Grassley and Ranking \nMember Baucus for working so closely together to develop a fair and \nbalanced tax bill that passed the Senate by a vote of 62 to 38 last \nweek--and for fighting to retain the structure and focus of that \npackage so effectively in the ensuing House-Senate conference. Because \nof their efforts--and the manner in which they so successfully defended \nthe Senate's position--I believe the conference report we are now \nconsidering deserves at least the same level of bipartisan support as \nthe original Senate bill, and urge its adoption.\n  No package could truly be said to produce fairness without including \na refundable child tax credit. That's why, as part of the original \nSenate package, I worked with Senators Lincoln, Kerry and Breaux--as \nwell as both the Chairman and Ranking Member--to include a provision \nthat builds on the President's proposal to double the $500 per child \ntax credit by making it refundable to those earning $10,000 or more, \nretroactive to the beginning of this year. That's why I offered an \namendment last week that called for the retention of this provision in \nthe House-Senate conference--an amendment that was adopted by a vote of \n94 to 4. And that's why, during the conference, I continued to fight to \nretain this provision in the face of strong resistence by detractors.\n  Through these efforts--and because of the unyielding support of \nChairman Grassley and Ranking Member Baucus--families earning the \nminimum wage will be able to receive a refundable per child tax credit \nfor the first time. Let there be no mistake, this is introducing a \nwholly new concept with respect to that child tax credit, and one that \nis most assuredly warranted.\n  How will this help? In its original form, the tax relief plan would \nnot have reached all full-time workers--the tax reduction would have \ndisappeared for wage-earners with net incomes of less than about \n$22,000. Indeed, without refundability, there are almost 16 million \nchildren whose families would not benefit from the doubling of the \nChild Tax Credit. To give an idea of how many children we're really \ntalking about, that's about twice the population of New York City or \nabout thirteen times the entire population of my home State of Maine.\n  Thanks to this provision, the bill now provides a substantial tax \ncredit to a total of 37 million families and 55 million children \nnationwide who might otherwise have gained no benefit from the proposal \nto simply double the per-child credit.\n  Many of these are families earning minimum wage, struggling to make \nends meet in addition to paying their share of State and local taxes, \npayroll taxes, gasoline taxes, phone taxes, sales taxes, and property \ntaxes. All told, the average full-time worker earning the minimum wage \npays more than $1,530 in payroll taxes, and more than $300 in federal \nexcise taxes.\n  This is no small burden to working families already living on the \nfiscal edge. In fact, despite America's strong economy, one in six \nchildren live in poverty, and the number of low-income children living \nwith a working parent continues to climb. My provision to make the \nchild tax credit refundable will give these families a hand up as they \nstrive for self-sufficiency, and give these kids the hope of a \nchildhood without poverty.\n  When fully phased-in, the partially refundable credit will provide a \nbenefit of up to 15 cents on every dollar earned above $10,000 per \nyear, adjusted for inflation. Likewise, the maximum refundable credit \nwill rise from $500 to $600 this year, increasing to $1,000 by\n\n[[Page S5786]]\n\n2011. Families with more than one child would also receive a refundable \ncredit based on their income.\n  Will this tax relief solve all the financial problems faced by \neligible families? No. But it will help to purchase essentials, like \ngroceries, heating fuel, or electricity. And it sends an important \nmessage of encouragement that we want those who work hard and strive to \nimprove their lives to succeed. Refundability shows that tax relief is \nfor all full-time working families.\n  With these kinds of adjustments, we take a critical first step in \nensuring that the balance of this package in its totality will help \nlower and middle income taxpayers.\n  The fact of the matter is that the case for tax cuts has never been \nmore compelling. As a percent of GDP, federal taxes are at their \nhighest level, 20.6 percent, since 1944--and all previous record levels \noccurred during time of war or during the devastating recession of the \nearly-1980s, when interest rates exceeded 20 percent and the highest \nmarginal tax rate was 70 percent.\n  The fact of the matter is, it would be irresponsible not to return a \nreasonable portion of the surplus--which is really just an overpayment \nin the form of taxes--to the American taxpayer. And there should be no \nmistake--if we fail to enact meaningful relief package, we will fail \nboth working families and the economy upon which their work depends.\n  And let us not forget that this package is nearly 25 percent smaller \nthan was proposed by President Bush in his budget. Let us not forget \nthat it will utilize less than one-half of the projected surplus over \nthe coming 10 years, 45.7 percent, excluding both Social Security and \nMedicare surpluses.\n  In fact, even with a $1.25 trillion tax cut over the coming ten \nyears, we will still have about $1.5 trillion available for other \npriorities, including the funding of a new prescription drug benefit \nand additional debt reduction. This package is neither unreasonable nor \nirresponsible.\n  Just as importantly, many of us fought hard to ensure that the \nbenefits of this tax cut package will be weighted toward those who need \nrelief the most--middle and lower-income taxpayers--and that weighting \nhas been retained.\n  We have before us a thoughtful proposal that addresses concerns I, \nmyself, had with the distributional effects of the original package. \nAnd it does so in a variety of meaningful ways--retroactively creating \na new ``ten percent'' bracket, providing much-needed AMT relief for \nmiddle-income families, and ensuring marriage penalty relief for all \ncouples while bolstering the Earned Income Tax Credit.\n  And that's not all. The bipartisan education package that the Finance \nCommittee reported in March is included in this bill, along with a new \ndeduction of up to $4,000 for higher education tuition paid--a \nprovision that I sought along with Senators Torricelli and Schumer. \nWith the cost of college quadrupling over the past 20 years--a rate \nnearly twice as fast as inflation--this provision will provide critical \nassistance to individuals and families grappling with higher education \ncosts.\n\n  It also includes the bipartisan IRA and pension package--introduced \nseparately by Senators Grassley and Baucus that will not only \nstrengthen and improve access to pensions and IRA's, but also enhance \nfairness for women who frequently leave the workforce during prime \nearnings years, and suffer from reduced retirement savings accordingly.\n  Again, this is a balanced and fair package. In looking at the various \nanalyses of the changes we made to the package, the Joint Tax Committee \nestimates that those earning less than $50,000 will see their share of \nfederal taxes drop from 14.3 percent under current law to 14 percent in \n2006. Conversely, in the same year, the share of federal taxes paid by \nthose with incomes of $100,000 or more will increase from 58.4 percent \nto 58.7 percent.\n  Moreover, as a result of the refundability of the child tax credit, \naccording to Joint Tax, those in the $10,000 to $20,000 income range \nwill see their share of federal taxes reduced from 1.5 percent to 1.4 \npercent--a reduction of $3 billion. And by 2006, this level is down to \n1.1 percent.\n  And in terms of the overall package, it is worth noting that creation \nof the new 10 pecent bracket accounts for $421 billion, while \nreductions in all other brackets amount to $420 billion--that's 50 \npercent of the cuts going to the lowest bracket alone.\n  As for the compromise we developed that results in a reduction of the \nuppermost bracket from 39.6 to 35 percent, it's worth noting that many \nindividuals in that bracket are small business owners whose business-\nrelated income is taxed as personal income.\n  According to the Treasury Department, in 2006, 63 percent of the tax \nreturns that would benefit from reducing marginal rates in the top two \nbrackets would be reporting some income or loss from a business. And in \nmy home State of Maine, for example, about 97 percent of all businesses \nare small business.\n  The reality is, small businesses have played a central role in our \nNation's economic expansion. From 1992 to 1996, for example, small \nfirms created 75 percent of new jobs--up 10.5 percent--while large-\ncompany employment grew by 3.7 percent. So why--when we're talking \nabout such a tremendous impact on individuals and the economy--when the \ntop corporate tax rate is 35 percent--why should we continue making \nsmall business men and women pay more?\n  And let's face it, the economic impact of this tax cut cannot be \ndismissed. In fact, given the warning signs in our economy, I believe \nthe timing of this tax package is fortuitous. One Business Week article \nspoke of a terrible first quarter, stating that ``The earnings of the \n900 companies on Business Week's Corporate Scoreboard plummeted 25 \npercent from a year earlier--The first quarter profit plunge was the \nScoreboard's sharpest quarterly drop since the 1990-91 recession.''\n  Productivity fell at a 0.1 percent annual rate in the first quarter--\nthe first quarterly drop in six years. And layoffs are at their highest \nlevels since they were first tracked in 1993, with major corporations \nannouncing more than 572,000 job cuts this year. Little wonder, then, \nthat the unemployment rate has risen to 4.5 percent, with April's job \nloss the largest since February 1991.\n  Even more ominous is Business Week's recent observation that if wide \nlayoffs of high wage earners continue, the likelihood of recession \nbecomes even greater.\n  And the Washington Post noted recently that Federal Reserve cuts in \ninterest rates have been the most aggressive since the second quarter \nof 1982--the worst recession since the great depression--and that \nobservation came before the most recent half-percent rate cut.\n  And while it is true that a tax cut may not actually prevent a \nrecession, if one is in the offing, I well remember the words of \nFederal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who came before the Finance \nCommittee in January.\n  Chairman Greenspan stated that tax cuts, while perhaps not having an \nimmediate effect, could act as ``insurance'' should our recent downturn \nprove to be more than an inventory correction--that it could soften the \nlanding and shorten the duration of any recession should it occur. And \nlet's keep this in mind as well--``blue chip'' economists have \nindicated just this week that they are factoring the tax cut in their \nprojections.\n  Given our growing economic uncertainty and the grim repercussions it \ncould have, I am pleased that--as I urged on the floor last week and in \na letter to the Senate conferees--the final conference report ensures \nthat even more money will be in the hands of taxpayers this year than \nwas originally anticipated in the Senate bill. Specifically, by \nproviding for the delivery of refund checks to taxpayers this fall--\n$300 for single taxpayers and $600 for couples--tax relief will be \naccelerated during the current year, and hopefully help get the economy \nback on track.\n  I think the American public often thinks about tax cuts the way they \nwould think of winning the lottery--it would be great if it really \nhappened, but it in reality it really only happens for ``the other \nguy''--that tax cuts will only apply to someone else--and if they do \nhappen, they'll be so small as to have no appreciable effect on \neveryday life.\n  Well, the American people should know that this tax cut applies to \neveryone, and especially those who could\n\n[[Page S5787]]\n\nuse the break the most. And that's true not just on paper, but in \nreality--in the real world.\n  This is no phantom tax cut--this is real, this is balanced, and this \nis fair. And what this all comes down to is, if you're really serious \nabout cutting taxes, you should support this package that begins the \nprocess of providing some relief given, once again, the status of our \neconomy and the tax burden on the American people.\n  We know we're never going to get unanimity on an issue of this \nmagnitude. But we can have progress and we can come to some kind of \nconsensus. This package represents a bipartisan effort that, in the \naggregate, is good for our future and good for the American taxpayer \ntoday. And it deserves our support. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to \nthis fiscally irresponsible conference report. Today, this tax cut \nperpetrates a fraud on the American people.\n  Their hard work created this surplus and this opportunity to sustain \nour economy and strengthen Social Security and Medicare. But no one \nshould be fooled that this conference report is anything but an \nirresponsible, unfair, and politically motivated giveaway to the \nwealthiest in our society.\n  I deeply regret that we have failed to take this historic opportunity \nto provide a meaningful tax cut to all Americans, and at the same time, \ncontinue to make real progress paying down our national debt and \nreserve sufficient resources to invest in our future.\n  I voted for a $900 billion tax cut that would have allowed us to \nprovide all Americans with an immediate and meaningful tax cut across \nthe board and that included important education and energy provisions, \nand would have allowed us to pay down the debt and provide a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit, as well leave room for other West Virginia \npriorities.\n  The conference report's tax cut is far too large to protect West \nVirginia's priorities and its future whether it's education, a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit, federal investments in roads and aviation \nsafety, or safer communities. In fact, the true cost of this bill is \nprobably over $1.7 trillion over the 10 years of the budget. And \nbecause of backloading of the tax cuts, which means that the effective \ndates for many of the tax cuts don't occur for at least 5 years, the \ntax cut cost will explode in later years.\n  Even more farcical, the conferees have hidden even more of the true \ncosts of the tax cut by making it appear that it will expire, and taxes \nsubstantially rise, after 2010. The Chairman and Ranking Member of the \nCommittee know this is simply not what will happen, but they have \nnevertheless used this gimmick to make it appear that they have held to \nthe Senate-passed Budget Resolution. It is ludicrous to think that the \nCongress would impose a quarter of a trillion dollar tax increase on \nthe American people in 2010 when this tax cut proposal expires. These \ntax cuts will be extended, and their cost will thus explode to $4 \ntrillion and more. That's not responsible, and it's bad economic \npolicy.\n  What's even worse, this bill is just not fair to hardworking \nAmericans who created the surplus.\n  This tax conference report simply gives too much to the wealthiest \nAmericans and does too little to reduce our national debt. This tax \nplan endangers our ability to provide a desperately needed Medicare \nprescription drug benefit to 39 million American seniors and taps into \nthe Medicare Trust Fund. It threatens Social Security just when our \n``baby boomers'' start to retire. It leaves us too little to invest in \nour children's education, and jeopardizes our efforts to improve our \nNation's transportation infrastructure. It chokes our ability to \nimprove our national defense and veterans health care--ironically, just \nas many Members of Congress are planning to return to their states to \nhonor their veterans on this coming Memorial Day. This tax bill short-\ncircuits critical components of a balanced energy policy to invest in \nclean coal research and encourage alternative fuels and energy \nefficiency.\n\n  And this tax giveaway will, undoubtedly, return us to the huge budget \ndeficits we worked nearly a generation to eliminate. All of us remember \nthe consequences of the Reagan tax cut--two decades of spiraling \ndeficits. And for my state of West Virginia, the consequences were \ndevastating. As a Governor, I know how my state suffered. I don't want \nto return to those days, and West Virginians don't either. This \nproposal, regretfully, sets us on that path.\n  As the second ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, I was \nofficially named a conferee on this tax legislation. I had hoped to \nwork hard to improve the Senate-passed bill where we could, and, at a \nminimum, retain the Senate's provisions. While the Senate's tax \nproposal was backloaded and cost the same unaffordable $1.35 trillion, \nit included some essential improvements for lower and middle income \nfamilies. As grave a mistake as I believe this tax package is, and as \ndangerous as I believe it will be for our Nation's economic future, I \nwas prepared to support these Senate provisions in conference and do \nwhat I could to prevent further erosion of the already tilted tax cut \nfor the rich. I deeply regret to report, however, that neither the \nMinority Leader nor I were included in the negotiations of this bill. \nWe were presented with this conference report after it had been \ncompleted and at the same time my nonconferee colleagues learned of the \npackage's content. I note this procedural point only to raise my \nconcern that we have deviated from the traditional committee processes \nand from any semblance of true bipartisan negotiating, to our Nation's \nand the Senate's ultimate detriment. The Chairman's repeated assertions \nthat this matter has been conducted in an open and inclusive process \ndoes not reflect reality.\n  Let me outline the most obvious problems with this irresponsible tax \ncut. The tax conference report has several fatal flaws. It plays games \nwith the effective dates of the tax cuts in order to mask the real cost \nof this tax proposal. Those games mean that married people won't get \nrelief from the marriage penalty for 5 years, until 2006. The reason \nwhy married people have to wait for their tax cut is because the \nconference report chose to give even more money to the wealthiest \nAmericans at their expense.\n  The top income tax rate that was reduced from 39 percent to 36 \npercent in the Senate bill is now lowered to 35 percent by the terms of \nthe conference report--that's a 1.6 percent deeper cut than any other \nincome tax bracket. While there is no reduction in marginal rates for \nthe 15 percent income tax bracket--where most Americans and most West \nVirginians pay their last dollar of tax--there is a 4.6 percent \nreduction for the wealthiest Americans who need it the least. West \nVirginians will not be fooled by that; they will see that this is \nunfair. When we get the best analysis from the experts, it will no \ndoubt document just how much is robbed from middle income taxpayers to \nfinance the tax break for the wealthiest. Only 0.3 percent of West \nVirginians are in the top income tax bracket. And let's not be misled \nby the rhetoric that the wealthy get more of the benefit only because \nthey pay more taxes. Of course, the wealthiest Americans pay a \nsignificant share of Federal taxes--about 22 percent. The President's \nproposal would have given those wealthiest Americans 43 percent of the \ntax cuts. This conference report will give them roughly 38 percent of \nthe entire tax cut. They pay in 22 percent, but they get 35 percent of \nthe surplus. I can't explain why they have been rewarded with more of \nthe surplus than they deserve at the expense of hardworking West \nVirginia families, and I can't support it. I can't support a tax cut \nthat gives about 15 percent of our Nation's surplus to the bottom 60 \npercent of taxpayers, and 38 percent to the top 1 percent.\n\n  The estate tax provisions of this bill, also a benefit solely for the \nwealthy, begin almost immediately--in 2002, but middle income married \ncouples are told they must wait for their relief until 2006. The estate \ntax is also totally repealed in 2010. But another startling fact about \nthis tax bill is that the entire bill--even the tax relief for lower \nand middle income people, the child credit, and EITC improvements, all \nsunset in 2010 in order to pretend that this bill really costs $1.35 \ntrillion over 10 years. We know that this is a sleight of hand. We know \nCongress won't sunset or trigger off the tax cuts in 2010. So the true \ncost of this bill, while it purports to be $1.35 trillion--will be\n\n[[Page S5788]]\n\nwell over $4 trillion in the next 10 years. The Senate-passed bill cost \n$1.35 trillion over 10 years, but to finance the upper income tax cut, \nthat timeframe was shortened by a year so about $90 billion could be \nused to transfer it to the wealthiest Americans.\n  I should note that there are needed provisions to help lower and \nmiddle income families with children in this bill that I think we can \nall be proud of, even as they are set in the context of a tax bill for \nthe wealthiest Americans. I do not support this massive irresponsible \ntax cut. But I do support the provisions to make the child tax credit \npartially refundable. I do support the provisions to increase the \nEarned Income Tax Credit, EITC, and to simplify and reduce errors in \nthe EITC. As the Chairman of the National Commission on Children years \nago, we issued a bold bipartisan report calling for a fully refundable \nchild tax credit of $1,000. The child credit and EITC provisions of \nthis bill are a major step in that direction, and it will help millions \nof children and their families. I believe that tax relief should be \ndirected towards the families that need it the most: the parents who \nare working and playing by the rules, but struggling to raise their \nchildren on low-wages. I cannot support this overall package because I \ndo not believe it helps the majority of West Virginia families. But \nsome of its provisions, like the partially refundable child tax credit, \nthe EITC, and the education provisions will help families in my state \nwho need and deserve help.\n  The Senate-passed tax bill, bloated as it was, included a permanent \nextension of the R tax credit. The conference report fails to include \nthis provision. The R tax credit is a highly successful way of giving \nbusinesses an extra incentive to invest more in research and \nexperimentation that is highly beneficial but otherwise can be beyond \nthe reach of private companies. This investment benefits all Americans \nby allowing companies to expand our understanding of science and \ntechnology, and by enabling the marketplace to bring better products \nand services to everyone. Congress should permanently extend the \ncredit, rather than leaving companies in limbo every few years about \nwhether it will be merely extended, in order to provide businesses with \nthe certainty they need to engage in long-term planning and resource \nallocation. If businesses can count on the credit, they can make the \nlong-term, continuous investments that are necessary for real \nbreakthroughs.\n  I am glad that this conference report included pension provisions \nthat will help some middle income families save and improve \nportability. Again, here, I would have done more for the majority of \ntaxpayers that need to be encouraged to save, but the balance of the \nbill is an important savings tool.\n  Finally, the sad fact is that this tax cut is now so large that it \ncommits every dime of the surplus for tax cuts and current obligations, \nleaving nothing--0--for Medicare solvency, new defense needs, or any \nother future or unanticipated emergencies.\n  I will conclude by saying I regret that we are passing this bill \ntoday without much opportunity to review its details, but knowing that \noverall it gives too much to those who already have much, and reserves \ntoo little for our Nation's most important priorities. I cannot support \nthis tax bill, and I hope that my fear that this bill will endanger our \nNation's economic future will be proven incorrect. It will \nunquestionably make meeting the many needs of my state more difficult.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this bill is about righting wrongs in \nthe tax code that are so flagrant as to transcend partisan rancor. It \nis not fair to penalize Americans for marrying. It is not fair to \npenalize Americans for dying. And it is not fair to ask the American \ncitizen to pay more taxes than ever during a peacetime economy. The \naverage American works almost two hours a day, or more than four months \na year, to pay his or her federal tax burden. Tax Freedom Day did not \narrive until May 3rd this year, the latest date ever.\n  It is fair, however, to help families shoulder the costs of raising \nchildren and to encourage Americans to save their hard-earned money for \nretirement and for education. This bill does just that. One provision \nof this bill of which I am extremely proud of is the proposal to make \nsavings from qualified state tuition savings plans tax free. We are all \naware of the high costs of obtaining a college education. Even when you \naccount for inflation, we have seen a steady and stifling increase in \nthe costs associated with attending an institution of higher learning. \nOne of the most promising tools available to families who are trying to \nsave for these rising costs is the qualified state tuition savings \nplan. These plans aide those families trying save for college by using \nthe power of compounded interest. For those families who use a state \ntuition savings plan to save, compounded interest can be a blessing. \nFor those who must borrow to afford tuition, compounded interest can be \na heavy burden.\n  My home state of Kentucky has been at the forefront of those states \noffering such plans, and in 1994 I introduced the first legislation to \nmake savings from qualified state tuition savings plans tax free. Since \nthat time, it has been my pleasure to work with my colleagues Senators \nSessions and Graham to enact several measures to facilitate the use of \nthese savings tools with the eventual goal of making qualified state \ntuition savings plans tax-free. Earlier this year, I once again \nintroduced legislation, the Setting Aside for a Valuable Education, \nSAVE, Act to do just that. I am honored at the tremendous support for \nthis provision from the members of the Finance Committee and I thank \nthem for again including it in their bill. I also want to express my \nprofound gratitude to the House and Senate conferees for including this \nimportant provision in the Conference Report.\n  Indeed, it is fair to say that this tax bill restores tax fairness \nand promotes financial flexibility with respect to our most basic \nAmerican institutions--education, marriage, children, and retirement. \nThe next generation of Americans will have better access to education \nbecause of this bill. They will marry without paying a penalty. They \nwill pay less to the Government, and therefore, will have more money to \nraise their families. They will be able to save more money to retire \nwith dignity. And finally, when their parents pass away, they will not \nhave to sell a family business to pay a death tax. These are not \nDemocratic or Republican goals, these are American ideals.\n  So, you might ask, why are our opponents complaining? I don't think \nthey are complaining about restoring tax fairness and financial \nflexibility to American families. No, I think their real complaint is \nthat we did so while doing what our opponents have always claimed was \nimpossible--lowering taxes and protecting Social Security and Medicare, \nand paying down the debt, and continuing to balance the budget. For \nyears we heard that any tax cut, no matter how fair it may be, would \nrob Social Security, balloon the national debt, and raid domestic \nspending. But now we have called their bluff: we have tax fairness that \nis fiscally responsible. We finally are shedding some light on the \nreal, albeit unacknowledged, complaint of our opponents--that there \nwon't be as many spending sprees in Washington over the next 10 years.\n  Frankly, I wish we could do more in the way of tax relief. For \nfairness sake, I wish we could repeal the death tax and the marriage \npenalty immediately. And I wish we could push income tax rates even \nlower.\n  We have spent a lot of time arguing about what Americans want when it \ncomes to tax relief. Well here's a novel idea--let's ask them. A Zogby \npoll found that 8 out of 10 Americans think the maximum tax rate should \nbe less than 30 percent. Fox News reported similar results. And Gallup \nfound that 65 percent of Americans feel like they pay too high a \nfederal income tax.\n  My office has been filled with constituents coming to complain about \nthe death tax. As hard as it may be for some of my Democratic \ncolleagues to believe, most of these constituents are not tycoons. No, \nthey are small business owners, and they are fed up with the estate tax \nlooming over their families and their businesses. If only a tiny \nfraction of small businesses are affected by the estate tax, as our \nopponents constantly claim, why are all these people calling, writing, \nand coming to see me? I'll tell you why. It's because they, and others \nwho own small businesses, all pay a price for the death tax. Some may \nhave to sell their businesses before they die to avoid the\n\n[[Page S5789]]\n\ndeath tax, and many of them pay a fortune in estate planning fees to \navoid the death tax. For those that can't escape the tax and whose \nheirs may be forced to sell their businesses. Both the heirs and the \ncommunities served by these small businesses suffer tremendously. Our \nopponents rarely compute these collateral costs when they wave their \npartisan statistics.\n  And to those who continue to argue about reform, rather than repeal, \nof the death tax, I say this: it simply is not fair, as a moral, \npolitical, or philosophical matter, to tax someone for dying. Dying is \nnot a choice, Mr. President, but passing on hard-earned assets to loved \nones is a choice, and one that our Government should not penalize by \nmaking Americans visit the undertaker and the IRS on the same day.\n  To close, and to re-emphasize the issue of fairness, I want to \ncrystallize the two sides of this debate. Imagine if you overpaid your \nmortgage bill to the bank for ten consecutive years. Because that's \nwhat we're about to do--overpay our bill to the Government for the next \nten years. My guess is that everyone in this chamber would demand his \nor her money back from the bank. I don't think we would accept \nlistening to the bank tell us that it had devised other plans to spend \nour money. Indeed, we would be absolutely outraged at the very idea \nthat the money wouldn't be returned to us immediately.\n  And this is the crux of the debate: There are those, myself included, \nwho believe that taxes paid over and above the cost of government \nbelong to the American people--that the money should be returned to \nthem immediately for them to spend as they choose. And then there are \nthose who believe that taxes paid over and above the cost of Government \nstill belong to the Government and that the Government has the right to \nchoose whether to return it to the taxpayers or to spend it as they see \nfit. Well, I am proud to say that I believe that this surplus belongs \nto the American people, and I am glad we are going to give it back to \nthem.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Conference Report on \nthe Reconciliation bill. I do so after having expressed hope that the \nprogress we made in the Senate bill to scale back the benefits going to \nthe top rate taxpayers to make room for more tax relief to lower income \nAmericans would prevail in the final tax bill.\n  During the debate on the Senate version of the tax reconciliation \nbill, I had urged my colleagues that substantial tax relief to middle \nincome Americans should be our top priority. While I regret that my \namendment to cut the top rate by one percent to 38.6 percent so \nmillions more middle class Americans would fall into the 15 percent tax \nbracket failed on a tie vote, Senator Grassley did move in that \ndirection in the Senate bill by insisting that the top rate should be \ncut to only 36 percent. As a result, I reluctantly voted for the bill \nbut pledged to vote against the Conference Report should further \nreductions in the top tax rate be made at the expense of the majority \nof Americans who are in much greater need of tax relief.\n  Unfortunately, the Conference Report did just that by jettisoning the \ncommendable work both Senators Grassley and Baucus did in crafting a \nSenate reconciliation bill that provided more tax relief to middle \nincome Americans. This Conference Report lowers the top rate cut to 35 \npercent, at the cost of delaying, for several years, much needed tax \nrelief for married couples unfairly penalized by our tax code.\n  I regret having to vote against this Conference Report. We had an \nopportunity to provide much more tax relief to millions of hard-working \nAmericans. I supported a $1.35 trillion tax cut despite my concern that \na tax cut of that size would restrict our ability to fund necessary \nincreases in defense spending. But I cannot in good conscience support \na tax cut in which so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate \namong us, at the expense of middle class Americans who most need tax \nrelief.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today we have the opportunity to \ndemonstrate that bipartisanship is working in Washington.\n  We have before us what is no longer just the President's tax plan.\n  Just a few short weeks ago, the majority of our colleagues in the \nother body rubber stamped President Bush's plan that heavily tilted tax \ncuts to the rich while delaying most of them until after 2006. That \nplan would not have helped my State or many other southern States for \nthat matter. In fact, almost 50 percent of the wage earners in Arkansas \nwould not have received a tax cut under President Bush's original plan.\n  But with the input of Senate moderates, both Republican and Democrat, \nwe have created tax cut opportunities for millions of low and middle \nincome taxpayers almost immediately. We have stubbornly refused to give \nin to the argument that because people work for less than $21,000 a \nyear, they don't deserve a tax cut. They may not earn enough to pay \nincome taxes but they are surely taxpayers in every sense of the word. \nThey are hard working Americans who pay payroll taxes, sales taxes, \nexcise taxes and just about every other form of tax other than the \nFederal income tax.\n  I am proud that the final plan before the Senate today recognizes \ntheir contribution to our economy.\n  I want to extend my gratitude to my colleague on the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Snowe from Maine. Together we have stood fast in our \ninsistence that the child tax credit should be refundable so hard-\nworking, low-income families would receive a tax cut. By doubling the \nchild tax credit and making it refundable up to $1,000, this tax plan \nrewards hard work and recognizes that all Americans truly deserve a tax \ncut. I mean no disrespect to my male colleagues in this body, but I \nbelieve this provision might not exist in this plan had women not had a \nseat at the Finance Committee table.\n  Senate moderates have changed the President's original plan in other \nimportant ways.\n  The amount of income subject to the alternative minimum tax will be \nincreased immediately. This is a critical issue which the President \nignored. In fact, his original plan would have accelerated the pace at \nwhich middle income taxpayers are forced into the alternative minimum \ntax category. His tax cut would have actually resulted in a tax \nincrease for some unfortunate taxpayers.\n  The revised tax plan will allow people to increase their \ncontributions to IRAs and 401(k) plans, an extremely important change \nin an era when we have seen America's national savings rate drop to its \nlowest point in 40 years.\n  Another change expands the 15 percent tax bracket for married couples \nso that more of their income is subject to the lower tax.\n  And, while I believe that the top income tax rate of 35 percent could \nstill be higher, I am gratified that Senate moderates forced a \nsubstantial increase from the President's original 33 percent rate.\n  We can thank bipartisanship in the U.S. Senate for making this plan \nbetter and one that truly accomplishes the promise of a tax cut for all \nAmericans. The real thanks, however, goes all the way back to 1993 and \nto the American people. When our nation was deep in the deficit ditch, \nthe U.S. Congress went to the people of this great nation and asked \nthem to bare the burden of program cuts and higher taxes in order to \nbalance the budget. We now have a balanced budget and budget surpluses \nand we can now responsibly lift that burden with gratitude to the \ncitizens of this country.\n  I want to especially thank three of my distinguished colleagues on \nthe Finance Committee, Senators Grassley, Baucus and Breaux, who have \nearnestly negotiated the final terms of this bill during the last days. \nI believe that in most important aspects, it remains true to the \nprinciples advanced by the Senate earlier this week.\n\n\n                 massive tax cuts starve national needs\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, 8 years ago, this Congress built a bridge so \nthat future generations would be able to cross from budget deficits to \nbudget surpluses. That bridge resulted in lower interest rates, a \nbooming economy, and provided the nation with an opportunity to fix \nSocial Security and Medicare and retire the national debt.\n  The senate today blew up that bridge, and plunged our grandchildren \nand ourselves into the deficit ravine below.\n  I have spoken many times in recent months about my concerns regarding\n\n[[Page S5790]]\n\nthe size of this tax cut. The events of recent days do not change these \nconcerns, as the fundamental dynamics of the fiscal year 2002 budget \nand appropriations process remain the same.\n  While I would favor a much smaller tax cut, the fiscal year 2002 \nbudget resolution that was put into place in April, and this $1.35 \ntrillion tax cut package that was passed today, will make it impossible \nfor this Congress to come up with the appropriations necessary to fully \naddress our Nation's priorities.\n  I fear that this tax cut will return us eventually to annual deficits \nand impede our efforts to retire the national debt.\n  I fear that this tax cut will consume vital resources that could \notherwise be used to ensure the long-term solvency of Social Security \nand Medicare and provide for a prescription drug benefit.\n  I fear that this tax cut will put this Congress in a position where \nit will be unable to adequately finance our nation's fiscal and human \ninfrastructure needs. For all of the promises being made as the senate \ndebates the education reform bill, the Congress will not have the funds \nit needs to appropriately address these necessary reforms.\n  The administration has tried to assuage these fears by promising the \nbest of all worlds: massive tax cuts that will maintain budget \nsurpluses without draining resources away from infrastructure \ninvestment and retirement programs.\n  Abraham Lincoln said in his 1862 Message to Congress that ``we cannot \nescape history. We of this Congress and this administration will be \nremembered in spite of ourselves.''\n  History will hold us accountable for what we did here today in \npassing this monstrous tax cut. This tax cut, which mainly will benefit \nthe wealthy, is based on pie-in-the-sky projected surpluses which \nprobably will not materialize. History will not forget that the \nnational needs of today and of future generations have been sacrificed \nfor the sake of carrying out a political promise made in the heat of a \npolitical campaign last year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, \nis next on the list.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I do not see any Senators seeking time. I \nwill have to, therefore, suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I seek recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. What is the request?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I was going to request a few minutes, instead of going \ninto a quorum call.\n  Mr. REID. We have a unanimous consent agreement. I think it would be \nbest for everyone if we could move forward under the time agreement. \nSenator Conrad.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I support a significant tax cut for all \nAmericans. I proposed and voted for a $900 billion tax cut. I think \nthat is a level we can afford, one that will accommodate protecting the \nSocial Security and Medicare trust funds, one that will permit us to \nset aside money to strengthen Social Security for the future, one that \nwill allow us to reserve resources for important domestic priorities.\n  I cannot support this conference report because it does not permit us \nto protect Social Security and Medicare. It threatens to put us back \ninto deficit. It threatens to put us back into building debt after a \ndecade of getting our fiscal house in order.\n  This morning's Washington Post labels this conference report for what \nit is, ``Tax Fraud.'' It says:\n\n       The House-Senate tax cut conferees came up with a way, \n     yesterday, to stuff even more cuts into the bill without \n     appearing to break the cost ceiling that Congress virtuously \n     imposed on itself earlier in the year.\n\n  They went on to say:\n\n       Without apparent embarrassment, they adopted the mother of \n     all accounting gimmicks. To keep the supposed 10-year cost of \n     the bill at $1.35 trillion, they will pretend that major \n     provisions expire after nine years.\n\n  What they have done is alter the calendar. In a bill that is to cover \n10 years, they just took off the last year. What is the effect of that? \nThe Washington Post says:\n\n       This is a permanent tax cut masquerading as temporary. But \n     the masquerade is all that matters. The accounting \n     conventions allow the conferees to claim that they've done \n     what they said they would. Once again what they've really \n     done is mortgage the long-term future for short-term \n     political gain.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       When the gimmicks are removed from the bill, the true cost \n     is three times what the sponsors pretend--perhaps $4 trillion \n     over [the second] 10 years.\n\n  Instead of a $1.35 trillion tax cut, which is what was agreed to just \nweeks ago, the true cost of this bill over the period of the budget is \n$1.7 trillion.\n  Those who have said they somehow negotiated a reduction from what the \nPresident was seeking, to be more fiscally responsible, have come back \nwith a conference report that does not do it. It does not reduce the \nsize of the President's proposal because they take the 10 years, and \nput it into 9. If you make an honest assessment of the full 10-year \ncost, you are at $1.7 trillion.\n  The accounting gimmicks do not end there. As the Washington Post \nindicated, this bill is massively backloaded. It is advertised, in the \nfirst 10 years, as costing $1.35 trillion. But in the next 10 years it \nexplodes in cost because they have backloaded provision after provision \nafter provision. The result is that the cost absolutely explodes right \nat the time the baby boomers start to retire. They are digging a deep \nhole for the United States.\n  The New York Times labeled it ``The $4 Trillion Tax Cut.'' They said:\n\n       The tax cut's $1.35 trillion price tag is a deception. The \n     figure was calculated with an array of artificial devices \n     that disguise the true cost. Some of the tax cuts to be \n     enacted abruptly expire before the 11-year period is up. . . \n     .\n\n  This was written before the last gimmick was inserted, the gimmick of \njust taking an entire year out.\n  Remember that Republicans, a couple years ago, tried to put 13 months \ninto a 12-month year as a gimmick to disguise the effect of their \nbudget proposals. This time they have taken an entire year off the \ncalendar.\n  The New York Times goes on to say:\n\n       Other provisions are phased in slowly, with most of them \n     not fully enacted until 2009, 2010 and 2011. This means that \n     although the tax cut technically costs $1.35 trillion in the \n     first decade, its cost in the second decade--when the baby \n     boomers will all be retired--is more than $4 trillion. The \n     tax cut cannot be paid for except by raiding the Social \n     Security and Medicare trust funds. It is a scheme that seems \n     deliberately aimed at wrecking the basic American retirement \n     programs, perhaps to force their dismantling or \n     privatization.\n\n  I think the New York Times and the Washington Post have it right. We \nare in a period of surplus now. But we all know that in the next decade \nwe move to massive deficits. That is when this tax cut, because of the \nway it has been designed, absolutely explodes: from $1.35 trillion, it \nballoons to $4 trillion in cost over the second 10 years.\n  When one examines the real budget--the defense expenditures the \nPresident is asking for, the alternative minimum tax that must be \nfixed, the education expenditures the Senate is in the midst of \napproving now--as we consider the education bill, the emergencies, and \njust the average emergencies we have experienced over the last 10 \nyears, fast forward them to the next 10 years: We are not only going to \nbe raiding Medicare, we are going to be raiding the Social Security \ntrust fund as well.\n  We estimate that this bill, when combined with the real budget \nreflecting what will actually be spent over the next 10 years, will be \nraiding the Medicare trust fund by $311 billion and raiding the Social \nSecurity trust fund by $234 billion. Make no mistake, this vote has \nreal consequences.\n\n  It is not just that it is fiscally irresponsible. In fact, this bill \nis a monument to fiscal irresponsibility. But in addition to that, this \nbill is not fair. The top 1 percent get more than twice as much of the \nbenefit as the bottom 60 percent. In fact, the bill has been made much \nworse in terms of its fairness when you compare what left the Senate to \nwhat has come back in the conference committee. The top 1 percent get \nnearly 38 percent of the benefits. The bottom 60 percent get less than \n15 percent of the benefits.\n  This bill cannot pass any fairness test, or any fiscal responsibility \ntest. It does not pass the fundamental test we ought to apply to any \ntax bill. This\n\n[[Page S5791]]\n\nfinal tax bill is clearly unfair. The top 20 percent get 71 percent of \nthe benefits. The bottom 20 percent get 1 percent. Seventy-one percent \nof the benefits to the top 20 percent; 1 percent to the bottom 20 \npercent.\n  We heard our colleagues say that this bill is much more fair than the \nBush proposal. Well, it is a little bit more fair but not much more \nfair. Seventy-one percent of the benefits in this bill go to the top 20 \npercent. In the President's proposal, 72 percent of the benefits went \nto the top 20 percent.\n  One of the things I think is most revealing about this proposal is \nwhat happens to the various tax brackets. It is fascinating what has \ncome back from the conference committee. Those who are the wealthiest \namong us get by far the biggest rate reduction--by far. Those who are \nin the top 1 percent, who on average earn $1.1 million a year, they get \na 4.6 percentage point reduction, which is, in overall percentage, \nabout a 12-percent reduction in their marginal rate. They are getting \n4.6 points of reduction in a 39.6-percent bracket. That is about a 12-\npercent reduction.\n  The other brackets get 3 percentage points. They roughly average \nbetween 8 and 11 percent of rate reduction. So those at the very top \nget the very most. And the final bracket, the 15-percent bracket, where \n70 percent of the American taxpayers are, gets no rate reduction--none, \nzero. You talk about a bill that is weighted to the very top, the very \nwealthiest; this bill is a testimony for campaign finance reform.\n  Have we learned nothing from the past? We tried this same approach in \nthe 1980s, and it skyrocketed the deficits and the debt, and it took us \n15 years to end it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, some have said: But we are paying down the \ndebt. Make no mistake, we are paying down the publicly held debt, but \nthe gross debt is going up, because the debt to the trust funds is \nskyrocketing under this proposal.\n  Let me just end. This is a chart that shows what is happening to the \ngross Federal debt. It is $5.6 trillion today. At the end of this \nperiod, it is going to be $6.7 trillion. The debt is not going down, \nthe debt is going up. This bill ought to be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend our colleague from North Dakota \nfor his very thoughtful presentation. He has laid out the arguments \nagainst this tax bill rather well.\n  Mr. President, we all are familiar with the famous expression of \nGeorge Santayana which says that those who fail to remember the \nmistakes of history are destined to repeat them. I regret that we are \nabout to do that today with the vote on this tax bill.\n  There are a handful of us here today who were on this very floor in \nthis Chamber 20 years ago when a similar, although smaller, tax cut was \nbeing proposed. No one doubts today the damage that proposal had on our \neconomy over the ensuing years. Its author, in fact, the head of the \nOffice of Management and Budget, has written extensively about the huge \nmistakes that Congress made in the early 1980s in crafting a tax \nproposal that was way out of balance, and had no sense of \nproportionality in terms of the economic needs of the country.\n  It took us more than a decade to recover from that tax cut. Luckily, \nwe began doing so in the early 1990s and, ultimately, we reached the \npoint we are at today where we are enjoying budget surpluses.\n  I am sure my colleagues are familiar with the mythological figure \nSisyphus, the King of Corinth, who was condemned to roll a heavy stone \nup a hill only to have it roll down again as it neared the top. This \nlegislation is much like Sisyphus's dilemma. Just as we start to \nproduce surpluses, to reduce that $220 billion a year in interest \npayments on our national debt that don't build a new school, that don't \nmake anyone healthier, and don't contribute to the environment, just as \nthat rock gets up to the top of the hill, we are about to let it fall \nback upon us by adopting a proposal that sends us right back in the \nwrong direction.\n  I am for a tax cut, and I believe we have plenty of room for one. But \na tax cut of this size that eats up $1.35 trillion of the surplus in \nthe coming years is the height of irresponsibility, especially since we \ndon't have any real clear idea of how this Nation's economy will look \n3, 4, 5, let alone 10 years from now.\n  I regret deeply we are limited to this short amount of time to debate \na proposal of this importance and significance in light of what our \ncountry experienced as a result of a similar tax cut. I hate to say \nthis to my colleagues--I said it in 1981; I will repeat it today, 20 \nyears later--we are about to make the same mistake again. The \ndifference is, we will not have the time to correct it as we did with \nthe mistake made 20 years ago. At the very hour that millions of \nAmericans will look to us for Social Security and Medicare, this \nproposal is going to create a train wreck with those programs.\n  I urge, in the waning moments of this debate, that those who may be \nwavering to please think again, not about the Democrats or Republicans, \nliberals or conservatives. This is an excessive tax cut and one that we \ncannot afford. I urge our colleagues to reject this proposal. Go back \nto the drawing board. It is only May. We have plenty of time to do this \nin a far more thoughtful, prudent, and balanced way.\n  For those reasons, I urge rejection of this conference report and \nurge our colleagues, whom I know have worked very hard on the Finance \nCommittee, the Ways and Means Committee, to go back and try again to \nsee if they can't come up with a more balanced approach that treats all \ntaxpayers fairly and leaves room for the needy investments that America \nmust make if it is going to be the great power of the 21st century that \nit has been in the 20th.\n  With that, I yield the floor to my colleague from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is the final vote on a tax cut which \nis far larger than the country can afford. It has been pushed through \nCongress by the Republican leadership in unprecedented haste without \nadequate debate. They have sought at every turn to avoid a serious \ndiscussion about national priorities. They pretend that we can have it \nall--that this massive tax cut will not affect our ability to \nadequately fund our education and health care needs, to reduce the \ndebt, and to financially strengthen Medicare and Social Security for \nfuture generations. This view is a fantasy. The reality is that this \ntax cut will have a direct and substantial effect on our ability to \nfulfill our responsibilities in each of these areas.\n  Let's focus on one of these priorities--education. The budget \nresolution on which this $1.35 trillion tax bill is based also \neliminates $308 billion of funding for education which had the support \nof a majority of Senators. We recognized that those funds are essential \nto providing a quality education for every child. Yet the enormous size \nof this tax cut is incompatible with real education reform. Sadly, \nRepublican priorities place the needs of the wealthiest taxpayers for \nnew tax breaks above the needs of America's school children. Democrats \nsupport a substantial tax cut--one that would cost nearly a trillion \ndollars over the next 10 years and one that would give working families \na fair share of the tax benefits. Under Democratic plans, the vast \nmajority of American families would receive the same, or even more, tax \nrelief than the Republicans provide, but at a fraction of this bill's \ncost. That is possible because the Republican bill gives such a huge \nwindfall to the rich. Four hundred and fifty billion dollars will go to \nthe wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers. This tax cut reported from the \nconference committee is clearly excessive. It is neither fair nor \naffordable.\n  The conference report gives even larger tax breaks to the rich than \nthe Senate tax bill did. It reduces the rate of the top income tax \nbracket by an additional percent, but still fails to provide any \nreduction in the 15 percent tax rate that nearly three quarters of all \ntaxpayers pay. The extra dollars consumed by reducing the top income\n\n[[Page S5792]]\n\ntax bracket come from budget gimmicks that make the bill even more \nfiscally irresponsible in the long run.\n  Over one of every $3 of tax breaks in this conference report will go \nthe wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers. Once the tax breaks are fully \nimplemented, the richest 1 percent will receive an average tax cut of \nover $37,000 each year--more than the pay most families take home in an \nentire year. The $37,000 a year that this bill provides to the \nwealthiest 1 percent could pay the salary of a new teacher in most \nschool districts. But now there won't be funds for new teachers. The \nRepublicans decided that wealthy taxpayers need the money more.\n  Education is far and away the most important concern of Americans, so \nI offered a number of amendments to protect education from the adverse \neffects of the most extravagant parts of the tax cut. Again and again \nRepublicans chose tax breaks aimed exclusively at the wealthiest 1 \npercent of Americans, people with average incomes of $1.1 million, over \nfull funding of elementary and secondary education for disadvantaged \nchildren, over full funding for the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act, over teacher quality improvements for all students, over \nincreased access to safe after-school activities, over bilingual \neducation, over Pell grants, over HOPE Scholarship Tax Credits, and \nover Head Start. The President's rhetoric may say ``leave no child \nbehind,'' but this tax bill leaves a whole generation of children \nbehind. It leaves them behind so that the very wealthiest taxpayers can \nget a half-trillion dollars in new tax breaks. If we do not have \nadequate resources to provide all our children with a quality \neducation, then we certainly don't have the excess revenue that \njustifies new tax breaks for millionaires. Nationwide, there are 129 \nmillion income tax returns filed each year, but only 900,000 of these \nreport income in the top marginal income tax bracket, which is \npresently 39.6 percent. These are the wealthiest men and women in \nAmerica, and tax cuts that exclusively benefit them should not displace \nthe education funding that the Senate has already agreed is necessary.\n  Only by the use of smoke and mirrors and budget gimmicks has this tax \nbill been made to comply with the mandate of the budget resolution to \nreport a tax bill costing $1.35 trillion over eleven years. But the \nreal cost are even higher. The real costs of this bill explode in the \nout years. Most disturbing of all is the extreme use of back-loading to \nconceal the enormous cost of these tax cuts when they completely take \neffect. The rate reduction is not fully implemented until the year \n2006. Marriage penalty tax relief does not even begin until the year \n2005. The amount of the child credit does not reach the full $1,000 \nuntil the year 2010. The estate tax is not repealed until that year as \nwell, so that almost none of the cost of the repeal shows up until the \nyear 2011.\n\n  These tactics are the height of fiscal irresponsibility. The \nexcessive cost of the bill in the first decade is troubling enough. But \nthat cost will more than triple in the following ten years. A $1.35 \ntrillion tax cut in the first 10 years will mushroom to substantially \nmore than $4 trillion in the next 10 years--precisely when the nation \nwill confront unprecedented new costs in Medicare and Social Security \nfrom the retirement of the baby boom generation. Funds urgently needed \nto strengthen these basic programs are being consumed by reckless tax \ncuts. The Republican leadership could easily have accepted the recent \nSenate vote on the Harkin budget amendment reducing the size of the tax \ncut by 20 percent and investing the resulting $250 billion in education \nover the text 10 years. A responsible proposal like that would enable \nvital improvements to be made in education throughout America, while \nstill leaving $1 trillion for tax cuts that both Democrats and \nRepublicans support. Unfortunately, they refused.\n  Across America, 12 million children live in poverty--but we currently \nprovide the full range of title I Federal educations services to only \none in three of these children. Four of every 10 children in poverty \nare taught by teachers who lack an undergraduate major or minor degree \nin their primary field. Gym teachers are teaching math. English \nteachers are teaching physics. Nearly one in five first-through-third \ngraders are attempting to learn in overcrowded classes of 25 or more \nstudents. In these cases, some students inevitably lose in the \ncompetition for essential teacher time.\n  In addition, over 7 million latchkey children are left alone to fend \nfor themselves after school each day, without constructive after-school \nactivities to keep them off the streets, out of gangs, and away from \ndrugs and other dangerous behavior. Even though Head Start ranks as the \npublic's favorite government program, inadequate funding continues to \ndeny Head Start to half of all eligible children.\n  Students with disabilities suffer from the same Federal neglect. The \nFederal Government has long promised to fund 40 percent of disability \neducation. Yet it still only funds 17 percent. For years, parents and \nStates have called on the Federal Government to live up to its \ncommitment to disabled students. Almost 14 million children attend \nschools in inadequate facilities--schools that are overcrowded with \nclasses held in hallways and trailers and schools that are crumbling \nand unsafe. Seven million children attend schools with severe safety \ncode violations.\n  While money may not guarantee quality education, it is impossible to \nprovide quality education in today's schools without substantial new \ninvestments. ``Reform'' without resources will have no real impact on \nwhat takes place in America's classrooms.\n  The massive tax cut contained in this bill will shortchange an entire \ngeneration of children. Nowhere are Republicans' misplaced priorities \nclearer. After all the talk about the importance of education to \nchildren's lives and the Nation's future--after all the talk about \nunmet needs in the Nation's schools--after all the Senate votes to \nincrease investments to meet the most basic education needs, the \nRepublican tax cut crowds out new investments in education. It tells \nmillions of children who attend inadequate schools that they don't \ncount. If the Federal Government lacks the resources to provide both, \nshouldn't the education of our children take precedence over new tax \ncuts for the wealthiest taxpayers? Who in this Chamber would openly \ndeclare that the wants of 900,000 millionaires are more important than \nthe needs of millions of school children? That, in essence, is what we \nare voting on today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thought we were going to let the \nSenator from Minnesota speak.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator from Massachusetts yield his time to the \nSenator from Minnesota?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield my remaining time to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 2 minutes \n19 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield that to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields his 2 minutes 19 seconds to \nthe Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to strongly oppose this \nconference report. As I have said consistently, I support tax relief, \nand have voted for more modest alternative tax cut packages. But I \nbelieve in tax cuts that reward work, not wealth. That are distributed \nfairly across the economic spectrum, with a special emphasis on relief \nfor those most in need, who bear an unjust proportion of the tax \nburden, including payroll taxes, already--working families. The \noriginal Senate bill did not meet this test. Sadly, when confronted by \nthe priorities of the most extreme elements of the House Republicans, \nthe conference committee has made a bad bill even worse--more grossly \nunfair, with more of the benefits tilted toward the very wealthiest \nAmericans.\n  The worst possible outcome for this decade would be a return to a \n1980s mentality of huge tax breaks for the rich, increases in a bloated \nmilitary budget, and neglect of our social infrastructure, including \nkey insurance programs like Social Security and Medicare. Yet that \nappears to be where the President and the Congressional majority would \nhave us go. We are making a terrible mistake if we pass this conference \nreport today.\n  I can't say it more plainly than that. We are making a grave mistake. \nIf the economy goes south, this conference\n\n[[Page S5793]]\n\nreport will almost certainly leave us without sufficient funds to make \nkey reforms in Medicare like providing for a new prescription drug \nbenefit, or for reforming Social Security in a way that will secure its \nfuture for generations to come. The costs of these tax cuts, so \nobviously backloaded, will explode just at the time when a huge \ngeneration of baby boomers prepare to retire in 10 years. And they will \nbe left holding the bag, along with the generations that come after.\n  The American people should not have any illusions about what we are \nabout to do. The economy and hard choices made in the past have endowed \nus with budget surpluses. In a time of growing economic uncertainty, \nit's not yet clear how large they'll be; private economists, the \nCongressional Budget Office, and even White House (OMB) estimators have \nall readily acknowledged the uncertainty of their projections. But it's \nclear there is some surplus, and Congress has to decide how to spend \nit.\n  If we had crafted a fairer, more modest tax bill, the benefits of \nwhich would have been distributed according to some principles of \nfairness, I would have supported it. But this conference report is \nnothing but a Robin Hood in reverse raid on the federal treasury. When \nfixes to the Alternate Minimum Tax and interest costs are added in, the \ntax cut will cost over $2 trillion over the next ten years. The cost \nwill likely top $4 trillion over the following ten years (2012-2022). A \nvote for this bill is a vote to squander the opportunity to address our \nnation's most pressing problems. We could lift up all children and \nrestore the shining promise of equal opportunity by investing in the \neducation and health care of our kids, over 20 percent of whom still \nlive in poverty in this country. We could move to restore the dignity \nof older Americans by providing affordable prescription drugs, long-\nterm care, and securing the Social Security system. We could invest in \nresponsible, long-term energy policies which protect our environment \nwhile boosting our energy capacities. Instead, we are today almost \ncertainly deciding to ignore these priorities for years to come. We are \nsurrendering on environmental conservation and protection. We are \nsurrendering on investment in clean energy technologies. We are \nsurrendering on tax relief for low and middle income Americans. And we \nare surrendering on decisions to invest in the health, character, \nskills and intellect of our kids.\n  But it isn't just that we are spending nearly the whole surplus for \nthe foreseeable future in one vote. It is what we are spending it on: \ntax cuts for the rich, the powerful, the connected.\n  These tax cuts are still overwhelmingly weighted toward the \nwealthiest Americans: 35 percent of the benefits go to the wealthiest 1 \npercent of Americans. Altogether, 55 percent of the cuts go the \nwealthiest 10 percent, while less than 16 percent of the cuts go to the \n60 percent of American families who earn $44,000 or less.\n  Put another way, 80 percent of Americans will get 30 percent of the \nbenefits in the bill, while 70 percent of the benefits in the bill will \ngo to the 20 percent of Americans with the highest incomes.\n  There are provisions of this bill I support. There is modest tax \nrelief in this bill that goes to those who most need it. But not nearly \nenough. And the price we pay for this meager relief for working \nfamilies is tax cuts three times larger targeted to the richest \nAmericans. That's not a deal that I would want to explain to the \nworking people in my state.\n  Consequently, Americans who earn between $27,000 and $44,000 will get \nan average tax cut of merely $596. But the wealthiest Americans, with \nan average income of over $900,000, will see an average cut of $44,536.\n  Additionally, 10 million children, 1 in 7 children, live in families \nthat will still get no benefit from the legislation, because the \nparents or guardians do not earn enough to qualify for the tax cuts in \nthe bill.\n  In contrast, in 2010, the plan fully repeals the estate tax. This \nwill cost the Federal Government $30 billion in that year alone and \nwill cost nearly $1 trillion over the next 10 years. Yet the vast \nmajority of estates, and nearly all small business and farms, will \nalready be exempted from the estate tax when the repeal goes into \neffect because of the other estate tax reforms in the bill. By 2010, \nunder the bill, a couple would be able to shield $7 million from estate \ntaxes. Full repeal on top of those high exemptions will only benefit \nthe richest of the rich.\n  In Minnesota, in 1999 only 636 estates paid any estate tax. Only 636 \nestates out of the nearly 5 million people who lived in my State. Only \n36 of those estates were valued at over $5 million!\n  Now let me give credit where credit is due. At the strong insistence \nof some of us on the Democratic side, the child credit expansion that \nis included in the bill is a significant improvement over the \nPresident's proposal. It would be refundable to families earning more \nthan $10,000 per year, phasing in at 15 percent of earnings above that \namount. So, for example, a family earning $11,000 a year would get $150 \nand a family earning $16,000 would get $900 as a refund from the IRS. \nIf this provision becomes law, half a million children will be lifted \nout of poverty. This proposal offers some modest relief for certain low \nand moderate income families with kids, and the Committee should be \napplauded for at least including a partially refundable child credit in \nthis bill.\n  However, the partial refundability provision in this bill would still \nleave 10 million very poor children behind. That includes every child \nof a parent who works full-time at the minimum wage. Children left \nbehind with the partial-refundability proposal include: 2 million \nchildren with a disabled parent; more than 300,000 children who live \nwith a grandparent or other family members who are not working because \nthey are retired; more than 6 million children whose parents work \nduring all or part of the year; and 4 million children whose parents \ntogether worked at least 26 weeks--or half the year.\n  Like the Reagan tax cuts of the early 1980s, this bill is too big, \nand fiscally irresponsible. It is grossly unfair. Its benefits go \nmostly to the wealthiest Americans. It will crowd out critical \ninvestments in education, health care, protecting the environment, \nenergy conservation and renewables, and other key priorities for years \nto come. It will severely limit our ability to protect Social Security \nand Medicare, just as the baby boomer generation is preparing to \nretire.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, as we get ready to vote, I thank my \ncolleagues for all their cooperation on this vote and say, with a \ntwinkle in my eye, to my good friends on the other side, that in some \nways this tax cut has finally made me a fiscal conservative because, as \nI look at what is going to happen in the out years, I see a huge \nerosion of the revenue base.\n  I am so worried that at the very time people reach the age where they \nqualify for Social Security and Medicare, we are not going to have the \nresources. This is a mistake. It is a profound mistake, though I \nunderstand the good intentions and goodwill of, for example, the \nSenator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley.\n  On another point: Whatever happened to the President's goal of leave \nno child behind? Whatever happened? The Senator from Massachusetts is \nabsolutely right.\n  The huge victory here--if you want to call it that--for those who \nbelieve there is no positive role for Government to make in the lives \nof people is that there will not be the revenue. So for those children \nwho come from disadvantaged backgrounds, we are not going to have the \nfunding for title I. We won't be able to make the commitment to make \nsure the children are kindergarten-ready or that higher education will \nbe affordable. We won't be able to renew our national vow of equal \nopportunity for every child.\n  I believe these tax cuts are directly antithetical to what our \ncountry is about, which is equal opportunity for every child. That is \nwhy I will vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, do I have 5 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield the first 2 of my 5 minutes to \nthe Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I had the great good fortune of being here \n20 years ago and being involved in the\n\n[[Page S5794]]\n\nReagan tax cuts--tax cuts that let working people keep more of what \nthey earned and ignited the golden economic age in which we live.\n  One of the advantages of living a long time and serving in public \noffice a long time is that you get an opportunity for a day such as \nthis when, 20 years later, we are cutting taxes again. This is a great \nday for the people who do the work and pay the taxes and pull the wagon \nin America and who often get forgotten by their Government.\n  It is obvious in listening to our colleagues that it is a sad day for \nthose who desperately wanted to spend this money here in Washington, \nDC, but I hope my colleagues find some solace in the fact that working \nmen and women sitting around their kitchen tables trying to make ends \nmeet will use this money far more effectively to promote their \ninterests and America's interests than we would use it spending it here \nin Washington, DC.\n  I thank our distinguished chairman, Senator Grassley, for his \nleadership in making this day possible. I reserve the remainder of the \ntime for Senator Grassley.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have now come to the end of our many \ndays of deliberation over the tax cut bill. This will probably be my \nfinal bill during my brief tenure as chairman of the Finance Committee, \nand so, I want to make a few closing remarks about the bill before us \nthis morning.\n  This bill represents an enormous bipartisan effort. This bill has had \nbipartisan participation from its very creation, all the way through to \nits completion in conference with the House. The bill before us today \nwas drafted in concert with Senators Baucus, Breaux, and many others on \nthe Finance Committee from both sides of the aisle--all of whom I \nconsulted with personally. I thank you all for your insights and \nguidance in designing this bill.\n  I would also like to thank Chairman Bill Thomas of the House Ways and \nMeans Committee. His responsiveness to the difficulties we face here in \nthe Senate was refreshing and very constructive. But most of all, we \nshould thank President Bush. It was his leadership and vision that led \nus to this historic moment--as we prepare to enact the largest \nindividual income tax cut in 20 years.\n  We took as a starting point President Bush's efforts to provide \nincome tax relief to all Americans. This legislation includes the four \nmain elements of President Bush's goals for providing tax relief to \nworking families: the bill before us today provides an across the board \ntax cut and creates the new low 10 percent rate requested by the \nPresident; the bill reforms and repeals the death tax, which the \nPresident wanted; the bill provides marriage penalty relief, which the \nPresident and Congress have sought for a very long time; the bill also \nincludes a $1,000 refundable child credit, which was specifically \nrequested by the President. Sixteen million more children will be \nhelped by our bill. In addition, the bill contains an extensive \neducation incentives package, pension and IRA enhancements, and AMT \nrelief.\n  This tax bill is a victory for Republicans. It is a victory for \nDemocrats. It's a victory for the President, but most importantly, it \nis a victory for the taxpayers of the United States.\n  Now for some of the details. First, the conference bill reduces \nmarginal rates across-the-board and applies the President's 10 percent \nrate retroactively to January 1st of this year. The Treasury Department \nwill issue rebate checks to American taxpayers to remit any excess \ntaxes that have been withheld on their 10 percent earnings earlier this \nyear. The 28 percent, 31 percent and 36 percent rates will be reduced \nby 3 points over the next several years.\n  The first one point rate reduction will take effect on July 1--just a \nmonth from now.\n  The rebate checks and immediate rate reductions will provide a \nstimulus that our sluggish economy very much needs. In addition, the \n39.6 percent top marginal rate will drop to 35 percent. While we don't \ngo as far as the President in reducing the top rates--and I would add \nwe didn't go as far as I would like--we also address the hidden \nmarginal rate increases caused by current law that denies deductions \nfor personal exemptions and itemized deductions.\n  Those laws will be repealed, thus eliminating these hidden marginal \nrate increases and removing another complexity from the Code. We \nprovide marriage penalty relief for married families--for families \nwhere both spouses work and where only one spouse works.\n  The President's desire to expand the child credit to $1000 is met in \nthis bill. And in response to the concerns of Senators Snowe, Lincoln, \nBreaux, Jeffords, and Kerry the child credit was expanded to help \nmillions of children whose working parents do not pay income tax.\n  And lastly, we heard America's voices and have reformed and repealed \nthe death tax. Starting January 1 of next year, the unified credit is \nincreased to $1 million and the top rate is cut to 50 percent. The \nburden of the death tax is reduced and will be eliminated--as called \nfor by President Bush. This effort is due to the work of many Senators \nbut I would particularly note the efforts of Senator Kyl and Senator \nLincoln.\n  In addition, the bill contains many provisions targeted for \neducation. Elements include expansion of prepaid tuition programs to \nhelp families pay for college--long advocated by Senators Collins, \nMcConnell, and Sessions. In addition, we provide college tuition \ndeduction thanks to Senators Torricelli, Snowe, and Jeffords, as well \nas an expansion of the education savings accounts--in honor of Senator \nCoverdell--thanks to the work of Senator Torricelli and the Majority \nLeader. In addition to President Bush's proposals for tax relief for \nworking families, we also included the Grassley-Baucus pension reform \nlegislation which probably would not have made it in the bill without \nthe longtime support of Senators Hatch and Jeffords.\n  In addition to maintaining the basic framework of the bipartisan \nagreement, we were able to retain some of the important amendments \nadded to the RELIEF Act on the Senate floor. The key amendments we kept \nwere keeping with the major focus of the bill--providing benefits for \nworking families. First among these is that the adoption credit is \nextended and expanded effective 2003. I have been a long advocate on \nthis matter, but I want to recognize the critical work of Senators \nLandrieu and Craig in this matter. Further, we were able to retain the \ngoal of giving employers greater tax incentives to provide child care \nto their employees--long advocated by Senator Kohl.\n  In addition, we kept the policy advocated by Senator Jeffords of \nexpanding the dependent care tax credit--which assists families facing \nthe difficulties of providing care for children and spouses with \nspecial needs. We include Senator Bingaman's amendment offered in \ncommittee that allows the IRS to provide greater relief to families who \nare in a disaster area.\n  Finally, we retained the Senate amendment championed by Senator \nFitzgerald that excludes from income payments made to survivors of the \nHolocaust. America is a society of opportunity. Over 60 percent of all \nfamilies will at one time or another be in the top fifth of income in \nthis country.\n  This bill will provide the American taxpayer with the greatest amount \nof tax relief in a generation. And they deserve it. It is wrong that in \na time of surpluses we are still imposing a record tax burden on \nworkers. With passage of this bill, struggling families will have more \nmoney to make ends meet; parents and students will be able to more \neasily afford the costs of a college education.\n  A successful business woman will be able to expand and hire more \npeople; a father finally getting a good paycheck after years of work \nwill be able to better provide for his aging mother; and, a farmer can \npass on the family farm without his children having to sell half the \nland to pay estate taxes. The examples are endless of the great \nbenefits that we realize when we give tax relief to working families. I \nwould remind my colleagues again that the hallmark of this bill is that \nrelief for low-income families comes first.\n  The marginal rate drop to 10 percent is immediate, and the effects of \nthat reduction will be placed in taxpayer's hands this year. The child \ncredit expansion to low-income families is immediate. Over 16 million \nmore children will be helped by the provisions of this\n\n[[Page S5795]]\n\nbill. In addition, the numbers show that once again, our bipartisan \nbill makes our tax system even more progressive. That is, at the end of \nthe day upper income families would be paying a greater share of taxes \nthan lower income taxpayers.\n  I also have a message for those who claim this bill benefits the rich \nat the expense of the poor, and that it will jeopardize Medicare and \nSocial Security. Those things just aren't true. This is a bipartisan \nbill. We'll spend at least $3.5 trillion on Medicare in the next 10 \nyears. That's more than 2.5 times the size of the tax cut. We wouldn't \nput forward bipartisan legislation that jeopardizes Medicare and Social \nSecurity. So I hope Americans will rest easy that this tax bill doesn't \nshortchange one group of Americans at the expense of others.\n\n  My message to taxpayers is this: Substantial tax relief is on the \nway. The Government will ease its grip on your wallet. You deserve \nthis. Now, the last time the Senate considered this bill, it turned the \nbill over and over and around and around. Some Members tried to huff \nand puff and blow this bill down. That didn't work. Like a house made \nof bricks, our bipartisan bill is standing strong. But apiece of \nlegislation is only as good as the last vote it survives. Today, we are \nfaced with a crucial vote. Let me say it again: This is a bipartisan \nbill.\n  I have described this legislation to remind Senators of the balanced \napproach that took place in crafting this bill; to highlight the fact \nthat it reflects the views and priorities of a wide range of members on \nboth sides of the aisle. I can assure my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle that if Senator Baucus had not been present at the \ncreation of this bill--it would have been a very different piece of \nlegislation.\n  It is because of his efforts that there are many elements in this \nbill that members on the other side of the aisle can enthusiastically \nsupport. I am tired of reading in the press the constant carping of \nSenator Baucus' efforts to draft a bipartisan bill. It seems that while \nmany are happy to talk about bipartisanship that can't stand to see \nbipartisanship practiced. We saw that happen the last time we brought \nthis bill to the floor of the Senate.\n  I urge my colleagues to stop the petty partisanship and put the \nAmerican taxpayers first. Now it is time for the Senate to send this \nmuch needed tax relief to the President for signature. America is \nwaiting, and America is watching. Let's send them this historic tax \nrelief package today.\n  Mr. President, I have 3 minutes, and I yield 1 minute to Senator \nHatch.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am grateful that I was a conferee in this \nmonumental historic event. I personally congratulate Chairman Grassley \nand the ranking member, Senator Baucus. Both worked very well together. \nOf course, Chairman Thomas and House Leader Armey and Speaker Hastert \ndid a terrific job, as did John Breaux, who has worked so magnificently \nthrough the years.\n  Six months ago nobody thought the President would win on a $1.35 \ntrillion tax cut. It is amazing. He hung in there. He stood for what he \nbelieved, and I believe the American people are going to be the \nbeneficiaries.\n  I want to highlight one thing. There are 16 million additional \nchildren who directly benefit from the refundable child credit \ncontained in this comprise. This is one of the best bills for children \nand families I have seen in years and I just wanted to make that clear \nto everybody. The rate reductions and every other provision will \nbenefit America.\n  This conference report is not perfect, just as no political \ncompromise is perfect. I, like many of our colleagues, would have \ngreatly preferred a larger tax cut of at least $1.6 trillion. Ideally, \nthe top marginal rate should have come down to no more than 33 percent, \nwith corresponding reductions in all the other brackets. The \nalternative minimum tax still will afflict millions of Americans. And, \nI greatly regret that the permanent extension of the research and \nexperimentation credit was not accommodated in the final product.\n  On the other hand, Mr. President, this conference report includes the \nnecessary elements that will make it stand out as landmark legislation. \nIt does so much for the people of Utah and for the people of America. \nIt begins to reverse the flawed philosophy that says the government \nknows best how to spend the taxpayers' hard-earned money. It cuts taxes \nfor every American who pays them. It will stimulate the economy and \nprovide incentives to keep it strong in the future. It acknowledges the \nimportance of families, as well as the need for providing a good \neducation for our people. It also includes strong incentives for all \nAmericans to increase their savings and prepare for their own \nretirements. It recognizes the gross unfairness of the confiscatory \ndeath tax and begins immediate relief with repeal within a decade. It \nmakes great strides against the unfairness of the marriage tax penalty \nin a way that does not punish those families where one spouse chooses \nto stay at home. On the whole, it is a very good bill.\n  Although this tax cut bill is the capstone of our budget agreement, I \nalso look at it as just the beginning. The beginning of what I hope \nwill be more bipartisan work this Congress to make the tax code even \nmore fair and certainly more simple. And, what I hope will be \ncontinuing cooperation between the President and the Congress.\n  I again want to extent my congratulations and gratitude to the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley, for his \nextraordinary dedication to bipartisanship and his tireless dedication \nto accomplishing the triumph that is represented in the conference \nreport that lies before the Senate today. Without his perseverance and \npersistence in sticking to the goal at hand despite many obstacles, \nthis victory for the American taxpayer would not have been possible.\n  Likewise, I thank Senator Baucus for the major role he played in \ngetting us to this point today, and for his courage in the face of \nopposition of many in his own party. He, along with Senator Breaux, \nhave shown all of us what it means to rise above partisanship and pure \npolitics for the sake of what is good for the nation. They, together \nwith the others in the soon-to-be majority party who supported this \nbipartisan tax cut, have my respect, my gratitude, and my promise that \nI will continue to reach across the aisle to work with them to further \nimprove our tax system in the future.\n  My fellow conferees deserve a lot of credit for accomplishing this \ndifficult task. Congressman Thomas, the new chairman of the Ways and \nMeans Committee, demonstrated toughness, dedication, knowledge, and \ncompassion in representing the House position. I also want to commend \nSpeaker Hastert and Leader Armey for their tireless support and \ncontributions. On the Senate side, Senators Murkowski, Nickles, and \nGramm put in many long, difficult, and late hours in helping us find \nour way through the differences in the House and Senate bills to reach \nthe compromise.\n  Mr. President, most of all, I want to extend my congratulations to \nPresident George W. Bush. The tax cut the Senate just passed is a \ntestament to his vision and his willingness to carry out with single-\nmindedness a campaign promise that many, frankly, took lightly and \nconsidered highly unlikely if not impossible. This is what real \nleadership is all about, and I commend him for it.\n  This is a great day in the United States Congress. I am proud that I \nwas able to be part of it.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there will be a lot of speeches about \nthe substance of the legislation and, obviously, I think it is a good \npiece of legislation or I would not have negotiated the final product. \nI think it is good for the economy. It is surely good for working men \nand women of America to have tax relief. It is surely good for fiscal \ndiscipline within our Government as we make sure that the Government \nmust squeeze every dollar of value out of every penny that we spend.\n  I think leaving this money in the pockets of the taxpayers rather \nthan sending it to Washington will help us with our fiscal discipline. \nMost importantly, I think the process by which this product is before \nus is much more significant than the product because the control of the \nSenate hangs in the balance--even over the next several years, it seems \nto me, regardless of the exact numbers.\n\n[[Page S5796]]\n\n  The Senate is known for its bipartisanship to pass legislation. I \nhope that the work Senator Baucus and I have done in a bipartisan way \nto bring this product of tax relief to the American taxpayers and to \nthis body for it to become law serves as an example not only for the \nentire Senate but also will continue the tradition of bipartisanship \nthat we have had in our committee.\n  I hope that we do, in fact, look upon the Senate as being very \nclosely divided for a long period of time, and for whoever is in \ncontrol, it is very important that we continue this bipartisanship in \nthe Senate.\n  I yield the floor, and I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a Resolution to \nhonor a group of Americans who have dedicated their lives to serving \nand protecting our Nation.\n  As we approach Memorial Day, we should take time to remember the \nsacrifices and achievements of our armed forces. In doing so, I would \nlike to recognize the heroic African Americans who served in the Ninth \nand Tenth Horse Cavalry Units of the U.S. Army. These units first were \nestablished at the end of the Civil War and eventually were ordered to \nthe Western Frontier, where they earned the name ``Buffalo Soldiers.'' \nThese men were instrumental in the realization of our Manifest Destiny \nby guarding settler communities and securing new western land. These \nbrave American soldiers continued to serve our country in the Spanish-\nAmerican War as part of Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders and again in \nduring World War II, both in Europe and here at home as our domestic \ndefense in California against a possible Japanese invasion.\n  The Buffalo Soldiers were truly brave Americans to which our country \nowes a great debt. I would like to draw special attention to a soldier \nin their ranks--Colonel Charles Denton Young. Colonel Young was a \nlifelong resident of my home state of Ohio and contributed greatly to \nhis country. He graduated from West Point in 1884 as only the third \nAfrican American to ever receive a diploma from the Academy. Owing to \nhis strength, perseverance, mental and physical toughness, and a \nnatural ability to lead, Young eventually was promoted to the rank of \nColonel, which was the highest rank ever achieved by an African \nAmerican at that time.\n  Leading his men on the battle field, however, was not the only way \nColonel Young had an influence on the people around him. He took an \nactive role in his community as an educator and mentor to students at \nWilberforce University in Ohio. Colonel Young was a person whom others \nwished to emulate, and continue to emulate today, as Secretary of State \nColin Powell has cited Colonel Young as one of his earliest role \nmodels. I believe I can speak for all Ohioans when I say that we are \nextremely proud of Colonel Young and his contributions to our nation, \nand I believe that America has great cause to share in this pride.\n  I ask that when celebrating the great accomplishments of our armed \nforces this Memorial Day, we do not forget\n\n[[Page S5797]]\n\nour Buffalo Soldiers.

Mr. President, since 1963, the month of May has helped \nthe nation focus on the contributions and achievements of America's \nolder citizens. Fewer people over the age of 65 require nursing home \ncare and more are living on their own, with little or no outside help. \nOlder Americans increasingly redefine modern maturity, re-shape \ncultural boundaries and dispel age-related stereotypes associated with \ngetting older. They are leaders in our families, in our workplaces and \nin our communities.\n  One of these leaders is a 76-year-old man from Mechanicsville, IA. \nJohn Sauer understands the value of helping others. Through his \ninitiative, compassion and commitment, he has touched the lives of many \nin his community.\n  Mr. Sauer began volunteering with the local seniors group in 1992. At \nthat time, he responded to a request from a friend to help out with the \ngroup for a short time. Today, not only does he continue to volunteer \nin Cedar County, but he also serves seniors in six other counties as \nchairman of the advisory council of the Heritage Area Agency on Aging.\n  Although Mr. Sauer has always been active in the community service, \nhe took on many of his current activities after he retired from farming \nin 1994. At that time, Mr. Sauer became increasingly involved with \ncounty senior citizens groups. He joined the transportation board of \nthe Cedar County Senior Citizens task force and began providing \ntransportation for older people in his area who were unable to drive. \nTwo or three times a week, Mr. Sauer drives seniors to and from doctor \nand hospital visits in Cedar Rapids and Iowa City, both 25 miles away \nfrom Mechanicsville. The service Mr. Sauer provides is invaluable to \nthose people who otherwise would have no way to make those important \nvisits.\n  Mr. Sauer is also committed to serving the visually impaired. For 37 \nyears, Mr. Sauer has been an active member of Lions Club International, \na service organization recognized for their help to the blind and \nvisually impaired. In 1994, Mr. Sauer became an Iowa district director \nfor the organization. In that position, he traveled around the United \nStates and Canada representing the state at various meetings and events \nfor the service club.\n  In addition, Mr. Sauer has volunteered in the Opthamology Department \nat the University of Iowa Hospitals for the past 4 years. He greets \npeople from across the Midwest who come to the hospital for care and \nguides them to their appointments. Mr. Sauer says he enjoys \nvolunteering at the hospital because he likes meeting new people from \nvarious locations.\n  Mr. Sauer also enjoys learning new things. Three years ago, he became \na member of the Eastern Iowa Mutual Insurance Board. Although his \nbackground was not in insurance, Mr. Sauer accepted the challenge of \nserving on the board and has enjoyed learning about the industry. He's \nalso been active in the local schools, serving as a member of the \nschool board and most recently on the school foundation. In addition, \nMr. Sauer is an active member in his church and in the American Legion.\n  A devoted family man, Mr. Sauer has been married to his wife Kathleen \nfor 51 years. The couple has three children and five grandchildren.\n  I want to thank Mr. Sauer for his contributions to the people of \nCedar County. His initiative and compassionate concern for others is an \nexample to us all that we should always be willing to contribute, no \nmatter what our age.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/26/senate-section/article/S5797-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         IN HONOR OF DON LAUER\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today with pride to remark \non the extraordinary public service career of Dr. Donald Lauer. For \nover twenty-five years, Dr. Lauer has played a key leadership role at \nthe Earth Research Observation Systems, EROS, Data Center near Sioux \nFalls, South Dakota, and for over a decade has served as Chief at EROS.\n  Under the jurisdiction of the United States Geological Survey, the \nEROS Data Center holds one of the world's largest collections of images \nof the earth's land surface. These incredibly valuable images are \nmanaged and distributed by EROS personnel to scientists, policy makers \nand educators worldwide. The data is used to study a wide range of \nnatural hazards, global environmental change and economic and \nconservation issues.\n  EROS is also now home to the United Nations Environmental \nProgramme's, UNEP, Division of Environmental Information, Assessment \nand Early Warning office in North America. South Dakotans are proud to \nhost this important United Nations office within our state.\n  The great success of EROS is due in significant portion to the \noutstanding leadership provided over the years by Dr. Lauer. His \nscientific, and management skills have proven invaluable as the role of \nEROS has expanded and become ever more complex. He has played a key \nrole in facilitating a recent multimillion dollar transfer of NASA \nearth images to the UNEP, and their placement at EROS.\n  Beyond all this, Dr. Lauer has also provided important leadership for \nthe Sioux Falls community. He currently serves on the Board of \nDirectors for Sioux Valley Hospital, and has had a career long interest \nin the health and education of his fellow citizens.\n  I am pleased that Dr. Lauer will remain with the United States \nGeological Survey as an Emeritus Scientist, and that he plans to \ncontinue his residence in Sioux Falls. His vision and commitment to \nscience will continue to well serve the people of the United States and \nof the world.\n  Dr. Lauer's life and career serve as models for public servants \nthroughout our nation. I take this opportunity to thank him for all he \nhas accomplished at EROS, and wish him well on all his future \nchallenges and opportunities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/26/senate-section/article/S5797-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:17 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Rota, one of its clerks, announced that the House agrees to the \nreport of the committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \ntwo Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 1836) \nentitled ``An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to section 104 \nof the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2002.''\n                                  ____\n\n  At 10:36 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

A bill to provide emergency assistance for families receiving \nassistance under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act and low-\nincome working families; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, we all know the cost of gasoline has \nbeen increasing very dramatically and the people of my State, a very \nrural State, have to travel very long distances. There is little public \ntransportation in rural counties, and as a result they have to use \ntheir cars and have to, therefore, buy a lot of gas.\n  Today I am introducing legislation to give temporary help to those \nwho need it most, particularly low-income families, workers, seniors, \nand, frankly, students who have to drive long distances each day to get \nto their work, their school, and to critical health care.\n  In West Virginia prices of gas have gone up, as they have everywhere. \nIn the North and South they have gone up by a great deal. People suffer \nbecause of that. I know high prices affect everyone when it comes to \ngas, but they do hit lower income people in the most painful way. When \nyou are already struggling to pay the cost of housing and the cost of \neducation or whatever it might be, the cost of gas aggregated over a \nperiod of time becomes a very painful item. As I indicated, if you are \nin a rural area, your problem is much worse because there is not public \ntransportation. This is a very crucial fact. It means you have to use \nyour automobile. It means you have to buy the gas to put in the \nautomobile.\n  I support the development of long-term energy policies and hope we \nwill do that in a wise way. But for those who pay their living expenses \nday to day, that will not come soon enough. Therefore, my bill is a \nsimple one. It is a temporary approach to what I believe is already, in \nfact, something of an emergency.\n  The bill is modeled on the successful Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program, LIHEAP, which helps working families and seniors \ncope with home heating costs. The proposal which I call LIGAP--not out \nof my poetic sense but simply because it stands for Low-Income Gasoline \nAssistance Program--would give grants to States for an emergency \nassistance program for people who must drive 30 miles a day or an \naverage of 150 miles a week for work, for education related to work, or \nscheduled routine health care.\n  This new program will have similar income eligibility guidelines as \nthe LIHEAP program. Therefore, it will not be difficult to administer. \nIt is triggered when a State's average gasoline price hits the \nunmanageable current level. It is also triggered off when gas prices \ndecline. Every eligible person or family will get a monthly stipend of \n$25 to $75 to help cover the high cost of gasoline.\n  This legislation encourages States to use their block grant funding \nto help welfare recipients pay for transportation costs, necessary for \npeople getting off welfare to get to work. Some States, including West \nVirginia, are already using welfare reform moneys as part of their \nwelfare-to-work initiatives to help with transportation costs. I think \nthat is a very important thing for States to do. I am proud of my \nState's initiative, and I am proud of their approach to welfare reform.\n  There obviously are not any magic bullets in bringing some sanity \nback to gasoline pricing, but this bill is designed to offer at least \nmuch-needed relief to West Virginians and other Americans who simply \ncannot make ends meet while we are in the throes of high gasoline \ncosts. I think it is a sensible bill, and I hope at the appropriate \ntime it will get favorable consideration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Byrd, Mr. \n        Hollings, Mr. Specter, and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 979. A bill to amend United States trade laws to address more \neffectively import crises, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce bipartisan \nlegislation known as the Fair Trade Law Reform Act of 2001 with my \ncolleagues Senators Rockefeller, Byrd, Hollings, Specter, and Mikulski. \nThis legislation will change for the better the way we trade with our \nglobal trading partners.\n  We talked a lot about trade in the last Congress. We voted to extend \nPermanent Normal Trade Relations status to China. We debated and passed \nthe Africa Growth and Opportunities Act. Now, we have a new \nadministration asking for Trade Promotion Authority and bilateral trade \nagreements with Jordan and Vietnam.\n  Today, we have just passed the President's tax bill. As far as I am \nconcerned, the Congress and more specifically the Senate Committee on \nFinance should now turn its attention to the important matter of trade \nbetween our country and our global trading partners around the world. \nWe need to have a discussion about what we are doing to make sure our \nmanufacturers, our steel makers, our textile workers and our farmers \nare able to compete on a level playing field.\n  One industry, in particular, has been facing a deluge of imports from \nsome 30 nations. The U.S. steel industry has for the last 4 years been \nbattered by imports from foreign countries. We know from prior unfair \ntrade cases that much of it is being dumped on our shores, and \nsubsidized by foreign governments, at prices that are at historic lows. \nAnd we are talking about blatant subsidization. Look at the Korean \ngovernment's relation to Hanbo and Posco. To this date, they have not \nfully divested their government role in those two steelmaking entities.\n  Many of the same nations who have been exporting steel to the U.S., \nhave erected import restraints in their own countries or have filed \ndumping cases to keep this deluge from their own shores. The U.S. has \nbecome the export market of first and last resort for the whole world.\n  Some of these same nations throughout Europe and Asia, who erected \ntrade barriers to this onslaught because of the harm it threatened over \nthere, are arguing that our industry is not similarly threatened, or \nthat our law doesn't permit us to take remedial action, even \ntemporarily. Some argue that the industry has not been sufficiently \nharmed by this situation. Not\n\n[[Page S5799]]\n\nenough firms have gone under, not enough workers have been laid off. In \nother words, in order to prove sufficient harm to save your job, you \nmust first lose it.\n  One week ago today, Northwestern Wire and Rod in Sterling, IL, shut \ndown its furnace. It will roll out the rest of its billets and then \nclose its doors. That's almost 1,500 employees. Over one-third of the \nresidents of Sterling get their health insurance through Northwestern \nsteel. Acme Steel has had financial difficulties. Five Illinois steel \ncompanies have either shut their doors or declared bankruptcy since \n1998 and I don't see an end in sight.\n  My constituents are told that this is just the ``free market'' at \nwork. That this is just the world markets working out the kinks. I find \nall this incredible. Some of these other nations must be laughing up \ntheir sleeves at our apparent helplessness and we are the only ones who \ndon't get the joke.\n  Let me state for the record: I believe that free trade is very \nimportant for the United States. I also believe that fair trade is just \nas important. We are not helpless. We do not expect our businesses to \nall go under, our workers to all be laid off, before we wake up and \ntake action.\n  We must take action in the 107th Congress to address basic \ninadequacies of our trade laws. We have made it easier to send our \nproducts and services to other countries. Yet, we haven't seemed to be \nable to address successfully the steel crisis that's been with us now \nfor nearly 4 years.\n  Our trade laws, particularly the antidumping and countervailing duty \nlaws, have long been, and remain, critically important to the U.S. \nmanufacturing sector. They are the last line of defense for U.S. \nindustries, operating on market-economy principles, against injury \ncaused by unfairly traded imports. The heart of U.S. trade policy \nmaintains that while America keeps an open market to fairly traded \ngoods of any origin, our industries and workers will not be subject to \ninjury from unfairly traded imports because the trade laws will be \nenforced and kept up-to-date.\n  The last general reform of the U.S. trade laws, unconnected to any \nparticular trade agreement, occurred more than a decade ago. In that \ntime, the problems to which these laws must respond have changed \nconsiderably, as underscored by the late 1990s Asian and Russian \neconomic conflagrations and the ripple effect of results felt \nworldwide. It has become painfully clear that current trade laws are \neither incapable of responding to the kinds of sudden import surges--\ncausing dramatic and rapid injury--or we have had various \nadministrations that were unable to enforce them.\n  Our trade laws themselves are fully consistent with WTO rules. But \nthey need to be revisited and made stronger. This bipartisan \nlegislation would do several things:\n  First, we should strengthen section 201 language by removing a very \nhigh causation standard and replacing that standard with a lower \nthreshold by which U.S. industries and workers can prove their cases \nmore easily. Let me state for the record that if we reform our trade \nlaws and we ensure our trading partners know we are serious about \nenforcing those laws, the incentive to dump steel or other imported \nproducts will be reduced.\n  Second, the AD/CVD sections of this bill respond to the fact that \ncurrent U.S. law makes relief unnecessarily difficult to obtain, \nimposing standards more onerous than those in the relevant WTO \nagreements. By updating the antidumping and countervailing duty laws, \nin light of new global economic realities to which those laws must now \nrespond, we will reverse errant court decisions that had limited the \nlaws' remedial reach in a manner never contemplated by the Congress.\n  And finally, we will establish a steel import monitoring provision, \ncomparable to WTO-compatible programs maintained by other WTO members \nsuch as the EU, Canada, and Mexico.\n  The Congress, I might add, has not been silent during this debate \nover the last several years. We have had extensive debate in both the \nHouse and Senate and we passed the Byrd-Durbin Steel Loan Guarantee \nProgram last year. This legislation was intended to provide immediate \nrelief to qualified steel firms that have fallen on hard times. \nUnfortunately, the loan guarantee wasn't as successful as we had hoped. \nDespite a guarantee of 85 percent by the Federal Government, private \ncreditors didn't step up to the plate and do their part to help our \nNation's steel industry.\n  So, despite our still growing economy, despite our efforts to date, \ndespite fiscal dilemmas in other parts of the world, we can't forget \nthe steel industry. With over 10,000 steelworkers out of jobs and \nimports still fluctuating, I want to go home and tell my constituents \nin the steel pipe and tube industry that we have a solution to their \nwoes. Let's send a clear signal to our trading partners, to our \nfarmers, and to our manufacturers that we don't intend to stand by and \nlose more and more jobs because of unfair trading practices.\n  I thank my colleagues for helping me draft this legislation and I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues on the Finance Committee to \nhaving hearings, to marking up this important piece of legislation, and \nenacting it into law.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, \nSenators Durbin, Hollings, and Byrd, in introducing the Trade Law \nReform Act of 2001. It has been far too long, well over a decade in \nfact, since the last general reform of our trade laws, and current \ncircumstances, particularly the ongoing steel crisis that has resulted \nin 18 American steel companies declaring for bankruptcy since 1997, \nnecessitate the prompt action of Congress.\n  Nothing short of section 201 can save the American steel industry. I \nhave written President Bush twice since he took office in January \nurgently pleading with him to initiate a section 201 case before the \nInternational Trade Commission. In the time between my first and second \nletters, five U.S. steelmakers filed for bankruptcy. Imports have \ncontinued at record levels and prices have not rebounded. Absent a \nSection 201, any measures we take up in the Congress to redress the \nsteel crisis are akin to rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.\n  Despite the necessity of an immediate section 201 on steel, we must \nnot cease in our efforts to improve the proper functioning of our trade \nlaws. The safeguard, countervailing duty, and anti-dumping laws are \nvital to the manufacturing sector of our economy. They are often the \nfirst and last line of defense for U.S. industries injured by unfairly \nor illegally traded imports. Companies, workers, families, and \ncommunities rely heavily on these laws to prevent the ill-effects of \nunfair trade by our trading partners.\n  Unfortunately, recent events like the steel import crisis have \ndemonstrated how painfully inadequate our current trade laws are in \nresponding to rapid import surges. The flooding of U.S. markets with \nunfairly or illegally traded steel has caused severe and irreparable \nharm to our steelworkers, their families, and communities, and it is \nhigh time we revisit our trade laws in an effort to make our laws more \nresponsive to the changing realities of the global economy. In the case \nof steel, I refer to the problem of foreign steel overcapacity that \ncontinually finds its way into the open U.S. market where it seriously \ninjures our domestic steel manufacturers.\n  The reforms we are proposing today fall into three categories. Title \nI of the act improves the ability of our safeguard laws, often referred \nto as section 201, to adequately respond to import surges such as the \nflood of cheap steel that began to hit U.S. shores in 1997 and has not \nyet abated. Section 201 allows U.S. producers to obtain relief from \nserious injury that is substantially caused by imports even in the \nabsence of unfair trade. However, the current U.S. safeguard standard \nfor proving that a U.S. industry has been seriously injured by imports \nis stricter than the corresponding standard in the WTO Safeguards \nAgreement, a discrepancy which places U.S. manufacturers at a \ndisadvantage with regard to their foreign trading partners. Whereas a \nforeign producer must prove only that an import surge, like the current \nsteel import crisis, is a cause of injury, domestic producers are \nhindered by our trade laws which require our domestic industry to prove \nthat the imports are a substantial cause of injury.\n\n  This inequity hampers the ability of our domestic industries to \nobtain relief from unfairly traded imports and creates an unequal \nplaying field on which\n\n[[Page S5800]]\n\nour foreign trading partners have an advantage. It also contributes to \nmaking the U.S. the premiere dumping ground for illegal and unfairly \ntraded imports, particularly in the case of steel. Our trading partners \nknow the U.S. injury standard is high, and they exploit that fact. \nTitle I simply brings the U.S. safeguard law with respect to the injury \ntest into line with the WTO standard, thereby putting our domestic \nindustries on equal footing with the rest of the world. Title I also \ncontains other language to make section 201 more effective, such as \nprovisions that expand the availability of early and meaningful \nprovisional relief and more rapidly and effectively address import \nsurges.\n  Title II of this legislation updates our anti-dumping and \ncountervailing duty laws to make them more effective for a rapidly-\nchanging marketplace. First, the bill makes it tougher for our trading \npartners to circumvent an anti-dumping or countervailing duty order. No \nlonger will foreign nations be able to skirt around our laws by making \nslight alterations to the products they are exporting to the U.S. This \nlegislation clarifies that antidumping and countervailing duty orders \ninclude products that have been changed in only minor respects.\n  In addition, the bill provides that the ITC cannot conclude that \nimports do not have a significant effect on domestic prices simply on \nthe basis of the magnitude or stability of the volume of imports. This \nallows the Commission to take into account the fact that in some cases \nand for some industries, even small volumes of imports can have \nsignificant price effects and negatively impact the domestic industry.\n  Title III creates a steel import monitoring program designed to act \nas an early notification system when imports begin flooding the U.S. \nmarket. When the steel import surge began in July 1997, it was many \nmonths, even close to a year, before anyone in the administration would \neven admit that there was a spike in imports that was potentially \nharmful to the domestic industry. During that time, companies went \nbankrupt and thousands of steelworkers were laid off.\n  These provisions will make it easier to track imports and provide \nmuch quicker notification of potentially harmful import surges. Quite \nsimply, the sooner we learn of unfair import surges, the sooner the \nadministration, Congress, and the industry itself can take the \nnecessary steps to provide steelworkers and steel companies with the \nrelief they deserve.\n  By recognizing the changed reality of the international marketplace \nand how quickly import surges become major crises, the bill being \nintroduced today provides much needed improvements of our trade laws. \nToo many of the current provisions designed to provide relief to our \ndomestic manufacturing sector have been antiquated by recent changes in \nthe global economy and the structure of international trade. It is time \nwe reaffirm our commitment to our manufacturing base by updating and \nenhancing the very laws designed to protect U.S. manufacturers from \nunfair and illegal imports from abroad. The Trade Law Reform Act of \n2001 does just that.\n  Once again, I must reiterate that only an immediate section 201 on \nsteel can preserve basic steelmaking capacity in the United States. \nWhile this bill cannot solve the steel crisis by itself, it does \nrepresent a significant step in the right direction.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FITZGERALD (for himself and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 980. A bill to provide for the improvement of the safety of child \nrestraints in passenger motor vehicles, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, late last year, Congress passed the \nTransportation Recall Enhancement Accountability and Documentation, or \nTREAD Act. That new law includes a bill I authored, the Child Passenger \nAct of 2000, which requires the Department of Transportation to update \nits standards on child safety seats for infants and toddlers. Today, I \nrise to introduce another bill, which represents the next step in our \neffort to ensure that all of our Nation's children are adequately \nprotected in motor vehicle crashes.\n  The purpose of this bill is to encourage greater use of booster \nseats, and thereby reduce the number of traffic fatalities and injuries \nto young children. Booster seats are seat belt positioning devices that \nare designed to protect children who have outgrown their car seats but \nare still too physically small to fit properly in an adult-sized safety \nbelt.\n  Safety advocates have coined the term ``forgotten child'' to describe \nthe average occupant of a passenger vehicle who is at least 4 years \nold, but usually less than 8 or 9 years old, and less than 4'9\" tall. \nAccording to the National Highway traffic Safety Administration, or \nNHTSA, only about 6 percent of children between the ages of 4 and 8 \nyears currently use booster seats when riding in motor vehicles. Too \noften, the child in this category has outgrown his child safety seat \nand is inappropriately placed in an adult-sized safety belt without a \nbelt-positioning booster, or worse still, left completely unrestrained.\n  Three-point shoulder and lap belts, even those in the back seat where \nit's recommended that children sit, currently are not made or tested \nfor children. Children who are graduated at 40 pounds or so directly \nfrom their child safety seat to adult seatbelts can suffer serious \nharm, say researchers. In some crashes, the seatbelts don't restrain \nthe child. In others, they do, but the shoulder belt that cuts across \nthe small child's neck, and the lap belt that rides high over her \nabdomen, cause severe internal injuries to the liver, spleen, \nintestines and spinal cord. Medical doctors have characterized such \ninjuries as ``lap belt syndrome.''\n  Parents obviously want to do what is best for their children. Safety \nrestraint use for children under a year old is 97 percent, and 91 \npercent for children ages one to four. These high usage rates are due \nin part to the education and outreach that has occurred through the \nOccupant Protection Incentive Grants Program, enacted in 1998. The \nauthorization for that annual, $7.5 million grant program is about to \nexpire. The legislation that I am introducing would extend the program \nfor an additional two years.\n  To an even greater extent. These high restraint usage rates for \ninfants and toddlers are due to the enactment of mandatory child \nrestraint usage laws in all 50 states. There is no similar uniform \nrequirement for booster seat use, and there are very serious gaps in \nstate laws regarding child restraint generally. For example, some \nstates require seatbelts only for children sitting in the front seat, \nand others only require children to wear seatbelts if they are younger \nthan 5 or 6 years. According to NHTSA, for children between age five \nand fifteen, restraint use is only 68.7 percent, and NHTSA data for \n1998 shows that over 47 percent of fatally injured children ages four \nto seven are completely unrestrained.\n  Education is critical to closing this safety gap. A recent survey of \n1,000 parents and care givers conducted by NHTSA and DaimlerChrysler \nrevealed that about 96 percent of parents and caregivers did not know \nthe correct age for which a child no longer requires a booster seat or \nchild safety seat.\n  We know booster seats save lives, yet the overwhelming majority of \nstates don't require them. Only three states, Arkansas, California, and \nWashington, have adopted mandatory booster seat laws. Recent attempts \nto pass meaningful legislation in other states, including my home state \nof Illinois, have failed.\n  One obstacle that is holding back the states from adopting stronger \nlaws is the lack of a Federal performance standard for booster seats \nfor children who weigh more than 50 pounds. The legislation I am \nintroducing today would give the Secretary of Transportation two years \nin which to come up with a new performance standard for booster seats. \nThat standard would, of course, cover all children in booster seats, \nincluding those who are heavier than 50 pounds.\n  In addition, this bill provides strong incentives for states to adopt \nresponsible highway safety laws. It would extend grant money to states \nif they adopt seat belt laws for all children under the age of 16 as \nwell as booster seat laws for some of these children.\n  Many passenger cars have only a lap belt in the rear, center seating \nposition\n\n[[Page S5801]]\n\nof the vehicle, which generally means that you cannot install a booster \nseat there. Yet safety advocates say that the rear, center seating \nposition is generally the safest place for a child to be in the event \nof a crash. To close this safety gap, my bill also would require the \ninstallation of lap and shoulder belts in each of the rear seats of \nnewly manufactured passenger vehicles offered for sale in the United \nStates. That new requirement,which may be phased in over a three-year \nperiod, is based on a recommendation of the National Transportation \nSafety Board.\n  In closing, comprehensive medical data evidencing the benefits of \nbooster seats is still being developed; and a lot of states have yet to \nadopt adequate safety belt laws. I believe that the safety of the \n``forgotten'' child is extremely important, and we need to consider all \nof the tools at our disposal to advance it. I therefore urge my \ncolleagues to support this important measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 980\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I want to take just a few minutes at \nthe closing to congratulate some key individuals, starting with Senator \nChuck Grassley of Iowa. Senator Grassley has worked doggedly to get \nthis tax bill completed. He has done an artful, masterful job. He has \nworked with numbers of individuals--everybody in the Congress, in the \nHouse, the Senate, the White House--in order to get this bill on \nthrough. He deserves our applause and great thanks and appreciation. \nSenator Max Baucus led on the\n\n[[Page S5803]]\n\nDemocrat side. He did a great job as well on getting this bill and \nmoving it on through.\n  I also want to recognize our leadership, Trent Lott and Don Nickles \nin particular, both of them, in their aggressive efforts to get this \ntax bill, this tax cut that is needed by the American economy, that is \ndeserved by the American public, on through the system. Without their \nefforts, it would not have taken place.\n  Of course, I also want to recognize and thank the House of \nRepresentatives, Chairman Thomas on the Ways and Means Committee, \nSpeaker Hastert, and people there who pushed this bill on through so it \ncould get done.\n  Finally, I recognize the person who, a year ago, started talking \nabout the need for major tax relief in this country, and that is \nPresident George W. Bush, who put this forward in the campaign. I might \nnote that was accompanied by a fair amount of consternation on the part \nof a number of people, saying it is too big, too much; we cannot afford \nto do this; it is not the right thing, it is not the right time--all of \nwhich proved to be false. He was right. The American economy needs \nthis. The American people deserve this. This is the right time. It is \nthe right place. Now we are going to do that $1.35 trillion worth of \ntax relief for which the President has asked.\n\n  If you are getting a headache coming on, most people would say take \nan aspirin before it really sets in hard. If you get a recession that \nis coming on, and a downturn in the economy, most economists would note \nto you: Act early and act surely and act clearly to try to prevent \nthat. The Federal Reserve has done that by easing the monetary supply \nand lowering interest rates five times. Five times the Federal Reserve \nhas done that in anticipation of a slowing economy, saying we are going \nto do everything we can to keep this economy from going into recession. \nEconomists would say that is monetary policy.\n  There is fiscal policy on the other side. In fiscal policy, you cut \ntaxes if you anticipate a slowing of the economy. You need to do so \nclearly. You need to do so in ways that stimulate the economy, and you \nneed to do it early before recession sets in. It is similar to that \nheadache: If it starts pounding and you take two aspirin, it doesn't do \nmuch. But if you start much earlier, when it is just starting, then you \ncan pull back out of it.\n  The same is true with fiscal policy. We needed this tax cut for the \neconomy. Rate reduction is the key way to do that. This is primarily \nabout rate reduction, although it has great provisions on marriage \npenalty relief, educational savings relief, death taxes, and a number \nof different provisions in the bill--retirement security, adoption tax \ncredits so people can be in a better position to afford the cost of \nadoption.\n  This is what the doctor ordered. This is what the economists have \nsaid we need and we need to do now. This should be the package enabling \nus to assure that the economy, while slowing, does not go into \nrecession. This is exactly what the doctor ordered.\n  The individuals who led in this effort should be commended and \nrecognized and given a real attaboy for seeing this early and putting \nus in the situation where now we are in the latter part of May putting \nthis through and getting it done now, before we really could get into \nsome trouble spots.\n  I think this is exactly the appropriate thing for management of this \ngreat economy in the United States that has had some difficulties here \nlately, for us to do the right thing. The individuals I mentioned \ncertainly deserve our praise and accolades for getting it done.\n  This is a great day for the country. It is an important day for the \neconomy. It is a necessary day for the economy. It is the right thing \nand a deserved day for the American taxpayers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for a period of 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for that purpose.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Chair. (The remarks of Mr. Rockefeller \npertaining to the introduction of S. 981 are located in today's Record \nunder ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
