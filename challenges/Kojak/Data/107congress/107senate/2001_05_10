In all they do, may we be privileged \nto see their love for truth, justice, compassion, liberty, and peace.\n  Lord God, we are mindful of the human cost that each bears by being a \nSenator. Each is first and foremost a child of God, and to be true to \nYou, we offer sincere and honest prayers for the personal well-being of \neach Senator.

JOHN JOHNSON\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I have the privilege of welcoming our guest \nChaplain, the Reverend John Johnson. We are indeed fortunate to have \nReverend Johnson with us today. He is a true Renaissance man and public \nservant. He brings to us his vast experience, not only in the ministry, \nbut also in academia, business, law, and volunteerism.\n  Reverend Johnson has a master's degree in physics. He studied as a \nChurchill Scholar at Cambridge University in England. He has a Juris \nDoctor degree from the University of Chicago. And he has had a \nsuccessful business career, creating a leading technology company.\n  Not content to stop there, Reverend Johnson earned his Master's of \nDivinity degree in 1997 and now is ordained as a minister in the \nPresbyterian Church. Reverend Johnson currently serves as interim \nminister at the First Presbyterian Church in Merrillville, Indiana.\n  Amidst these multiple careers he even found time to run for the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives in 1990 from Indiana's Fifth District and for \nthe Indiana Republican gubernatorial nomination in 1992.\n  Reverend Johnson has remained active in the academic community, and \nhe has generously volunteered his time to many organizations including \nthe United Way Campaign, the YMCA, the Indiana Corporation for Science \nand Technology, and the Public Broadcasting System.\n  He is a dear personal friend. It is a privilege to thank him for \njoining us and for his inspiring words of prayer for us this morning.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I join the Senator from Indiana in welcoming \nto the Senate the Reverend Mr. Johnson. We are grateful for his \npresence and for his prayer.\n  Tennyson said that more things are wrought by prayer than this world \ndreams of. And the Bible tells us that blessed is the Nation whose God \nis the Lord. Thank God for our forefathers who built this Nation on \nreligious principles, who had faith in a higher power. If Providence \nhad designs for this country and its people, may we never get away from \nthe offering of prayer in the opening of the two bodies of the \nlegislative branch of government.\n  There are those in this country who would have us do away with that. \nMay there always be men and women in this body and the other body who \nwill stand for prayer, stand up for the Creator.\n  I haven't seen Him, nor have I seen electricity. But I dare not put \nmy finger in an open socket because I know it is there.\n  I thank the Senator for having his minister in our midst this \nmorning.\n\n[[Page S4776]]\n\n May God add his blessings to the word that has been spoken for us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/10/senate-section/article/S4776-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of the conference report to \naccompany H. Con. Res. 83, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Conference report to accompany the concurrent resolution \n     (H. Con. Res. 83) establishing the congressional budget for \n     the United States Government for fiscal year 2002, revising \n     the congressional budget for the United States Government for \n     fiscal year 2001, and setting forth appropriate budgetary \n     levels for each of fiscal years 2003 through 2011.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from West Virginia is now recognized for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, would the Chair kindly inform me when I have \nused 25 minutes of my time?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will notify the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate will soon vote on the conference \nreport for the fiscal year 2002 budget resolution. I will vote against \nthis conference report. This budget is a bad deal for America. It fails \nto address critical deficiencies in our Nation's schools, our Nation's \nhighways, our Nation's drinking water and sewage systems, our Nation's \nlaw enforcement, and energy independence. The list goes on and on like \nTennyson's brook--almost forever. Instead of addressing these \ndeficiencies, instead of planning for the future, this is a budget \nresolution that places short-term, partisan political gratification \nahead of the long-term needs of the Nation.\n  This Nation faces daunting challenges--if you drove in just this \nmorning to work, or yesterday morning, you can see what I am talking \nabout, the daunting challenges that confront this country on the \nhighways--in the next two decades. We will continue increasingly to \nface those daunting challenges.\n  The baby boom generation will begin to retire around the year 2008. \nThat is not far away. Because of the demands of that generation, both \nthe Social Security and Medicare trust funds are expected to be running \nin the red by 2016--15 years from now. Not a single dime--not one thin \ndime--is devoted to shoring up Social Security, and the resources \nallotted to Medicare and prescription drugs are totally inadequate.\n  We know that 75 percent of our Nation's school buildings are \ninadequate to meet the needs of the Nation's children. But how many \ndollars are devoted to building and renovating school buildings? How \nmany dollars are devoted to making classrooms smaller? Zero. Zilch. \nZip.\n  The American Society of Civil Engineers, earlier this spring, graded \nthe Nation's infrastructure. How did we do? Abysmally. Roads, D+; \naviation,\nD-; schools, D-; transit, D-; drinking water, D. Overall, in 10 \ndifferent categories, the Nation's infrastructure received an average \ngrade of D+.\n  Now my old coal miner dad would have given me a good thrashing if I \nhad brought home a report card with a D on it. I could have depended on \nthat. Well, the dog must have eaten that report card on the way to the \nWhite House because this conference report ignores low grades on the \nNation's infrastructure.\n  Now the President--and I have great respect for the President--is \nfond of saying we ought to give the people their money back. I think we \nought to give the people their money's worth. Instead of a massive tax \ncut today, we ought to look toward tomorrow and repair our outdated \ninfrastructure. Instead of a massive tax cut today, we ought to help \nprovide for safe highways and bridges, airports and transit systems \nthat work, clean air, safe drinking water, safe schools. We ought to \nplan ahead to ensure that Social Security and Medicare will be \navailable in the long term. The American people expect us to make smart \nchoices. This conference report is not a smart choice.\n  What is in this conference report?\n  It contains a $1.35 trillion tax cut spread out over the next 11 \nyears, based solely on an illusory surplus estimate that even the \nCongressional Budget Office considers highly unlikely.\n  This budget also establishes discretionary spending levels that are \ntotally inadequate and unrealistic. For the next fiscal year, the \nbudget limits spending to a 4.2-percent increase. For nondefense \nprograms, the level provided in the conference report is $5.5 billion \nbelow the level necessary to keep pace with inflation.\n\n  Now I am wearing my Appropriations Committee hat today. I am the \nranking member on the Senate Appropriations Committee. Let me say to my \ncolleagues, you will be coming to the waterhole--I think of the animals \nin the forest. Occasionally, they have to go to the waterhole. They \ncan't avoid it. And so the people of this country have to go to the \nwaterhole. The waterhole is the Appropriations Committees of the two \nHouses. And Senators and House Members who represent the people who \nelect them and send them here also have to go to that waterhole, the \nAppropriations Committee. Well, I am wearing my appropriations hat \ntoday.\n  Let me say to my colleagues, if you vote for this budget conference \nreport, don't come to the watering hole. It is not that I would not \nlove to help you, but you are going to make it impossible. Those who \nvote for this conference report are going to make it impossible for me \nand for the Appropriations subcommittee ranking members to help you. \nHear me: I would love to help you, but you are going to make it \nimpossible when you vote for this conference report, because you are \ngoing to cut discretionary spending levels to the point that we cannot \nhelp you.\n  Again, for nondefense programs, the level provided in the conference \nreport is $5.5 billion below the level necessary to keep pace just with \ninflation. This level will leave no resources for increases that we all \nrecognize are necessary for education, for infrastructure, for research \nand development, and for the promotion of our energy independence. We \nhave an energy shortage in this country right now--rolling brownouts. \nYou are going to hear more about them. But what are we doing about it? \nWe are not doing anything positively in this budget conference report. \nI will tell you what we are doing. We are cutting the moneys for basic \nresearch--fossil fuel research--in the budget.\n  The increases being debated on the floor for elementary and secondary \neducation cannot be fully funded. The resolution provides for an \nincrease of less than $13 billion above fiscal year 2001 for all \nnondefense programs. The elementary and secondary education\n\n[[Page S4777]]\n\nbill now pending in the Senate assumes over $10 billion in increases \nfor fiscal year 2002 just for elementary and secondary education \nprograms alone. And all we have is less than $13 billion.\n  Members should be under no illusions. The budget conference report is \nnot the budget resolution that passed the Senate 65-35 last month. \nSeveral of our Democratic colleagues voted for that, and a great \nmajority on the other side did so, too. But you are not voting today \nfor that concurrent resolution on the budget that you voted for a \ncouple of weeks ago on this Senate floor. For fiscal year 2002 alone, \nthe conference report you will be voting for today is $27 billion below \nthe resolution that passed the Senate a few days ago--$10 billion lower \nfor defense and $17 billion lower for nondefense.\n  Now the President has called this a ``people's budget.'' Imagine \nthat. The President called this a ``people's budget.'' I would almost \nlaugh out loud if it weren't so serious. Imagine that--the President \ncalling this a ``people's budget.'' Well, that may be true if your \ndefinition of ``the people'' is limited to those lucky individuals who \nearn six-figure salaries. If you limit ``the people'' in your State to \nthose who are spending their mornings sipping Starbucks coffee and \nperusing the Wall Street Journal to check on the status of their stocks \nand bonds, then you are talking about the people.\n  It may be a people's budget if the people are limited to those lucky \nsouls who spend their winters in the Bahamas and their summers on a \nCaribbean cruise. But this is not a people's budget for the coal \nminers, not for the locomotive engineers, not for the brakemen on the \nrailroads, not for the cleaning ladies, not for the schoolteachers. It \nis not a people's budget for the folks flipping hamburgers for minimum \nwage. Ask them. They are the people, too, and they have been left out, \no-u-t, and left behind in this whale of a deal for the well-to-do.\n  President Bush, the President of all the people of the Nation, says:\n\n       It's a good budget for the working people of America.\n\n  He said it. I didn't say that. That may be true if your definition of \n``working'' means calling your broker on your cell phone to tell him to \nput another million on titanium futures. That may be true if your \ndefinition of ``working people'' is the folks who hop in their Learjets \nto check out their business interests on three continents.\n  In my State of West Virginia, we know who the working people are. The \nworking people are the people who earn their living by the sweat of \ntheir brow. They are the people who get up early and stay up late \ntrying to make ends meet. They are the working people. They are the \npeople who get their hands dirty while trying to feed their families. \nThose are the working people.\n  Working people are the teachers struggling on low pay in a hot \nclassroom while trying to impart some wisdom to our Nation's children.\n  The working people are the cops on the beat who risk their lives \ndaily and nightly, who try to keep some order in these mean and \ndangerous streets and alleys.\n  Working people are the coal miners who end up crippled, who end up \nsick after long, long years of digging coal from the rugged Earth to \nproduce the electricity for this Senate Chamber, and to produce the \nelectricity for this Nation. They are the people who get their hands \ndirty. They are the people who wash the grime, the coal dust out of \ntheir eyelashes, out of the wrinkles in their faces, grown old too \nearly. They are the working people.\n  Mr. President, they are the working people, the coal miners, the \nwelders in the shipyard, the produce salesmen in the country, the \nfarmers who toil in the hot Sun of the June and July and August days. \nThey are the working people, Mr. President. They are not the people Mr. \nBush is talking about.\n  The President lauds this budget. He says it contains ``reasonable \nlevels of spending.'' That may be true if you think that costing the \nAmerican driving public nearly $6 billion a year because one-third of \nthis Nation's roads are in poor condition, is ``reasonable.''\n  Why don't we fix America's roads? If you think highway congestion is \nbad now, what will it be 5 years from now? Those of you who spent an \nhour and 10 minutes yesterday morning to drive ten miles to work in \nthis Capitol, if you think congestion is bad now, think of what \ncongestion will be 5 years from now. What will it be 10 years from now?\n  The President calls the spending levels in this budget \n``reasonable.'' In this Nation, we have so many unsafe or obsolete \nbridges that it will cost $10.6 billion every year for the next 20 \nyears to fix them.\n  We have 54,000 drinking water systems which will cost $11 billion to \nmake them comply with Federal water regulations.\n  We have more than 2,100 unsafe dams in this country. Do we recall \nBuffalo Creek Dam in southern West Virginia? It broke several years \nago. Scores of lives were lost. And there are 2,100 unsafe dams in this \ncountry today which could cause loss of life.\n  We have energy delivery systems which rely on old technology.\n  We have outdated and crumbling schools which will require $3,800 per \nstudent to modernize.\n  This budget provides little or no money to address any of these \nneeds. It allows for current services adjusted for inflation for all \ndiscretionary programs, including defense. Do you know what that means? \nBut for nondefense programs, the conference report is $5.5 billion \nbelow the amount necessary to keep pace with inflation. It means this \nNation is essentially frozen in its ability to address backlogs or to \nanticipate needs.\n  The backlogs are worsening, and the needs are going unaddressed \nbecause the funding levels endorsed by this White House are far too \nlow.\n  Anyone who calls these levels ``reasonable'' needs a reality check. \nTake off the rose-colored glasses, Mr. President; take them off, and \nonce the warm cheery glow of tax cut fever has subsided, we will still \nhave a nation that is very steadily sliding backwards.\n  This huge tax cut will savage our nation's real and growing needs; it \nwill siphon energy away from the engine that makes this economy run; it \nwill benefit the jet set, but leave the rest of America's riding on \nrusty rails. There is nothing ``reasonable'' about such a policy.\n  I am also very concerned that this conference report does nothing to \naddress the growth of mandatory spending. The President claims that he \nwants to restrain the size of Government, but his budget focuses only \non limiting the part of the budget that is subject to the annual \nappropriations process. That is only one-third of the budget, and \ngrowing smaller by the day. The rest of the budget is on auto pilot.\n  I assure Senators that discretionary spending will not be the cause \nof any future deficits. It we return to deficits--and we very well \ncould--it will be because of the massive tax cuts contained in this \nconference report and the growth of mandatory programs. Discretionary \nspending is currently only 6.3 percent of the gross domestic product, \nless than half of what it was in 1967. Under the Budget resolution, it \nwould fall to 5 percent by 2011. Mandatory spending is currently 9.7 \npercent of GDP, more than double the level in 1966 and under the Budget \nconference report, mandatory spending will grow to 11 percent of GDP in \n2011.\n  Not only does this resolution not constrain mandatory spending, it \nincludes seven new reserves that empower the House and Senate Budget \nCommittee chairmen to increase spending for mandatory programs.\n  I have a great deal of faith in our budget chairman, Mr. Domenici, \nand I have seen all the budget chairmen we have had in the Senate since \nthe Budget Act became law, but I do not care if it is a Republican or \nDemocrat chairman, I do not support giving that kind of power to any \nbudget chairman, Democrat or Republican. I would not want it myself if \nI were a chairman.\n  I am very concerned that these powers which are being given to the \nBudget Committee chairmen will be used in a partisan way.\n  This budget resolution was produced in negotiations between White \nHouse officials and the Republican leadership.\n  There was no involvement--none--of the Democratic Leadership or the \nranking members of the House and Senate Budget Committees. To add \ninsult to injury, this Budget Resolution would empower the Budget \nCommittee chairmen to allocate funding to mandatory programs with no \nassurances that the minority will be consulted. This is just one more \nexample of the one-sided nature of this Budget Resolution. But as \nMilton said in Paradise\n\n[[Page S4778]]\n\nLost ``who overcomes by force has overcome but half his foe.'' There is \nno balance in this budget. It is tipped too far to the tax cut side. As \na see-saw, it lifts some people up with generous tax givebacks, but it \nleaves this nation's needs sitting firmly on the ground.\n  It is a ``for show'' budget designed to please a select group, and it \nwas gussied up and trotted out by one party from behind locked doors.\n  Since January's inauguration, we have heard plenty of lip service \nbeing paid to bipartisanship. Lip service. We have all heard the mantra \nthat the tone of Washington is being changed. You better believe--it is \nnot being changed. We have seen the photo-ops of Democrats being \ncourted at the White House. All 535 Members of the House and Senate \nwere invited to the White House a few days ago. All 535 Members. What a \nsham. That was to be a photo op. Nothing more, nothing less. What a \nsham. What hypocrisy. This budget deal was crafted without input from \nthe Democratic Leaders, or the Ranking Members of the House and Senate \nBudget Committees. When it was time for the rubber to meet the road, \nbipartisanship had a flat tire. Bipartisanship never was able to wiggle \nunder the cracks in that door. Some Democrats may be willing to vote \nfor this budget--they may be willing to sit at the President's table \nfor this tax-cut feast. But, make no mistake, they were not in the \nkitchen when the meal was being cooked. They did not get to decide what \nwent in the stew and what stayed out.\n  The President, in his remarks congratulated the Republican Budget \nCommittee chairmen of the House and the Senate. He congratulated the \nRepublican Leaders of the Senate and the House. He lauds a few \nDemocrats, but there is no mention in his remarks of the Democratic \nLeaders or the Ranking Members of the House and Senate Budget \nCommittees. They were not privy to the budget pseudo-conference. There \nwas no room for them at the inn. That is no accident. The plain \nunvarnished truth is that there has been barely a pinch of \nbipartisanship in the cooking of this final budget omelet, and the \nresult certainly shows in the one-sided way the budget eggs were \nscrambled.\n  There simply is not enough money to adequately fund the 13 \nappropriations bills, get that--there is not enough money to adequately \nfund the 13 appropriation bills, and so, once again, appropriators will \nhave to scrimp and parse and cannibalize in order to do our work.\n  For those Senators who vote for this budget deal, I say go ahead and \nwrite your press releases. Pat yourselves on the back. Tell your \nconstituents how you voted to cut taxes. That is an easy vote. But \ndon't forget to tell your constituents about the other side of that \ncoin. Be sure and include that in your press release. Don't forget to \ntell your constituents that you voted to shortchange our schools, \nroads, and water systems; don't forget to include in your press \nrelease, that you voted for lower funding for health care and energy \nresearch; and be sure to include in your press releases that you turned \na blind eye to the looming crises facing Social Security and Medicare. \nIn 1981, we took what Majority Leader Howard Baker called a riverboat \ngamble with President Reagan's tax cut and we ended up with triple \ndigit deficits for fifteen years. Now the Republican Leadership has \nforced upon us another bad deal. A deal that will reduce revenues, \naccording to the Joint Tax Committee, by nearly $300 billion per year \nin 2011 and beyond at just the moment that the baby boom generation \nbegins to retire.\n  This conference report makes a mockery of the Budget Act because it \nundermines the purpose of the act. The Budget Act was intended to \nimpose predictability and discipline. But the continual manipulation of \nthe Budget Act to achieve political goals has made it a sham and a \nshame. Gimmicks and bad policy are the result--gimmicks and bad policy. \nThe demands of a great nation have to be satisfied in spite of fantasy \nworld budgets. The result will probably be that at the end of the \nprocess, yet another Budget Resolution will have been ignored because \nit had to be. It was never grounded in reality. In spite of the \nPresident's claims that he would change things in Washington, he has \nalready succumbed to the same old partisan polo game, and the same old \nswap shop budget bingo we have seen for years. This conference report \nought to be defeated.\n  Mr. President, Senators who vote for this budget conference report, \ncall your mother in advance of Mother's Day. If she is one of the baby \nboom generations, tell her you voted for this tax cut for the bigwigs. \nTell her: ``Yes, mother, I voted for the Bush tax cut.''\n  But as to Social Security? There wasn't a dime in the bill for Social \nSecurity. Forget it.\n  I close by this compliment from Milton from ``Paradise Lost,'' and I \noffer it to our budget ranking member, Kent Conrad.\n\n       Well hast thou fought the better fight, whose single hast \n     maintained against revolted multitudes the cause of truth.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, the very distinguished senior member of the Senate \nBudget Committee.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia said: Tell your mother on Mother's Day that you increased \ntaxes. If you turn to page 4 of the conference report, you will find \nthat the debt goes up from $5.6 trillion to $6.7 trillion--$1.1 \ntrillion.\n  As we left the last fiscal year, we ended with a $23 billion deficit, \nwhich we had reduced, over the 8 years, from $403 billion, and now this \nvery minute we are running a slight surplus. But when you vote for this \nparticular measure, and this is our main reason for appearing here this \nmorning, it is to remind everybody that this is Reaganomics II. It is \nhappening here today.\n  Let me speak advisedly. As the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia reminded us, I have been on the Budget Committee since its \ninstitution 25 years ago. I have been the chairman. I hasten to comment \nthat our distinguished ranking member, the Senator from North Dakota, \nhas done an outstanding job under the most difficult of circumstances.\n  Let me tell you about the difficult circumstances, because the very \nreason for our budget process 25 years ago was to give all the Members \na look-see at every facet of Government spending here in Washington. \nPrior to that time, we had 13 appropriations bills, we had 13 \nauthorizing bills, and the authorizers authorized without regard to \nappropriating and the appropriators appropriated without regard to the \nauthorization and the one--namely, defense--didn't know what education \nwas doing, or housing didn't know what the highways were doing.\n  So we got together in a comprehensive look-see, where the President \nwould submit his budget, we would go before the Budget Committee, and \nin detail, each one of the particular appropriations measures would be \ndebated, marked up, reported out, and then come to the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Here we passed this budget without having the President's budget. He \ndidn't give it until it had passed the House, until it had passed the \nSenate--absolutely ridiculous. Why? Because he couldn't sell his tax \ncut. He knew the great reason for the prosperity and comeback of our \nDemocratic Party is that we showed we were fiscally responsible. For 8 \nyears we gave us the greatest prosperity. But it is a sophomoric \napproach, this ``tax cuts, tax cuts, the Government is too big, the \nmoney belongs to you'' and all that nonsense--and not paying the bills. \nSo the President went to 28-some States. You can't sell a tax cut? He \ncouldn't sell beer on a troop train, I can tell you that right now.\n  He went everywhere, and he didn't sell his tax cut, so he rammed it, \nand the leadership on the other side of the aisle went along with it, \nand the media didn't report it. That is another reason I appear here, \nbecause this instrument is an atrocity, a clear, absolute abuse of the \nprocess.\n  We had a deliberate debate back when President Clinton came to office \nto find in what direction the country was going to head. Lyndon Johnson \nused to say: It is not whether I am conservative or whether I am \nliberal, it is whether I am headed in the right direction.\n  We debated. The President submitted his budget. We had 30 amendments \nbefore that Budget Committee. We reported it out, and the last \ninstrument--namely, reconciliation--was not\n\n[[Page S4779]]\n\npassed until August. We had a real old hoedown, and we said we were \ngoing to cut the size of Government. Yes, we were going to cut \nspending. And, yes, we were going to increase taxes.\n\n  When we increased Social Security taxes, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Texas said: They are going to hunt you Democrats down like dogs in \nthe street and shoot you.\n  Where is the Republican tax cut for Social Security? Instead, they \nare going to spend the Social Security trust fund. If you don't think \nso, come on up and I will give you a bet.\n  Congressman Kasich, chairman of the House Budget Committee, said: If \nthis thing works, I'll change parties.\n  Senator Packwood, Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said: If \nthis thing works, I'll give you my house in downtown Washington.\n  But it worked. We made a great comeback paying down the debt. Now \nsome strayers want to go along with this ``Cut taxes, cut taxes,'' and \nbuying the people's vote, when in essence the debt increases. It goes \nup.\n  We had no debate. We had no markup. We had no report. We passed it \nwithout all that. Then we got to the conference to be told we were not \ngoing to be conferees. Oh, they invite you to the White House when you \ncannot vote, you just stand up and grin and smile and bow. But when you \ngot a vote in the conference committee, they said no, you are not \ninvited back because you're not going to vote with us.\n  Thank God we weren't parliamentarians. He wouldn't agree. They fired \nhim. They would like to fire us. That is why they said we will give you \nall the rhetoric about education, because you look at the report after \nit comes out: Zero increase for education. What does that mean to us in \nthe game? It means you are going to have to get a majority of 60 votes \nin order to get your increase, whether it is for class size or whether \nit is for construction or whether it is for teacher counseling or any \nof these other things that we need in public education--namely, \nteachers' pay. No, you are not going to get it.\n  All of this exercise has been the best off-Broadway show, as they see \nit, because they are just smiling to themselves: We are going to \ndestroy this Government and we are just as much against education as we \nwere for that 20-year crusade to abolish the Education Department.\n  What happens on the so-called immediate rebate to get the economy \ngoing? By 94 votes to 6, every Republican voted for my $85 billion \nrebate plan. But instead of the instant rebate of $85 billion, they \ncame in here with $100 billion over 2 years, and they are going to go \nto the Finance Committee--you can read the reconciliation instructions, \nand they translate: We are going to use the stimulus dollars for tax \ncuts.\n  The main thing to be said this morning in the few minutes given me is \nthat we have tried our best under Senator Conrad's leadership. We have \ncalled their hand at every turn. We have been very courteous, very \ntactful in trying to get the report. We know the distinguished chairman \nof the Budget Committee has to practically do what the Senator from \nTexas tells him. And the Senator from Texas is tied into the Office of \nManagement and Budget. And the Office of Management and Budget tells \nthe President what he wants. So you want to get on the record how it is \nbeing worked this year: It is a total abuse, an absolute atrocity. \nThere is no question about it. Everybody seems to go along. And the \nheadline will say: We passed the budget. No. We don't even have a \ndefense figure.\n\n  We don't have a budget. We have a tax cut. That is what the President \nwanted. That is what they had back with Reaganomics I: $750 billion. \nNow this is going to go up to about $1.6 trillion. If you analyze it \ncarefully, it will probably be nearer to $2.6 trillion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the very outstanding Senator, who \nis a member of the Senate Budget Committee, Mr. Hollings from South \nCarolina, for his remarks this morning.\n  As I understand it, Senator Breaux wants time off of Senator \nDomenici's allocated time. The staff director for Senator Domenici \ntells me that is acceptable to their side.\n  We had lined up Senator Clinton to go next on our side. I don't know \nif Senator Breaux would like to go at this point.\n  I would like to recognize Senator Clinton.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Absolutely.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time would the Senator like?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Oh, 6 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from New York, an \noutstanding member of the Senate Budget Committee, who has made a real \ncontribution to the work on our side of the aisle on the Senate Budget \nCommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized for 6 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank my ranking member, the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, who, as my good friend from South Carolina has put \nso well, has led with honesty and directness, and believes so \npassionately in the issues that we are addressing today.\n  I rise because I cannot remain silent in the face of both a budget \nprocess and a budget product that I think will be so harmful to our \ncountry. I really wish I did not have to rise today. I wish, given the \nopportunities that lie before us as a nation, what we were debating was \nthe kind of balanced approach to the budget that I could wholeheartedly \nsupport--a balanced approach that included an affordable, reasonable \ntax cut, that fairly went to all Americans, giving every one of our \nfamilies a Mother's Day present, as Senator Byrd so wonderfully \nreminded us is around the corner.\n  I wish this budget were filled with the kind of careful analysis \nabout the investments that we need to make our country rich and smarter \nand stronger in the years ahead. And I wish this budget continued to \npay down the debt in the way that we had been doing.\n  In the last 3 years, we paid off more than $600 billion of our debt. \nWe took it off the backs of all these schoolchildren who are watching \nus. We said: We are not going to pass on the debts of your parents. \nYour grandparents, the greatest generation, did not leave us in debt \nthe way that this country did in the 1980s with the quadrupling of our \nnational debt. I cannot stand here and say that.\n  I look at all these faces. I meet with schoolchildren from throughout \nNew York nearly every day. I wish I could say: I am going to go to the \nSenate Chamber and support a budget that will invest in education the \nway we need it, that will continue to pay down the debt so that you are \nnot faced with that debt when you are my age, or even younger, and that \nit will invest in Social Security and Medicare so that you do not have \nto worry about your parents, your grandparents, or yourselves. \nUnfortunately, I cannot say that.\n\n  I have thought hard about what it is that has happened in the Senate \nin the last several months because I sat through 16 hearings in the \nBudget Committee. They were informative, very helpful hearings, laying \nout the priorities of our Nation, talking about the amount of money we \nhad that we could count on, not pie in the sky, not projections that \nwere unlikely ever to come true but realistically what it was we, as a \nnation, could count on. And then how could we have a tax cut, pay down \nthe debt, and invest in education, health care, the environment, as \nwell as taking care of Social Security and Medicare?\n  I do not exactly know what happened, how we arrived at this point. We \nhad those hearings, and then we were shut out of the process. We did \nnot have a markup, which is a device in a committee to get everybody \ntogether to try to hammer out a bill.\n  Then the Democrats, with decades of experience--with distinguished \nSenators such as Senator Hollings and Senator Conrad--were shut out of \nthe process between the House and the Senate.\n  So here we are today on the brink of passing a tax cut that will, I \nbelieve, do to our country what was done in the 1980s. I can only think \nthat this is a tax cut proposal that was born in the passion of a \nprimary political campaign, in the snows of New Hampshire, when the \nPresident was running for his life to be President and had to come up \nwith something, so he plucked out of the air $1.6 trillion and said \nthat was\n\n[[Page S4780]]\n\nwhat it was going to be and felt compelled to come and present it to \nus.\n  I was proud of the Senate when, in the process of the budget debate, \nwe made some good changes. We made those changes not only on the tax \ncut side but on the investment side. I thought: If the House can go \nalong with that, maybe at the end of the process we can have a better \nbalance. I did not think it went far enough, but I was proud of the \nfact that we had a negotiation.\n  What we have today has zero increases in education. We have spent a \nheck of a long time talking about education. The President says it is \nhis first priority. I can only look at the documents I am handed. I \nhave only been handed them recently. I was not part of the process, \neven though I serve on the Budget Committee. And it looks to me as if \nwe are turning our back on education.\n  As I thought back, I could not think of any analogy, I could not \nthink of any guidance that would help illuminate what it is we are \ngoing through. So I went back and looked at 1981. I read about what \nhappened when another President said: Pass this big tax cut, and we are \ngoing to have surpluses. And we went further and further and further in \ndebt.\n  It is always easier to pass a tax cut. Who doesn't want a tax cut? I \nwant a tax cut. But I don't want to have a tax cut at the expense of \nhurting my country. I don't want a tax cut at the expense of preventing \nthe kind of investment in education that we need. I don't want a tax \ncut where I have to go and tell my mother that Medicare may not be \nviable for the rest of her natural life. I don't want that kind of tax \ncut.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I give an additional minute to the Senator \nfrom New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. So I, with great regret, stand in this Chamber and \nexpress the disappointment I feel in that we had an opportunity to do \nwhat our country needs--to invest in education, health care, the \nenvironment, pay down our debt, and provide affordable tax cuts--but, \ninstead, we are taking a U-turn back to the 1980s. Mark my words, we \nwill be back here--maybe under the same President, or maybe under a \ndifferent President--having to fix the fiscal situation we are throwing \nour country into today. I lived through that once. I do not look \nforward to it. But I will be a responsible Member of this body in \ntrying to fix the problem that we are causing for our Nation because of \nthis tax cut and budget.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized for 10 minutes \noff Senator Domenici's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the ranking Democrat on the Budget \nCommittee for his consideration in allowing me to have the time that I \nneed to make comments on this budget. I also thank Senator Domenici for \nbeing willing to yield me some time.\n  Let me start, first, by commending Senator Conrad for the work that \nhe has done, under some very difficult circumstances, with regard to \nputting together this product. It has not been easy. It has been very \ndifficult. It has been very emotional--with a great deal of pressure on \nboth sides to try to come up with something that makes sense and that \nis a rational guideline for how we handle the affairs of this country \nover the next 2 years.\n  I also commend the Democratic leader, Senator Tom Daschle, as well as \nthe Republican leader, Senator Lott, because I know that within their \nown caucuses there are vast differences as to how we should approach \nthe passage of the budget for this coming year. It has not been an easy \njob for either of the budget leaders--Senator Conrad and Senator \nDomenici--or for our two respective leaders. I think they have both \ndone about as good a job as anyone could ever ask for them to do \nconsidering the circumstances.\n  Mr. President, and my colleagues, I will make the point that \ngoverning in a democracy is about the art of the possible; it is not \nabout the art of the perfect. Is this budget a perfect document? Of \ncourse not. But does it advance the cause of governing in a democracy \nthat is almost evenly divided among the two parties?\n  The answer is, yes, it does. Republicans, as we need to remind \nourselves, control the House with the narrowest of margins in years. \nThe President was elected after losing the popular vote and narrowly \nwinning the electoral college vote. Our Senate, indeed, is the perfect \ntie, 50/50.\n  Now is not the time, with these circumstances, to figure out how we \ncan disagree. There are plenty of opportunities to find where we \ndisagree with this document, but now is not the time to concentrate on \nhow we disagree but, rather, now is the time to figure out how we can \nreach an agreement for the good of all the people whom we represent.\n  It is very clear that we could have 535 budgets and each author would \nthink theirs is the best one. But we can only have one.\n  The two principal parts of this budget consist of how we handle \nrevenues or taxes and how we go about spending what is left, a \nchallenge every American family must make for themselves when they work \nout their family budgets. We are fortunate today to have what CBO tells \nus is a projected surplus of $5.6 trillion over the next 10 years. That \n$5.6 trillion is more than is necessary to run all of our Government \nfunctions at the current level.\n  Most Members, but not all Members, would say it is appropriate to \ngive a portion of that surplus back to the citizens who created that \nsurplus when they paid their taxes. The question then before this body \nis, How much do we give back?\n  President Bush said: Give back $1.6 trillion over the next 10 years. \nVice President Al Gore, as a candidate, suggested a tax cut of $500 \nbillion. This budget consists of a $1.25 trillion tax cut over the next \n10 years, plus a $100 billion stimulus package in the first 2 years. \nSome would think that is too high; others argue that it is far too low \nand not enough.\n  It is, in fact, sufficient to give money back to all Americans with a \nbalanced and a fair tax cut.\n  We can, within this budget, reduce all marginal rates. We can, within \nthis budget, create a new 10-percent bracket for lower income \nAmericans, which would also benefit all income Americans. We can, \nwithin this budget, reduce the estate tax to a level that almost \neliminates everyone from paying it. We can, within this budget, fix the \nalternative minimum tax problem. And we can, within this budget, \nincrease the child credit that families take. We can make it \nrefundable, and we can make it retroactive within this budget. And we \ncan help education within the tax structure of this budget by making \ntuition taxes deductible for all American families. We can, within this \nbudget's tax structure, fix the marriage penalty.\n  With regard to spending contained in this budget, it is important for \nus to put the figures in proper perspective. Last year our Democratic \nPresident, President Clinton, proposed a budget for discretionary \nspending calling for $614 billion. The House and Senate Republicans and \nthe budget, indeed, ended up saying we were going to spend $596 billion \nfor discretionary spending. We ended up spending $635 billion.\n  We did that because of emergencies that occurred during the year. We \ndid that because of new spending priorities that were brought to our \nattention during the year that were unforeseen at the time of the \nbudget enactment. This Congress responded to those needs as they \noccurred. This Congress will respond to those needs as they occur in \nthe upcoming months of this fiscal year.\n\n  This budget provides $661 billion in discretionary spending. That is \nwithout any emergency money being designated. It is not designated \nbecause it is clear that this Congress will add that emergency money as \nthe emergencies occur. If there is a hurricane, if there is an \nagricultural emergency, if there is an earthquake, if there are any \nother kinds of emergencies, it is clear, from the history of this body, \nthat this Congress will address those needs because they are true \nemergencies.\n  That $661 billion is a $26 billion increase over last year. That is a \n$47 billion increase more than President Clinton asked for last year \nwhen he submitted his budget to the Congress.\n\n[[Page S4781]]\n\n  I know some of my colleagues will argue that it is not enough, that \nwe don't have enough money, for instance, for education in this budget. \nMy reading on education is that there will be a lot more money than \nlast year for education, a lot more. President Bush has offered a $4.6 \nbillion increase for the Department of Education over last year's $18.3 \nbillion in spending. That is larger than the $3.6 billion President \nClinton won for this fiscal year.\n  As Senator Kennedy, who is the master of putting together good policy \ndeals, has said:\n\n       We have exceeded the budget every year in education \n     appropriations, and we are going to do it again.\n\n  That is a correct assessment of what we are going to do and have done \nin the past, when it comes to meeting the educational needs of the \npeople of this country. We will provide sufficient funds to educate our \nchildren.\n  It is important to bear in mind that most of the money for education \ncomes from the local and State levels. In fact, 94 percent, on average, \nof the money on education doesn't come from Washington; it comes from \nthe States; it comes from the local communities that fund the \neducational programs they determine are their priorities. On average, \nonly 6 percent of the total education budget comes from Washington, DC. \nThe money will be adequate to address the demands.\n  My recommendation is that we pass this imperfect document to allow \nthe Finance Committee and the Appropriations Committee to begin their \nwork. This document is important as an outline of our priorities, but \nit is written on paper. It is not written in concrete. It can and will \nbe modified as we have done so every single year as we move through the \nlegislative process.\n  This is a time of great emotion. It is a time of great pressure. Our \nleaders, Tom Daschle and Kent Conrad on the Budget Committee and also \nSenator Domenici and Senator Lott, have had a very difficult job trying \nto reach an agreement in truly a divided Government. I respect all of \nthem for their sincerity and their honesty and their dedication to try \nto reach an agreement that everyone can support.\n  It is, however, time for us to move ahead. There is other work to be \ndone. Now is the time to begin that work by adopting this budget and \nmoving on to the next step.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Breaux for his \nassessment of where things are. I think he included in his remarks that \nthere is still a contingency fund of $500 billion. For those who think \nwe ought to do other things and that we have to, that is still in this \nbudget. I think what Senator Breaux said about the appropriated account \nis right on the money. We don't know where the appropriators are going \nto put the money, no matter what we say in this Chamber.\n  But there is a $31 billion increase year over year, and $6.2 billion \nmore than the President asked for, if you really are talking apples and \napples and the money to be spent by the appropriators. I think Senator \nBreaux summarized that just about right. I thank him for his support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thought the distinguished Senator, my \nranking member, was going to yield to somebody on his side before he \nand I used our final time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator. The Senator from Minnesota requested \ntime. I yield 5 minutes to Senator Dayton.\n  Let me alert Senators on our side that I now have, other than the \nwrap-up reserved for Senator Domenici and myself, only have 2 minutes. \nI alert colleagues to the circumstance that exists.\n  I yield to the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Dayton, for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota for granting me this time, and also for his outstanding \nleadership on this issue on behalf of our Democratic caucus.\n  I rise to say that I intend to vote against this budget today because \nI believe it allocates too much to the richest Americans and too little \nto our schoolchildren, senior citizens, veterans, and most of our other \ncitizens. It also wrongly provides a blank check for additional \nmilitary spending without congressional review or approval.\n\n  This budget purports to be a bipartisan creation. In fact, I am told \nthat the Democratic Senators on the Senate-House conference committee \nwere completely excluded from the deliberations and decisions about \nthis budget agreement. As a result, a bipartisan Senate amendment to \nincrease funding for elementary and secondary education was eliminated. \nThe amendment of my colleague, Senator Wellstone, which increased \nfunding for veterans' programs, was eliminated. Funds for farm aid, \nprescription drug coverage, Head Start, health care, child care, \ntransportation, and other important government services were reduced. \nExcept for military spending, all other federal government \ndiscretionary services were cut by 2 percent below their inflation-\nadjusted baselines.\n  Why? Why, despite huge projected budget surpluses, must the funds for \nthese essential public services be denied? For a tax cut which favors \nthe rich, rather than working, middle-income Americans.\n  There is enough surplus projected to provide immediate tax cuts and \nrate reductions for all American taxpayers, so long as they are \ntargeted to the first tax brackets. Unfortunately, this budget places \ngreed ahead of need. People who already have the most get even more, \nwhile people who have the least receive even less.\n  There is no compassion in this budget. There is no bipartisanship in \nthis budget. There is no new education funding to ``leave no child \nbehind'' in this budget. Its pretenses are a sham. Its promises are a \nscam.\n  Furthermore, this budget expressly does not protect either the Social \nSecurity or the Medicare Trust Funds from being raided for other \nspending programs. Instead, it sets up an all-purpose contingency fund, \nwhich pretends to cover every imagined funding need. First, however, it \nmust fund a literal blank check for whatever additional military \nspending the Secretary of Defense shall recommend to the chairmen of \nthe Senate and House Budget Committees. In an unprecedented procedure, \nwith no further congressional review or approval, these two men alone \ncan add whatever amounts of additional spending are proposed by the \nSecretary of Defense. Thus, this budget provides blank checks for the \nmilitary, big checks for the rich, and bounced checks due to \n``insufficient funds'' for all other Americans.\n  I support, and will vote for, a large tax cut benefiting all \nMinnesota taxpayers. I also support, and will fight for, additional \nfederal funds for special education, for student aid, for prescription \ndrug coverage, for farm price supports, for veterans' health care, for \nflood victims, and for other important government services. I believe \nin a balanced budget. I believe we have enough resources available to \nus to improve the quality of life for our citizens and to reduce taxes. \nI believe this budget squanders that opportunity. That is why I am \nvoting against it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eighteen minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota.\n  I think this budget proposal on the part of my Republican colleagues \nshould be called ``leave no dollars behind'' when it comes to Robin-\nHood-in-reverse tax cuts with over 40 percent of the benefits going to \nthe top 1 percent of the population. That is what we have.\n  I had an amendment to provide $17 billion for veterans' health care \nover the next 10 years, filling in the gaps to make sure we would do \nwell and say thanks to our veterans--eliminated.\n  I joined with Senator Harkin to provide $250 billion for education, \nafterschool programs, and title I kids with special needs--you name it. \nIt was eliminated from the budget proposal.\n  This is about the most hard-hitting thing I can say, because I really \nbelieve\n\n[[Page S4782]]\n\nin the chair of this committee, a Senator for whom I have tremendous \nrespect. He is a great Senator. But I am in profound disagreement with \nhis proposal.\n  I have been following the discussion about education. I hope my \ncolleagues on the Democratic side will have the courage to challenge \nthis education bill on the floor, which will not have the resources.\n  Senators, if you love children, then you don't rob them. If you love \nthis little boy or girl, then you don't take their childhood away. If \nyou love these children, you help them for 10 years from now, or 7 or 8 \nyears from now. You must be willing to step up to the plate and make \nsure you invest some money so these kids will all have the best \nopportunity to learn. That means that they are kindergarten ready. That \nmeans you help the kids who come from low-income backgrounds. That \nmeans, just as Senators' children when they go to school, and our \ngrandchildren, they have the best teachers and the schools and the \ntechnology and all of the facilities. This is no way to love children. \nThat is to say, do not rob them by not making the investment in \nchildren in Minnesota and around the country and instead giving 40 \npercent-plus of the benefits to the top 1 percent of the population.\n  These are distorted priorities. There is going to be a pittance for \nchildren and education, a pittance for health care, and not anywhere \nnear enough for affordable prescription drug costs for the elderly.\n  Whatever happened to that campaign promise?\n  I resist this budget. I will vote against this budget.\n  I am going to have a lot of amendments on this education bill that \nare going to make people step up to the plate, and we will see who is \nwilling to talk about the resources for children and education.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-nine minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand Senator Frist is going to come down and \nwants to use a little time. Would you please instruct me when I am down \nto 15 minutes remaining. I hope not to use that.\n  I first want to say to the distinguished new Senator, Mr. Dayton, \nthat I listened carefully to his remarks. Everyone is entitled to their \nopinion. But we have not given a carte blanche to the Defense \nDepartment of the United States.\n  We were confronted with a very interesting situation. One, the \nPresident asked for a low number for defense, with the assumption in \nthis budget that his task force, headed by the Secretary, his top-to-\nbottom review, could not come up with the answers of what we needed by \nway of change by the time we were doing this work. What would one do? \nWould one shut all of that out and say whatever it is when that task \nforce is finished, they can wait until next year?\n  We allocated to the appropriators the amount of money the President \nasked for in defense--a low number. Then we said if and when the task \nforce is finished--and we are still in this year--whatever the task \nforce recommends in changes we will put in the defense pot allocated in \nthis budget. But it would have to be appropriated by the Congress of \nthe United States item by item, line by line, and system by system. You \nmight say that is an open door for defense with no controls.\n  You said subject to no congressional controls. I don't believe that \nis the case. What I just described is true. And is that without \ncongressional concurrence? I think not.\n  I don't know any other way we could have done it. We could have said \nwe will produce a new budget with a new defense number and debated that \nthoroughly and then came back, and we would have had the year behind us \nbefore we could have done anything. Guess what. They would come along \nand appropriate for defense and say: Too late. It has taken too long. \nWe are putting it in, in excess of the budget.\n  We are trying to have a little common sense on defense.\n  In my closing remarks, I will allude to some other aspects, but a lot \nhas been said about spending. Is there enough in this budget for the \nappropriators to spend?\n  Let me suggest it is pretty clear that there are many who would \naccept a much higher number. But I want to tell you the numbers as they \nare.\n  It is $31.3 billion above the 2001 budget available to be \nappropriated. Take out all of the things that are not spending and just \ndo apples and apples. It is $31.3 billion.\n  Of that number, $6.2 billion is new money over and above the \nPresident's budget. That means you have what the President recommended, \nplus $6.2 billion more, which gives you $31.3 billion over last year to \nspend. This $661.3 billion, which is the number, is real money. It will \nbe sent to the appropriators to be spent. With that figure, we assume--\nand that is all we can do--that $44.5 billion of it will go to the \nDepartment of Education for the year 2002. We assume--and that is all \nwe can do--that there will be an 11.5-percent increase. This is new \nmoney. Nobody can say that 11.5 percent isn't well above inflation. \nWhat kind of money are we talking about in the 4.6? The highest ever \nlevel of funding for education of disabled children, a $460 billion \nincrease in title I, including a 78-percent increase in assistance to \nlow-performing schools; a $1 billion increase in Pell grants; $1 \nbillion for new reading programs; $320 billion to ensure accountability \nwith State assessments. We can go on. There is $472 million to \nencourage schoolchildren, some kind of innovative choice that we might \npass; $6.3 billion to serve 916,000 Head Start children.\n  I guess it is easy to stand up and say there is nothing in this \nbudget for education. I just read it to you. Actually, the \nappropriators will probably do more because we gave them more to spend, \nand they have always favored more money for education. So, frankly, \nwhatever we have heard rhetorically on the floor about education, we \nhave done better by education than we have in modern times. This is the \nhighest, most dedicated budget for education that we have ever \nproduced.\n  I note the presence of the Senator from Tennessee. Would the Senator \nlike to speak to the matter before us?\n  Mr. FRIST. For 4 or 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 23 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator wants 5 minutes. And then Senator Nickles \nwants 5 minutes. I yield to them in that order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise because I think in 30 minutes or so \nwe will be voting on the conference report. I want to give my \ncolleagues my strongly felt support for what we have arrived at today. \nI believe it does, in a very consistent way, represent what at least I \nhear as I travel around the country, and through the State of \nTennessee, from every day people who are looking at their lives, the \nqualities of life, looking at Washington, DC, and Government and what \nit can be both for them and against them, and they tell you simple \nthings. Those things are: We do have a debt today, which one generation \nhas given another. Please address that debt.\n  They say we have some important things to pay for, and that is the \nrole of Government. That includes things such as Medicare, research in \nhealth care, education, defense of the country. And they say: After you \npay down that debt--and in this conference report we pay down that debt \nfrom $2.4 trillion from where it is, and they say: Thank you, that is \nwhat we want.\n  They say: What about teacher quality? We have $2.6 billion in the \nbudget for teachers and we know, when we look at that teacher-pupil \ninteraction in the classroom, that this is important. In higher \neducation for Pell grants, they say: After graduating from high school, \nlet's give people that opportunity to have, in essence, a pool of \nresources to take wherever they choose to go, and that is Pell grants--\nand indeed it is in this bill--for disadvantaged students; we assume \n$9.8 billion for Pell grants. They say: In health care, make sure you \naddress this issue of prescription drugs. Very specifically in this \nbudget $300 million is provided for expansion of Medicare prescription \ndrug benefits. The exact\n\n[[Page S4783]]\n\nmix, the exact bill, the exact nature--yes, couple it with \nmodernization but do it in a way that we can see it soon. They say \nthink about the future.\n\n  In this bill we think about the future in the field of health \nresearch. The resolution includes the President's $2.8 billion increase \nin the National Institutes of Health. It goes through the defense \nspending, agriculture, attention to the veterans. Then they say: After \naddressing the debt, after protecting the Social Security trust fund, \nafter protecting that Medicare trust fund, both of which give security \nto our seniors today, let us keep, instead of sending to Washington, \nDC, a little bit more of our hard-earned money.\n  Indeed, we do that. All of this is our money, say the people \nthroughout Tennessee, not yours because you represent the Federal \nGovernment. So if after we invest in those priorities of health care, \neducation, quality of life, agriculture, defense, and the veterans--\nafter we make that commitment to substantially pay down that debt, \nallow us to keep the dollars with us. Trust us, the American people, to \nspend, to save, to invest.\n  ``Trust us,'' the people across Tennessee tell me. We do that by \nallowing the taxpayer to keep $1.35 trillion over the next 11 years in \ntheir pockets, instead of on April 15 sending it to Washington, DC, \nwhen it is not needed.\n  In addition to that $1.35 trillion that we allow taxpayers to keep is \nthe $100 billion stimulus, which answers the question of: What are you \ndoing today to restore that hope in our economy, that hope in job \ncreation? And the answer is that we are taking $100 billion and \ntargeting it for a short-term stimulus to help turn this economy \naround--something that everybody feels each and every day--a change, \nsomething different than 2 years ago, than 3 years ago.\n  Finally, in this bill we authorize the additional tax relief, or debt \nrelief, if surpluses exceed those expectations.\n  Mr. President, this conference report reflects what the American \npeople want. There is compromise and negotiation in there. I, for one, \nwould like to see taxpayers keep a little bit more money in their \npockets as we look to the future. But recognizing the realities of this \nbody pulling together people on both sides of the aisle, I believe the \nconference report is strong, and it reflects the will and spirit of \npeople throughout Tennessee. Therefore, I look forward to heartily \nsupporting this conference report as we go forward.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my friend and colleague, the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Domenici, for his work. We have been \non the Budget Committee for many years. I have been on it for 20 years \nand have had the pleasure of working with him. Most of the time, \nunfortunately, the budgets are pretty partisan. I wish they weren't. I \nknow Senator Domenici wishes they weren't. Many times they are \ndifficult to put together. This has been one of the toughest. It is not \nan easy task in any way, shape, or form. Certainly, with a 50/50, \nevenly divided Senate, it is a very difficult task.\n  I compliment my friend and colleague who has had battles with \nDemocrats, Republicans, with liberals on both sides of the aisle and \nconservatives on both sides. He has wrestled with a very difficult \ntask. He has come up with a product that I think is a giant step in the \nright direction. It is not perfect. The Senator from Tennessee, whom I \ncompliment, is a member of this committee. He said he would like to \nhave a larger tax cut. This is a small tax cut in relation to the \nsurplus. We have an estimated surplus of over $5 trillion. The total \ntax cut, at maximum, is $1.35 trillion, with one-fourth going to \ntaxpayers. The majority is used to pay down the national debt. We have \ncolleagues on both sides who said let's do it.\n  The Senator from New Mexico said we are paying down the national debt \nfrom publicly held debt, as of this year, $3.2 trillion, and in 10 \nyears it will be less than $1 trillion. We are paying it down to the \nmaximum extent that we possibly can. Nowhere in the history of our \ncountry have we ever paid down the national debt the way we are \nprojecting to do it this year, next year, and throughout the next 10 \nyears.\n  So I compliment my friend from New Mexico. We still have a \nsignificant surplus. He says let's give a portion of that to taxpayers. \nI have heard people objecting and saying we are not taking care of our \nNation's domestic needs. Either we need more money for education, or \nveterans, or defense, and so on; we need more money to spend.\n  The spenders have been winning for the last 3 years. The people who \nhave wanted for the last 3 years to give some of the surplus to the \ntaxpayers or let the taxpayers keep some of the surplus have lost.\n  We passed tax cuts in 1999 and 2000. President Clinton vetoed them. \nWe did not have the votes to override, so the taxpayers did not get a \nbreak. They just kept sending in more money. As a matter of fact, \ntaxpayers today, on a per capita basis, send in $1,000 more than the \nFederal Government is spending. The Federal Government today is \nspending $7,000 for every man, woman, and child in the United States. \nThat is a surplus of about $1,000.\n  Let's give a portion of that back to the taxpayers. Let's let them \nkeep some of their own money. They are sending in too much. Granted, \nthere is no limit to the ideas we have in Congress on spending people's \nmoney, and people obviously think Congress can spend it better than the \nAmerican people.\n  Let the taxpayers keep a portion of it and take the bulk of the \nsurplus and pay down the national debt. That is exactly what we are \ndoing in this proposal. Spending continues to grow. Maybe it has not \ngrown as much as it has in the past. Thank goodness. Spending got out \nof hand in the last couple of years. I will put in a chart showing \ndomestic spending last year grew 14.1 percent. Defense spending grew at \n3.5 percent.\n  Some people say spending grew at 8 percent last year. Nondefense \nspending grew at 14 percent last year. That is not sustainable. The \neducation function last year grew in budget authority 29.9 percent. \nThat is not sustainable.\n  Yet on top of those enormous increases we had last year and large \nincreases in the previous year, this budget says let's grow spending \nmore, actually 5 percent more.\n  I heard people say: We are not doing enough in education despite the \nenormous increases we had in education. Education funding is projected \nunder this budget to grow at 11 percent, and all of us suspect, with \nthe large support we have in education led by our President and others, \nthat education within these functions will probably grow by even more \nthan that amount.\n  My point is, we are spending a lot of money, over $7,000 for every \nman, woman, and child, and it should be enough. Surely, we can give \nsome tax relief to taxpayers.\n  I heard some of my colleagues say the tax bill benefits the rich. I \nam in the process of working with others on the Finance Committee to \nput together a bill. It does not just benefit the rich; it benefits \ntaxpayers. It is weighted towards taxpayers who are in the lower income \ncategories. We are talking about large percentage cuts for individuals \nwho pay the lowest rates, not the highest rates. The largest \nbeneficiaries, certainly in the first few years, are the people at the \nlower end of the brackets who are now paying 15 percent. They will pay \n10 percent, or 12 percent under the House bill, or people who are \npaying 28 percent will pay 15 percent. We are going to expand the 15-\npercent bracket.\n  My point is, please do not prejudge the tax bill as benefitting the \nrich. A lot of that is class warfare demagoguery that is not going to \nbe sustained by the facts. Let's allow taxpayers to keep a portion of \nthe surplus and take the bulk of the surplus to pay down the debt and \nlimit the growth of spending to 4 or 5 percent as proposed under this \nbudget. It is affordable and sustainable.\n  I thank my colleagues for supporting this budget resolution. We had \n65 votes in favor of the budget a week or two ago. There is no reason \nthose individuals who supported this budget a week or so ago would not \nsupport it today. The differences in the tax cut are minimal from what \nwe passed a couple weeks ago. I urge my colleagues to support the \nbudget resolution.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the chart to which I \nreferred earlier be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S4784]]\n\n\n\n                                         APPROPRIATIONS BY SUBCOMMITTEE\n                                            [In billions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                    Growth from                     Growth from\n                                    Fiscal year     Fiscal year     fiscal year     Fiscal year     fiscal year\n                                       2000            2001       2000 (percent)   2002 request   2001 (percent)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAgriculture:\n    BA..........................            15.0            16.1             7.3            15.4            -4.3\n    OT..........................            14.7            16.3            10.9            16.4             0.6\nCommerce/Justice/State:\n    BA..........................            38.8            37.6            -3.1            37.9             0.8\n    OT..........................            36.9            37.5             1.6            39.6             5.6\nDistrict of Columbia:\n    BA..........................             0.5             0.5             0.0             0.3           -40.0\n    OT..........................             0.4             0.5            25.0             0.3           -40.0\nDefense:\n    BA..........................           278.8           287.5             3.1           301.0             4.7\n    OT..........................           273.5           276.2             1.0           296.1             7.2\nEnergy/Water:\n    BA..........................            21.6            23.6             9.3            22.5            -4.7\n    OT..........................            21.7            23.3             7.4            23.2            -0.4\nForeign Operations:\n    BA..........................            16.2            14.9            -8.0            15.2             2.0\n    OT..........................            14.8            15.7             6.1            15.7             0.0\nInterior:\n    BA..........................            15.4            19.0            23.4            18.1            -4.7\n    OT..........................            15.6            17.9            14.7            18.3             2.2\nLegislative Branch:\n    BA..........................             2.5             2.7             8.0             3.0            11.1\n    0T..........................             2.5             2.6             4.0             3.0            15.4\nLabor/HHS:\n    BA..........................            87.1           109.4            25.6           116.4             6.4\n    OT..........................            87.4           100.3            14.8           110.3            10.0\nMilitary Construction:\n    BA..........................             8.7             9.0             3.4             9.6             6.7\n    OT..........................             8.5             8.9             4.7             8.6            -3.4\nTransportation:\n    BA..........................            14.4            18.3            27.1            16.2           -11.5\n    OT..........................            44.0            48.2             9.5            52.7             9.3\nTreasury/Postal:\n    BA..........................            13.7            15.8            15.3            16.6             5.1\n    OT..........................            13.7            16.1            17.5            16.3             1.2\nVA/HUD/IND:\n    BA..........................            71.8            80.7            12.4            83.1             3.0\n    OT..........................            81.1            85.9             5.9            89.0             3.6\nEmergency Reserve:\n    BA..........................

Mr. President, a month ago I voted in support of the \nbudget resolution which passed the Senate and which contained $688 \nbillion in discretionary spending for fiscal year 2002 and $1.18 \ntrillion in tax cuts.\n  I continue to support the elements of the tax package that made for \nhalf of the budget agreement. I support providing broad-based tax \nrelief, eliminating the marriage penalty, and providing significant \nestate tax reform. And I believe that a stimulus package will be \nimportant in assuring that the economy does not slip into a recession.\n  But it was the allocation of resources in the Senate budget \nresolution--particularly funding for education programs--that made it \npossible for me and many of my colleagues to support the tax cuts.\n  Without the allocation of adequate spending to allow us to meet \npressing domestic needs, especially in education, it seems to me that \nthe other half of the understanding that made my support of the budget \nresolution is now missing.\n  As I understand it, the conference report currently before the \nSenate, provides discretionary budget authority of $661.3 billion ion \n2002, $27 billion below the amount agreed on by the Senate, and even \nbelow the amount that the CBO estimates is needed to keep pace with \ninflation.\n  In fact, overall funding for all non-defense discretionary spending \nis $5.5 billion less than last year's level, adjusted for inflation.\n  And on education, the bottom line appears to be that although the \nPresident's budget included an increase in education spending, the \nconference report which is currently before the Senate does not.\n  There is no new funding for education in the conference report, and, \nin fact, the discretionary education totals in the budget resolution \nare nearly $1 billion less than the increases provided in the \nPresident's budget.\n  There is no new funding provided for Head Start, and only minimal \nincreases for Title I and the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct, IDEA. This is not an approach which is calibrated to ``leave no \nchild behind.''\n  And while it is true that this conference report provides up to $6.2 \nbillion in additional unallocated discretionary budget authority for \nfunding domestic priorities beyond the President's budget request, \nwhich some have argued can all be used on education, discretionary \neducation funding is only one of the priorities that this money will be \nneeded for. This $6.2 billion is all that is available for all domestic \npriorities, not just education.\n  I supported the Senate budget resolution because I thought that it \nrepresented a good balance at a time of unprecedented surpluses, \nproviding both significant tax relief and making significant \ninvestments in our children and in our nation's future.\n  This conference report, unfortunately, no longer contains that \nbalance, and I find that I cannot, in good conscience, support it.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, first I must congratulate the chairman \nof the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, for his hard work on the \nbudget. It is a thankless task that earns the Senator few if any points \nwith his New Mexico constituents. Unfortunately, I am greatly troubled \nby certain elements in this budget, and\n\n[[Page S4785]]\n\nwill vote against the fiscal year 2002 budget resolution conference \nreport now before the Senate.\n  In approving this budget, Congress is missing a significant \nopportunity to address some of our nation's most critical needs. Key \namong these needs is education. A nation that does not invest in its \npeople, that does not provide its citizens with an excellent education, \nthat does not ensure that its children can read, and that does not \ntrain them for eventual entry into the workforce, is acting \nirresponsibly.\n  We must grant the American people a tax cut. We must pay down the \ndebt. We must protect social security. But we must not ignore a most \ncritical responsibility, to provide a free and adequate education to \nevery child in America.\n  I was proud to play a key role in making the tax cut contained in \nthis budget more responsible. I have the greatest respect for my \ncentrist colleagues who joined me in striking this agreement. But I \ncannot support a budget that puts large tax cuts and unlimited defense \nspending ahead of educating our nation's children. By voting against \nthis budget agreement today, I am committing to the nation that I will \ncontinue my efforts to bring more resources to our schools and children \nto improve education.\n  I can not hide my disappointment that the Congress once again will \nnot fulfill its pledge to fully fund special education. This year, I \ntried and failed to have language included in the budget that would \nhave made the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA, \nmandatory spending.\n  When I first arrived in Congress, one of the very first bills that I \nhad the privilege of working on was the Education of All Handicapped \nChildren Act of 1975. As a freshman Member of Congress, I was proud to \nsponsor that legislation and to be named as a member of the House and \nSenate conference committee along with then Vermont Senator Bob \nStafford.\n  At that time, despite a clear constitutional obligation to education \nall children, regardless of disability, thousands of students with \ndisabilities were denied access to a public education. Passage of the \nEducation of All Handicapped Children Act offered financial incentives \nto states to fulfill this existing obligation. Recognizing that the \ncosts associated with educating these children was more than many \nschool districts could bear alone, the Federal government pledged to \npay 40 percent of the additional costs of educating these students.\n  The budget resolution that is before the Senate continues to make a \nmockery of this pledge. However, I will work with members of the Senate \nAppropriations and Finance Committees both to increase annual spending \nfor IDEA and convert the program into mandatory spending. Additionally, \nthe budget sets overall discretionary education spending at a level \nbelow what was passed in the Senate and below what is needed for our \nchildren and the future of our country.\n\n  The budget resolution allows up to $1.35 trillion in tax cuts over \neleven years. While I agree some level of tax cuts are warranted, I \ncontinue to be troubled with making surplus assumptions ten years into \nthe future. The level of tax cuts called for in this resolution gives \nthe Congress little leeway should projected surpluses not materialize.\n  While the budget resolution sets the overall level of tax cuts that \nwill be considered by the Congress this year under reconciliation \nrules, I intend to be an aggressive advocate for children when the tax \nbill is debated in the Finance Committee. I also will strongly advocate \nthat the Congress not attempt this year to exceed $1.35 trillion in tax \ncuts by writing additional tax bills. We can and should enact all of \nthis year's tax cuts within a ceiling of $1.35 trillion.\n  We dare not risk a return to the era of deficits, especially with the \ncoming retirement of millions of baby boomers and the burden that this \nwill place on the Social Security and Medicare systems.\n  On the positive side, I am pleased that this resolution protects \nSocial Security. Not one penny of the Social Security surplus is \ntouched. Second, it balances the budget every year without using the \nSocial Security surplus. Thirdly, this resolution retires the national \ndebt held by the public--about $2 trillion over the next ten years.\n  I should add that it has been a pleasure these past weeks to work \nwith a bipartisan group of centrist Senators who believe that tax \nrelief is warranted, but not at the expense of education, veterans \nhealth, job training, child care, environmental and other important \ndiscretionary programs.\n  This budget, like all budgets passed by Congress, is an expression of \npolitical intent, priorities, and a starting point for bargaining. Much \nwork remains to be done to pass the 13 appropriations bills that \nactually fund the Federal Government. In areas where I disagree with \nthe budget resolution, I plan to work hard with appropriators to adjust \nspending levels and turn this budget into reality.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today with great disappointment to \noppose this budget. I am disappointed that I am forced to vote against \na tax cut number, $1.25 trillion over the next ten years, that I \nsupport and think is reasonable. I am disappointed that Congress, by \nthe slimmest of margins, is passing a spending plan that includes zero \nfunding for education reforms, school modernization, teacher training, \nor any education initiative that will empower our local communities to \nimprove their schools.\n  But mostly I am disappointed that a budget that left this chamber a \nreasonable compromise, with significant investment in education, \nveterans, and Medicare and an over $1 trillion tax cut, has returned a \npolitical document in bipartisan clothing.\n  I want to make it clear that I do not oppose the tax cut set up by \nthis budget. I believe that we can afford, and should give, a tax cut \nof over $ 1 trillion. In fact, I have every intention of voting for the \ntax cut bill that will be on the floor in the next couple of weeks. Our \nstrong economy, and our fiscal discipline over the last few years makes \nit possible to let taxpayers keep more of their money while still \nmaking essential investments in our children, our communities, our \nveterans and our seniors.\n  The Senate vote last month proved that. We had 65 votes, mine \nincluded, for a budget that envisioned a $1.2 trillion tax cut, an \nunprecedented increase in education investment, a substantial \ncommitment to veterans health, significant debt reduction, and the \ndeserved title of bipartisan.\n  The budget before us today chooses to keep the tax cut, and I support \nthat, but to sacrifice investment on education, health care, NIH, and \nother domestic priorities. Why? In order to allow a blank check for \ndefense spending.\n  Let me repeat that. This budget allows an unspecified and unlimited \namount of resources to go to defense while holding flat spending on \neducation and other domestic programs, completely flat. The budget \nbefore us right now has less education spending than any other budget \nconsidered this year--the Senate Budget Resolution passed last month \nhad more, the House Budget Resolution passed last month had more, the \nPresident's budget submission had more. I pride myself on being a \ntightwad when it comes to spending taxpayer money, but I have always \nsaid the one area I will not shortchange is our children's education. I \ncannot support the lowest offer for education on the table, yet that is \nexactly what we have before us today.\n  I very much wanted to support this budget today. I look forward to \nsupporting portions of it in the future. And I sincerely hope that, as \nwe work through the tax and spending bills this year, we return to the \ncompromise and broad support that marked the Senate Budget Resolution--\nand reject the extremism and political polarization that scars the \nfinal budget before us now.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, when I came to the Senate almost 30 years \nago, we were just entering what became a generation of Federal deficit \nspending. We lost the key to balanced budgets, the discipline to match \nour spending with our income.\n  The economic impact of those decades of deficits was profound. The \naccumulating debt grew faster than our economy, and we slipped from our \nposition as the world's leading creditor nation to the world's biggest \nborrower.\n  While the Federal Government borrowed money as if nobody else needed\n\n[[Page S4786]]\n\nit, private borrowers from first-time home buyers to major corporations \nall paid more for their loans. Our inability to balance our budgets was \na dead weight burden on the economy here, and our high interest rates \naffected international finance as well.\n  But perhaps the most important cost of those deficits was the loss of \nfaith suffered by Americans in their Government. A lot of factors \ncontributed to that cynicism and skepticism, but I am convinced that \nthe cumulative effect of decades of unbalanced budgets was a major \nreason Americans for so long held their Government in such low esteem.\n  Those deficits had another major effect. As we struggled every year \nto match our spending with our income, the priorities I came to the \nSenate to fight for, support for those among us who need it most, \nprotection of the environment, quality education for everyone, safe \nstreets and homes, those priorities were the first hit by spending \ncuts.\n  And as we cut back on those programs, we cut back on the basic \nresponsibilities of a democratic government. The era of budget deficits \nwas marked by a deficit of democracy itself.\n  Today, we can congratulate ourselves on not only balancing our \nbudgets, but on producing substantial budget surpluses. On the \nfoundation of an historical economic boom, the longest period of high-\nproductivity growth in our history, we have restored the health of our \nFederal budgets.\n  History will judge how we manage this success, what we do with the \nopportunity before us. Will we build a foundation for future growth, \nwill we pay down the burden of debt that we built up in the generation \nof deficits, will we continue to meet the demands of our citizens for \nworld class education, health care, and technology, for safe streets, \nclean air and water? Or will we put all of this at risk, along with the \nhard-won victory over deficits?\n  I will vote against the Budget Resolution before us today, because it \ngives the wrong answer to those questions.\n\n  As the distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations Committee \nreminded us so eloquently last week, Americans rightly expect us to \nmake sure that the basic functions of government are taken care of. \nWhen we fail to provide the safe streets, the clean water, the good \nschools, that the citizens of the world's richest nation have every \nreason to expect, we have failed to live up to our responsibilities. I \nam sorry to say that this budget marks such a failure.\n  Because of the size of the tax cuts, $1.35 billion, and their shape, \nthey increase in cost in future years, this budget puts at risk all we \nhave gained through years of hard work on the budget. And it puts at \nrisk our ability to meet the basic demands our citizens make of us to \nmanage our common affairs effectively and efficiently.\n  We have real needs in this country, as the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia reminded us last week. Almost a third of our bridges are \nin need of repair, many of our school rooms are crumbling, our water \nand sewer systems are in disrepair. In the midst of all of the private \nwealth our economy has created in the last decade, our public \ninvestments have failed to keep pace.\n  This budget fails to provide any new funds for education, for health \ncare, for clean air and water, for police protection, for safer roads \nand bridges--none. This budget spends less per citizen, after \ninflation, for all of those priorities.\n  The President claims, and I believe him, that he wants to spend more \non education. I support him in that effort. However, because there is \nnot enough money in this budget to keep present levels of support for \nany domestic priorities, any increase in education spending will have \nto come out of police protection, out of drug interdiction, out of \nhealth care research.\n  There is no increase in spending for education, unless you count a \nvague promise that we would like to spend more. But a budget is not \nabout vague promises. It should tell us the facts about how much we \nhave to spend on our priorities. And the sad fact is that this budget \nhas no new money for education, period.\n  This budget fails to meet the basic test of facing up to reality, \nthere are more demands on our budget than there are funds to meet them, \nand this budget gives us no idea of where the cuts will fall to pay for \nany of the new priorities we face.\n  When the Senate voted on its version of the budget last month, we \ncalled for $225 billion in additional investments in education. That \nmoney is gone from the Budget Resolution before us today, gone.\n  In fact in this resolution, there is actually $5.5 billion less than \nlast year's spending for education, allowing for inflation.\n  The Federal budget is already smallest it has been since 1960 as a \nshare of our economy. It is simply not realistic to assume that it will \ncontinue to shrink, in real terms, not just next year but for the next \nten years. But that is just what this budget assumes.\n  These cuts in domestic priorities will happen even if the economic \nprojections on which this budget is based, ten-year projections that \nhave proved wrong every time in the past, even if those projections \nturn out to be true. If the economy grows more slowly, if we face \nnatural disasters, national security threats or other inevitable but \nunpredictable emergencies, there will be even more cuts.\n  But there are other assumptions built into this budget, assumptions \nthat I believe will be wrong no matter what happens to those economic \nprojections. This budget assumes we will do nothing to protect millions \nof Americans from increases in the alternative minimum tax, that we \nwill fail to renew popular and important programs such as the research \nand development tax credit, it assumes that we can undertake a major \noverhaul of our defense policy with a relatively small increase in \nspending. But recent statements by Defense Secretary Rumsfeld suggest \nhundreds of billions of dollars in new spending, that is not in this \nbudget.\n  If any of those assumptions, or a lot of other similar costly issues \nthat are assumed away in this budget, prove to be wrong, there will be \neven less money for education, for health care research, for clear air \nand water, for cops on the beat.\n  But this budget does not face up to those problems, it assumes them \naway.\n  With the underlying health of our economy, with the hard work we put \ninto restoring balance to our budgets, I am convinced we can afford tax \ncuts, tax cuts that would in any other context sound huge.\n  Prudent budgeting, that makes full allowance for domestic and defense \npriorities and that is cautious about ten-year economic forecasts that \nhave huge margins of error, would still leave room for hundreds of \nbillions of dollars in tax cuts.\n  There is no economic reason behind the tax cut numbers in this \nresolution. Those numbers date back to the Republican primaries, in \n1999, when the economy was booming, the stock market was soaring and \nunemployment was falling. The Bush campaign picked a tax cut number \nthey thought would help them beat Steve Forbes in the New Hampshire \nprimary.\n  They certainly were not concerned with formulating a ten-year budget \nplan during a slack economy. But those are the numbers we are told are \nstill basically right for today.\n  If we go into this thinking that we can afford a tax cut of this \nsize, and a defense build-up many times greater than this budget allows \nfor, with promises to increase spending on education, expectations that \nhealth care spending will go up, some kind of plan to shore up Social \nSecurity and Medicare with funds from outside those systems, I think we \ncan all see where we are headed.\n  One of the first things to go will the surpluses that we ought to use \nto pay down the debt, the burden that raises interest payments today \nand that our children and grandchildren will have to pay off. For all \nthe talk about the surpluses belonging to the American people, we have \nto remember that the national debt belongs to them, too.\n  Playing fast and loose with the assumptions in the budget could leave \nus with a bigger debt, and higher continuing interest payments on the \ndebt burden, than we would have if we stayed on the course that \nrestored balance to our budgets.\n  We have come too far to go that way again.\n\n[[Page S4787]]\n\n  This budget does not build on the successes of the last decade; it \nthreatens to return us to the time when we failed to make the hard \nchoices that Americans expect us to make. I will vote against this \nbudget resolution, and I hope my colleagues will join me.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President. Last month, I joined a bipartisan group \nof centrist Senators to support a $1.25 trillion tax cut along with an \neconomic stimulus for this year. The tax cut agreed upon after \nnegotiations with the White House and House of Representatives totals \n$1.35 trillion. I support a tax cut of this size and think that the \npeople of Missouri also believe it to be a commonsense compromise.\n  This tax cut should provide immediate tax relief to help stimulate \nthe economy, cut personal income taxes for all taxpayers, eliminate the \nmarriage penalty, and eliminate the estate tax for all family farms and \nfamily-owned small businesses. I also want to ensure that the tax cut \nis distributed fairly and responsibly by focusing on the people who \nneed tax relief the most--the working men and women of America.\n  The other key component of the budget voted on by the Senate last \nmonth was an approximately $300 billion investment in education over \nthe next decade. That budget plan included sufficient funds to meet the \nFederal Government's commitment to fund 40 percent of the cost of \nspecial education. Meeting this commitment would enable states and \nlocalities to spend billions of dollars of their own funds on improving \neducational quality at the local level. The Senate budget also included \nfunds for student loans, programs for disadvantaged students, and the \ntesting and accountability reforms currently being debated on the \nSenate floor.\n  Unfortunately, the conference report before us completely eliminated \nthe educational investments contained in the Senate passed budget. \nIndeed, this conference report does not even fund the education \nincreases contained in President Bush's budget proposal.\n  Not only is this approach to education inconsistent with the \nbipartisan actions taken on the budget by the Senate a few weeks ago, \nbut it is dramatically at odds with the votes being cast by the Senate \non the education reform bill. Last week, the Senate unanimously voted \nto fully fund the Individual with Disabilities Education Act at a cost \nof $120 billion over ten years. Earlier this week, the Senate agreed to \nfully fund the largest federal education program for disadvantaged \nstudents at a cost of $130 billion. The vote on that amendment was 79-\n21.\n  I am a newcomer to the Federal budget process, but it defies common \nsense to be voting to support major increased investments in education \non the one hand, while on the other hand voting for a budget that does \nnot meet these commitments.\n  Some of my colleagues have stated that the lack of education funding \nin the budget should not be of concern because, eventually, Congress \nwill provide additional support for education during the appropriations \nprocess. But I ask, what purpose does a budget serve if we vote based \non an intention not to abide by it?\n  So, while I strongly support the $1.35 trillion in tax cuts for the \nAmerican people contained in the conference report, I cannot support \nthis budget agreement. I look forward to working on the tax cut \nlegislation scheduled for later this month and on the appropriations \nbills that follow. Hopefully, in the end, we will provide both a tax \ncut of $1.35 trillion that provides needed tax relief to the public and \nan investment plan that meets our vital national priorities.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today the Senate will complete action on the \nconference report to the 2002 budget resolution. While we all know that \na budget resolution is a non-binding document that does not require the \nPresident's signature, it is, nonetheless, still an important document \nbecause it should serve as the blueprint that reflects the priorities \nfor America. Sadly, the document before us does not fulfill that \npurpose.\n  At the outset, let me first express my disappointment with the \nprocess that was undertaken to produce this misguided conference \nreport. In the Senate, Budget Committee members were denied the \nopportunity to mark up a budget resolution and the decision was made to \nbring one directly to the floor for consideration without any committee \ninput. The conference report itself was negotiated by the White House \nand Republican congressional leaders without allowing Democratic \nmembers a meaningful seat at the table. As a result, the Senate will be \nvoting on a partisan conference report that is flawed, unbalanced, and \nout of touch with the needs of the American people. We need to take a \nlesson from this year's experience to improve upon how we deal with one \nof the most important pieces of legislation that we consider as a body \neach year. This conference report isn't worthy of the Senate and it's \ncertainly not worthy of the Americans it is intended to serve.\n  The budget outlined in this conference report fails on a number of \nimportant counts and I take this opportunity to briefly discuss why I \nbelieve this budget is wrong for this country and why I will be voting \nagainst it.\n  First, this conference report is unrealistic as it fails to take into \naccount numerous costs that will most likely be incurred in the months \nand years ahead. Specifically, it ignores the cost of Alternative \nMinimum Tax reform, something that we all know will be absolutely \nnecessary as more and more taxpayers find themselves subject to this \ntax. It does not address the additional interest costs associated with \nthe tax cut required in the conference report or the funds that will be \nneeded for the extension of popular expiring tax provisions. It also \ndoes not consider the costs that are likely to arise as a result of the \nPresident's National Defense Review. Preliminary estimates indicate \nthat this new defense spending could carry a price tag of at least $250 \nbillion over the next 10 years. Yet, none of these costs are reflected \nin the document up for consideration today.\n  Second, the conference report provides no safeguards for Social \nSecurity and Medicare. Once one adds up all the real costs which, \nagain, are noticeably absent from this budget, raiding both the Social \nSecurity and Medicare trust funds will become an unfortunate reality. \nWhat is more troubling is the fact that this budget does not provide \nany real protections for these trust funds that would guarantee that \ntheir surpluses would be used only for the purposes of Social Security \nand Medicare. We seem to be moving in the wrong direction on Social \nSecurity and Medicare at a time when the demands being placed on them \nwill be at their greatest. These trust funds should not become a piggy \nbank, but I fear that this conference report does nothing to ensure \nthat they won't.\n  Third, one of this conference report's most obvious failures, is the \nfact that it limits our ability to invest in the priorities that are so \nimportant to the American public like preserving the environment, law \nenforcement, new highways, and quality health care. One of the areas in \nwhich I, personally, take the greatest exception is the conference \nreport's utter disregard for education.\n  Many of us in the Senate agree that education is one of the most \ncritical priorities facing our nation. Proof of this was evident during \nthe Senate's consideration of the budget resolution when, on a \nbipartisan basis, the Senate voted for a smaller tax cut and increased \ninvestments for children and education.\n  In a bipartisan vote, the Senate approved an amendment offered by \nSenator Harkin which added $250 billion to support student achievement \nand to help failing schools. Again, on a bipartisan basis, the Senate \nsupported an amendment from Senators Breaux and Jeffords which \nincreased funding for the education of children with disabilities by \n$70 billion. In addition, last week, by an overwhelming vote of 79-21, \nthe Senate supported an amendment to the ESEA reauthorization bill that \nI offered with Senator Collins to add $135 billion over the next 10 \nyears to the title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, \nwhich helps to meet the educational needs of the poorest, most \nvulnerable children in our country.\n  And does this conference report reflect any of these bipartisan \nvotes? No. It rejects them and provides no new dollars for us to commit \nto education in this country. It prevents us from making any of those \ninvestments on behalf of the neediest school children in America that \nthe Senate has gone on record as supporting.\n\n[[Page S4788]]\n\n  I have heard my Republican colleagues claim that this conference \nreport increases funding for education. While we may be reading the \nsame document, we do not share the same interpretation of its meaning. \nAs a result, there are no increases to be found. None.\n  In fact, when I read this conference report, all I see are cuts. \nThere are no increases for education because total non-defense \ndiscretionary funding in this conference report is actually $5.5 \nbillion below what is needed to maintain even current programs and \nservices. This decrease becomes $62 billion less over the next 10 \nyears. Consequently, to pay for any proposed increases in education \nwill require severe cuts in other programs which are already operating \non less than adequate funding. So, in effect, this conference report \nwill squeeze resources from critical priorities such as education, \nhealth care, and the environment in order to help finance a massive tax \ncut that heavily favors the most affluent.\n  I am aware that the conference report provides a $6.2 billion earmark \nfor education. Unfortunately, this money is a mirage. It is in the form \nof non-binding, unenforceable ``sense of the Congress'' language \nexpressing that Congress should spend this money on education. This is \nin no way a guarantee and it is a far cry from the resources that the \nSenate believed were necessary to truly improve education in this \ncountry.\n  The one thing that is abundantly clear in this conference report is \nthe amount of money that will be spent on a tax cut. I find it \ninteresting that the language in the report with respect to the tax cut \nis straightforward and directs Congress to cut taxes by $1.25 trillion \nover the next 10 years. Yet, we can't seem to make the same kind of \nunequivocal commitment to education.\n  I support tax relief and I believe that Americans need tax relief. \nBut tax relief must be affordable fair. The tax cut in this conference \nreport is neither. I believe it is unwise to commit $1.25 trillion to \ntax cuts that will benefit the wealthiest Americans, that we may not be \nable to pay for in years to come, and that may risk a return to runaway \ndeficits.\n  The conference report also can't seem to commit to the idea of an \nimmediate economic stimulus which many economists feel would boost our \nslowing economy. With the way the language is structured in the \nconference report, the $100 billion that should be used as a stimulus \nin 2002 could potentially be spread over the next decade, thereby \nlosing its stimulatory impact.\n  One way to make this tax cut more fair would be to double the child \ntax credit and make $500 of it refundable. Senator Snowe and I have \nintroduced legislation to do precisely that. This bill would, with just \na few words, lift one million children out of poverty.\n  It seems fair to me that at the same time that we consider cutting \ntaxes by $1.25 trillion over the next 11 years, we could work to find \nthe resources to provide these working families with some kind of \nmodest relief. Senator Snowe and I introduced what I believe is a bill \nthat acts as a first step in truly helping these families. This \nlegislation won't eliminate child poverty entirely, but it's a start. I \nhope that the Finance Committee will keep the millions of children who \nlive in poverty in this country in mind as it begins work on a tax \nbill.\n  I represent a State with the highest per capita income in the nation. \nYet, surprisingly, I do not many people asking for a $1.25 trillion tax \ncut. What I do hear is that people want Social Security and Medicare to \nbe strengthened, they want cleaner drinking water, they want better \nroads, and they want quality teachers and safer schools for their kids.\n  Unfortunately, this conference report virtually ignores all of their \nconcerns and offers only vague, empty promises. This conference report \nhas got it all wrong. It's wrong on the environment, it's wrong on \ndefense, it's wrong on Social Security and Medicare, it's wrong on \neducation, and it's most especially wrong on tax cuts.\n  As such, I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing this \nconference report so that we can begin work again, in a bipartisan \nfashion, to prove to the American people that we are truly listening. \nAnd should it pass--as it probably will on a largely partisan basis--I \nhope that we will, before the year is out, honor and support the \nimportant priorities of the American people.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I must oppose this budget resolution \nconference report because it is an irresponsible gamble with our \neconomic future. Despite the best efforts of the Senate to reduce the \nPresident's risky tax cut plan, this conference report does not \nadequately protect the interests of low- and medium-income American \nmen, women, and children.\n  This resolution sets aside trillions of projected budget surpluses \nfor tax cuts proposed by President Bush that are steeply tilted to the \nwealthy. It pays for the Bush tax plan at the expense of needed \ninvestments in Social Security, Medicare, education, and the \nenvironment. In addition, the cost of the Bush tax plan imperils our \nability to pay off the national debt so that this nation can finally be \ndebt free by the end of the decade.\n  We should remember that the nation still carries the burden of a \nnational debt of $3.4 trillion. Like someone who had finally paid off \nhis or her credit card balance but still has a home mortgage, the \nfederal government has finally balanced its annual budget, but we still \nhave a national debt to pay off. In the meantime, the Federal \ngovernment has to pay almost $900 million in interest every working day \non this national debt.\n  Paying off our national debt will help to sustain our sound economy \nby keeping interest rates low. Vermonters gain ground with lower \nmortgage costs, car payments and credit card charges with low interest \nrates. In addition, small business owners in Vermont can invest, expand \nand create jobs with low interest rates.\n  I want to leave a legacy for our children and grandchildren of a \ndebt-free nation by 2010. We can achieve that legacy if the Congress \nmaintains its fiscal discipline. But this budget resolution tosses out \nfiscal responsibility for skewed tax breaks. It is based on a house of \ncards made up of rosy budget scenarios for the next ten years. Any \ndownturn in the economy, are of which we are now beginning to \nexperience, threatens to topple this house of cards.\n  Mr. President, the $5.6 trillion surplus that President Bush and \nothers are counting on to pay for huge tax cuts is based on mere \nprojections over the next decade. It is not real. Many in Congress have \nbeen talking about the $5.6 trillion surplus as if it is already money \nin the United States Treasury. It is not.\n  While none of us hope that the budget surpluses are lower than we \nexpect, to be responsible we need to understand that this is a real \npossibility. In its budget and economic outlook released in January \n1st, CBO devotes an entire chapter to the uncertainty of budget \nprojections. CBO warns Congress that there is only a 10 percent chance \nthat the surpluses will materialize as projected by saying: \n``Considerable uncertainty surrounds those projections.'' This is \nbecause CBO cannot predict what legislation Congress might pass that \nwould alter federal spending and revenues. In addition, CBO says--and \nanyone whose watched the volatility of our markets over the past few \nmonths knows--that the U.S. economy and federal budget are highly \ncomplex and are affected by many factors that are difficult to predict.\n\n  With all of this uncertainty in projecting future surpluses, it is \namazing to me that the budget resolution insists on a fixed $1.35 \ntrillion tax cut. I was one of five Senators still in the Senate who \nvoted against the Reagan tax plan in 1981. We saw what happened there: \nWe had a huge tax cut, defense spending boomed, and the national debt \nquadrupled.\n  The conference report includes the full $1.5 billion increase in \nbudget authority ($32.4 billion total) for essential Department of \nJustice programs to help state and local law enforcement programs \ncontained in the Leahy/Harkin amendment that unanimously passed the \nSenate. However it reduces the outlays increase to $1.1 billion ($31.8 \nbillion total) in FY 2002. The conference report also waters down the \nSense of the Senate language to drop all references to specific grant \nprograms that are targeted for cuts by the President.\n  I cosponsored and supported a successful, bipartisan amendment in the\n\n[[Page S4789]]\n\nSenate to increase funding for agriculture conservation programs on \nprivate lands by $1.3 billion. This funding was to support nationally-\nsuccessful programs like the Environmental Quality Incentive Program, \nthe Farmland Protection Program, and the Wildlife Habitat Incentive \nProgram--programs that truly help farmers and ranchers keep their \nworking lands and that help private landowners enhance their \ncommunities' water quality, open space, and wildlife habitat.\n  Unfortunately, though communities all over the nation have asked \nCongress for help to protect and restore water quality and open space, \nRepublican negotiators chose to strike funds for our amendment in the \nfinal conference report.\n  The conference report also ignores communities' cries for cleaner \nenergy and energy conservation--especially communities in the Northeast \nwho breathe the downwind fumes of 1960's-era, dirty energy production \nfurther west. By following the Bush plan to significantly cut funding \nfor the Department of Energy's conservation, energy efficiency, and \nclean energy programs, the Republican negotiators continue to ignore \nthe 21st century energy needs of our people.\n  During consideration of the budget resolution in the Senate, I joined \nmany of my colleagues in supporting amendments to increase funding for \neducation programs. Despite the passage of these important amendments, \nthis budget resolution conference report ignores the Senate's actions \nand does not provide sufficient funds for our students, teachers and \nschools.\n  This conference report contains no increase for K-12 or higher \neducation discretionary spending. Mandatory spending for education and \ntraining is essentially the same as the House-passed resolution and \ntherefore reflects none of the Senate's bipartisan actions. The \nconference report rejects the Harkin education amendment that provided \nincreased funds for so many important education programs. It rejects \nthe Jeffords/Breaux amendment, which increased funding for the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education (IDEA) Act--fulfilling the \nFederal government's responsibility. This conference report also fails \nto accommodate the Hagel-Harkin amendment--adopted unanimously by the \nSenate to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA)--without \nadditional cuts to student loan programs.\n\n  At a time when the Senate is debating reauthorization of ESEA and \nconsidering a significant change to our education system, it makes no \nsense to me that we reduce education funds as is the case in this \nconference report. If we really want to leave no child behind, then we \nmust acknowledge that we have a financial responsibility to support our \nchildren's education. This conference report fails to do that.\n  The conference report includes a $1 billion increase in discretionary \nveterans health spending. That increase barely covers inflation in the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs' current programs, let alone provides \nthe department flexibility to increase the availability and quality of \ncare. I am also concerned that this budget squeezes this money out of \ncritical veterans health research programs, leaving investigations into \nspinal injuries and war wounds at inadequate levels.\n  This conference report also drops a provision passed by the Senate \nthat would have allowed military retirees to receive their full VA \ndisability and retiree pay earned during their lifelong service. Once \nagain, the other side has made it a priority to top-off the bulging \npiggy-banks of the wealthy with change pilfered from the fixed income \nchecks of those who have sacrificed for our country.\n  Mr. President, after years of hard choices, we have balanced the \nbudget and started building surpluses. Now we must make responsible \nchoices for the future. Our top four priorities should be paying off \nthe national debt, passing a fair and responsible tax cut, saving \nSocial Security, and creating a real Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit. This budget falls far short of these priorities. For the sake \nof our economy and the working families of America, I will vote against \nthis budget resolution.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, yesterday I cited chapter and verse how \nthis Republican budget flunks the test of education reform. It puts tax \ncuts for the wealthy first, and the needs of America's children last. \nBut that is not the only fundamental flaw in this budget. America's \nseniors, too, will be left out and left behind.\n  Too many elderly Americans today must choose between food on the \ntable and the medicine they need to stay healthy or to treat their \nillnesses. Too many senior citizens take half the pills their doctor \nprescribes, or don't even fill needed prescriptions--because they can't \nafford the high cost of prescription drugs.\n  Too many seniors are paying twice as much as they should for the \ndrugs they need, because they are forced to pay full price, while \nalmost everyone with a private insurance policy benefits from \nnegotiated discounts.\n  Too many seniors are ending up hospitalized--at immense cost to \nMedicare--because they aren't receiving the drugs they need at all, or \ncan't afford to take them correctly.\n  Pharmaceutical products are increasingly the source of miracle cures \nfor a host of dread diseases, but senior citizens are left out and left \nbehind in this republican budget.\n  The crisis senior citizens face today will only worsen if we refuse \nto act, because insurance coverage continues to go down, and drug costs \ncontinue to go up.\n  Twelve million senior citizens--one third of the total--have no \nprescription drug coverage at all. Only half of all senior citizens \nhave prescription drug coverage throughout the year. Coverage through \nemployer retirement plans is plummeting. Medicare HMOs are drastically \ncutting back. Medigap plans are priced out of reach of most seniors. \nThe sad fact is that the only senior citizens who have stable, \nreliable, affordable drug coverage today are the very poor on Medicaid.\n  Prescription drug costs are out of control. Since 1996, costs have \ngrown at double-digit rates every year. In the stunning report released \nearlier this week, cost increases continue to accelerate, with \nprescription drug costs growing an enormous 18.8 percent last year. No \nwonder access to affordable prescription drugs has become a crisis for \nso many elderly Americans.\n  Every Member of Congress understands that this is a crisis--but this \nbudget offers no solution. It refuses to give senior citizens the help \nthey deserve. Yet it gives lavish tax breaks to millionaires.\n  Compare the language in this budget for prescription drugs to \nlanguage on tax cuts and you have a sense of the relative priorities in \nthis budget.\n  If the Republicans gave a real priority to coverage of prescription \ndrugs under Medicare, there would be a reconciliation instruction--not \na reserve fund. The budget resolution could require the Finance \nCommittee to report a prescription drug bill and set a date certain for \naction, just as the GOP resolution does for tax cuts.\n  If Republicans gave a real priority to this proposal, they would not \ncondition life-saving prescription drugs for seniors on ``reforming'' \nMedicare. The supporters of the resolution are saying that prescription \ndrugs for seniors will be held hostage to controversial reforms in \nother parts of Medicare. But the resolution contains no requirement \nthat the tax code must be reformed before millionaires get their tax \nbreaks.\n  If the Republicans were serious about a prescription drug proposal, \nthe resolution would specify that the reserve fund is for coverage of \nprescription drugs under Medicare. That is what senior citizens want \nand deserve. But this resolution doesn't require that. These funds are \navailable for any program that ``improves access to prescription drugs \nfor Medicare beneficiaries.'' That could be a welfare program. It could \nbe an expansion of Medicaid. It could even be President Bush's proposed \nblock grant that would reach only one-third of senior citizens.\n\n  At bottom, the amount the resolution allocates for Medicare \nprescription drugs is grossly inadequate. The maximum it provides is \n$300 billion over ten years. But, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, senior citizens will have to spend $1.1 trillion on \nprescription drugs over the next ten years. The maximum amount that can \nbe provided under this budget resolution is only about a quarter of \nthat amount. That is not the kind of help senior citizens need, and it \nis not what\n\n[[Page S4790]]\n\nCongress should provide. To add insult to injury, the Republican budget \nresolution allows the Medicare drug benefit to be funded by taking \nmoney from the Medicare Hospital Insurance fund, which seniors have \npaid into over their working lives to protect them against the high \ncost of health care.\n  There is a reason for the inadequate promises of this budget \nresolution. The budget does not contain enough funds to provide a real \nprescription drug benefit under Medicare, because it squanders too much \nof the budget surplus on new tax breaks for millionaires.\n  Medicare is a solemn promise to senior citizens. It says, ``Work \nhard, pay into the trust fund during your working years, and you will \nhave health security in your retirement years.'' But this promise is \nbeing broken every day, because Medicare does not cover prescription \ndrugs, and this budget does not mend that broken promise.\n  It has been said that the measure of a society is how it treats its \nyoung and its old. By this measure, the Republican budget is a sad \ncommentary on our values. It shortchanges young and old alike. It is a \nbudget that is anti-child, anti-education, and anti-senior citizen. Its \npriorities are not the priorities of the American people, and it should \nbe rejected.\n  This budget spends $1.6 trillion over the next ten years on tax cuts, \nbut only $153 billion on Medicare prescription drugs. Almost half the \ntax cut goes to the richest one percent of Americans--people with \nincomes averaging more than a million dollars a year. The GOP budget \ngives this small number of wealthy families more than five times as \nmuch as it provides for essential prescription drugs for forty million \nelderly and disabled Americans.\n  The President and the sponsors of this budget say that they want to \nprovide prescription drug coverage for every elderly American under \nMedicare. But adoption of this budget will make this goal much more \ndifficult to achieve. This budget squanders the surplus and saves only \ntoken amounts for Medicare prescription drugs.\n  In fact the budget does not even fund the low income program fully. \nIf the block grant program is adjusted for inflation, it will cost $210 \nbillion over 10 years, not the $153 billion that this budget provides. \nClearly, there is not enough money in this budget to fund a Medicare \nbenefit for all senior citizens.\n  The choice could not be clearer. Do we stand with America's senior \ncitizens--or with the privileged few? Do we believe the budget surplus \nshould be used to benefit all Americans--or just the wealthiest \nAmericans? Do we believe it is more important for people who already \nhave incomes of more than a million dollars a year to get an additional \n$50,000 a year, than it is for senior citizens scraping by on limited \nincomes to get the life-saving drugs their doctors prescribe?\n  For all of these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote against this \nanti-senior citizen budget.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my serious \ndisappointment with the budget resolution and to explain why I cannot \nvote for it. This resolution is irresponsible. It is irresponsible to \nthe citizens and businesses of this nation, to the fundamental economic \nprinciples for which we stand, and to the values that define us as \nAmericans. As I have stated often, the government does not create jobs \nor economic success. However, through fiscal discipline the government \ncan create an environment in which the private sector thrives. Fiscal \nresponsibility produced an environment that enabled the historic \neconomic growth of the past several years and the unprecedented surplus \nwe have today. I am sorry to say this resolution abandons that \ndiscipline.\n  Government should tend to the people's money with the same care and \nconsideration that individuals, families, and businesses demonstrate \nwhen handling their own dollars and cents. As I look at the budget \nresolution that we are voting on, I conclude that it lacks not only \nfiscal responsibility, but also a sense of reality. It is based \nentirely on large projected surpluses that we are not confident will \nmaterialize. And, if these surpluses are not realized, this budget \nresolution puts us at risk of returning to deficit spending financed by \nborrowing from the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds.\n  The tax cut provided for in this budget resolution is simply too \nlarge. At the very least, it will cost $1.35 trillion over 11 years. In \naddition, if you add in other required or likely to pass tax \nprovisions, including AMT reform, increased interest payments, \nextension of expiring tax provisions, pension reforms and business tax \ncuts, this package easily rises to above $2 trillion. While I support \nsignificant tax cuts, that amount is more than we can afford. This \nbudget resolution spends too much of the projected surplus on a tax cut \nthat is too large and it uses too little of the surplus for other \npriorities.\n  Additionally, this resolution does not seriously address debt \nreduction. Aside from funds already committed to the Medicare and \nSocial Security Trust Funds, this budget does not devote a single \ndollar over the entire decade towards paying down our national debt. \nBecause this resolution is so irresponsible, it is not at all clear \nthat even the Medicare and Social Security Trust funds will be \navailable for debt reduction if they are used instead to pay for the \ntax cut. Sadly, this budget resolution sacrifices the unique \nopportunity that we have at this point in time to successfully pay down \nour publicly held debt--the key to low interest rates and economic \ngrowth.\n  This budget resolution sets us on course for an appropriations train \nwreck later this year and in the future. The spending levels do not \neven keep up with inflation. The resolution provides total \ndiscretionary spending levels for FY02 that are $2 billion below CBO's \nbaseline with inflation. For the 10-year period, they are $24 billion \nbelow inflation. Despite the rhetoric, it removes nearly $300 billion \nin additional education funding that the Senate had added to its budget \nresolution. It provides an increase of only $3.3 billion above \ninflation for defense in FY02 and only $40 billion over ten years--$22 \nbillion less than the President's request prior to the Rumsfeld review. \nAccording to the resolution, any increased spending as a result of the \nRumsfeld review which is likely to be at least $250 billion over 10 \nyears--would come out of the contingency reserve fund. This fund may \nnot even exist if surplus projections do not materialize or if Congress \ntaps it for other purposes, including additional tax cuts.\n  This budget resolution does not represent reality, but fantasy. It \nabandons fiscal discipline and blithely overspends a surplus whose size \nsix months down the road or six years down the road is at best \ntheoretical. This agreement sets our country on a dangerous path toward \nresurrecting the deficits we worked so hard to eliminate over the past \nseveral years. Finally, this resolution does not add up because the \nAdministration and the Majority here in Congress prefer to sound the \ncall for compassionate conservatism rather than engage in honest \naccounting. It is ``dejavoodoo economics.'' It commits us to the same \nfiscal mistakes of the early 1980s that had a horrendous and long-\nlasting impact on our economy.\n  So I call on centrists of both parties here in the Senate to not \nwaste a decade's worth of hard work invested in re-building our \neconomy. I urge my colleagues to look closely at this resolution. It is \nnot what the American people deserve, nor is it what they expect it to \nbe. In support of progress and prosperity, I must vote no and I \nencourage my centrist colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I want to express my support \nfor the conference report on the budget resolution. My affirmative vote \non this report will be cast for several reasons, but the most important \none among them is that this resolution provides the American people \nwith a substantial tax cut--without neglecting our national budgetary \nobligations. The concerted effort from Senators and Members of Congress \non both sides of the aisle in the negotiating process has culminated in \na victory for American taxpayers.\n  The vote on the budget resolution will succeed in doing a great deal \nfor our country and for our future. Today we are authorizing the third \nlargest tax cut in the history of our Union. The men and women of \nNebraska, as well as the men and women across the Nation, will directly \nbenefit from the $1.25 trillion tax cut over 11 years that will enable \nus to still pay down the national debt and meet our domestic budgetary \npriorities. The American people deserve a tax cut, and it is the\n\n[[Page S4791]]\n\nrole of Congress and the administration to deliver it. This conference \nreport is our delivery vehicle.\n  Of even greater consequence than the tax cut spread over 11 years is \nthe inclusion of a $100 billion up-front stimulus package, which will \nhelp strengthen our economy sooner rather than later. I firmly believe \nthat our economy, which has been showing all the symptoms of a slow-\ndown, needs a jump-start from a stimulus package to blunt the effect of \nwhat could become a serious economic recession. As any doctor will tell \nyou, you should not wait until the patient is on life support before \nyou begin treatment. It is critical that we heed the warning signs of a \nslowing economy, and use the tools within our legislative power to \nprevent the situation from metastasizing. The 2-year, $100-billion \neconomic stimulus package prescribed by this conference report will put \nthe American economy back on the road to recovery.\n  Another important aspect of the resolution, in addition to the \nsubstantial tax cut and the upfront stimulus package, is the increased \nsupport of agriculture. When our budget negotiations started, \nagriculture was a mere footnote in the margin. While it remains a \nfootnote, it is now a little bolder and a little bigger. I am anxious \nto see agriculture removed altogether from ``footnote'' status, or more \naccurately, out of emergency spending mode; but I am pleased in the \ninterim that at least we are increasing agriculture funding to a more \nsubstantial--and realistic--level. While a new farm bill would be more \nwelcome than prolonging the endless cycle of emergency spending, the \n$79 billion over 11 years that has been included in this Report does \nrecognize and consider the unfavorable odds and inequities that our \nfarmers and ranchers are forced to contend with due to a problematic \nfarm bill and unpredictable hardships dispensed by Mother Nature.\n  As with any compromise, the conference report on the budget \nresolution is not representative of my ideal budgetary blueprint. I \naccept, however, that ``giving and taking'' is an integral part of the \nbicameral, bipartisan negotiating process. While this report could be \nstronger in some areas--namely, education--I am comfortable casting an \naffirmative vote, because it meets an important criterion I have \nconsistently promoted throughout the process. This report authorizes a \nsubstantial tax cut--including an up-front economic stimulus package--\nthat allows us to still provide for our critical domestic priorities, \nsuch as preserving Social Security and Medicare, paying down the \nnational debt, and funding agriculture. As a result, I will vote in \nfavor of this conference report.\n  While the final outcome of the budget resolution cannot be described \naccurately as a triumph for bipartisanship, it can be characterized as \na triumph for American taxpayers. It is my hope that we will forge \nahead on other issues in a stronger and more cohesive spirit, more \nunited in our efforts and less divided in our cause. It is time to make \n``politics as usual'' synonymous with progress, not partisanship.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield myself the remaining time and I \nask the Chair if he would inform me when I have 5 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, first, I thank the chairman of the Budget Committee \nfor his courtesy as we have considered the budget conference report. I \nrespect him. I admire him. I have affection for him. I disagree with \nhim with respect to this budget, and I disagree with him strongly with \nrespect to this budget.\n  I do not believe this is the right budget plan for our country, and \nit is not an opinion limited to me. We have heard on our side of the \naisle how deficient we believe this budget is.\n  I noticed in this morning's New York Times the lead editorial was \nentitled ``An Irresponsible Budget Plan.'' I will read the first \nsentence:\n\n       After several days of back room negotiations, the House \n     approved a federal budget plan yesterday that is a model of \n     fiscal evasion and irresponsibility.\n\n  I echo those words.\n  Earlier the Washington Post called this budget we are considering \ntoday an unreal budget. They concluded their editorial by saying:\n\n       The theme of this budget is tax cuts first, sweep up \n     afterward. It's the wrong way around. Budget resolutions are \n     supposed to foster fiscal responsibility. This one will have \n     the opposite effect.\n\n  Unfortunately, that is the case. The reason for it is quite clear. \nFirst, this entire budget is based on a 10-year forecast--10 years. \nThis is not money in the bank; these are projections over 10 years. The \npeople who made the projections have warned us of the uncertainty. In \nfact, they told us that in the fifth year alone, based on the previous \nvariances in their forecasts, we could have anywhere from a $50 billion \ndeficit to more than a $1 trillion surplus.\n  In fact, they have told us there is only a 10-percent chance the \nforecast number that is being used, that is being relied on, will come \ntrue. There is a 45-percent chance there will be more money; a 45-\npercent chance there will be less money. And that forecast was made 8 \nweeks ago before we saw additional weakness in the economy.\n  Just yesterday, we saw the productivity growth forecast come out on \nthe first quarter of this year. They were expecting a 1-percent \nincrease. Instead, they got a reduction. If there is just a 1-percent \nreduction in productivity over the forecast period, instead of having a \n$5.6 trillion surplus, we will have a $3.2 trillion surplus. It seems \nto me that advises caution in what we do on this budget resolution.\n  Those are not the only defects of this budget. There are huge chunks \nof spending that are not even in this budget, that have not been \nincluded. For example, here is a story from USA Today, Friday, April \n27. ``Billions Sought for Arms.'' The story says that the Secretary of \nDefense and this administration are expected to seek a large boost in \ndefense spending, $200 billion to $300 billion over the next 6 years.\n  That money is not in the budget. None of that money is in the budget. \nWhy not?\n  Perhaps we heard the reason in an interview this last weekend on \n``Meet the Press.'' The Secretary of Defense was there. He was asked:\n\n       Will you get the $10 billion more in defense money this \n     year that you need?\n\n  His response:\n\n       I don't know. I have not gone to the President as yet. He \n     wanted to wait until after some of the studies had been \n     completed and until the tax bill was behind us. . . .\n\n  That is the real reason this budget is unreal. It is the real reason \nthis budget is irresponsible, because they are not telling us the full \nstory. They do not really have the budget before us. What they have is \na part of the budget because they know what we know. If they put the \nfull budget in place on one piece of paper, on one document, it would \nnot add up. That is the problem with this budget.\n  It goes to education. The President says education is his highest \npriority, and yet there is no new money in this budget for education. \nIn the Senate, when we considered the budget, we passed the Harkin \namendment that added $225 billion for education. It took $450 billion \naway from the tax cut and put $225 billion into education and put $225 \nbillion into paying down more of the debt. What came back from the \nconference committee? Not one penny of that amendment survived.\n\n  We passed a bipartisan amendment on the floor of the Senate when the \nbudget resolution was considered, with $70 billion of additional \nfunding for education to address the disabilities act. Not one penny of \nthat increase came back from the conference committee. That is true \nthroughout the education budget.\n  We have heard a lot of talk that somehow there is money in this \nbudget, new money for education. Here is the document. Here it is by \nfiscal year. What it shows is the increase in budget authority and \noutlays over what is in the so-called baseline is zero. It is zero for \n2002; it is zero for 2003; it is zero for every single year.\n  There were a lot of brave speeches about education being the \npriority, but it is clearly not a priority in the budget because there \nis no new money in the budget for education.\n  It doesn't stop there. Not only is it the case that the defense \nbuildup that we all know is going to be announced, perhaps as early as \nnext week, is not in the budget, the President says education is a \npriority, but that is not in\n\n[[Page S4792]]\n\nthe budget. And then we see the President has a meeting at the White \nHouse and says he is going to strengthen Social Security but there is \nno money in the budget for that.\n  We have an editorial from the Columbus Dispatch that says:\n\n       The tax-cut proposal works against [the President's] plan \n     to begin privatizing Social Security. . .experts differ on \n     how much this ``transition cost'' will be, but it won't be \n     cheap. . .thus, the Bush's 10-year, $1.3 trillion tax cut \n     would deprive the Government of the cash it would need to pay \n     for the $1 trillion transition cost for the first 10 years of \n     Bush's Social Security privatization plan. The goals are \n     contradictory.\n\n  Do you see a pattern? The administration is calling for a major \ndefense buildup but the money is not in the budget. The President says \neducation is a top priority but the money is not in the budget. The \nPresident says he is going to fix Social Security but the money is not \nin the budget.\n  Why? I think we all know the reason why. Because if the money were in \nthe budget for the defense buildup, if the money were in the budget for \nthe education initiatives, if the money were in the budget to \nstrengthen Social Security, then the budget does not add up. In fact, \nit would show they are raiding the Medicare trust fund by over $200 \nbillion. They are raiding the Social Security trust fund by over $200 \nbillion. That is the dirty little secret of this budget. It is the \nreason whole chunks of what is really intended have been left out.\n  Over in the House they had two missing pages. It stalled the budget \nwork for a week. Two missing pages? There is more than two missing \npages. There are whole chunks of the real budget that have been left \nout because they know it doesn't add up.\n  As we look ahead, it is critical to understand we are in a period of \nsurplus now. These projections of surpluses may hold. They may not. But \nat least we have a projection of surpluses. We know when the baby \nboomers start to retire that these surpluses turn to massive deficits. \nThen the question will be: What did we do when we had the opportunity \nto prepare for what was to come?\n  This is what we are doing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes remaining.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair for advising me of the time.\n  If we go back to the budget that is before us and put back the \ndefense buildup the administration is going to call for and which is \nauthorized in this budget, although the numbers are not included, if we \nwould go back and correct the alternative minimum tax that is going to \naffect over 35 million taxpayers in this country, one in every four \ntaxpayers who think they are going to get a tax cut but are going to be \nsurprised when they find out they are caught up in the alternative \nminimum tax and it costs $290 billion to fix it; if we put in the \neducation amendment that passed on the Senate floor last week on a \nunanimous consent basis; if we put in the emergencies that we all know \nare going to occur that run on average $5 billion a year; and if we put \nin the associated interest costs with those items, what we find is that \nwe would be deep into the Medicare trust fund; that we would be deep \ninto the Social Security trust fund.\n  That is the reason all of those items have been left out--because \nthis budget does not add up.\n  There has been a lot of talk about reducing the public debt, but the \npart of the debt they have been talking about is the publicly held \ndebt. It is true, the publicly held debt is going down under this \nbudget. It is going down from $3.2 trillion at the end of this year to \n$800 billion at the end of this 10-year period.\n  Do you know what? While the publicly held debt is going down, the \ndebt to the trust funds of the United States is going up. As a result, \nthe gross debt of the United States, which is currently $5.6 trillion, \nwill be $6.7 trillion at the end of this time. It is very interesting--\njust about the amount of the tax cut is the amount of additional debt \nour country will have at the end of this 10-year period.\n  I believe these are the top six reasons to oppose the budget \nresolution conference report.\n  No. 1, no new money for education;\n  No. 2, unaffordable tax cuts crowd out priorities, especially paying \ndown this national debt;\n  No. 3, it hides defense spending increases by providing a blank check \nto the Bush administration;\n  No. 4, it sets up a raid on the Social Security and Medicare trust \nfunds;\n  No. 5, it cuts spending for high-priority domestic needs by $56 \nbillion over the next 10 years. They are $56 billion short of just \nkeeping pace with inflation, not to mention population growth.\n  Finally, No. 6, it fails to set aside funds for the long-term Social \nSecurity and Medicare reform needs we all understand are before us.\n  Perhaps it is time to review history. Those who are advocating this \nbudget are the very ones who, back in the 1980s, advocated a similar \npolicy, a policy of a massive tax cut combined with a substantial \nbuildup in defense. What was the result? The result was an explosion of \nthe deficits in the Reagan administration and a further growth of the \ndeficits in the Bush administration. It was only when we had a new \nadministration and a new fiscal plan that deficits started coming down \nand we began to pay down debt.\n  Here is the record. It is as clear as it can be. President Reagan \ncame in; he had about a $80 billion deficit. That exploded to over $200 \nbillion, with exactly the same kind of economic analysis that has been \ndone and with the same advocates that put in place that plan.\n  Then the deficit further exploded under President Bush to over $290 \nbillion. It was only when a new administration came in and we put in \nplace a 5-year plan to bring our fiscal house back into order that we \nbegan to reduce deficits, reduce debt, and put this Nation in a \nposition to have the longest economic expansion in our history.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask our colleagues to oppose this budget resolution so \nwe do not repeat this history.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico controls time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Am I correct now, there is no time remaining on the \nother side and I have how many minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So our fellow Senators ought to know, we are going to \nfinish in a timely manner and the vote will be sometime after 11:30.\n  First, I thank all the wonderful staff on both sides of this budget \nbattle. Much more work goes into this than anybody thinks.\n  In particular, I say to Bill Hoagland, the staff director on our \nside, and to his staff, thank you so much for all you have done. It has \nbeen a great effort.\n  Mr. President, fellow Senators, those who are listening, this is a \nbudget for prosperity now and prosperity in the future, plain and \nsimple. It is the largest commitment of money for education in our \nNation's history. I will go into some details on that momentarily. It \nkeeps our word. Social Security and Medicare are not touched. Their \nfunds are not used.\n  I know that Senator Byrd said today on the floor that when your \nmother calls you--implying on Mother's Day--tell her that the Social \nSecurity trust fund is being raided, and whatever else he said we \nshould be responding to our mothers on Mother's Day.\n  I have another response. My mother is not alive. But if she were to \ncall me, I would say: Your Social Security is intact and fully \nprotected. Medicare is fully protected. But also, mother, there is $300 \nbillion in this budget for prescription drugs and reform of the \nMedicare program--$300 billion. The House wanted only $146 billion. \nThere is $300 billion to get started on the program. There is $300 \nbillion that can be used.\n  I say, in addition to my mother, that this budget is good for me, one \nof your children, and for the other three children, and for the \ngrandchildren, six of whom are working. I am just describing a family. \nDo you know that it is good for them, mother? Because we are going to \ngive them back some of their hard-earned tax money. You know they are \nhurting because of gas prices. They are hurting because of electric \nbills. Everybody is working on some way to fix that.\n  But wouldn't it be nice if, in fact, your sons and daughters and \ngrandchildren this year and next year got a very significant tax \nreduction?\n  Frankly, I could go on and on as to what this budget does.\n  But let me suggest that to bring into this debate the subject of \nSocial Security and Medicare is just another part\n\n[[Page S4793]]\n\nof the same old argument. Whenever tax cuts for the American people are \nclose at hand and we are going to do something for them, every argument \nin the world that can be invented from a budget standpoint is offered \nin opposition. It is a wonder that the American people ever get a tax \ncut; we have our minds on so many things that we can do with that \nmoney.\n  But we decided today to take about 25 percent of the surplus--it \nsounds like we are using all of it--about 25 or 26 percent, and give it \nback to the Americans in an orderly way for such things as child \ncredits, marriage tax penalty, which everybody knows should be done, \nand marginal rate reductions with bigger cuts at the bottom end than at \nthe top end.\n  I don't know what else we can do. I believe we have done everything \nin this budget that you can do in a rational way to make sure that the \nsurplus is handled in a proper manner and that it is there to have the \nright things feed on it, use it, and get money out of that surplus for \nthings we must have.\n  I have already disagreed with my friend on the other side. But I \ndon't disagree from the standpoint of his hard work, his own views, and \nhis own opinions. I would not be asking people to vote for a budget \nresolution that touched the Social Security trust fund. I wouldn't be \nasking them to vote for one that touched Medicare because it does not. \nBut neither would I ask them to vote for a budget resolution that some \nwould want that would spend all the money instead of having any of it \nfor the taxpayers of America.\n\n  We have heard all kinds of ideas of what should be in this budget. If \nanybody is adding it up and listening to us, I guess you would conclude \nthat the Government of the United States is going to take care of every \nproblem in the United States, and if we just didn't gave the taxpayers \nback any money, we would be out there solving all of them.\n  We know that isn't true. This budget is an increase over last year. \nIn fact, I know that the House and the Senate would do it in their own \nway.\n  I see the chairman of the House Budget Committee. I want to tell the \nSenate that I believe on the nondiscretionary side of this budget there \nis a little bit more than 5 percent over last year they can spend. The \nHouse started at 4; the President started at 4. That is $6.2 billion \nmore we have for education and other things of significance.\n  I want to close my remarks where I started. This budget is for \nprosperity. Now, because it has $100 billion that will go back to the \nAmerican taxpayers in these next 2 years, this one and the next, and it \nis a budget for the future because for America to prosper we have to \nhave low taxes and low tax rates. It has been our history that we \ncompete not through government but through innovation, and through \npeople investing their money, time, talents, and working hard. If you \nhave high taxes, you get less of those things in an economy. That is \njust it.\n  Senator Nickles also told us about how much we are paying in taxes as \na group of people, as Americans. It is very high. We are going to \nreduce it a little bit--not very much; $1.25 billion over ten years is \nnot very much. In fact, when you look at that as part of the total tax \ntake, what we are going to give back to the American people is rather \ninsignificant.\n  I close by saying to everyone here: This is your chance today but not \nthe last chance because there is a $500 billion surplus remaining. But \nthis is your chance to say to the American people before we spend all \nof your tax money that isn't needed, we are going to give you a little \nbit of it to be used as you see fit because we trust you. Not only do \nwe trust you, but we think the less you are taxed, the harder you work, \nand the more you will invest in your life, in productivity, in growth \nand doing things, and the more you will sit around the family table \nsaying what you can do with your money instead of saying the Government \nis taking so much of your money.\n  In conclusion, this has been as tough as it comes. I have been at \nbudgeting for many years. It is tough because there are people on both \nsides of the aisle, in the White House, and in the House of \nRepresentatives, who have their own opinions and nothing was going to \nchange anybody's opinion. A lot of opinions have been changed. There \nhave been many compromises, which is what we have to do to get our work \ndone. This compromise package is the best we can do this year. I \nbelieve it is good for our future. I believe the American people, in \nabout 6 months, will say it is a very good budget. And, yes, I believe \nthose wondering where the education money is coming from will be very \nhappy. There will be over an 11-percent or perhaps as much as a 12-\npercent increase in education with some highlighted at higher increases \nthan that.\n\n  I think that is what we ought to be doing. The highest priority on \nthe domestic side is education.\n  I want to say to President Bush, you didn't get everything you \nwanted, Mr. President, but I want to compliment you because you have \nmade us change direction. You have moved us in the direction of giving \nback taxes to the American people rather than giving them the last cut \nafter the debt. They are going to get some of those taxes back now, \nnext year, and the year after. That is a new direction. Mr. President, \nyou ought to be proud of it.\n  We will implement it in due course, and, frankly, I think that we \nwill all say this was a job well done, as hard as it was.\n  I close by saying if we don't want to do this now, when will we do \nit? How much more surplus will we have to have? I believe we have \nenough surplus that we should leave part of it in the hands of the \ntaxpayers.\n  I yield such time as I might have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the \nconference report.

The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank everyone who participated in \nthis debate. I believe we have a good product and now we will implement \nit over the next year.\n  Once again, I thank everybody who participated on both sides of the \naisle. We have a good product. Now everybody can begin to implement it. \nIt means different things to different people, but in the end, it is \npretty clear we are going to have a significant tax reduction plan in \nplace. Let's hope, as we work through it, we will get some of the other \nthings that most of us believe are in this budget resolution and see if \nwe can carry them out in the ensuing months.\n  I thank the ranking member on the Budget Committee for the way he \nconducted himself, the information he put together, and the knowledge \nhe has obtained. It has been a pleasure working with him. I thank him \nvery much.\n\n[[Page S4794]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I congratulate the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee for his victory today and for the way he has conducted \nhimself. I appreciate the relationship we have. We disagree on this \nbudget, but I have great respect for him as a Senator and as a person.\n  I also thank the staff on both sides. They worked incredibly hard in \nthese last 2 days, in some cases almost around the clock. I thank my \nstaff director, Mary Naylor, for her extraordinary efforts, Sue Nelson, \nJim Horney, and the entire group of budget staffers on our side.\n  I also want to recognize the professionalism of the staff director on \nthe Republican side. Bill Hoagland is a consummate professional, as are \nthe other members of the staff on the Republican side. We have a very \nprofessional working relationship. They have worked very hard to \nproduce this document.\n  One of the great things about the Senate and the Congress is we will \nbe back. These battles are not over. We have a different sense of what \nthe priorities should be for the country, and we will be speaking out \non those issues in the days ahead.\n  Again, I congratulate those on the other side who prevailed on this \nvote. I look forward to a continuing debate on what should be the \nfiscal course for the country.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/10/senate-section/article/S4794-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4794-S4812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        BETTER EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ACT--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 403.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to yield for a question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am wondering if the Senator would like to have a \nrollcall vote.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would like to have a rollcall vote. I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator be willing to enter into a reasonable \ntime period? It is the noon hour now, just for notice to our Members. \nWe had a good debate on this amendment. It is a very important one. I \nwant to do whatever permits the Senator to make his case again.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I see a unanimous consent request which I think will \nbe fine. I say to my colleague from Massachusetts, like other Senators, \nI have other amendments to this bill and there will be plenty of time \nfor extended debate later.\n  This is a good amendment for the Senate to go on record. I am pleased \nto agree to a time limit.\n  Mr. President, I still have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield so I can propound \na unanimous consent request regarding the Senator's amendment?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to do so.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that with \nrespect to the Wellstone amendment No. 403, the time between now and \n1:45 p.m. today be evenly divided in the usual form, with no second-\ndegree amendments in order. I further ask unanimous consent that the \nvote occur in relation to the Wellstone amendment at 1:45 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, first, I will be clear about this amendment. With this \namendment, we want to make sure, as we talk about accountability and \ntesting, that this is done the right way. In many ways this amendment--\nreally, in all ways, this amendment tracks the consensus in the testing \ncommunity, the work of the Committee on Economic Development, which is \nthe arm of the business community which is very pro-testing.\n  We are saying a number of things:\n  First, it is extremely important that this testing that is done--\nafter all, we are talking about testing every year from age 8 through \nage 13--that this testing that is done meet the criterion that is \ncomprehensive; that is to say, there are multiple measures for any kind \nof testing that is done in our country. It is terribly important that \nis done.\n  Second, it is important that it be coherent, that there is a \nconnection, there is a relationship that the testing actually tests the \ncurriculum and the subject matter being taught. It seems to me that is \nthe very least we can do for our local school districts.\n  Third, as we continue, it is important we be able to measure progress \nover time, how these children are doing.\n  Moreover, this amendment says that States will provide evidence to \nthe Secretary that the tests they use are of adequate technical quality \nfor each purpose for which they are used. It is very important that \nthis be done the right way.\n  Finally, it says itemized score analyses should be provided to \ndistricts and schools so tests can meet their intended purpose, which \nis to help the people on the ground, the teachers and the parents, know \nspecifically what their children are struggling with so they can help \nthem do better.\n  I am absolutely amazed that this amendment has not been accepted. I \nthought there would be a real consensus behind this amendment. The \nreason I say this is all across the country, in case colleagues have \nnot taken note of this, they are having a very negative reaction to \ntesting being done the wrong way. We have a lot of very distinguished \neducators at the higher end level saying we ought not rely on the SAT \nas a single test. We have parents, children, young people--really \nstarting in the suburbs, interestingly enough--who are rebelling. We \nare having more and more reports coming out that the really gifted \nteachers, the very teachers we need in the school districts where \nchildren are most underserved, are leaving the profession because they \ndo not want to teach to the standardized test; they do not want to be \ndrill instructors.\n  In addition, there has been, I think, some very important, moving \nwriting that has come out. Marc Fisher, a columnist with the Washington \nPost, wrote a piece on May 8. The headline is, ``Mountain of Tests \nSlowly Crushing School Quality.'' I recommend this piece to my \ncolleagues.\n  What Marc Fisher is saying, on the basis of what a lot of teachers \nand a lot of parents are saying, is that if you just have the \nstandardized tests, if you do not do this the right way, if you do\n\n[[Page S4795]]\n\nnot have multiple measures, if you do not have tests that are actually \ntesting the curriculum that is being taught, then what you are going to \nhave all across the country is drill education.\n  It is a sad sight to see when you have 8-year-olds and 9-year-olds \nsitting in straight rows--I have seen it on television--and you have a \nteacher saying: 2 plus 2 is 4; 3 plus 3 is 6; 5 plus 5 is 10. This goes \nfor education, drill education, for standardized tests, for worksheets \nthat have to be filled out. It is educationally deadening, and not one \nSenator would want his or her children to be taught that way or would \nwant to see a teacher have to teach that way. But if we are not \ncareful, that is what is going to happen.\n  My understanding is the administration is opposed to this amendment. \nI am amazed that any education Senator would be opposed to this \namendment.\n  There is another piece that Marc Fisher wrote today which is a real \nheartbreaker. ``Schools Find Wrong Answers To Test Pressure'' is the \nheadline. I am just going to quote the latter part of this piece.\n       Michael West, a professor at Virginia Commonwealth \n     University, tells me that at his daughter's middle school, \n     students who pass this week's tests have been told they can \n     skip the final week of school. There's a great lesson: First \n     prize--you don't learn.\n       The testing mania has brought with it a tidal wave of \n     mediocre teaching materials, Julie Philips, a teacher who \n     recently moved from the New York suburbs to Montgomery \n     County, says, ``Great books are tossed on the heap so that \n     students can practice writing about short, fable-like tales \n     that test prep writers concoct to imitate what is on the \n     tests. It is so disheartening.''\n       Listen to a third-grade teacher who has taught in a Fairfax \n     County school for 30 years. Here are a few of the things she \n     says she has had to eliminate from her classroom since the \n     SOL tests took over the curriculum:\n       ``We would have a whole biography unit. We would read a \n     biography of a famous American. We would talk about the \n     elements of a biography. Then the children would choose a \n     famous American for a report. They would write their own \n     autobiography. Finally, they would write a biography of one \n     of their parents. It really got the children talking to their \n     parents about their lives. I typed this up and bound it as a \n     book which the children illustrated. (I don't have time \n     anymore. I have to teach to the SOLs.)\n       ``I would teach a poetry unit. We would explore the various \n     forms of poetry and the children would write at least one \n     poem in each of six forms. They would illustrate them and we \n     would bind them as a book. Something for them to keep \n     forever. (I don't have time anymore. We read some poems and \n     picked out the rhyming words so they can pass their SOLs.)\n       ``I would teach reading twice a day so the children who \n     were behind could catch up. I was able to raise some children \n     by two years in one school year. (I don't have time anymore. \n     I have to teach to the SOLs. I have to teach how to fill in \n     bubbles.)''\n       Frustrated by the new test-driven curriculum, this teacher \n     has decided to leave her profession. Is that school reform?\n\n  I say to my colleagues: Believe me, next week I will have trigger \namendments and I will talk about the mockery of not having the \nresources so these children will have a chance to succeed. But today \nyou cannot even vote for an amendment that would assure quality of \ntesting so we do not drive the best teachers out of the profession?\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Senators are wondering what is going to be happening in the \nnext couple of hours. With the courtesy extended to me by the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, the Senator has told me he wishes to speak for another \n20 minutes or thereabouts on the amendment that is pending, \napproximately; is that right?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Approximately. I am not sure exactly.\n  Mr. REID. The only thing we have, Senator Lincoln is here. She is \ngoing to speak for 15 minutes on an amendment she is going to offer. \nThe opposition would ask for 15 minutes. We wanted to have a couple of \nvotes at about quarter until 2.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I certainly want to accommodate other Senators, but I \nwant to hear the arguments against this amendment. I want people to \ncome out here and debate this amendment. I want to have a chance to \nrespond to those arguments.\n  Mr. REID. Whatever time the Senator has, they will have that time, \nand if they choose to speak against it, they certainly can. I am \nwondering if we could have the Senator's agreement that we could have a \ncouple of votes at quarter to 2. The Senator from Arkansas wishes 30 \nminutes equally divided on her amendment, which would leave the rest of \nthe time for the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to. I want to reserve 5 minutes before \nthe vote to have a chance to summarize and, I say to my colleague from \nArkansas, I will certainly try to finish my initial responses. I \ncertainly would like to know what is the basis of the opposition to \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. REID. If I may say to my friend from Vermont, I ask unanimous \nconsent that at 1:45 there be two votes, a vote on the Lincoln \namendment, which will be offered shortly--there will be a half hour \nequally divided on that--and there will also be a vote on the Wellstone \namendment which is the pending amendment. So the time not used for the \nLincoln amendment would be evenly divided for Wellstone and those who \nwant to speak in opposition thereto.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I think I have a unanimous consent request that has a \nsequence.\n  Mr. REID. The problem with that is, it asks the Wellstone amendment \nbe laid aside and he wants to finish. Perhaps that may be appropriate. \nWould the Senator from Minnesota allow the Senator from Arkansas to \noffer an amendment and speak for 10 or 15 minutes and you have the \nremaining time until quarter to 2?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Yes. That would be fine. I would be pleased to hear \nfrom my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota still controls the \ntime.\n  Mr. REID. We understand that.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, will the Senator from Minnesota yield \nfor a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nWellstone amendment be laid aside and the Senate then turn to amendment \n451, and with respect to the Lincoln amendment, the time between now \nand 1:45 today be equally divided in the usual form with no second-\ndegree amendment in order.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I ask that be amended to \nallow the Lincoln amendment one-half hour evenly divided.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask that the Lincoln amendment be \nallowed one-half hour.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I haven't even finished. I am not going to agree to \nhave my amendment set aside right now. I haven't made the case for the \namendment. I object. I probably will take another 15 minutes to explain \nwhy I think the amendment is so important. Then I would be pleased to \nyield the floor and we can move to the Lincoln amendment for a while \nand come back. I certainly don't want to lay the amendment aside right \nnow.\n  Mr. REID. We are planning on having two votes at 1:45. We will do our \nbest to get to that.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. That is something we can work out.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If we would not keep jumping on the floor with the \nunanimous consent requests, I could be finished in about 8 minutes, and \nthen you can have the floor and we can come back.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these two pieces by Marc \nFisher be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 10, 2001]\n\n              Schools Find Wrong Answers To Test Pressure\n\n                            (By Marc Fisher)\n\n       The fifth-grade girl stands in the foyer of Bethesda \n     Elementary School, capsized in tears. ``What's the matter \n     sweetie?'' a concerned mother asks. ``Can I help?''\n       The girl sobs and sobs. She cannot speak. Finally, she \n     gulps: ``I'm a few minutes late, I missed the bus and now I \n     can't go on the playground.''\n       The mother: ``They won't let you go on the playground if \n     you miss the bus?''\n       Girl: ``No, not the regular playground. There's a special \n     MSPAP playground, but you can't go on it unless you come on \n     time and bring your special red pen.''\n       It has come to this. The MSPAP--Maryland School Performance \n     Assessment Program--is Maryland's state-mandated standardized \n     test for children in grades 3, 5, and 8.\n\n[[Page S4796]]\n\n     It is used to compare how well schools perform. It is, \n     therefore, something principals and teachers desperately want \n     students to take seriously.\n       How desperately? Bethesda Elementary set up a special \n     playground with triple the usual time for students to play \n     and an array of extra games. ``If you're on time every day, \n     are here every day, and do your best on the test, you qualify \n     for the MSPAP Playground,'' says Principal Michael \n     Castagnola. ``It's a motivator. The kids get penalized if \n     they miss a day of the test. They know that if you work hard, \n     you're going to have fun.''\n       And if you miss the bus, what happens? ``You go to regular \n     recess,'' the principal says.\n       Just imagine the ribbing those kids get. No wonder the \n     little girl was weeping.\n       We don't need to dwell on the cheating scandals that have \n     hit Montgomery schools two years running, as panicky \n     principals and terrified teachers mortgage their consciences \n     to get the scores up at any cost. This week, at Silver Spring \n     International Middle School, the principal and six other \n     staffers were removed after students were given advance peeks \n     at a state math test.\n       Those cases are clear enough. Let's look instead at the \n     supposedly ethical ways in which schools twist and tweak kids \n     to get them to take the tests seriously.\n       In Virginia, where the Standards of Learning tests are much \n     more deadening than the relatively creative MSPAPs, Michelle \n     Crotteau, who teaches 10th- and 11th-grade English in \n     Rockingham County in the Shenandoah Valley, administered the \n     test this week with a heavy heart.\n       Our students are given a five-point bonus on their final \n     grade if they pass the SOL test in each subject area,'' she \n     says. ``So a student with an 89 or B average for course work \n     who passes an SOL earns an A. Last year, I had two students \n     who failed my course because they did not bother to do most \n     of the coursework, yet these students passed the class \n     because of the five added points. Talk about grade \n     inflation!''\n       Michael West, a professor at Virginia Commonwealth \n     University, tells me that at his daughter's middle school, \n     students who pass this week's test have been told they can \n     skip the final week of school. There's a great lesson: First \n     prize--you don't learn.\n       In Maryland, there are MSPAP snacks and MSPAP parties. In \n     Virginia, there are entire classes devoted to preparing for \n     the SOL tests. At Carl Sandburg Middle School in Fairfax \n     County, ``Friday SOL prep classes have been going on'' since \n     the depth of winter, says eighth-grader Ijeoma Nwatu. ``We've \n     recently been given worksheets with test-taking skills, \n     vocabulary terms, graphs and stories.'' On Friday, the \n     children will work on SOL posters, which, they've been told, \n     will boost their self-esteem.\n       The testing mania has brought with it a tidal wave of \n     mediocre teaching materials. Julie Philips, a teacher who \n     recently moved from the New York suburbs to Montgomery \n     County, says, ``Great books are tossed on the heap so that \n     students can practice writing about short, fable-like tales \n     that test prep writers concoct to imitate what is on the \n     tests. It is so disheartening.''\n       Schools are so fearful of performing poorly that some \n     Virginia districts axed the 15-minute recess to cram in more \n     test prep time. ``With the pressure of the SOLs, there is no \n     time for recess built into the schedule,'' Ron Weaver, \n     principal of a Roanoke County elementary school, told the \n     Roanoke Times. Virginia's Board of Education last year \n     finally ordered elementary schools to reinstate a daily \n     recess.\n       Some schools responded to the board's cry for a bit of \n     common sense by leading kids on a three- or four-minute walk \n     after lunch and calling it recess. Three minutes! Other \n     grudgingly restoring a 15-minute recess--by cutting the \n     minutes out of physical education class. Gee, thanks.\n       Supporters of the testing binge argue that teaching to the \n     test is a good thing, because it ensures that schools will \n     eliminate unnecessary frills and focus on essentials--the \n     reading and math skills that the tests measure.\n       That one-size-fits-all approach is driving parents nuts in \n     schools where kids are achieving; their kids are losing out \n     on creative lessons and enriching activities because \n     bureaucrats insist that all schools act identically.\n       But the notion that we must do this for low-achieving \n     students is equally flawed; they need inspiration and \n     individualized attention even more than kids from privileged \n     backgrounds.\n       Listen to a third-grade teacher who has taught in a Fairfax \n     County school for 30 years. Here are a few of the things she \n     says she has had to eliminate from her classroom since the \n     SOL tests took over the curriculum:\n       ``We would have a whole biography unit. We would read a \n     biography of a famous American. We would talk about the \n     elements of a biography. Then the children would choose a \n     famous American for a report. They would write their own \n     autobiography. Finally, they would write a biography of one \n     of their parents. It really got the children talking to their \n     parents about their lives. I typed this up and bound it as a \n     book which the children illustrated. (I don't have time \n     anymore. I have to teach to the SOLs.)\n       ``I would teach a poetry unit. We would explore the various \n     forms of poetry and the children would write at least one \n     poem in each of six forms. They would illustrate them and we \n     would bind them as a book. Something for them to keep \n     forever. (I don't have time anymore. We read some poems and \n     picked out the rhyming words so they can pass their SOLs.)\n       ``I would teach reading twice a day so the children who \n     were behind could catch up. I was able to raise some children \n     by two years in one school year. (I don't have time anymore. \n     I have to teach to the SOLs. I have to teach how to fill in \n     bubbles.)''\n       Frustrated by the new test-driven curriculum, this teacher \n     has decided to leave her profession. Is that school reform?\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 8, 2001]\n\n            Mountain of Tests Slowly Crushing School Quality\n\n                            (By Marc Fisher)\n\n       Those who say the culture wars are over must not have \n     children of school age. The struggles that have divided the \n     nation for 20 years--the phonics fracas, the New Math mess, \n     the tiff over teaching morality--pale next to the brewing \n     battle over testing.\n       Just as President Bush and Congress reach consensus on \n     mandating even more testing for the nation's children, \n     colleges by the dozens step away from the SATs as a primary \n     arbiter of who gets in. Just as parents in poor schools rally \n     to use standardized tests to rid themselves of incompetent \n     teachers, parents in more affluent schools stage boycotts of \n     the very same tests.\n       And just as D-Day looms for high-stakes testing programs \n     like those in Virginia and Maryland that will deny diplomas \n     to kids who flunk the tests, parents and teachers alike raise \n     the alarm about classrooms where creativity, variety and \n     inspiration are becoming dirty words.\n       In Montgomery County, students reel under the burden of 50 \n     hours of testing each year, including the state-mandated \n     MSPAPs, three other state test programs and the county-\n     imposed CRTs. The 50 hours doesn't include PSATs, SATs or \n     Advanced Placement tests. Now, if Bush has his way, there'll \n     be nationally required tests as well.\n       In Virginia, the load is lighter, but the grumbling just as \n     heavy, especially as we near 2004, when thousands of seniors \n     will be denied diplomas if they fail the Standards of \n     Learning tests.\n       In wealthy Scarsdale, N.Y., more than half of the eighth-\n     graders stayed home during last week's state testing, capping \n     a boycott organized by parents fed up with testing and its \n     pernicious deadening impact on their kids' education.\n       In the District, a relative handful of parents--based in \n     affluent Northwest Washington--attempted a similar boycott of \n     last month's exams.\n       Caleb Rossiter, who teachers statistics at American \n     University, led the boycott, keeping his first-grader home \n     from Key Elementary in the Palisades. ``My son has had a \n     whole series of Stanford-9 prep days at school, when they \n     work over and over on multiple choice questions and how to \n     fill in the bubbles correctly,'' he says. ``If you could see \n     how they waste students' time with all this test prep--it's \n     so disheartening.''\n       Rossiter approached everyone from his son's teacher on up \n     to Superintendent Paul L. Vance, asking why first-graders, \n     many of whom can barely read, should be subjected to testing. \n     ``Everyone I talked to said there's no educational \n     justification for this,'' Rossiter says. ``They use the tests \n     to grade the teachers and the principal, which everyone \n     agrees the tests were not designed to do.''\n       As a statistician, Rossiter likes tests. He understands how \n     useful they can be in diagnosing learning problems. But he \n     and those who write the tests are offended by their misuse--\n     even as those companies rake in millions in the nation's \n     testing binge.\n       Tests that were never meant to do anything of the sort are \n     now used to determine teacher pay and to judge the quality of \n     schools. Even though research has repeatedly shown that \n     affluence is the strongest indicator of test success, scores \n     are now used to declare some schools losers and others--such \n     as the Prince George's County schools yesterday--winners.\n       The most corrosive effects of this measurement mania are \n     the emerging class and racial divisions over testing. ``It \n     just breaks my heart when I see parents stand up and cheer \n     when they hear that some number of kids in their school have \n     had their scores drawn up above Below Basic on the tests,'' \n     Rossiter says. ``They don't see what the effort to bring up \n     the scores is doing to the curriculum.''\n       They don't see the dispiriting effect of scrapping art, \n     music and physical education because they are not on the \n     tests. They don't see the minds that go uninspired because \n     teachers must forsake their craft to focus like drones on \n     getting the scores up.\n       ``Testing is even more damaging in low-income schools \n     because that's where you need the most creative teaching,'' \n     Rossiter says.\n       But testing is a lot cheaper than paying teachers a decent \n     wage, and testing makes politicians look tough, so we will \n     test and test. And one day, we will look up and see how we \n     have crushed our schools, and tests--which when used properly \n     have lifted the educational fortunes of many poor and middle-\n     income children--will end up the culprit, and the pendulum \n     will swing to the other extreme, zipping right past the happy \n     medium.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me explain what this amendment \ndoes.\n\n[[Page S4797]]\n\n By the way, so we can be clear we already know--I am going to \nsummarize--we actually already know which children are doing well and \nwhich children are not doing so well. Children who come from families \nwho are low income, where they do not have the same opportunities other \nchildren have for the very best developmental childcare, children who \nattend schools that don't have anywhere near the same resources that \nmore affluent schools have, children who live in inadequate housing and \nall too often their parents move two or three times during the school \nyear, children who are in schools where sometimes during the school \nyear there are two or three or four teachers who come in and try to \nteach and can't, and who do not have the best teachers, students who \nare in schools where the teachers don't make nearly the salaries and \ndon't have nearly the access to technology, we already know these \nchildren are not going to do well on these tests. We already know.\n  Actually, what we are going to do--and I will speak more about this \nnext week--is something that is incredibly cruel. We are going to fail \nthese children again because all of this authorization is fiction. We \nhave no agreement on any resources. We just had a budget that gives \ninstructions to appropriators, which means we are going to have but a \npittance.\n  I will have a particular amendment next week that says we do the \ntesting when we live up to the Dodd amendment and fund title I at that \nlevel.\n  By the way, when we are talking about these children and about full \nfunding over 10 years, why are we waiting 10 years, I ask my \ncolleagues. If a child is 8 years old now, 10 years from now when we \nfully fund these programs, although we don't have any commitment to do \nso yet, that child will be 18. Childhood is once. You don't recover \nyour childhood. Why aren't we helping these children now? Where in the \nbudget are the resources to help these children now? Where is the \ncommitment to help these children now? Instead, you are going to have \npeople pounding their chests saying they are all for accountability.\n  These tests don't do a thing when it comes to getting a good teacher, \nwhen it comes to a smaller class size, or when it comes to making sure \nchildren come to kindergarten ready. None of that is accomplished.\n  I say to my colleagues, at the very minimum let's at least not drive \nout good teachers. Let's not make the mistake of discouraging the very \nbest women and men from going into teaching. Let's not drive out good \nteachers by forcing them to be involved in drill education where they \nbasically are having to teach the tests and that is all that it is \nabout and no more. So they drop social studies, they drop music, they \ndrop theater, and they drop art. None of it is tested.\n  This amendment says we make the commitment that these tests around \nthe country, if we are going to talk about accountability, are \ncomprehensive. Don't use just one measurement. In addition, they are \ncoherent. They are a measurement that the curriculum is being taught, \nthat they are continuous, and we can see how a child is doing over a \nperiod of time.\n  We are saying the States need to provide evidence to the Secretary \nthat the tests they use are adequate and of technical quality for each \npurpose for which they are used. Why wouldn't you want to go on record \nmaking sure we have the high-quality tests used for the purposes for \nwhich they are supposed to be used?\n\n  Finally, the itemized test scores are provided to the schools so the \nparents and others know where the children are struggling and how they \ncan do better.\n  I am telling you, if we don't do this, there are two things that are \ngoing to happen. First of all, you are going to have either a lot of \nchildren who are going to be held back or put into lower reading groups \nor math groups or whatever or you are going to have a lot of schools \nthat are going to be identified as failing schools on the basis of \nsingle standardized tests.\n  We all draw from our personal experience. I can certainly tell you \nthat based upon my own personal experience. I am glad that many more \nschools are looking at more than SATs. I wasn't supposed to graduate \nfrom the University of North Carolina based on SAT scores. I worked \nhard and did great. I wasn't supposed to be a graduate of graduate \nschool on the basis of SAT records. I was lucky enough to get a \ndoctorate degree at age 24.\n  These tests are not always accurate. Why in the world would you want \nto defy what every single person in the testing field says--that you \nshould never rely on a single standardized test. You must have multiple \nmeasures.\n  I know there are some students and perhaps some teachers in the \ngallery today.\n  The second thing that is going to happen is you are going to drive \nout the best teachers. You are going to make it impossible for the very \ncommunities, the very schools, and the very kids who need the best \nteachers to get the best teachers because you are going to channel \neverybody down the road of having to teach the standardized test, to \nteach the test. What could be more educationally dead?\n  By the way--I will finish on this--I will have a lot to say about \nthis bill next week. I will spend a lot of time saying it.\n  First of all, we ought to get the testing right.\n  Second, without the resources, it is a mockery. It is an absolute \nmockery. We already know what works and what doesn't work. All we have \nto do is look at the schools that our children and our grandchildren \nattend. That is all we have to do.\n  The schools that Senators' children and grandchildren attend are good \nschools. They are beautiful. They are inviting. The landscape is \nlovely. The teachers are highly paid. The classes are small. They don't \ndo drill education. It is exciting and rewarding. And our children and \ngrandchildren, before kindergarten, have been read to widely, know the \nalphabet, and know computers. They are sophisticated and are ready to \nlearn.\n\n  We already know we don't need tests to tell us what works. All we \nneed to do is live up to our own rhetoric and be accountable. We will \nnot be accountable if we jam down the throats of every school district \nin every State in the United States of America a test without at least \nsome standards to make sure they are high-quality tests that do not \nlead to what will only be a disaster for education, for these children, \nand for their teachers. We will not be doing our job if we do not \nprovide the resources to go with the accountability.\n  Today in this amendment I am focusing on the quality of testing. I \nwould love to find out why--I had the understanding there was strong \nsupport for it. Now I understand there isn't. I would like to know in \nwhat ways the administration disagrees with this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nWellstone amendment be laid aside, and the Senate then turn to the \nLincoln amendment No. 451, with 15 minutes under the control of Senator \nLincoln and 5 minutes under the control of Senator Jeffords, with no \nsecond-degree amendments in order, and, further, following that debate, \nthe remaining time until 1:45 be divided equally on the Wellstone \namendment.\n  I further ask consent that the vote occur in relation to the Lincoln \namendment following the Wellstone amendment at 1:45 p.m. today, with 2 \nminutes prior to the vote for explanation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, the Senator from Minnesota \nis in the Chamber. That would give the Senator from Minnesota \napproximately 50 minutes in additional time to debate the amendment.\n  I ask the Senator, would that be sufficient?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I actually, first of all, am pleased to \nspeak after the Senator from Arkansas. Second of all, as far as time \nthat I need, I said what I needed to say. I am just interested in what \nin the world is the opposition to a high-quality testing amendment? I \nwould like to hear what it is people have to say in opposition. So I \nonly need time to respond.\n  If the Senator from Vermont, and others, support the amendment--which \nI hope they will--I do not need to respond. If other Senators don't \nwant to come to the Chamber and debate, then there is no one to respond \nto, so I will\n\n[[Page S4798]]\n\nnot need a lot of additional time. I already said what I needed to say \non this amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Further reserving the right to object, Mr. President, it is \nthe understanding of the two managers of the bill--one of whom is not \nhere--on these two amendments there would be no second-degree \namendments?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Vermont, the Senator from Arkansas \nis on her way to the Chamber. She will be here momentarily. In the \nmeantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 451 To Amendment No. 358\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, and I \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mrs. Lincoln] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 451 to amendment No. 358.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding, and authorize \n appropriations for, part A and part D of title III of the Elementary \n                  and Secondary Education Act of 1965)\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 902. SENSE OF THE SENATE; AUTHORIZATION OF \n                   APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       (a) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress should appropriate $750,000,000 for fiscal year \n     2002 to carry out part A and part D of title III of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 and thereby--\n       (1) provide that schools, local educational agencies, and \n     States have the resources they need to assist all limited \n     English proficient students in attaining proficiency in the \n     English language, and meeting the same challenging State \n     content and student performance standards that all students \n     are expected to meet in core academic subjects;\n       (2) provide for the development and implementation of \n     bilingual education programs and language instruction \n     educational programs that are tied to scientifically based \n     research, and that effectively serve limited English \n     proficient students; and\n       (3) provide for the development of programs that strengthen \n     and improve the professional training of educational \n     personnel who work with limited English proficient students.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out part A and part D of title \n     III of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965--\n       (1) $1,100,000,000 for fiscal year 2003;\n       (2) $1,400,000,000 for fiscal year 2004;\n       (3) $1,700,000,000 for fiscal year 2005;\n       (4) $2,100,000,000 for fiscal year 2006;\n       (5) $2,400,000,000 for fiscal year 2007; and\n       (6) $2,800,000,000 for fiscal year 2008.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, before I begin, I ask unanimous consent \nto add as cosponsors to the amendment Senator Bingaman and Senator \nKennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Before I describe the specifics of my amendment, I want to take just \na few moments to commend Senators Jeffords and Kennedy for their \ntireless efforts in crafting the bipartisan proposal that is before the \nSenate today. As someone who works hard to bridge the partisan divide \nin Washington, I think each Member of this body owes the managers of \nthis particular bill a debt of gratitude for bringing Senators with \nvery different points of view together to find common ground on the \nmost important bill we will likely consider this year.\n  They have done an excellent job. They have worked tirelessly \ntogether. I certainly commend both of them for their good manners and \nfor the diligence with which they have gone about this very important \nissue. They have demonstrated real leadership in this debate by placing \nthe education of our children above partisan advantage. I am proud to \njoin this bipartisan effort to reform our system of public education by \nhelping States and local school districts raise academic achievement \nand deliver on the promise of equal opportunity for all students.\n\n  I think the way this bill has been brought up also accentuates the \nopportunity we have to move in a timely way. As the mother of small \nchildren who will start kindergarten this fall, I certainly understand \nthat the more time we waste in addressing this critical issue, the more \nat risk we put more and more young people across this Nation of not \nbeing able to achieve their goals.\n  So I am pleased to note that the bill before us reflects many of the \npriorities that are important to me and the 500,000 elementary and \nsecondary students in my State of Arkansas. As many of my colleagues \nknow, I have worked with Senator Lieberman and other new Democrats over \nthe last 18 months on a bold ESEA reform proposal known as the three \nR's bill. Our bill took a new approach to Federal education policy by \ncombining the concepts of increased funding, targeting, flexibility and \naccountability to help our school districts meet higher standards.\n  If there is one thing we have come to know about education, it is \nthat you do not get something for nothing. We have to make a priority \nin this Nation of investing in education. This bill and this session \ngives us that opportunity to meet the mark and to actually do what it \nis we say we want to do.\n  One fundamental component of our plan, which is also a part of the \nBEST bill, is a commitment to give States the resources they need to \nhelp all limited English proficient students attain proficiency in the \nEnglish language and achieve high levels of learning in all subjects.\n  The amendment I offer today recognizes that we aren't doing enough at \nthe Federal level to provide the vast majority of LEP students in this \nNation with the educational services they need to be successful under \nthis new framework. This year, we will spend $460 million to serve LEP \nand immigrant students but only 17 percent of eligible children will \nbenefit from these programs.\n  My amendment calls on Congress to appropriate $750 million for \nlanguage instruction programs and services in fiscal year 2002. Also, \nmy amendment would authorize additional funding over the next 6 years \nso all LEP and immigrant students could receive services under title \nIII within 7 years. Under this approach, funding will be distributed to \nStates and local districts through a reliable formula based on the \nnumber of students who need help with their English proficiency. It is \nso essential, if we are going to ask these students to meet the \nperformance standards in our schools, that we indicate we have left the \nstatus quo of education in this country and have moved beyond to the \n21st century. We must give them the tools in order to do so.\n  If you have visited many schools in your States lately, you have \nprobably heard about the challenges schools and educators face in \nserving the growing number of students in need of LEP programs. From \n1989 to the year 2000, the enrollment of limited-English-proficient \nstudents in our Nation's schools grew by 104 percent, from 2 million to \nan estimated 4.1 million today. During this same time period, total \nschool enrollment grew only by 14 percent.\n  My State of Arkansas is a prime example of the trend that is \noccurring across this great Nation, especially in Southern States. \nAccording to the most recent census estimates, the Hispanic population \nin our State of Arkansas grew 337 percent since 1990, which is believed \nto be the largest percentage of growth in the Nation. Not surprisingly, \nthe number of LEP students in Arkansas has increased dramatically in \nrecent years as well. Since 1994, the number of LEP students enrolled \nin Arkansas public schools has increased by 80 percent, from 2,172 \nstudents to 10,599 students today.\n  Other States have experienced a similar increase in the number of \nstudents in need of services under title III. Between fiscal year 1999 \nand the year 2000, the percentage of immigrant students grew \ndramatically in the following States: Connecticut by 72 percent; \nGeorgia by 39 percent; Louisiana\n\n[[Page S4799]]\n\nby 34 percent; Michigan by 35 percent; Missouri, our neighboring State \nto the north, grew by 50 percent; Oregon by 28; Tennessee by 33 \npercent; and Utah by 38 percent.\n  The need to do more to serve these students and the educators who are \nresponsible for teaching them is clear. Providing more resources alone \nwon't bring about reform or help close the achievement gap which \npersists between LEP and non-LEP students. Under the BEST bill, States \nwill have to establish and meet annual performance goals for LEP \nstudents or face sanctions. In addition, all LEP students must attain \nthe State's proficient level of performance within 10 years. This is a \nnew approach that represents an important change from the past where \ntoo often low expectations for LEP students and immigrant students has \nresulted in low performance in the classroom. Our Nation and its \neconomy cannot tolerate that approach to educating our children any \nlonger.\n  In closing, I hope my colleagues will support my amendment which \nexpresses a strong commitment to enhance educational opportunities for \nLEP students by increasing and distributing Federal resources for LEP \nprograms in a reliable way and requiring LEP and immigrant students to \nmeet higher standards. If we are going to ask these students to master \nEnglish and meet the same challenging State content and student \nperformance standards that all students are expected to meet, which we \nmust do under this bill, then we need to provide States and local \nschool districts with the resources they need to meet this new \nchallenge.\n  I thank all of my colleagues for their support and encourage their \nvote in favor of the amendment. Attention to this issue is growing in \nso many of our States.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold, please.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 403, As modified\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I really will not need to take much \nmore time. In a few moments, I am going to ask unanimous consent to \nmodify my amendment. There isn't anything I have said that I would \nchange. I just think part of the disagreement, at least with the \nSenator from Vermont, was more semantics. I am intending the quality of \ntesting language here to apply to this act, this piece of legislation, \nthis reauthorization of the ESEA.\n  I haven't resolved this one way or the other yet. In my own mind, I \nhave a question as to whether or not the Federal Government ought to be \ntelling the school districts--I really mean this--in States across the \ncountry that you will do this testing, and you will do it every year in \ngrades 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 with every kid. That is a philosophical \nquestion.\n  The second concern I have is that in terms of our involvement and the \nways in which schools are going to be measured and accountability is \ngoing to be defined, I want to make sure we have the necessary language \nthat deals with quality, and again I, in particular, would emphasize \nthe importance of comprehensiveness, multiple measures, and coherence, \ntests measuring the curriculum and what is being taught, and that it is \ncontinuous so that we see how children are doing over time.\n  I don't know how other Senators will vote, but I am certainly pleased \nto have had the discussion with my colleague from Vermont.\n  I send my amendment to the desk and ask that the amendment be \nmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 403), as modified, reads as follows:\n\n       On page 46, strike line 19 and replace with the following:\n\n     ``assessments developed and used by national experts on \n     educational testing.\n       ``(D) be used only if the State provides to the Secretary \n     evidence from the test publisher or other relevant sources \n     that the assessment used is of adequate technical quality for \n     each purpose required under this Act, and such evidence is \n     made public by the Secretary upon request;''.\n       On page 46, line 20, strike ``(D)'' and insert ``(E)''.\n       On page 51, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n       ``(K) enable itemized score analyses to be reported to \n     schools and local educational agencies in a way that parents, \n     teachers, schools, and local educational agencies can \n     interpret and address the specific academic needs of \n     individual students as indicated by the students' performance \n     on assessment items.''.\n       On page 125, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 118A. GRANTS FOR ENHANCED ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENTS.\n\n       Part A of title I (20 U.S.C. 6311 et seq.) is amended by \n     inserting after section 1117 (20 U.S.C. 6318) the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 1117A. GRANTS FOR ENHANCED ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENTS.\n\n       ``(a) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to--\n       ``(1) enable States (or consortia or States) and local \n     educational agencies (or consortia of local educational \n     agencies) to collaborate with institutions of higher \n     education, other research institutions, and other \n     organizations to improve the quality and fairness of State \n     assessment systems beyond the basic requirements for \n     assessment systems described in section 1111(b)(3);\n       ``(2) characterize student achievement in terms of multiple \n     aspects of proficiency;\n       ``(3) chart student progress over time;\n       ``(4) closely track curriculum and instruction; and\n       ``(5) monitor and improve judgments based on informed \n     evaluations of student performance.\n       ``(b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are \n     authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section \n     $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 and such sums as may be \n     necessary for each of the 6 succeeding fiscal years.\n       ``(c) Grants Authorized.--The Secretary is authorized to \n     award grants to States and local educational agencies to \n     enable the States and local educational agencies to carry out \n     the purpose described in subsection (a).\n       ``(d) Application.--In order to receive a grant under this \n     section for any fiscal year, a State or local educational \n     agency shall submit an application to the Secretary at such \n     time and containing such information as the Secretary may \n     require.\n       ``(e) Authorized Use of Funds.--A State or local \n     educational agency having an application approved under \n     subsection (d) shall use the grant funds received under this \n     section to collaborate with institutions of higher education \n     or other research institutions, experts on curriculum, \n     teachers, administrators, parents, and assessment developers \n     for the purpose of developing enhanced assessments that are \n     aligned with standards and curriculum, are valid and reliable \n     for the purposes for which the assessments are to be used, \n     are grade-appropriate, include multiple measures of student \n     achievement from multiple sources, and otherwise meet the \n     requirements of section 1111(b)(3).

Mr. President, I want to hear from my colleague from \nVermont. Sometimes when I feel particularly indignant--and I do right \nnow about where we are heading with this bill, and I have a Senator on \nthe floor whom I respect and like to work with, I don't want the \nSenator from Vermont to think this is aimed at him.\n  My third concern, which I will talk about next week, is that we are \njust going to kind of keep these children thin when it comes to \nprekindergarten and what is being done for them, and keep them thin \nwhen it comes to the additional title I help, which could be pre-K, or \nextra reading help, or after school, and we are going to keep them thin \nwhen it comes to whether or not their schools have the resources and \nthey are able to get the best teachers; and then we are going to put \nthem on the scale, test them, and fail them again.\n  This doesn't work. The ``accountability'' without resources doesn't \nwork. But at least this amendment deals in part with the accountability \npiece, which is to make sure we don't confuse accountability and \ntesting and a single standardized test as one and the same thing. It is \nnot.\n  So in the spirit of improving this bill, I hope there will be support \nfor this amendment. I thank my colleague\n\n[[Page S4800]]\n\nfrom Vermont for his very useful suggestions. As I say, next week I am \ngoing to have some amendments that are going to say, basically, put up \nor shut up. We voted for the title I authorization--not money. So at \nleast let's not do this testing until we in fact fund it. I am going to \nhave amendments that say that, and I am going to talk about the funding \nof prekindergarten. If you are going to start testing 8-years-olds, I \nguarantee you what has much more to do with what 8-year-olds do in \nschool is what happens to them before kindergarten. That is absolutely \ntrue. That is what is so wrong about the direction in which we are \nheading. I will speak about that at great length next week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to comment briefly on Senator \nWellstone's willingness to modify his amendment. We all agree we want \nhigh-quality tests, and it is entirely proper the tests required under \nthis act be demonstrably valid and reliable. I appreciate the Senator \noffering his amendment, and I believe it is vastly improved. Hopefully, \nit will be acceptable.\n  The Senate now has returned to consideration of the Better Education \nfor Students and Teachers, called the BEST, Act. We have now spent a \nlittle over a week on this bill, and we have made good progress. We \nhave disposed of about a dozen amendments, and we have eight that are \npending, most of which I hope we can complete action on quickly.\n  As my colleagues know, consent was reached that first-degree \namendments were to be filed by 5 p.m. yesterday, and I want to bring my \ncolleagues up to date as to those results.\n  I compliment my colleagues for their interest and industry in \npreparing the amendments. Somewhere around 280 amendments were filed to \nthe bill. Of course, this number does not include possible second-\ndegree amendments that could be allowed under the rules.\n  At our current base of 20 amendments a week, we would complete this \nlegislation, say, in another 14 weeks. Obviously, that is about the \ntime we intend to adjourn for the year, if we assume we did not do \nanything else. Assuming the Senate takes up no other business and all \namendments are offered and everybody is happy, that would be fine. \nObviously, that is not the case. I urge all my colleagues to make sure \nwhen we get back into the amendment process after today that they \ncooperate so we can narrow these amendments and hopefully consolidate \nmany of them, or whatever, so we can finalize this bill within the next \nweek or 2.\n  I hope my colleagues will reflect on what is really important to them \nand this legislation and communicate to Senator Kennedy's staff or my \nstaff which amendments they want considered.\n  At a minimum, I urge my colleagues to restrict themselves to \neducation amendments. I advise my colleagues that I plan to oppose all \namendments that are not relevant to the bill regardless of the merits \nof the particular proposal.\n  We will obviously have our hands full completing action on this \nlegislation without undertaking debate on largely unrelated issues.\n  Senators rightly have taken a great interest in this legislation and \nhave proposed hundreds of amendments to the bill. We will do our very \nbest to work with Senators to clear as many amendments as possible and, \nin turn, will ask our colleagues to identify over the next few days \nwhich amendments are their highest priority.\n  As we move on today, hopefully Members will let us know which \namendments they want to pursue so we can narrow the number as soon as \npossible without having to bother Members with calling up amendments.\n  I urge my colleagues to please let us know which amendments they \nreally want to have offered, and we will try our best to expedite them.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first I want to say I am very hopeful \nthat the Senate will overwhelmingly support the amendment of the \nSenator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone. He spoke very clearly and \neffectively about his presentation today. I made comments yesterday \nabout the importance of developing a test which is going to be \ncomprehensive and not just reflective of perhaps the simple rote \nanswers to rote kinds of questions, but real examinations of the \nthinking process of children and where they need help and assistance.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to provide valid and reliable \ntests along with meaningful reforms that enable children to move ahead \nacademically.\n  That is what we want to try to do with the whole range of tests. We \nhave enough experience now of knowing which ones really can be used for \ninstruments for learning as compared to those which are solely \npunitive. In too many instances, teachers teach to the test. In this \nway, we both fail the student, fail the test, fail the school, and fail \nthe parents.\n  Senator Wellstone's amendment is enormously important. As I tried to \npoint out yesterday, I think the kind of thoughtful examination by \nthose who have been in the field for years in terms of the evaluation, \nas well as testing, have come to the conclusion that the more \ncomprehensive examination of children done in a timely way and with the \nsupplementary services available can be a very powerful instrument in \nhelping needy children move ahead academically. I am hopeful that will \nbe accepted by the Senate.\n  I want to say a strong word in support of Senator Lincoln's amendment \nin terms of the bilingual education.\n  One of the themes of this legislation is to try to find out what the \nchallenges are in our local communities but also what works in our \nlocal communities in terms of educational achievement and build on \nthat; also, to take that experience, and make sure that the children \nwho ought to be covered in title I will be covered. This amendment is a \nno-brainer.\n\n  If we look at the legislation that we currently have without the \nacceptance of the Lincoln amendment, we will be denying millions of \nlimited English proficient children the key element in terms of \nincreasing their academic ability with high quality, effective programs \nin Title III. We are not prescriptive. We give the local communities \nthe choices in terms of the bilingual and language instructional \nprograms that will be available to the schools and to the local \ncommunities in terms of helping children who are limited English \nproficient. Local communities can make judgments and decisions as to \nwhich program is suitable for their particular community.\n  There is a wide range of different evaluations of these programs to \ndemonstrate the ones that have been the most successful. All of that \nwill be available to the local community. What is important is that \nthose services be available to those children. Without those services \nbeing available to those children, then we are basically failing those \nchildren. It is a very clear group of children that we are failing.\n  The number of children who fall into the limited English proficiency \nhas virtually doubled over the period of the last 10 years, and is \nincreasing daily. These students are making up a growing number of \ndistrict's total enrollment. In 9 states the limited English proficient \npopulation has grown by 25 percent or more since 1995.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Arkansas recognizes this growth, \nand responds to it. It says: Look, we know what works for the local \ncommunities. We know that schools throughout the nation have been \nstruggling to serve this population.\n  For a certain period of time, we thought the only language was going \nto be Spanish, and that it was just\n\n[[Page S4801]]\n\ngoing to be in Florida, Texas, and California. But we know of the \nexpansion of and the need for these programs in many other areas of our \ncountry, including Arkansas, as the Senator has pointed out.\n\n  On this chart, the red line shows that the limited-English-\nproficiency enrollment has increased by 100 percent in the last 10 \nyears, while total enrollment has basically been rather flat over that \nperiod of time.\n  What we also know is, if we do not provide these programs, \neffectively, these children, almost out of definition, are going to \nfail in terms of new accountability and testing standards. That, we \nknow. That is a given.\n  The question is--here, this afternoon, in a few minutes--whether we \nare going to go on record and say, look, this is a particular group of \nchildren who are part of our public school systems--as a result of a \nvariety of factors; the changes in immigration patterns, the changes in \nour immigration laws--who need assistance.\n  There are many children who are falling into this category. We know, \nas sure as we are standing in this Chamber today, that if we do not \nadopt the Lincoln amendment, we are denying millions of children the \nkinds of benefits that we know are successful because they have \ndemonstrated success.\n  I have a number of examples where we have seen local communities that \nwere able to participate in programs, such as what would be included in \nthe amendment of the Senator from Arkansas. They have seen dramatic \nchanges in their whole academic attitude. The result is that these \nchildren have really blossomed with those kinds of programs. Without \nthem, we are going to be reaching only a very small number of these \nchildren who would otherwise be eligible--only 17 percent under the \nBush budget. Over the 4 million limited English proficient students \nnationwide, we are only serving 900,000 at the present time. We aim to \nserve more. But we need the resources.\n  We are hopeful, with this legislation, to try to build on tried and \ntested efforts that have been initiated in different parts of the \ncountry and that have been demonstrated to be constructive and \nproductive in enhancing academic achievement--to offer these out to \nlocal communities, to let local communities make these decisions. We \nhave given them additional kinds of flexibility. Then we would have \naccountability in terms of the teachers, in terms of the schools, in \nterms of the parents, and also new accountability for disadvantaged \nchildren who are facing enormous kinds of challenges every single day. \nMany students struggle with learning English, and meeting challenging \nacademic standards.\n  If we are really interested in getting a fair start for these \nchildren, if we are really interested in no children being left behind, \nwe have, we believe, a program that can do that. But if we do not \nprovide the kinds of targeting assistance with these programs for \nchildren who have the limited English proficiency, then effectively we \nare writing them off, make no mistake about it.\n  That is what is at stake. That is what is so important.\n  If we are really interested, we ought to recognize that this is a \ndefined group of children who we have in our schools, and we ought to \nmake sure the children are going to benefit from these programs.\n  The red line on the chart--which brings us up to the year 2000--shows \nthat the limited English proficient population now numbers more than 4 \nmillion students. That number is going to continued to grow. So the \nquestion is, Are we going to recognize what is happening in our schools \ntoday--what has happened over the last 10 years and what is going to \nhappen in the next 5 years? If we are really interested in trying to \nmake sure these children are not going to be left behind, this is the \namendment that can make a major difference.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Arkansas. I think this is one of the \nmost important amendments we will consider. It is a lifeline in many \nrespects. It is the crutch upon which the other provisions in Title III \nof this legislation really depend. If we do not provide resources for \nthis program, then the other aspects of this legislation are going to, \nfail millions of children. That is wrong.\n  We ought to take what we know. The good Senator from Arkansas has \ndone that and has offered us an opportunity to make this legislation \neven stronger. We saw a modest increase in our authorization coming out \nof the committee. But that increase is clearly not enough to do the \njob. The Lincoln amendment will do the job. I am very hopeful that it \nwill be accepted in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, whatever time I have remaining, I am glad to yield to \nthe Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has 9\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts \nfor yielding.\n  In the last few weeks this Senate has begun to focus on what is, by \nany measure, the most pressing issue before the country; and that is \nsimply the quality of education for America's schoolchildren.\n  It is a quality-of-life issue. It is an economic issue. It is even a \nnational security issue. A great nation cannot long endure in its \nposition if the quality of education for its children is not paramount. \nYou cannot lead economically, socially, culturally, or even militarily \nfor long if you do not lead in the quality of education for your \nchildren.\n  This reality, I believe, has focused the Senate's attention on \nfunding standards and quality of education. I believe the debate has \nbeen promising. The Senate adopted the Dodd amendment to authorize a \n$132 billion increase over 10 years in title I aid to poor schools. \nCurrently, the Federal Government provides school districts with only \none-third of the assistance for which they are eligible. Under the Dodd \nmeasure, by 2011, they will receive 100 percent of the assistance they \nboth need and require.\n  The Senate adopted the Harkin amendment to meet our Federal \ncommitment to special education by guaranteeing $181 billion over 10 \nyears for IDEA. This program was enacted by Congress in 1975. The \nFederal Government promised to pay 40 percent of the per-pupil cost. \nThe reality is, for the year 2000, we have paid simply 13 percent.\n  The Harkin amendment will make an enormous difference to local school \ndistrict budgets where the share of the special education funding has \nincreased from 3 percent to 20 percent in total cost since 1975.\n  But also, I believe that the bill itself--before amendment --does \nhave the underpinnings of genuine reform. The Bush administration's \nplan does include an emphasis on accountability, standards, and \ntesting. If these provisions of accountability are married with meeting \na genuine Federal commitment on special education, training, hiring \nteachers, and special education, then the Senate can be proud of this \nlegislation. Indeed, to date, we have done exactly that.\n  Now we turn to the question of construction, the quality of these \nschools themselves. Most Americans in their communities would not \nbelieve what many of us have seen in our States, that in this \nextraordinary time of American prosperity, economic power, and budget \nsurplus, American students are attending class in gymnasiums, trailers, \nand hallways. I have seen it in New Jersey, in prosperous communities. \nIt is not a proud statement about our country.\n  Mr. President, 2,400 schools will have to be built in the next 2 \nyears just to accommodate rising enrollments.\n  Education reform will be incomplete without dedicating this funding. \nNo standard of accountability or testing will mean anything--indeed, \neven hiring teachers will mean little--if we do not do something about \nthe quality of the schools themselves.\n  As strongly as I believe in the building of schools, even that must \nbe complemented by doing something about the human capital, our \nteachers, for it to be a balanced piece of legislation.\n  This week we passed the Kennedy amendment which authorized $3 billion \nfor professional development. By combining professional development \nwith class size reduction, this bill, however, will be jeopardized \nwithout keeping the commitment of the Clinton administration to hire \n100,000 new teachers. I believe there was nothing more significant \naccomplished in the Clinton administration than the hiring of these new \nteachers to reduce class size.\n\n[[Page S4802]]\n\n  In the Nation, we have hired 30,000 towards that national goal. In my \nState of New Jersey, 1,500 new teachers are at work today who would not \nbe in place, reducing class size, but for this initiative.\n  A balanced program in the Senate will have accountability; it will \nconstruct new classrooms. But it must also reduce class size. Every \nstudy that has ever been chartered has made it clear that the single \ngreatest variable in the quality of education is having more teachers \nteaching fewer students. Overcrowded classrooms are a direct threat to \nthe ability of our children to learn. We must take disadvantaged \nstudents and have them engaged in the classroom to increase \nperformance.\n  An important element is going to be not only recruiting but also \nretaining teachers who otherwise are leaving the classroom, who can \nonly be retained by improvements in discipline, but also easing the \nburden by smaller class size and, of course, by compensation.\n  In the next decade in New Jersey, more than one-third of our 93,000 \nteachers are going to retire. It is going to happen. It is a clock that \nis ticking. Nationwide in the next 11 years, 2.4 million teachers will \nretire.\n  As I believe this debate has demonstrated, we have moved beyond a \npartisan debate. The most significant element in this education \ndiscussion is that Democratic and Republican ideas are now being melded \ntogether. It is a great moment for the Senate. If we can preserve the \nClinton administration's efforts at hiring new teachers to reduce class \nsize, combine the efforts of Democrats in the Senate for school \nconstruction to improve the quality of the infrastructure, and take the \nBush administration's proposals for accountability and testing and \ndiscipline, this Senate can be proud of what we have done. The Harkin \nand Dodd amendments on special education, on title I, on full funding \nof IDEA are important beginnings. But it is in the balance whether good \nlegislation can now be made great, reducing class size, constructing \nthe schools that America's children need and deserve.\n  I believe every Member of the Senate can be proud of this debate to \ndate. Now let's finish and make a good bill great.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifty seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, both the Wellstone and Lincoln amendments \nare very important.\n  One is to make sure we have quality testing that reflects an accurate \nevaluation of the progress children are making and where the needs are \nso teachers can work on them and so the children can excel. The other \nis to make sure the programs are made available to the children who \nneed the kind of assistance that limited-English programs provide and \nthat has been demonstrated to be effective. We are talking about the \nneediest children in the country. We are talking about the poorest of \nthe poor, living in enormously trying circumstances, who are trying to \nunderstand and make academic progress. Let's make sure that all the \nsupport will be there for them.\n  I believe the yeas and nays have been asked for, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have.\n  The Senator from Tennessee has 11 seconds.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my understanding is we will have a vote \nat any moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. I will take a moment or two to \nsummarize this amendment.\n  Again, the amendment focuses on quality testing. The amendment says \nthat everything we are doing within this Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act which has to do with these tests that are going to take \nplace every year must meet the professional standards. In particular, \nwhat I am focused on is that there be multiple measures, not a single \nmeasurement; that, again, there be coherence; that the actual \ncurriculum that is being taught is what is being measured; and that we \nalso focus on continuity and are able to look at a child's progress \nover time.\n  I am not at all excited about any of the direction here, but any way \nI can make this bill a better bill, I want to. I certainly hope my \ncolleagues will vote for this amendment.\n  Again, this budget resolution that was passed tells the story loudly \nand clearly. We are not going to have the resources going to the \nschools and the children. Next week I will have amendments that say we \ngo with the testing and accountability when, in fact, we have provided \nthe funding for title I; when, in fact, we have provided funding for \nearly childhood development; when we have done the job by way of \ngetting the tools to the schools and the children and the teachers so \nthey can succeed. That is going to be a long story next week.\n  For now, I am hoping there is good, strong support for this quality \nof testing amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time remaining on either side.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2 p.m. on \nMonday, the Senate resume consideration of S. 1 and the Reid amendment \nNo. 460 and there be up to 1 hour for debate to be equally divided in \nthe usual form with no second-degree amendments in order.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following that debate, the \namendment be laid aside and at 4 p.m. the Senate resume consideration \nof amendment No. 376 offered by Senator Cleland and there be up to 1 \nhour for debate on that amendment with no second-degree amendments in \norder.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that a vote occur in relation to that \namendment following the Reid amendment with 2 minutes prior to the vote \nfor explanation.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that a vote occur in relation to the \nReid amendment at 5:30 p.m. on Monday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it is my \nunderstanding that there would be no second-degree amendments to the \namendments of Senators Reid and Cleland.\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now is on agreeing to the \nWellstone amendment No. 403, as modified.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo) and \nthe Senator from Nevada (Mr. Ensign) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, the amendment on which we are about to \nvote reconfirms our commitment to give States the resources they need \nto help all students with limited English proficiency to attain \nproficiency in the English language and achieve high levels of learning \nin all subjects.\n  This year we spent $460 million to serve LEP and immigrant students, \nbut only 17 percent of eligible children will benefit from these \nprograms. This amendment calls on Congress to appropriate $750 million \nfor language instruction programs and services in 2002. It would also \nauthorize additional funding over the next 6 years.\n  The critical part of this is that these children are also going to be \njudged by standards and tests. We want to be able to give these school \ndistricts the capabilities to give these children the tools they need \nin order to be successful within these standards and these tests. It is \nabsolutely essential if what we want to do in this Nation is to leave \nthe status quo of education and move on to something that is \nprogressive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], for herself, Mr. \n     Wellstone, Mr. DeWine, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Crapo, \n     Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Biden, proposes an amendment numbered \n     534.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record of May 9, 2001, \nunder ``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, amendment No. 534 is the Careers to \nClassrooms Act of 2001. I have several cosponsors who have worked very \nhard with me to put this amendment together because many of us had \nideas along the same line. I thank very much my cosponsors: Mr. \nWellstone, Mr. DeWine, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \nSchumer, and Mr. Biden.\n  We have all worked on this issue because probably every one of us has \nhad some experience that caused us to realize we must do more to \nrecruit teachers into our classrooms. I had the experience of having a \nvery good friend in Greenville, TX, who was a Latin major in college. \nShe taught Latin in a private school, but when she moved to Greenville, \nshe did not have the teacher certification for public school, so she \nwas not able to teach Latin. Well, they didn't offer Latin in \nGreenville High School, even though they very much wanted to do so. But \nshe was not qualified to teach because she didn't have the teacher \ncertification, even though she had taught Latin in private school and \nthat was her major in college.\n  So I started thinking, what are we doing, when we have a shortage of \nteachers, especially in rural classrooms, in urban classrooms, in high-\ngrowth areas, where we have subjects that are not being taught--\nsubjects such as math, science, languages--yet we have artificial \nbarriers to bringing people who have expertise into the classroom?\n  So I modeled the Careers to Classrooms Program--along with my \ncosponsors--along the lines of the Troops to Teachers Program, which \nSenator DeWine will speak about later, which has been so successful in \ntaking retired military personnel who would like to have another \ncareer, who are 40, 45, 50 years old, and bringing them into the \nclassroom with all of their myriad of great experience and giving the \nchildren in our country the chance to experience this kind of \nexpertise.\n  This is Careers to Classroom because now we have a number of people \nwho have done very well early in their careers, and they would like to \nchange careers, or they would like to retire from the computer \nindustry. We want to lure those qualified people into the classroom. We \nwant to target the classes that don't have teachers, where we have \nteacher shortages. So this amendment simply puts forward another \nopportunity for our school districts to give alternative certification, \nexpedited certification, to encourage teachers to go into the \nclassrooms in areas where we have teacher shortages.\n  In this legislation, individuals with demonstrable skills in high-\nneed areas would be given the chance to help a school that has a need \nfor teachers in their field. It would provide limited stipend \nassistance for individuals involved in State alternative certification \nprograms and will agree to\n\n[[Page S4804]]\n\nteach in rural schools, schools with the most pressing teacher \nshortages, and schools with the highest percentage of students from \nlow-income families. So we give incentives through stipends to help \nthem get that teacher certification.\n  Second, to help offset the additional costs these high-needs schools \nincur when they accept individuals in the Careers to Classrooms \nProgram, the provision allows States to award grants to such schools to \nmeet these costs.\n  In other words, we are rewarding the school districts for creativity, \nfor going the extra mile to bring qualified teachers into the \nclassroom, and we are rewarding the person who is willing to go into \nthe classroom by giving assistance for that alternative certification.\n  I ask that we pass this bill. It is one more way our public schools \ncan give every child an opportunity to reach his or her full potential. \nThat is the goal of public education. It is why public education is so \nimportant. We want every child to reach his or her dreams with a public \neducation.\n  We like private schools. We like parochial schools. We think home \nschools are fine for many students. But we also want our public schools \nto be the foundation of our country, and that is exactly what adding \nmore options and more incentives for creativity will do.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will take 3 or 4 minutes. I notice \nSenator Clinton is on the floor, and Senator DeWine is on the floor as \nwell. I say to Senator DeWine, I will let him cover the Troops to \nTeachers part of this legislation. It is a real addition, and I like \nthis effort. This whole notion of Careers to Classrooms makes all the \nsense in the world.\n  I want to highlight two facts. No. 1, we are focusing again on \nunderserved children and underserved communities, be they inner city, \nrural, or, for that matter, in a suburb.\n  No. 2, we want to make it possible for some people to make big career \nchanges, to go into teaching, working with the States, and States \nhaving collaborative relationships with higher institutions to provide \nalternative means for certification and have more lateral entry into \nteaching.\n  Some of the best teachers are women and men who midcareer decide to \nmake this change and go into teaching. For my own part --I hope I do \nnot have to do it too soon; some of my colleagues might disagree with \nme on that--I often think to myself that I would love to do some \nteaching in the schools I visit all the time. Even though I do have a \ndoctorate in political science and have some experience in the area of \nsocial studies, the thought of going back to school and going through \nthe usual certification is a disincentive. We are trying to provide \nmore incentives for people to come into teaching.\n  Every discussion I have been involved in at every school, once every \n2 weeks for the last 10\\1/2\\ years, if I ask a student what makes for a \ngood education, the first thing they talk about before anything else is \ngood teachers. By the way, they are not talking about teachers who \nteach the worksheets. They are talking about teachers who fire their \nimagination.\n  Finally--and Senator Clinton may speak about this--it is not just \nrecruitment but retention, having mentors, and providing support for \nteachers to stay in the profession. We run into the problem of good \npeople leaving the profession. This is terribly important.\n  This amendment is on target. Each of us wrote our own amendments, our \nown bills. The Senator from Texas is right; we put this all together in \na collaborative relationship. It is a very important amendment. There \nis widespread support for it, and I am proud to work with my colleagues \non this important legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate my colleagues from Texas, Minnesota, \nand New York for the great work they have done on this bill. This bill \ngoes to the heart of the challenge we face in the next few years in \neducation. We know a lot of things are important in education. We know \nwe have to have a good building, laboratory equipment, and good books. \nWe have to have different items, but we know the most important thing \nin education is the teacher.\n  As my high school principal, Mr. Malone, told me years ago, there are \nonly two things that really count in education: One is a student who \nwants to learn and the other is a teacher who can teach. This amendment \ngoes directly to the heart of this issue.\n  We face a challenge in this country. In the next decade, we will have \nto produce 1.6 million to 2.6 million new teachers just to replace the \nteachers today who are getting ready to retire--1.6 to 2.6 million. We \nknow from our experience that the greatest challenge with regard to \nrecruiting these teachers is in the poorer parts of the country--in the \ninner cities many times, in areas of Appalachia. This is where it is so \nvitally important for us to attract, retain, and keep the best teachers \nwe can find. We absolutely have to do that. This amendment is targeted \ndirectly at that.\n  I wish to talk for a moment about the part of the bill that we refer \nto as Troops to Teachers. This is not a new program. It is a program, \nfrankly, we had to fight last year to keep afloat. It is a program that \nhas been proven to work.\n  The concept is very simple. Every year in this country we have tens \nof thousands of men and women who retire from the military, and they \nretire many times at, at least from my point of view now, a relatively \nyoung age, the age of 57. They have a lot of time ahead of them, and \nthey have a great deal of experience. We want to encourage as many of \nthese people as we can who have already proven they can lead other \npeople to go into education, to teach, to take that leadership ability \nand lead our young people and mold them and work with them to, in turn, \nbecome leaders.\n  It has been a very successful program. This bill expands that \nprogram. Let me briefly tell the Members of the Senate what the results \nof this program have been.\n  A 1999 study found that 30 percent of Troops to Teachers, 30 percent \nof the people who go from the military into teaching under this \nprogram, are minorities. That is compared to only 10 percent of all \nteachers. Thirty percent of these former troops are now teachers and \nteaching math. Many of them are involved in teaching science. These are \ntwo subjects for which we know it is always difficult to find quality \npeople to teach and people who have that background.\n  Twenty-five percent of the Troops to Teachers teach in urban schools; \n90 percent are male, compared to the current teaching force, which is \n74 percent female. Many educators tell us we need more males to go into \nteaching, particularly in K-6, 7, 8, the primary education. Troops to \nTeachers has proven this will, in fact, work and helps to do that.\n  I congratulate my colleagues for their work on this issue. The Troops \nto Teachers provision is something I have worked on for some time. I \nhave had the chance in my State of Ohio to meet with people who have \nbeen troops who are now teachers. It is phenomenal to see their \nenthusiasm but, more importantly, to see the enthusiasm of their \nstudents. It really makes a difference in these children's lives.\n  This is an amendment that goes right at the heart of our problems and \nour concerns and that is to improve the quality of teaching in this \ncountry and to continue to do what we can to recruit the best people we \ncan and put them into education and let them teach our young people.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am so pleased to join my colleagues \nsupporting this amendment, Careers to Classrooms. I commend my good \nfriend from Texas who brought all of us together, took all of our \nvarious ideas, and came up with a amendment that I believe will make a \ntremendous difference in one of the most serious problems facing us in \neducation. This is an issue all of us who joined together as original \ncosponsors have worked on because it is one that came to us in our \nrespective States.\n  I brought along just three sample headlines from 3 different years. \nThe first, from August of 1998, from the Buffalo News, reports that \nmore than half of the teachers in New York State,\n\n[[Page S4805]]\n\n201,000, were headed for retirement in the next 10 years.\n  Then a year later, in August 1999, the New York Times ran a story on \nthe front page alerting the public that as children were heading back \nto school, cities and towns across our country were struggling to fill \nthe teacher slots, especially in our poorest neighborhoods, and \nespecially in difficult subjects such as math and science and special \ned.\n  Then, again, in August 2000, the New York Times focused on \nWestchester County where I live, highlighting the fact that faced with \nretirements and other departures from the profession, superintendents \nwere spending their time desperately searching for teachers to be there \nwhen school opened.\n  I think all of us who joined together on this amendment do not want \nto see these headlines anymore. We think it is time that, from August \n2001 on, the headlines should read that our country is coming together \nto answer the call to recruit and retain more teachers. I am so pleased \nthat this amendment hits what I see as all of the necessary major \npoints.\n  As Senator Hutchison said, it supports alternative routes to \ncertification. I have heard so many stories similar to the one she told \nabout her friend, the Latin teacher, who could not get a job in the \npublic schools. As Senator DeWine points out, it continues to support \nand fund the very successful Troops to Teachers Program. As Senator \nWellstone points out, it begins to provide the resources that our high-\nneed school districts will require in order to place them at the head \nof the queue to try to attract teachers. I am pleased it will permit \neach local school district to develop a local teacher corps, which \nwould be able to provide bonuses for midcareer professionals interested \nin becoming teachers.\n  I have often said if we give signing bonuses to athletes, we ought to \ngive signing bonuses to teachers. There is not any more important job \nin our country. All too often our teachers are relegated to the margins \nof our concerns. The teacher corps would also be able to make \nscholarships available for recent college students and create new \ncareer ladders for teacher's aides to become fully certified teachers. \nA lot of our teacher's aides want to become teachers. If they are \nperforming well, if they have the requisite academic skills, we ought \nto encourage their development.\n  It will also provide additional mentoring, support, and professional \ndevelopment that is needed to become an effective teacher.\n  All in all, I am so pleased that we have an opportunity to address \nthis important issue in this bill because if we do not address the \nquality and the quantity of our teaching force, we are not going to be \nable to deliver on all the other promises we are trying to make and \nkeep with the children, teachers, and parents of our country.\n\n  I know in New York City we are looking desperately to fill the slots \nthat are needed for our teachers. This kind of program of alternative \ncertification and additional mentoring, similar to what we call the New \nYork City Teaching Fellows Program, will help us recruit and retain our \nteachers.\n  In addition to promoting alternative routes to full certification, I \nam pleased that in the underlying bill as part of S. 1 we have the \nNational Teacher Recruitment Campaign to alert prospective teachers \nfrom across the country about these new resources and routes to \nteaching and include a National Teacher Recruitment Clearinghouse so \nsomeone, anywhere in the country, can sign on to the Web and find out \ninformation about where they are living now or where they hope to move \nso we can really attract people who are the best and the brightest into \nteaching.\n  I am excited about this opportunity. I commend all my colleagues who \nhave worked in a collegial and bipartisan manner, representing States \nfrom Texas to Ohio to Minnesota to New York, to send a clear message \nthat teacher recruitment and retention is not a partisan issue. It is \nat the root of how successful we can be in improving education. I am so \npleased we are going to have a chance to vote on this amendment and \nsend that clear message to the people of our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank all of my colleagues who have \nspoken so eloquently. I think Senator Wellstone, Senator Clinton, \nSenator DeWine, and I have each addressed a separate part of this bill. \nWe have each addressed something from our own States that we have seen \nthat caused us to come together to try to alleviate the critical \nteacher shortage that we have in public schools throughout our Nation.\n  I think this is one more way that we will be able to add more \ncreativity and more options to our arsenal of weapons that we have to \ncombat the teacher shortage that we are seeing in our country.\n  I thank all my colleagues.\n  If there is no one else wishing to speak on this amendment, I urge \nadoption of amendment No. 534.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 534) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I think we have taken a \ngreat step forward. I hope in the final bill this is a very big part of \nthe reform we are all seeking in public education.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, thanks to my colleague, especially for \nher leadership on this issue.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today as we debate one of the most \nimportant issues to come before us in the Senate--the education of our \nchildren--and to urge my colleagues to support the Careers to \nClassrooms amendment.\n  If you have listened to the debate, there is not a single Senator who \nis satisfied with the quality of education in our public schools. We \nare unanimous in our belief that U.S. schools must do better in this \nglobal, competitive, ideas-based world.\n  In my own State, New Yorkers were shocked to learn that more than \none-third of the State's students performed below the basic level of \nachievement in reading. Over the last 8 years, the number of New York \nState schools cited for poor performance has more than doubled, and \nthis is simply unacceptable.\n  When you look at the studies, you see that they show that the \ngreatest influence on how a young person performs in school is their \nparents and the values and oversight their parents are giving. There is \nsomething we can do about that, but not very much--at least in this \nbill.\n  Second is the quality of our teachers. On this bill, if we could only \naccomplish one thing--I hope it will accomplish many more than that--if \nwe could make only one change to our schools to raise the quality of \neducation for all kids, it would be to improve the quality of our \nteachers and make the teaching profession more attractive to young \npeople and midcareer professionals alike.\n  In the past, America was able to attract high-quality individuals \ninto teaching. We had three cohorts of people who went into teaching:\n  In the 1930s and 1940s, we had New Dealers--people who were raised in \nthe Depression and got that civil service job because they did not want \nto be fired, even if it paid a little less.\n  In the 1950s and 1960s, there were not many opportunities for women, \nand millions of young, bright American women were told, ``Go be a \nteacher,'' and, ``Go be a nurse.'' To our great luck as a nation and to \nmy great luck as a student who was taught by many of them, many of them \ndid go into teaching.\n  The final cohort were the young men in the late 1960s and early 1970s \nwho, because you received a draft deferment when you taught, went into \nteaching.\n  My children attend public schools in New York City. At Open School \nNight, I asked the six teachers of my daughter who is in high school \nhow they got into teaching. They are women who had gotten into teaching \nin the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, and they are men all about my age--I am \n50--who had become teachers during the Vietnam war.\n\n[[Page S4806]]\n\n  Those three groups of people are gone. New Deal, not too many people \nwho lived in the shadow of the Depression are going into professions \nnow; Women, thank God there are many more opportunities; and, again, \nthank God we don't have a Vietnam war that drove men into teaching.\n  As a result, because of that, our teachers are old.\n  This chart shows the age of teachers in America. This big bump shows \nteachers 47 to 49 in my State. I think the No. 1 age--the ``immediate \nmode'' I think it is called--of the teacher, the most frequent age of \nany, is 53.\n  In the next 10 years, we are going to have huge numbers of our \nteachers retire, and they are going to have to be replaced. The $64,000 \nquestion for education is, Who is going to replace them?\n  One thing we know. Today, to choose to teach is to choose financial \nsacrifice. Teacher salaries do not compare with other possible options \nfacing graduates. In fact, over the past 4 years salary offers for \ncollege graduates in all fields have grown at twice the rate of those \nfor new teachers. Isn't that incredible that in America, where we value \neducation, salaries for teachers grew at half the rate of others?\n\n  This chart tells the story about why we are having such difficulty \nattracting good teachers. The starting salary for computer programming \nis $44,000, for accounting is $37,000, for market research is $34,000, \nand for a paralegal is $45,000. But the starting salary for a teacher \nwith a bachelor's degree in America is $26,700.\n  So a qualified young person, idealistic though they may be, can often \nmake $10,000, $15,000, or even $20,000 more starting out by going into \nanother profession.\n  What job could be more important than teaching? It is the most \nimportant job in America in the 21st century. Teaching should be an \nexalted profession the way medicine and law were in the 20th century. \nThat is not just something that sounds nice; that is if we want to keep \nAmerica the leading country in the world.\n  Yet this most important job has become less and less and less \nattractive compared to other jobs financially. That means that quality \nhas become less important than simply filling vacant teacher slots. We \nhave seen it all. We have seen in my city they now are going not just \naround America but around the world to find young men and women to \nteach, particularly in math and science. The board of education in New \nYork City found itself lucky that it had a gold mine of Yugoslavian \nstudents who wanted to come teach, and Austrian students who wanted to \ncome teach. And they are good to have--better than nothing. But how \nmany of them are going to stay here and become career teachers and gain \nthe invaluable experience in the first 3 or 4 years that a teacher \ngains?\n  We cannot continue in this manner. We cannot have so many math and \nscience teachers not experienced in math and science. We cannot have \nthis global search for people who might teach for a year. We cannot \nhave it for a lot of reasons.\n  Today's economy depends on the quality of the minds of our young \npeople, the quality of the education we provide in our schools, and, \nconsequently, our children's success depends on the education they \nreceive.\n  As you can see from the chart, in my own State, in New York City \nalone, 11,000 teachers could retire by this year's end. And remember \nthat previous chart: One-third of our teachers are eligible to retire \nin 5 years. That means our country will have to hire or replace close \nto 2 million teachers over the next decade. And New York State will \nneed to hire 80,000 teachers over the next 5 years.\n  Studies tell us that teacher qualifications account for more than 90 \npercent of the differences in students' math and reading scores.\n  I believe in having more teachers. I support having 100,000 new \nteachers. But let me tell you this. I would rather have a really good \nteacher for 21 students than a mediocre teacher for 18. So as much as I \nsupport having 100,000 new teachers, I would much rather see us get the \nbest quality teachers, even if it means slightly bigger class size.\n  We, of course, in an ideal world, should not have to settle between \none and the other. But quality and training counts. That is what the \nstudies show. The bad news is that more than 12 percent of all newly \nhired teachers enter the teaching workforce with no training at all. \nMore than 1 out of 10 teachers have not a single bit of training. They \nhire you and throw you in a classroom. Isn't that amazing? Would we \ndo that to somebody who is working in a foundry on an assembly line? \nWould we do it in almost any other job? No. But here it is. And a third \nof all teachers lack a major or even a minor in the subject they teach. \nAnd 33 percent of new teachers nationwide lack full certification.\n\n  We all talk about education. We all think that it is the key to our \nfuture. And the people who are going into teaching are often \nfinancially underpaid, which means, frankly, we do not get the highest \nquality, and they are untrained when they enter the classroom.\n  I do not think anyone in this Chamber, from the most conservative to \nthe most liberal, would dispute this statement: Every American child \ndeserves to be taught by a highly qualified, motivated teacher.\n  So what does that mean? It means that scarce Federal dollars--and \nthey are scarce; particularly, I might add, with this huge tax cut they \nare even more scarce--it means that scarce Federal dollars should be \nused to support and help replicate successful programs to recruit and \nretain highly qualified teachers, especially in those districts with \nthe highest need.\n  I have been working on this piece of legislation since I came to the \nSenate 2 years ago. We put together something called the ``Marshall \nPlan for Teachers.'' I am proud to say that a lot of the things in this \namendment--and the ideas were not mine alone; lots of my colleagues had \nvery similar ideas--are very much like the ``Marshall Plan'' that we \nintroduced and talked about.\n  I am very proud to have worked with so many of my colleagues --of \ncourse, Senator Kennedy in the lead, and Senators Hutchison, Wellstone, \nCrapo, Clinton, DeWine, and Biden--on this amendment to provide Federal \nsupport for States and local districts to recruit and retain midcareer \nprofessionals and to attract young people into the teaching profession. \nTo me, it is the most important part of this bill.\n  There are many important parts. Federal dollars will help establish, \nexpand, or enhance programs that provide alternative routes to \ncertification, such as the National Teaching Fellows Program in my city \nof New York. Dollars will be targeted to the areas where they are \nneeded most--districts and schools with high numbers of low-income \nfamilies, high numbers of uncertified teachers, and high teacher \nturnover.\n  Similar to legislation I introduced this Congress, our amendment \nwould provide funds that could be used to recruit new teachers through \nincentives, scholarships, tax credits, or stipends, as long as these \nefforts are linked to effective retention activities such as mentoring \nprograms and high-quality, in-service professional development \nopportunities.\n  We know that 20 percent of new teachers leave the profession within \ntheir first 3 years of service. And nearly 10 percent leave within the \nfirst year. We must be committed to providing incentives to attract \nhighly qualified people and provide the resources and opportunities to \nkeep people teaching.\n  The amendment would support collaboration--partnerships, if you \nwill--between local districts, parents, colleges, and universities, and \ncommunity leaders to develop effective recruitment and retention \nstrategies.\n  In addition, we would support accelerated paraprofessional-to-teacher \nprograms and State and regionwide clearinghouses for recruitment and \nplacement. And we would expand upon the successful Troops to Teachers \nProgram.\n  Because accountability is so crucial to the success of our efforts, \nthe amendment would require an evaluation report from each grantee to \ndetermine whether we have increased the number of certified, highly \nqualified teachers teaching the subject areas in which they have \nexperience, decreased teacher shortages in high-need subject areas, and \nincreased teacher retention.\n  It is time to make a change. This amendment will get us on the way to \nwhat I know is a goal shared by all of\n\n[[Page S4807]]\n\nus: a qualified teacher in every classroom in America.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield to our friend and leader from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank my friend and colleague from New York for \noffering this amendment. I would appreciate his opinion on this. I have \nseen, in a number of different situations, where there are many \nindividuals in different professions who are skilled in math and \nscience and other areas in the new economy. And there are individuals \nwho are retiring.\n  If they had some way, some pathway to go into teaching, we would find \nthat there is a great deal of interest. What the Senator is attempting \nto do is create a pathway for individuals who may have gone into a \ncareer for a period of time and have been able to have achievement in \nterms of their professional careers but then, with this kind of an \nopportunity that is included in the Schumer amendment, they would be \nable to have a career change and, with the kind of training and what \nthey would bring to teaching as achievement in a number of different \npotential areas, they would be able to be of a real advantage to these \nstudents.\n  Many of us have seen, for example, the Troops to Teachers Program \nwhere we have had a number of members of the U.S. Navy, particularly in \nthe areas of--well, the submarine fleet comes the closest in the State \nof Washington, I believe, where a number of the people who retired from \nthe Navy stayed in the area. These are people with enormous kinds of \nunderstanding and a great deal of training in terms of math and in \nterms of science. When they were offered this opportunity to engage in \nthe schools--it is also true in a number of districts in Florida and in \nother communities where there were significant numbers of retirees in \nthe military--when they opened up the opportunity for these servicemen \nto go into teaching, they just went in droves. The positive impact it \nhas had in the schools in the areas of math and science has been \nabsolutely extraordinary.\n  As I was listening to the Senator, it seems to me that this is sort \nof a particular situation, but there are going to be other professions \nas well where individuals, through the Senator's amendment, could get \ninto the areas of teaching and have a rewarding and satisfying and \ninspiring career and also make a real difference in terms of children's \nappreciation for learning as well as enhancing their skills \nacademically.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator for his question. He is right on the \nmoney, as usual. There are so many people in modern America in the \nmilitary--the Troops to Teachers--so many other professions who retire \nearly; they receive their pensions after 25 years; they say they are \nnot going to work at this job any longer because they are getting a \ngood pension, whatever, who would love to teach, who would just love to \nteach.\n  I myself, as everyone here, have been invited into classrooms to \nteach. Come to Cunningham Junior High School and teach 8th grade social \nstudies for a day or come to Madison High School and teach 11th grade \nhistory for a morning. I guess I am not atypical. I love it. When these \npeople who have retired, who have such skills, get a taste of teaching, \nthey love it.\n  One of the things we do in this amendment--and the Senator is correct \nto point this out--is make it a lot easier for them to go into \nteaching. There are no inadvertent barriers in the way.\n  In this bill, we allow them to go teach. These days they could have \n15 or 20 productive years as a teacher after their original career. The \nSenator is exactly correct. As we try to think of how to attract new \nteachers, this group of people is one of the great untapped resources. \nI hope, through this amendment, we can tap it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I commend the Senator. We have seen awakened in this \ncountry, particularly in recent times, a sense of voluntarism. I think \nvoluntarism is alive and well in the United States. Many of us hope \nthat our young people, whatever their disposition, will be more \ninvolved in the public policy aspects of our country. You can't get \naway from the fact of their involvement in terms of volunteerism. I \nhave seen it in our high-tech area in my own State of Massachusetts \nwith our ``netdays'' where Massachusetts was 48 out of 50 States in \nterms of Internet access. And basically, through asking the high-tech \nindustry to tie up with local schools, we have moved now into No. 11. \nWe have what we call ``netdays.'' The private sector in the high-tech \narea, the software industry, has been enormously responsive in adopting \nschools, and labor laid down 350 miles of cable in Boston voluntarily \non Saturdays because their children were going to these schools.\n\n  Schools have an enormous ring in terms of our value system. To \nchallenge our society in ways which they haven't been challenged \nbefore, in terms of giving people an opportunity to be a part of an \neducational system, would get a very positive response. We shouldn't \nmiss the opportunity to at least challenge professionals in that area. \nThe good Senator's amendment will help enormously in being able to do \nit.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the senior Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. If the Senator will yield, I would like to share some \nexperiences I have had in this area also.\n  As you may remember, a few years ago, Congress took back--sort of--\nthe school system of the District of Columbia. I had the opportunity of \nsort of being the de facto superintendent of schools for awhile. I have \nbeen following up on some of the problems they have had, as all schools \nare having, with finding teachers who are qualified. I find that the \nonly teachers they can get in the science and math area are retired \npeople who have come back in and had some sort of a certification \nprocess to make sure they knew the basics about teaching.\n  Also, in Vermont, we have one of the largest IBM plants, and we have \nthe same shortage of teachers. They are finding there that the source \nof getting good teachers back into the schools is from the retired IBM \nemployees.\n  This is an idea we have been talking quite a bit about today. I \nwanted to share those experiences with the Senate because we have to do \neverything we can. At some point, the States would be better to do \nthat, to make sure the standards just of the common capabilities of \nteaching are there and all that sort of thing.\n  I commend the Senator on his amendment and the Hutchison amendment.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from Vermont not only for his \ninsight but for his great leadership on this bill. One of the reasons \nwe have such a broad and bipartisan bill is because of the Senator's \nleadership, as well as my friend from Massachusetts.\n  Teaching is so fulfilling. It is a great job, if people get a taste \nof it, as both Senators from Massachusetts and Vermont have said. \nWhether you are a retired military person or a retired person from \ntechnology or a retired small businessperson, I say: Look at teaching. \nIf we can pass this legislation with the amendment that so many of us \non both sides of the aisle have put together, we will make it easier \nfor you to get into teaching.\n  Given the importance of teaching to America and given what a \nfulfilling job it is, maybe this amendment will really help the \nchildren of this generation, and certainly generations in the future, \nto get the kind of great fulfilling experience they had from great \nteachers as we each did as we went through elementary and secondary \nschool.\n  I thank the Senator for those nice words as well as for his \nleadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I plead with my fellow Members of the \nSenate who may still be here that we are waiting for another Senator to \nhopefully offer an amendment. We have some 270 remaining to be brought \nto our attention. Hopefully, we will be here for a little length of \ntime anyway. I am not sure how long. Now is the time.\n  I yield the floor to Senator Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n[[Page S4808]]\n\n                 Amendment No. 402 To Amendment No. 358\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I shall offer an amendment. The amendment is \nat the desk. It is amendment No. 402. I call up the amendment at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 402.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide grants for the teaching of traditional American \n                     history as a separate subject)\n\n       On page 893, after line 14, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

It was 1924 that John W. Davis of Clarksburg was \nnominated on the 103rd ballot for the office of President of the United \nStates. He was defeated by Calvin Coolidge.\n  My first teacher was a woman by the name of Carrico. Her husband had \nlost his arm as a brakeman on, I believe, the N railroad. Mrs. \nCarrico was my first teacher and she taught the lower grades.\n  We started out in the Primer and the main character in that primer \nwas Baby Ray. And there were two rooms, as I say. In the other room, a \nman by the name of Lawrence Jennings taught the upper grades. I went \nthrough the Primer in about 3 weeks. I promoted myself when it came to \ngeography. Being in the same classroom with other students in the \nfirst, second, third, fourth grades--I believe the fourth grade was in \nthe same room--I learned a lot by listening to the other students in \nthe higher grades.\n  There was a geography book. I can remember it as though it were \nyesterday; it was Fryes Geography. Well, I liked geography; I liked the \nmaps and the pictures. So I went home one night and said to the man who \nraised me, a coal miner--he was my uncle by marriage--``I want a copy \nof Fryes Geography. I like that book.'' He said, ``Well, we will go to \nMatoaka,'' which was about 5 miles away. This was all in Mercer County, \nin southern West Virginia. ``We will go to Matoaka on Saturday, which \nis pay day, and we will get Fryes Geography.''\n  He took for granted that the teacher had asked me to ask him for this \nbook. The teacher didn't ask me to do that. I just decided I wanted it. \nSo we caught the train and went to Matoaka. There was no highway up to \nAlgonquin. Algonquin was the coal camp. There was no highway up to \nAlgonquin from Matoaka.\n  The railroad ran across Clark's Gap Mountain, and we went by \nrailroad, a passenger train, from Matoaka up to Algonquin. We went by \nGiatto and Weyanoke in Mercer County. That is the way we went from \nMatoaka to Algonquin.\n  Mr. Byrd, the man who raised me, was a man who didn't have much \neducation. He probably never went to the second grade. He could barely \nread. We had a Holy Bible in our house. That was about the only book at \nour house. I always called him my dad because I loved him and he loved \nme. I didn't know anybody else as a father. His wife was my aunt. She \nwas my natural father's sister, and I had three brothers and a sister. \nBut losing my mother when I was 1 year old, my biological father could \nnot care for five children. That was back in the days when he probably \nearned only $3 or $4 a week working in a furniture shop.\n  Upon the death of my mother during the influenza epidemic, he gave \nthe children to his sisters. He kept the one daughter. I only saw her \nwhen I was in high school--about 15 or 16 years old. I saw my sister \nthen for the first and only time.\n  But there we were. These people who took me in to be raised loved me. \nThey had one child prior to their taking me as their adopted child. \nThat child had died of scarlet fever. So they had me as their adopted \nson. They loved me. I never knew about a mother's kiss. My aunt was \ntough, very religious, and strict. I never knew a mother's kiss, but \nshe loved me.\n  Anyhow, I went home one evening, and I said to my dad--as I say, I \ncalled him my dad because, as far as I knew at that time, he was my \nfather. Now, I went home and I said I had to have a Fryes Geography. So \non Saturday, we caught the passenger train, went down to Matoaka and \nbought Fryes Geography.\n  I took it to school on Monday. The teacher Mrs. Carrico, said, ``I \ndidn't tell you to get this.'' I said, ``Well, I have to have it and I \nwant to study it.'' That teacher let me keep that book and let me study \nalong with the class in which the book was being taught.\n  Well, I came to love my teachers, and we had a category on that \nreport card that was denominated ``Deportment.'' My old coal miner dad \ntold me, ``If you get a whipping in school, I will give you another \nwhipping when you get home.'' I wanted to please that coal miner dad, \nand I wanted to please those teachers. Back in those days, I say to \nSenator Kennedy, the history book was by Muzzie.\n  It did not have a lot of pictures in it. It was full of narrative. I \noften ask the young pages who serve us--we have different pages from \nyear to year to let me see their history book. I ask the students, the \npages: Who is Nathan Hale? If an American history book does not tell us \nabout Nathan Hale, I do not think it is much of a history book.\n  Who was Nathan Hale? Nathan Hale was a young schoolteacher, 21 years \nof age. When George Washington asked for a volunteer to go behind the \nBritish lines and spy on the British fortifications and bring back \ndrawings of the British gun placements, and so on, this young man by \nthe name of Nathan Hale, age 21, schoolteacher, volunteered to go.\n  He went behind the British lines. He accomplished his mission. On the \nnight before he was to return to the American lines, he was arrested as \na spy, and, of course, the drawings and the papers were in his \nclothing. The next morning, September 22, 1776, he was brought before a \ngallows, and as he\n\n[[Page S4809]]\n\nstood there with his hands tied behind him, he asked for a Bible. The \nrequest was refused. Nathan Hale stood there before the gallows, and \nonly a few yards away was a wooden coffin--a wooden coffin. He knew \nthat his body would soon be placed in that coffin.\n  He was asked by the British captain, whose name was Cunningham: Have \nyou anything to say?\n  Nathan Hale said:\n\n       I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my \n     country.\n\n  Nathan Hale died for his country. I often wonder why people cannot \ngive one vote for their country--whether they are Republicans or \nDemocrats, why they will not vote, why they will not give one vote for \ntheir country Nathan Hale gave the only life he had for his country.\n  That history book taught me about Nathan Hale. As a lad, I memorized \nmy history lessons. I memorized them by the light of an oil lamp. I \nmemorized history. I liked history. I liked to read about Francis \nMarion the ``Swamp Fox,'' Nathanael Greene, Daniel Morgan, George \nWashington, Benjamin Franklin, James Madison. They were my heroes.\n  So I say today we need good history books and good teachers so that \nthe boys and girls today will find their heroes among the early \nAmericans who built this country.\n  I came to appreciate the fact that the peoples of western Europe, \neastern Europe, central Europe, southern Europe, northern Europe and \nelsewhere came to this country and helped to build it. My heroes were \nthose men and women who were mentioned in the history books. The \nteaching of history is important.\n  When I moved out of that area of West Virginia--moved out with a \nwagon team--we moved up a hollow called Wolf Creek Hollow. We were 3 \nmiles up that hollow.\n  I then attended another two-room school up on the mountain. I walked \nto that school with a man by the name of Archie Akers. He was one of \nthe two teachers in the school. He would walk from 3 or 4 miles down \nthe hollow up by my house, and I would get with him and walk on up to \nthe top of that mountain to that school.\n  I had two teachers there. One was named Mary Grace Lilly. I remember \nthe first day I went there. She said: If you have a fence and you can't \nget over it, you can't get under it, what do you do?\n  I held up my hand. She called on me. I was eager to be called on. I \nsaid: If you can't get over it, you can't get under it; you go around \nit.\n  She patted me on the head and said: That's right.\n  I memorized my lessons. Yes, memorized my lessons. I loved to do it. \nI loved to be called on by the teachers. I liked my teachers. I had \ngood teachers. They did not get paid much. Very little did they get \npaid, but they were dedicated teachers.\n  We did not have any electricity in the house. We did not have any \nrunning water. If we wanted to go to the toilet, we had to go outside \nto a privy behind the house. No radio. Never heard of television. You \nsee, that was in the twenties.\n  I will never forget those books. Those history books, to a degree, \nshaped me to what I am today. They shaped me, they shaped my attitude, \nthey shaped my outlook, and I came to want to be like James Madison or \nWebster or Clay or some other historical figure.\n  Oh, yes, I had my sports hero. That was Babe Ruth or Jack Dempsey--\nthese are some years later. But history, history had an impact on me, \nmay I say to my friend, Senator Kennedy. It had a decided impact on me \nwhen I was just a boy, 8 years old, 9 years old, 10 years old, and was \na root of my ambition to try to make something out of myself.\n  Mr. Byrd, who raised me, wanted me to go to school and to learn and \nto get a better education than he had been given. As I say, if he went \nto the second grade, I do not know that.\n  He did not want me to be a coal miner. He wanted me to get an \neducation. And in those days, when I graduated from high school in \n1934, it was something to have a high school education. I heard it said \nby my elders: If you don't get a high school education, you are not \ngoing to amount to much, you are going to have a hard time. You have to \nhave a high school education.\n\n  We had great teachers, good high school teachers. W.J.B. Cormany, \nWilliam Jennings Bryan Cormany, was the principal of the high school.\n  When we moved out of that hollow, Wolf Creek Hollow in Mercer County \nand moved to a coal camp, I enrolled at the Mark Twain School. The \nprincipal of that school, when he learned that I could recite whole \nchapters from the history book, took me up before the senior class and \nhad me perform for the senior class. Well, that kind of enhanced my \nreputation around the school--to be able to go up before the senior \nclass and recite history.\n  So, I loved my teachers. We were talking about teachers a minute ago. \nI often worked to be the best student in the class in order to please \nmy teacher. David Reemsnyder, a huge man, when I was in junior high \nschool, taught mathematics, Algebra, and geometry. I wanted to please \nhim.\n  Mrs. W.J.B. Cormany taught music. I wanted to study the violin \nbecause she wanted me to study the violin.\n  That is the kind of influence teachers had on me. I always wanted to \nbe the best student in the class, to please my teachers and to please \nthat old coal miner dad who reared me. There is no way to establish the \nworth of a good teacher.\n\n     A Builder builded a temple,\n     He wrought it with grace and skill;\n     Pillars and groins and arches\n     All fashioned to work his will.\n     Men said, as they saw its beauty,\n     ``It shall never know decay;\n     Great is they skill, O Builder!\n     Thy fame shall endure for aye.''\n\n     A Teacher builded a temple\n     With loving and infinite care,\n     Planning each arch with patience,\n     Laying each stone with prayer.\n     None praised her unceasing efforts,\n     None knew of her wondrous plan,\n     For the temple the Teacher builded\n     Was unseen by the eyes of man.\n\n     Gone is the Builder's temple,\n     Crumpled into the dust;\n     Low lies each stately pillar,\n     Food for consuming rust.\n     But the temple the Teacher builded\n     Will last while the ages roll,\n     For that beautiful unseen temple\n     Was a child's immortal soul.\n\n  I have done a little reminiscing here today. The Senator I am most \nfond of saying is my favorite Senator on this side of the aisle, \nSenator Kennedy--one gets into trouble saying things like that--saying \n``This man, this Senator, is my favorite,'' or, ``that Senator is my \nfavorite.'' They are all my favorites. But Senator Kennedy is my \nfavorite favorite Democratic Senator.\n  A few days ago, he wanted me to do a little reminiscing about my \nschooldays. You see, I have been going along life's pathway quite \nawhile. I came from those deep roots, and I like to speak of my \nremembrances of those teachers who sacrificed, back in the Depression. \nThey couldn't get their checks cashed. They had to surrender 20 \npercent, sometimes, of the monthly check, the total check, in order to \nget it cashed. That was in the Great Depression.\n  Mr. President, my amendment to the budget resolution, as I have \nalready indicated, will add $100 million in fiscal year 2002 to \nfunction 550, education. This increased funding will allow for the \ncontinuation of an American history grant program I initiated last \nyear. That program is going, it is ongoing, it is moving. This program \nis designed to promote the teaching of history, American history.\n  It is shocking--it is shocking--to read of students who do not know \nthat the Civil War occurred during the second half of the 19th century. \nThey cannot place the Civil War in a specific 50-year period with \naccuracy, let alone say it was from 1861 to 1865. They don't even know \nwhat half century it occurred in. So we are falling down badly in \nteaching American history. And history is so important.\n  Byron, Lord Byron, said, ``History, with all her volumes vast, hath \nbut one page,'' meaning that history repeats itself. And it does. It \nrepeats itself.\n  When Adam and Eve were placed in the Garden of Eden, H2O \nwas water. Water was made up of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of \noxygen. And it is still that way. It has never changed. It is still \nH2O.\n  It is the same with human nature. Human nature has never changed. \nCain slew Abel, and men are still slaying their brothers. It has not \nchanged. That is why we can truthfully say, and mean it, that history \nrepeats itself--not in every precise and particular detail, but one \nneeds to know history.\n\n[[Page S4810]]\n\n  An unfortunate trend of blending history with a variety of other \nsubjects to form a hybrid called ``social studies'' has taken hold in \nour schools. I am not against social studies, but I want history. If we \nare going to have social studies, that is OK, but let's have \nhistory. Further, the history books provided to our young people, all \ntoo frequently, gloss over the finer points of America's past. My \namendment provides incentives to help spur a return to the teaching of \ntraditional American history.\n\n  Every February our nation celebrates the birth of two of our most \nrevered presidents--George Washington, the father of our country who \nvictoriously led his ill-fitted assembly of militiamen against the \narmies of King George, and Abraham Lincoln, the eternal martyr of \nfreedom, whose powerful voice and iron will shepherded a divided nation \ntoward a more perfect Union. Sadly, I fear that many of our Nation's \nschoolchildren may never fully appreciate the lives and accomplishments \nof these two American giants of history. They have been robbed, the \nstudents have been robbed of that appreciation robbed by our schools \nthat no longer stress a knowledge of American history, robbed by books \nthat purport to be history books but are not history.\n  Study after study has shown that the historical significance of our \nNation's grand celebrations of patriotism--such as Memorial Day or the \nFourth of July--is lost on the majority of young Americans. What a \nwaste. What a shame.\n  American students, regardless of race, religion, or gender, must know \nthe history of the land to which they pledge allegiance. They should be \ntaught about the Founding Fathers of this Nation, the battles that they \nfought, the ideals that they championed, and the enduring effects of \ntheir accomplishments. Without this knowledge, they cannot appreciate \nthe hard won freedoms that are our birthright.\n  Our failure to insist that the words and actions of our forefathers \nbe handed down from generation to generation will ultimately mean a \nfailure to perpetuate this wonderful, glorious experiment in \nrepresentative democracy. Without the lessons learned from the past, \nhow can we insure that our Nation's core ideals--life, liberty, \njustice--will survive? As Marcus Tullius Cicero stated: ``. . . to be \nignorant of what occurred before you were born is to remain always a \nchild.''\n  Many groups are interested and have expressed support for this grant \nprogram. Representatives from the National Council for History \nEducation, the National Coordinating Committee for the Promotion of \nHistory, the American Historical Association, and National History Day \nhave all expressed enthusiasm for this grant program. They are very \nsupportive of this effort.\n  So, for those reasons, I offer this amendment to the budget \nresolution to increase function 500 (education) by $100 million in \nfiscal year 2002, and I urge the adoption of it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, some few days ago when we were on the \nfloor of the Senate--I think it was at that time, or perhaps even a \nlittle later in the week as we find ourselves today--we listened to our \ngood friend from West Virginia. At that time he quoted one of his \nfamous poems that, as his poem today suggests, had a deep-seated \nmeaning to it. I took the occasion to ask him prior to the time that we \nwere going to end this debate and discussion if he might recall his \nearly years as a student and share them with us once again on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  I have had the good opportunity to listen to the good Senator speak \non many, many different subject matters, and always with great \nenthusiasm, strength, and belief for the causes for which he speaks, so \nmany of which I agree. I always find, having listened to him for many, \nmany years, that the stories he talks about of his early years and the \npower of education is really a lesson that all of us should hear \nbecause it reminds all of us about what, in this case, this legislation \nis all about and what we are attempting to try to provide for the young \npeople in this country.\n  If we were ever possibly able to sort of capture that extraordinary \nmagic that was evidenced in that small school, the primer schools and \nthen after that, and somehow develop in that classroom the atmosphere \nwhich brought Bob Byrd to sense the great desire and thirst for \nknowledge and personal achievement, accomplishment, and desire to \nreally respond to the teachers by demonstrating keen intellect and an \nawareness in the classroom, and to take those early lessons and use \nthem as guideposts for the rest of his life resulting in this \nextraordinary career of public service for the people of West Virginia, \nand the people of this Nation, I think our problems really as a country \nand as a society would be immensely advanced.\n  Whenever I listen to Senator Byrd, I think about what we were trying \nto do in terms of different paragraphs, different authorizations and \napproaches in what we were trying to do in different provisions of the \nlegislation. It always makes us think about what we ought to be doing \nbetter to try to make the dream of education and the kind of \nopportunity this extraordinary Senator felt, which was so much a part \nof his pathway to his own life and such a source of strength to him, as \nwell as his deep-seated faith--we would be very fortunate if we were \never able to sort of capture that in a legislative undertaking. We have \nnot done so with this legislation, needless to say.\n  But we are going to continue to try to create a climate and \natmosphere in the schools so other Bob Byrds in West Virginia, \nMassachusetts, Vermont, and across this country might perhaps have a \nsimilar life's experience, and, as a result of that, we would have a \nbetter and a stronger nation.\n  I thank the Senator for his amendment. I know very well the Senator's \nstrong interest in history.\n  I will just take a moment or two to remind the Senate that one of our \ngreat historians, David McCullough, will be releasing his wonderful \nbook on Adams and Jefferson. The book is going to be published in about \n2 weeks. They have already printed some 350,000 copies. I don't think \nthey have underestimated both the success of the book or the thirst of \nAmericans for knowledge about this country in its early years.\n  I remember the occasion when I was at the Longfellow House in \nCambridge, MA, a few years back. I was looking at some of the papers in \nthe Longfellow House. The Longfellow House was designated by Mrs. \nClinton under Saving America's Treasures as one of our two treasures. \nThe Longfellow House in Cambridge and the Frelinghuysen Morris House in \nLenox are other treasures. But this was a special treasure for a number \nof reasons.\n  One of those related to David McCullough's book is the fact that this \nwas the place where George Washington assumed command of the American \nforces in the American Revolution. As David McCullough reminds us, this \nwas the first symbol of national unity of a southern general commanding \nnorthern troops. Others had signed up for the American Revolution for \nperiods of time, but the Glovers, which was a small band of troops who \nhad been organized by Colonel Glover, committed themselves for the \nduration of the war.\n\n  They were subsequently enormously important because they were the \nones who brought Washington from Brooklyn Heights over to New York when \nthe British fleet came into New York Harbor at a very key time in 1776. \nAnd when the wind was blowing from the northeast, it kept the British \ntroops out. The Glovers brought Washington back into the main of New \nYork, which would be Manhattan now. And then he escaped out into \nsouthern New York State and eventually over to New Jersey. Then the \nGlovers were the ones who brought him across the river at Trenton.\n  But Dave McCullough wrote to me about papers that were there that \nwere not as well cataloged or kept and were in danger of deterioration. \nThese were magnificent handwritten notes of John Adams and John Quincy \nAdams that were directly relevant to the early years of the founding of \nthis country. Senator Byrd was good enough to review--find out for \nhimself, actually, as one would expect--the substance of that material \nand made his own independent judgment about the importance of \npreserving those in terms of\n\n[[Page S4811]]\n\nour national history. As a result of his efforts, some extraordinarily \nimportant early documents involving the founding of this country are \nnow carefully preserved for future generations.\n  So when Senator Byrd talks about his love of history, we all know it \nand have seen it, but I think many of us have also witnessed it in our \nrelationships with Senator Byrd on different issues.\n  I thank him for offering this amendment.\n  Some years ago, I was on the Bicentennial of the American \nConstitution committee. I was on that committee that Chief Justice \nBerger chaired with a number of our colleagues, Senator Hatch, Senator \nThurmond--a number of our colleagues.\n  From that, which was the bicentennial of the Constitution, one \nenduring, continuing, and ongoing force from that period was the \nestablishment of the Madison Fellows. And there are two schoolteachers \nfrom each State, each year, who are selected through a very rigorous \nselection process. They receive a stipend for a period of study and \nthen basically commit to teach the Constitution for the rest of the \ntime they are teaching. We have now two in each State of the Union.\n  We found during that period of time there was so little understanding \nabout the Constitution. We found the challenge that we had so many \npeople who could not read the Constitution. One of the small efforts \nthat came out of that was a literacy corps to try to help in terms of \nreading.\n  We have seen a number of different efforts since that time. There are \nsome important initiatives in this legislation to improve reading for \nthe young people in this country. This was a serious deficiency. But I \ncan just say, as we reviewed at that time the importance of developing \nknowledge about the Constitution, we saw, as well, the failure in too \nmany of our schools of the understanding, the appreciation of being \ntaught good history.\n  The good Senator's amendment can help immeasurably in developing a \nbetter understanding and awareness in history for our students.\n  I appreciate the way the amendment is structured as well because it \ngives some special effort to our neediest communities that perhaps do \nnot have the range of different resources in terms of our history and \ngives them the recognition that they can participate in this program \nand be able to do so on a very even basis with any of the other \ncommunities in the country. So I think it is structured in a very \ncompelling way as well.\n  I thank the Senator for both his statement and, most of all, for his \nearlier comments. I know every Member in this body is extremely busy, \nbut if Americans want to know the value of an education and what it \nmeans in terms of an individual, read Bob Byrd, West Virginia, \nThursday.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from \nMassachusetts for this dialog. I was in this Chamber, I think it was \nprobably a week ago, when there were similar circumstances, when the \nSenator from Massachusetts asked the Senator from West Virginia to \nbring together his memories of his childhood and the importance of \nhistory and the importance of a good education.\n  So I am pleased to have had the opportunity to hear the Senator \nspeak. I wish more Members had the opportunity to be able to do that \nbecause it is a step back into history and a move forward in our \nability to understand this great Nation of ours.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia so much for his efforts and \nfor the amendment he has offered today.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if I could say one final word, I \nparticularly appreciate the reference the Senator from West Virginia \nmade about his teachers and the names of his teachers. And Fryes, is \nthat the geography book?\n  Mr. BYRD. Fryes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And the history book was----\n  Mr. BYRD. Muzzie.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Muzzie. So I was glad to hear that.\n  I might just mention one of my great teachers was Arthur Holcombe, \nwho wrote ``Our More Perfect Union,'' who was probably the leading \nteacher--and certainly was at Harvard--about the Constitutional \nConvention. When he taught, you had a feeling you were right at the \nConstitutional Convention.\n  I was fortunate to have him the last year he taught at Harvard. He \ntaught my father when he went to Harvard, and he taught my three \nbrothers. He taught about the Constitutional Convention. So he had a \npretty good grasp of the subject matter by that time. But it was also a \ncourse that made a profound impact and impression on me, and one I will \nnever forget.\n  I thank again the Senator for his good words and his good work today.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Let me share another moment, too. When the Senator \nmentioned who his teachers were, I thought, let's see if I can remember \nmy teachers. They were Miss Anderson, Miss Maughn, Miss Burns, Miss \nBrown, Miss Shipp, and then back to Miss Burns for the first six \ngrades. I remember them just as if it were yesterday.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. But it is amazing what influence teachers have on \nstudents, and others. The principal at the high school I went to was a \ngood friend who was a real mentor to me, also.\n\n  So we have to do all we can to make sure every child in this country \nhas the ability to get as good an education and have as wonderful \nteachers as we all had.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank both of my colleagues for their \ngenerous comments.\n  I sat and marveled, with great admiration, at the recollections that \nwere expressed by Senator Kennedy and at what he had to say today about \nsome of the things that have happened in his great State as we try to \ncontemplate the American Revolution, and then his comments concerning \nDavid McCullough; and his reference to John Adams.\n  Some few years ago I read John Adams' ``Thoughts on Government.'' \nJohn Adams, I think, has been underestimated--or really has never been \nfully appreciated, as he should be.\n  During the Constitutional Convention, he had had his ``Thoughts on \nGovernment'' printed and had passed this work around among the members \nof the convention. It had a great impact on the members and influenced \nthem very much in their deliberations.\n  I am glad that David McCullough, who is the right man for the job, is \ngoing to have this publication soon concerning John Adams, which leads \nme to say that knowing of David McCullough's interest in John Adams and \nknowing of John Adams' influence upon the Framers of the country, I \nhave been interested in trying to get an appropriation for an \nappropriate monument to John Adams. I understand that David McCullough \nis also supporting and promoting that idea. I am very much for it.\n  I thank Senator Kennedy for what he has said about John Quincy Adams. \nJohn Qunicy Adams suffered a stroke on February 23, 1848, as he spoke \nin Statuary Hall. He was a vigorous opponent of America's entry and \nparticipation in the Mexican war. He was making this very emotional \nspeech, and he had a stroke. He was taken to the office of the Speaker \nof the House of Representatives and died 2 days later--John Quincy \nAdams. He was elected to nine terms in the House, after having served \nas President.\n  Senator Kennedy, we are not supposed to address each other in the \nfirst person in this body, but I want to tell you, I really enjoyed \nwhat you had to say. I am glad that you have such an appreciation of \nAmerican history and the great patriots who gave us the Constitution. \nSenator Kennedy is a student of history sui generis.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. And an important part of history.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank my friend, Mr. Jeffords, for his recollections of \nteachers. I remember a Miss McCone who taught history. And she asked me \na question one day. I said: Huh? And I kept on studying. I was paying \nattention to my reading, and Miss McCone had not said another word. \nNext thing I knew, she had walked around the room and she came up \nbehind me and gave me a resounding slap on the cheek and said: Robert, \ndon't you ever say ``huh'' to me again.\n  I never said ``huh'' to Miss McCone again.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if there is no further discussion of this\n\n[[Page S4812]]\n\nparticular amendment, we are prepared to accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 402.\n  The amendment (No. 402) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BYRD. I again thank both of the Senators.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, we have had a wonderful moment here, and \nI now would like to give the opportunity for others to come and give \ntheir moments if they so desire.\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, yesterday, during rollcall vote No. 96, the \nMikulski amendment, and No. 97, the McConnell amendment, as modified, I \nwas necessarily absent to attend the funeral of a dear friend, Larry \nCacciola, of Middletown, Connecticut.\n  Had I been present, I would have voted ``aye'' for each amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/10/senate-section/article/S4812-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

A clean \nenvironment and a strong energy policy need not be mutually exclusive. \nThe forces of reality have brought us to this point. We have an energy \nproblem that we cannot ignore. We also have a new administration which \nis re-evaluating our environmental policies, as any new administration \nwould do, to ensure that what we are pursuing, and how we are pursuing \nit, is relevant, realistic, and achievable.\n  In the past, there has been a division of these issues. Energy and \nenvironmental policies have been considered separately--and mostly at \nodds with one another. This has led to an unnecessary gap of confidence \nin both efforts. We have an opportunity to reverse this division and \ncreate integrated policies to pursue both critically important \nobjectives of a steady energy supply and a clean environment.\n  In the next few days, President Bush will release the \nadministration's new energy policy. This policy will provide a balanced \napproach to meet the supply and demand imbalance we are now facing in \nthis country. It will reflect our absolute need for a wide and deep \nenergy supply portfolio, including the use of renewable energy and \nalternative energy sources. It would have been easy to defer this \nchallenge, to delay the tough choices. But that's what got us into this \nmess. For the last 8 years, this country drifted without an energy \npolicy, and today we are literally paying the price.\n  Gas prices have hit record levels and are predicted to continue \nrising. The energy shortages in California will spread to other areas \nof this country during the hot summer months when the demand for energy \nwill continue to outstrip supply.\n  Finding solutions to problems requires bold ideas, common sense, \nimagination and sometimes unpopular choices. President Bush has shown \ncourage and leadership for his willingness to address the problem and \ndevelop solutions. As we create a comprehensive and balanced policy to \naddress our energy needs, we need to take into account our \nenvironmental priorities, particularly in the area of climate change.\n  Just one example of where we can do this is nuclear energy \nproduction. Like solar and wind power, nuclear power produces no \ngreenhouse gases--zero emissions. It is one of the most cost effective, \nreliable, available, and efficient forms of energy we have. Vast \nimprovements in technology have made it one of the safest forms of \nenergy production. Having nuclear energy play a vital role in our \nenergy policy will enhance not only our energy supply but our \nenvironmental health as well.\n  President Bush has assembled a cabinet level environmental task force \nto review climate change. They have been listening to and learning from \nsome of the world's foremost meteorologists, climatologists, \nphysicists, scientists, and environmental experts. The President has \nsaid that his administration will offer a science based, realistic, and \nachievable alternative to the Kyoto protocol.\n  That is the responsible thing to do. President Bush merely stated the \nobvious when he declared the Kyoto protocol dead. Although his actions \nhave been criticized, the forthrightness and clarity are refreshing on \nthis issue. The Kyoto protocol would never have been in a position to \nbe ratified by the U.S. Senate. The Clinton-Gore administration knew \nthis as well. That is why they never submitted the treaty to the Senate \neven for debate and consideration.\n  Despite the heated rhetoric on this issue from the other side of the \nAtlantic, no major industrialized nation has ratified the Kyoto \nprotocol. In fact, Australia has said it will follow in rejecting the \ntreaty. There is a reason for that. The Kyoto protocol would not work. \nIt left out 134 nations, some of whom are among the world's largest \nemitters of greenhouse gases. A treaty claiming to attempt to reduce \nglobal emissions of greenhouse gases has no chance of being effective \nwhen it exempts some of the largest greenhouse gas emitters in the \nworld--nations like China, India, South Korea, Brazil, and 130 other \nnations.\n  My colleague from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, whom I worked with in \n1997 on S. Res. 98, addressed this point last week. S. Res. 98, or the \nByrd-Hagel resolution, which the Senate agreed to by a vote of 95 to 0, \nstated that the United States should not agree to any treaty in Kyoto, \nor thereafter, which would place binding limits on the United States \nand other industrialized nations unless ``the protocol or other \nagreement also mandates new specificly scheduled commitments to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions for Developing County Parties within the same \ncompliance period.'' As Senator Byrd reiterated last week, developing \ncountries must be included in any international agreement to limit \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n\n  From the moment it was signed, the Kyoto protocol was never a \nrealistic or achievable way to move forward on climate change. In the \nmeantime, we've lost precious time when we could have been exploring \nachievable and realistic ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We \nhave an opportunity now to discard an unworkable protocol and build a \nnew consensus that will address climate change, and initiate efforts \nthat are realistic and achievable.\n  The United States is still a party to the Framework Convention on \nClimate Change (Rio Treaty), which was signed by the United States and \nratified by the U.S. Senate in 1992. We should go back to the framework \nof that treaty, before the Berlin Mandate that excluded developing \ncountries from participation, and lay the groundwork for future \ninternational efforts. This gives us a strong base to work from. Many \nof the discussions during the negotiations for the Kyoto protocol have \nworked to build consensus on areas that will need to be part of any \ninternational initiative--flexible measures to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions, the role of carbon sinks, and other areas. We can build on \nthis progress in developing an alternative to Kyoto.\n  If we are creative and if our partners will work with us in good \nfaith, we can negotiate arrangements that are responsible and \nproactive. By addressing this issue domestically, the United States can \ndemonstrate our commitment to climate change and show that meeting this \nchallenge can be done in an integrated way that ensures a sound energy \nsupply and economic stability. The world will not be better off if the\n\n[[Page S4813]]\n\nUnited States slips into an energy crisis or if our economy falters. \nBoth would set off shock waves that would reverberate around the world. \nBy creating our own integrated policy, we can provide direction for how \nthe world can address the dual challenges of energy and climate change.\n  Senators Murkowski and Breaux have introduced a comprehensive energy \nbill, of which I am an original cosponsor, that will increase our \ndomestic resources, and increase the use of renewable and alternative \nfuels. In the last Congress, Senators Murkowski, Byrd, Craig, and I had \nlegislation that would dramatically increase funding for the research \nand development of technologies to provide cleaner energy sources, and \nto incentivize efforts to reduce or sequester greenhouse gases. We are \nbuilding upon that legislation and will be reintroducing it soon. It \nwill improve our scientific knowledge and lay out positive steps that \nwe can take now to address climate change.\n  A forward-looking domestic policy will demonstrate our commitment to \nthis important issue, enhance what we genuinely know abut climate \nchange, create more efficient energy sources, include the efforts of \nour agricultural sector, and have the additional effect of reducing air \npollutants.\n  Mr. President, as I stated earlier, we have an historic opportunity \nto create policies that will address both our energy and environmental \npriorities in a way that is not mutually exclusive. Policies that \ncompliment each other and work together. As we enter the 21st century, \nwe face a world that is integrated like never before in history. Just \nas foreign policy cannot be considered separate from national security \nor trade policy--energy policy cannot and should not be considered \nseparate from environmental and economic policy. What we do in one \npolicy area has dramatic implications for another--both in our nation \nand across the globe. Building sound policies for our future requires \nthat we create integrated policies to address the challenges facing \nAmerica and the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen).

Mr. President, this Sunday is Mother's Day. In an annual \ntribute as old as the holiday itself, all across America, families will \ndemonstrate just how essential mothers are to the smooth functioning of \nour families. How will they do this? They will serve mother breakfast \nin bed. Youngsters will rise early and attempt to sneak past their \nsleeping mother to reach the kitchen undetected. And despite the \nkeenness of a mother's hearing--just ask any teenager who has been \ncaught coming in too late how keen it is--a mother's soft heart will \nkeep her breathing even and her eyes gently shut as this stealth attack \non her kitchen is made. Toast will be burnt, eggs--well, they will be \nrunny, coffee may be the consistency of tar, and the flowers freshly \nplucked from the prized beds outside the window may be presented in a \njuice glass because no one knows in what dark cupboard mother hides her \nnice vases.\n  Why are these mealtime disasters met by smiles and nods of \nrecognition? Simply because mothers do their many jobs so well. Day \nafter day, week after week, month after month, the meals get cooked, \nthe dishes done, the laundry folded, the house cleaned up, in a never-\nending routine performed by loving, busy, efficient hands--mother's \nhands. Despite all the changes in American families, it is still the \nmother, whether or not she also works outside the home, who does most \nof the household chores. So, when other family members, particularly \nthe younger ones, attempt to take over mom's role for even one meal, \ntheir inexperience shows, highlighting in its comedy mom's effortless \nmastery of her crowded schedule.\n\n  Children who do not attempt to serve mother breakfast in bed may \ninstead make reservations for brunch. That's another Mother's Day \ntradition. And on this day, long distance telephone circuits will be \nbusier than usual. Florists, too, will be working overtime to deliver \nflowers, just as the postman will have carried more flowery cards and \ncalorie-laden packages of sweets than bills in the leather bag slung \nover his shoulder.\n  Mothers deserve far more recognition and far more applause than can \nbe delivered on just one day. Even women who are not mothers in the \ntraditional sense exercise their inborn mothering skills all around \nus--the co-worker whose desk serves as the office pharmacy for \nheadaches, colds, and just plain sympathy--these coworkers are mothers. \nThe neighbor who picks up the mail and newspapers when we are out of \ntown, and who we know is watching over our house while we are away, \nthese are mothers, really. The woman who feeds stray animals and \nbirds--those women are mothers. Without them, we could not function and \nsociety would fray and tear just a bit more.\n  Even in a world of automated teller machines and on-line banking, one \nstill needs to know how to multiply and divide in one's head to be sure \nthat the bank has not made a mistake in one's account. One still needs \nto be able to think, to analyze, to cogitate, to compute. It does not \nall need to be done in some glitzy new way in order to be effective. \nThere is still a place for the tried and true, even for rote \nmemorization. After all, what child does not learn the alphabet by \nmemorizing the alphabet song? Of course, that simple tune was likely \nnot taught by a teacher in a school but by a mother, perhaps in a \nnursery, using the same melody line as ``Twinkle, Twinkle, Little \nStar.''\n  All parents are teachers, by deed as well as by example. When a \nmother and child bake cookies together, that mother effortlessly \nincludes lessons in mathematics, chemistry, and reading, in addition to \nteaching order and discipline. And what sweeter way to take those \nlessons than by reading and following a spotted and time-worn family \nrecipe, measuring out a half of a teaspoon of salt or a tablespoon and \na half of vanilla, adding ingredients in the proper order and mixing \nlong enough but not too long, then dropping even rows of dough on a \nbaking sheet and waiting for the edges to crisp and turn brown. Taken \nseparately, flour and egg, spices and chocolate, do not look especially \nmouth-watering, perhaps. But is there anything more sublime than warm \nchocolate chip cookies still tender from the oven, washed down with a \nglass of icy cold milk? ``Ah, how sweet it is,'' and Jackie Gleason \nused to say. Not when you are 10 years old, I suspect. Perhaps not \never. Those are the lessons, and the memories, that mothers give us \nevery day.\n  We learn life's essential lessons at our mother's side. They may not \nbe life's greatest lessons, yet they may be. They may not be earth \nshattering new inventions may result, no cosmos-clarifying theorem be \ninspired--but they are essential nonetheless. When mothers read stories \nat night, and when they wash grimy hands and smeared faces, when they \nnag children to pick up their toys and put away the clean laundry, when \nthey scold children for not sharing with a playmate or for perhaps \nhitting a playmate, they teach more than reading, more than \ncleanliness, more than tidiness, more than manners: they teach love. \nThey teach respect for themselves, for oneself, and for others. These \nare lessons that last a lifetime. They are ingrained. They are what we \nteach our children. They are how we live our lives. Mothers--they are \nwhat make society work. Even as adults, in times of trouble, we may \nseek solace in a prayer learned in the dim bedrooms of an earlier time, \nwhen our mother's voice led us in ``Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray \nthe Lord my soul to keep.''\n\n  For all that mothers have to do each day, for all the lessons they \nteach, setting aside one day each year to honor them is but a small \ndown payment on the debt of love and gratitude that we owe. My own \nangel mother, having died when I was just a year old, left no memories \nfor me.\n  But to her, that angel mother whose prayers have followed me in all \nthe days of my years, and to the kind\n\n[[Page S4814]]\n\nwoman, my aunt, who took me to raise as her own, I say on this day: \nThank you. Thank you. I know--I know that they hear. They are in heaven \ntoday. And to my wife Erma, to whom I shall be married 64 years, 3 \nweeks from this past Tuesday, she has mothered me, too, my wife Erma, \nand she has continued my raising since I met her in the schoolyard long \nago. To my wife Erma, who raised my two precious daughters to be the \nstrong and resourceful women and mothers that they are, I say a \nheartfelt, ``Thank you!'' I have been in good hands, and I am grateful \non this Mother's Day and every day. And to all the mothers in America \nwho work so hard each day to keep our lives orderly and well fed, and \nwho remind and nag and scold and coach and encourage and hug and mold \ntheir children into happy, loving, responsible people, I say on behalf \nof all mothers, ``Thank you!'' ``Thank you'', mothers.\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to close with a poem that I learned a \nlong time ago, and which illustrates nicely that combination of \neducation that mothers provide, both practical and spiritual.\n  I want to dedicate it to our pages today, these fine young people. \nThey are all juniors in high school. They will be calling their \nmothers, I will bet.\n  It is called ``A Pinch of This, A Pinch of That.''\n  Have you ever heard that said, ``a pinch of this, a pinch of that''?\n\n       When Mother used to mix the dough,\n       Or make a batter long ago;\n       When I was only table high,\n       I used to like just standing by\n       And watching her, for all the while,\n       She'd sing a little, maybe smile,\n       And talk to me and tell me--What?\n\n       Well, things I never have forgot.\n       I'd ask her how to make a cake.\n       ``Well, first,'' she'd say, ``Some sugar take\n       Some butter and an egg or two,\n       Some flour and milk, you always do,\n       And then put in, to make it good--''\n       This part I never understood\n       And often use to wonder at--\n       ``A pinch of this, a pinch of that.''\n\n       And then, she'd say, ``my little son,\n       When you grow up, when childhood's done,\n       And mother may be far away,\n       Then just remember what I say,\n       For life's a whole lot like a cake;\n       Yes, life's a thing you have to make--\n       Much like a cake, or pie, or bread;\n       You'll find it so,'' my Mother said.\n\n       I did not understand her then,\n       But how her words come back again;\n       Before my eyes my life appears\n       A life of laughter and of tears,\n       For both the bitter and the sweet\n       Have made this life of mine complete--\n       The things I have, the things I miss,\n       A pinch of that, a pinch of this.\n\n       And, now I think I know the way\n       To make a life as she would say:\n       ``Put in the wealth to serve your needs,\n       But don't leave out the lovely deeds;\n       Put in great things you mean to do,\n       And don't leave out the good and true.\n       Put in, whatever you are at,\n       A pinch of this, a pinch of that.''\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in rejecting U.S. membership in the U.N. \nHuman Rights Commission, the strongest voice for freedom in the world \nhas been silenced at and by the United Nations.\n  Clearly, Members of the United Nations are far more comfortable with \na definition of human rights which is agreeable to rogue nations like \nLibya and Sudan. This is precisely the sentiment which created the \nInternational Criminal Court. If the signatories to the Rome Treaty \nproceed to establish a permanent International Criminal Court, we need \nan insurance policy against politicized prosecution of American \nsoldiers and officials.\n  This bill is just that protection, and let me be absolutely clear, \nthe Rome Treaty, if sent to the United States Senate for ratification, \nwill be dead on arrival.\n  Notwithstanding the fact that the Senate will not ratify this treaty, \nit is, to my knowledge, the first treaty which would be applicable to \nthe U.S. even without the United States consent. This is, to say the \nleast, an appalling breach of American sovereignty and it will not \nstand.\n  But, there will be real consequences if the United States remains \nsilent in the face of this outrage. It is easy to imagine the U.S. or \nIsrael becoming a target of a U.N. witch hunt, with officials or \nsoldiers being sent before judges handpicked by undemocratic countries.\n  I am pleased that the able Senator from Georgia, Zell Miller, is \njoining in the introduction of this bill.

Mr. President, this week, May 6-12, is National Suicide \nPrevention Week. Suicide is the eighth leading cause of death in the \nUnited States. This devastating tragedy takes the lives of more than \n30,000 Americans each year, and brings suffering and loss to the lives \nof the friends and family who are left behind. Citing suicide as a \n``national public health problem,'' the U.S. Surgeon General recently \nannounced a national strategy for suicide prevention. Central to the \nstrategy is promoting awareness of the fact that suicide is, indeed, \npreventable and that we must all do our part to help end this tragedy.\n  One of the Surgeon General's main goals for preventing suicide is to \nreduce access to lethal means of suicide of which guns are the most \ndeadly. I commend the Surgeon General for recognizing the need to \naddress the role that guns play in our Nation's staggering suicide \nrate. Firearms account for 60 percent of all suicides, making them the \nmost commonly used method of suicide and;\n  Each year more Americans die in suicides by firearms than in murders \nby firearms. The national suicide prevention strategy recommends a \npublic campaign to reduce the accessibility of lethal means of suicide, \nincluding firearms, and urges the gun industry to improve firearm \nsafety design. These aims are backed by evidence that limiting access \nto lethal means of suicide and self-harm can be an effective strategy \nto prevent suicide attempts and other self-destructive behaviors. In \nfact, studies have shown that there is a separate, additional risk of \nsuicide when there is a handgun in the home. Moreover, limiting access \nto lethal means of suicide, especially handguns, can reduce the number \nof suicide attempts that are fatal. While more than 650,000 Americans \nattempt suicide each year, the chance that the attempt will be fatal \nincreases dramatically in those cases where a handgun is used.\n  The relationship between handguns and suicide is even stronger among \nyoung people. Every 46 minutes a young person in this country kills \nhimself or herself, over 60 percent of the time with a firearm. And \nthese numbers are continuing to increase: the youth suicide rate has \nnearly tripled since 1952, making suicide the third leading cause of \ndeath among young people 15 to 24 years of age. There is no question \nthat the increased access young people have to guns has been a major \nfactor in this rise. In fact, one of the most rapidly rising suicide \nrates in this country is among young African-American makes, increasing \n105 percent between 1980 and 1996, and this rise can be attributed \nalmost entirely to suicides by firearms.\n  The Surgeon General has stated that ``we should make it clear that \nsuicide prevention is everybody's business. I believe the Surgeon \nGeneral is right. Suicide is a national problem that demands our \nattention and our commitment. Congress should do its part to help \nprevent suicide by encouraging the manufacture of safer handguns and by \nclosing the loopholes that allow young people easy access to handguns.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/10/senate-section/article/S4815-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4815]]\n                       THE MOSCOW HELSINKI GROUP\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, May 12th marks the twenty-fifth \nanniversary of the founding of one of the most significant human rights \ngroups of the 20th century, the Moscow Group to Monitor Implementation \nof the Helsinki Final Act.\n  On August 1, 1975, the United States, Canada, and thirty-three \nnations of Europe, including the Soviet Union, signed the Final Act of \nthe Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Helsinki \nFinal Act. Among the agreement's provisions was a section devoted to \nrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n  The Soviet government viewing the document as a great foreign policy \nvictory published the text, in its entirety, in ``Pravda,'' the \nCommunist Party's widely circulated newspaper. That move proved to be \ndecisive for the cause of human rights in the Soviet Union. A small \ngroup of human rights activists in Moscow, led by Professor Yuri Orlov, \nread the Helsinki Accords carefully and decided to take their \ngovernment at its word.\n  On May 12, 1976, at a press conference initiated by Dr. Andrei \nSakharov, the group announced the creation of the ``Moscow Group for \nAssistance in Implementation of Helsinki Agreements,'' soon to be known \nsimply as the Moscow Helsinki Group.\n  Needless to say, the Soviet authorities were not pleased that a group \nof private citizens would publicize their government's deplorable human \nrights record. The KGB swept down on the Moscow Helsinki Group and made \nits work almost impossible. Members were imprisoned, sent to ``internal \nexile,'' expelled from the country, slandered as foreign agents, and \nharassed.\n  Despite considerable hardship and risks, members of the group \npersisted and their work served to inspire others to speak out in \ndefense of human rights. Soon similar groups sprang up elsewhere in the \nSoviet Union dedicated to seeking implementation of the Helsinki Final \nAct. By 1982, the three remaining members at liberty in Moscow were \nforced to suspect their public activities.\n  Eventually, domestic and international pressure began to bear fruit \nand helped usher in dramatic changes under Soviet leader Mikhail \nGorbachev. Political prisoners and prisoners of conscience began to be \nfreed and longstanding human rights cases were resolved.\n  In 1989, the Moscow Helsinki Group was reestablished by former \npolitical prisoners and human rights activists. In 1996, President \nBoris Yeltsin signed a decree formally recognizing the contribution of \nthe Moscow Helsinki Group in the campaign to promote respect for human \nrights in Russia.\n  Mr. President, ten years after the fall of the Soviet Union, the \nMoscow Helsinki Group continues to promote human rights and fundamental \nfreedoms in the Russian Federation. Working with a network of human \nrights centers throughout the country, the Moscow Group provides a wide \nrange of assistance to Russian citizens and residents seeking \ninformation about human rights.\n  As Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation, I \ncongratulate the Moscow Helsinki Group on its 25th anniversary and wish \nits members the best in their continued endeavors.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. President, today, after the Senate finishes its \nbusiness for the week, many of us will be returning to our home states. \nI will be flying to my home state of Illinois. And I can anticipate \nthat the trip, for the most part, will be without incident.\n  However, this wasn't the case for African Americans 40 years ago. \nForty years ago, desegregation laws in bus and train stations, as well \nas their waiting rooms and restaurants, prohibited African Americans \nfrom enjoying the same facilities as their white counterparts. The \nSupreme Court issued a ruling calling for the desegregation of \ninterstate travel. However, this had to be tested.\n  The Congress of Racial Equality selected a group of students to make \na two week trip through the South in nonviolent protest of racial \ndesegregation laws. Congressman John Lewis was one of those students \nwho was later joined by Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. These civil rights \nactivists became known as the Freedom Riders. But unlike the travel we \nare all used to, their ride was filled with fear and brutality. Prior \nto embarking on this historic journey, the students were told to make \nout their last will and testament, just in case. But like most youths, \nthey thought themselves invincible. They had no idea how truly \ndangerous and bloody their mission would become.\n  One white rider, Jim Zwerg, who joined the riders because he could no \nlonger stand the injustice, had three of his vertebrae cracked, all of \nhis teeth fractured, his nose broken, and suffered from a concussion. \nThe Klan thought that he and other white Riders were betraying them.\n  On Mother's Day in Alabama, the young Freedom Riders were greeted by \na mob of 200 with stones, baseball bats, lead pipes and chains. One \nFreedom Rider bus had its tires slashed and was stopped by an angry \nmob. An incendiary device was thrown inside the bus causing it to fill \nwith smoke. And the angry mob held the door closed so that the Riders \nwould burn inside.\n  The Riders were saved when the fuel tank exploded causing the mob to \nback away from the bus and allowing the Riders to escape before the bus \nwas completely engulfed.\n  The Freedom Riders never made it to their destination of New Orleans. \nBut they achieved their objective. Attorney General Robert Kennedy \nordered that the Supreme Court ruling finding segregation in interstate \nbus and rail travel unconstitutional be enforced.\n  The Freedom Riders became an inspiration to thousands of Americans to \njoin the cause of tearing down racial inequality. It was a critical \nmoment in the civil rights movement. About 300 protesters had joined \nthe crusade, including our colleague Senator Lieberman. This weekend \nmarks that historic day 40 years ago.\n  I want to recognize and pay tribute to my colleagues and original \nFreedom Rider Representative John Lewis, as well as Senator Joe \nLieberman, who also took an active role in the South in the early 1960s \nvolunteering to register African Americans to vote.\n  But even after 40 years, our nation still confronts racial problems \neveryday. In cities all across America, we can plainly see evidence of \ninequality, and injustice.\n  I am concerned that African Americans represent 12 percent of the \nU.S. population (some sources reflect 13 percent) and 13 percent of its \ndrug users. Yet African Americans comprise 35 percent of all those \narrested for drug possession and 55 percent of those convicted of drug \npossession. Five times as many whites use drugs as African Americans, \nbut African Americans comprise the greatest majority of drug offenders \nsent to prison. Race appears to be a clear factor.\n  Yet, I also believe, there is still hope. I believe that justice can, \nand will prevail, if we are all diligent in pursuing the goals of peace \nand respect for each other that the brave men and women of the Freedom \nRiders set forth for the nation to follow back in 1961.\n  I am hopeful because we know that our system of criminal justice \nworks. It may not be perfect, but it always strives to do right.\n  On September 15, 1963, a violent bomb went off in the Sixteenth \nStreet Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, blasting the silent \ntranquility of that Sunday morning. That devastation also claimed the \nlives of four young African American girls, Addie Mae Collins, Denise \nMcNair, Carole Robertson, and Cynthia Wesley, who were preparing for a \nchurch youth service that day.\n  Almost 40 years after this brutal hate crime was committed, justice \nfinally prevailed last week when a Birmingham jury convicted Thomas \nBlanton of plotting the church bombing. During the closing argument, \nUnited States Attorney Doug Jones said, ``It's never too late for the \ntruth to be told. It's never too late for wounds to heal. It's never \ntoo late for a man to be held accountable for his crimes.''\n  That's right. It is never too late to pursue justice in the face of \ninjustice. And it is never too late to thank the Freedom Riders and all \nthe other civil rights activists of the 1960s for their courage in \nstanding up for justice.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/10/senate-section/article/S4816-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4816]]\n                    DEMOCRACY UNDER SIEGE IN BELARUS\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I wish to update my Senate colleagues on \ndevelopments in Belarus in my capacity as Chairman of the Commission on \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, the Helsinki Commission. The \nCommission continues to pay close attention to events in Belarus \nespecially as they impact democracy, human rights and the rule of law.\n  May 7 marked the second anniversary of the disappearance of Yuri \nZakharenka, the former Belarusian Minister of Internal Affairs. In \n1999, General Zakharenka, who had been critical of Belarusian leader \nAlexander Lukashenka and had attempted to form a union of officers to \nsupport democracy, was put in a car by unidentified men and taken away. \nHe has not been heard from since. His fate is probably similar to other \nprominent Belarusian opposition figures who have disappeared over the \nlast few years, notably Victor Hanchar, Antaloy Krasovsky and Dmitry \nZavadsky. The Belarusian authorities have had no success in \ninvestigating these disappearances; indeed, there are indications that \nthe regime of Alexander Lukashenka may have been involved. Opinion \npolls in Belarus have shown that a clear majority of those who are \naware of the disappearances believe that they are the work of the \nLukashenka regime.\n  These disappearances embody the climate of disregard for human rights \nand democracy that has persisted since the election of Mr. Lukashenka \nin 1994. That disregard has intensified following his unconstitutional \npower grab in November 1996.\n  Presidential elections are planned for later this year. \nUnfortunately, recent developments in Belarus do not inspire confidence \nthat these elections will meet OSCE standards for free and democratic \nelections. Despite commitments made to the OSCE, Belarusian authorities \ncontinue to unlawfully restrict freedom of assembly and to beat and \ndetain participants in peaceful demonstrations, as illustrated by the \nApril 21 protest by youth activists. On April 27, Valery Shchukin, \ndeputy of the disbanded Belarusian parliament, received a three month \nsentence for the dubious charge of ``malicious hooliganism.'' And on \nMay 7, police arrested opposition activists who marked the anniversary \nof Yuri Zakharenka's disappearance. The activists held placards \nreading: ``Where is Zakharanka?''; ``Who's Next?''; and ``Where are the \nDisappeared People--Zakharanka, Hanchar, Krasousky, Zavadsky?''\n  Lukashenka continues his harsh assault on OSCE's efforts to develop \ndemocracy, characterizing domestic elections observers supported by the \nOSCE Advisory and Monitoring Group (AMG) as ``an army of bandits and \ncollaborationists.'' This is only the last in a series of incredible \naccusations against the international community, including far-fetched \nallegations that $500 million had been earmarked in support of the \nopposition candidates. On April 25, the OSCE Representative on Freedom \nof the Media Friemut Duve canceled his visit to Belarus to protest the \ndenial of a visa to his senior advisor, a U.S. diplomat Diana Moxhay \nwho had earlier served at the U.S. Embassy in Miensk. The visit was to \nhave examined the difficult media environment in Belarus, especially in \nlight of the forthcoming presidential elections.\n  I continue to have grave concerns that Presidential Directive No. 8, \nwhich imposes restrictions on assistance from abroad offered to NGOs \nfor democracy building and human rights including election monitoring, \ncould be used to block NGO activities and important OSCE AMGroup \nprojects in Belarus.\n  These and numerous other recent occurrences call into question the \nBelarusian government's willingness to comply with freely undertaken \nOSCE commitments and raise doubts as to whether the Lukashenka regime \nintends to conduct the upcoming elections in a manner consistent with \ninternational standards.\n  As Chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I call upon the Belarusian \nauthorities to conduct a real and public investigation of the \ndisappearances. Furthermore, I urge the Belarusian Government to take \nthe steps necessary in order for the presidential elections to be \nrecognized as free and democratic as outlined by the March 7 Final \nStatement of the Parliamentary Troika. These are: transparency and \ndemocracy in the preparation and implementation of the elections, in \nparticular the process of registration of the candidates, the \ncomposition of electoral commissions and counting of votes; equal \naccess for all candidates to the mass media; refraining from harassment \nof candidates, their families and supporters; and freedom in carrying \nout their work for all those engaged in domestic election observation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/10/senate-section/article/S4816-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy last month. The \nLocal Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to current \nhate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society\n  I would like to detail a heinous crime that occurred September 22, \n2000 in Roanoke, VA. Ronald Edward Gay, 53, allegedly walked into the \nBackstreet Cafe and opened fire on patrons, killing one person and \nwounding six others. Gay told police that he shot seven people in a gay \nbar because he was angry about jokes people made about his last name. \nGay has been charged with first-degree murder in the death of Danny Lee \nOverstreet. Police have said that Gay admits shooting people ``to get \nrid of, in his term, `faggots,' saying that Gay was upset over the fact \nthat people made fun of his last name.''\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe by passing this legislation we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/10/senate-section/article/S4816-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC POWER\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, on April 24, 2001, I voted to report S. \n206, legislation which would repeal the Public Utility Holding Company \nAct, out of the Senate Banking Committee. I did so with strong \nreservations. I have been one of the strongest supporters of public \npower during my service in Congress. Public power has been extremely \nbeneficial for my State. Without the initiative and determination of \nthe municipal utilities and the rural cooperatives in the early part of \nthis century, South Dakota and the neighboring states would not have \nreceived electricity as soon as they did. Since then, these entities \nhave provided South Dakota with reliable electricity and energy \nservices.\n  In addition, I have had a long record of support for public power. \nThis includes authoring an amendment during committee consideration in \nthe House of Representatives that helped stop the sale of the public \npower administrations that House Republicans attempted to sell in 1995. \nMoreover, I have worked closely with the rural electric coops, \nmunicipal owned utilities and rural telephone coops on a number of \nissues. Recently, I was graciously given an award from the South Dakota \nRural Electric Cooperatives and the Congressional Leadership Award from \nthe National Telephone Cooperative Association in recognition of the \nwork we have done together.\n  I have concerns about S. 206 and am not committed to voting for it on \nthe floor. I believe that more needs to be done to ensure that \nsustainable, competitive markets are in place that will keep prices \naffordable and that will discourage undue concentration. I pledge to \nwork with all parties on this effort so that any legislation that is \nconsidered will be fair to public power and its concerns.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/10/senate-section/article/S4816-4", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4816-S4817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CONGRATULATIONS TO THE RUSSIAN JEWISH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

I think it is \nalso important to thank the Chief Rabbi of Moscow, Rabbi Pinchas \nGoldschmidt, the spiritual guide of the Russian Jewish Congress, for \nthe restoration of the Choral Synagogue dome which was destroyed under \nan anti-Semitic decree\n\n[[Page S4817]]\n\nof the pre-revolutionary Moscow government.\n  The Russian Jewish Congress was established in January 1996. In the \nyears since then it has been a stalwart combatant of racism and anti-\nSemitism in Russia establishing 50 branch offices throughout the \nFederation. In 1998 the Congress completed the Holocaust Memorial \nComplex on Poklonnaya Gora in Moscow, the first Holocaust museum in \nRussia. In addition the Russian Jewish Congress arranged for the \nrestitution of funds disbursed to Holocaust survivors in Russia to be \ntax exempt.\n  Finally, I would like to note the work of Mr. Yuri Luzhkov, Mayor of \nMoscow, for his initiative to restore the Choral Synagogue and the \nsurrounding area, including erecting a replica of Jerusalem's Wailing \nWall, symbolizing the suffering of the past as well as the hope for the \nfuture of Russian Jewry.

Mr. President, on April 22, 2001 I delivered a \nstatement before the Warsaw Ghetto Resistance Organization's, WAGRO, \nAnnual Tribute to the Martyrs of the Warsaw Ghetto, at Temple Emanuel \nin New York City. I ask unanimous consent that my remarks be printed in \nthe Record along with the statement delivered on the same day by Mr. \nBenjamin Mead, President of the Warsaw Ghetto Resistance Organization, \nWAGRO.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Mrs. Clinton. Good afternoon.\n       It's an honor for me to be here as your Senator, but more \n     than that, as a fellow human being who is called upon to \n     remember. I am also pleased to be here with the Governor, the \n     Mayor, and my friend and partner, Senator Schumer.\n       I would only add to the strong words that Senator Schumer \n     has just expressed, for most of us, if not all of us. That in \n     addition to the Jewish people and the people of Israel, \n     protecting themselves, the government and the people of the \n     United States must stand with the government and people of \n     Israel in that endeavor. And we will reassert as strongly as \n     possible the need for our government to do that in every way \n     necessary.\n       What brings us here today as we commemorate the six million \n     Jewish martyrs and the 58th Anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto \n     Uprising, is not to relive the pain for those of us who can't \n     possibly imagine. But to honor and respect the survivors and \n     to join together in pledging that the sacrifice and the \n     spirit was never extinguished, never given in vain.\n       I remember being in Warsaw with Ben and Vladka and looking \n     at some of the same places that he referred to, that he saw \n     with horror as a young man, as the Warsaw Ghetto was burned. \n     And as we remember Warsaw and as we do again today in New \n     York. Those young people, primarily young people, who \n     struggled, who understood the central mission of their fight: \n     to live with honor.\n       And what a struggle and what fighters and what an army they \n     were. The Warsaw Ghetto fighters constituted an army of hope. \n     These young soldiers, who smuggled arms, created bunkers, \n     established a system of intelligence and organized their \n     community, they transformed a ghetto, which the Nazis had \n     established as a mere way station to the death camps, into a \n     battlefield.\n       The Warsaw Ghetto fighters turned their vulnerability and \n     disadvantage, into an espirit de corps that shocked their \n     enemy. Let us not forget, it took the Nazi troops longer to \n     put down the ghetto revolt than it took to conquer all of \n     Poland.\n       When I read about or think back or when Ben or Vladka or \n     others tell me of the first hand experience of what those \n     days were like, I imagine the months of organizing and \n     smuggling and hiding, that made that uprising possible. I \n     imagine as though it were a ray of light penetrating the \n     walls of the ghetto. The constant renaissance of spirit and \n     courage that took place under the worst of all possible \n     conditions.\n       And I especially felt that, Vladka, after reading your \n     poignant account of the resistance. I commend that to you, as \n     I do the real life experiences and remembrances that we \n     should be passing on and teaching to our children.\n       Vladka describes the feeling of standing on the brink of an \n     abyss. She conveys the sense of despair that pervades the \n     emptied, ravaged ghetto. She recalls that, ``All roads in the \n     ghetto seemed to lead to Treblinka; there was no escape.''\n       And yet at the moment when all seemed lost, something \n     changes. And she tells the story of the resistance and \n     describes the hidden hope and the gathering storm of courage \n     brewing beneath the ruins. She eloquently writes, ``A spark \n     had been smoldering . . .  in the ghetto. Now it began to \n     glow, slowly, tentatively at first, then ever more \n     fiercely.''\n       As I watched the women climb the steps to light the \n     candles, I thought about that flame. I thought about the \n     flame of determination and yes, even triumph. That flame that \n     today stands as the greatest rebuke, not only to the Nazis, \n     but anti-Semites and evildoers everywhere. That flame did \n     keep hope and courage alive and with it, the will to live.\n       One of my favorite biblical passages comes from the book of \n     Deuteronomy. God has gathered his people together to explain \n     their obligations to him and to each other. And He tells \n     them, ``Before you I have placed life and death, the blessing \n     and the curse. You must choose life, so that you and your \n     descendants will survive.'' Even in the darkest hours of the \n     Holocaust, in the death camps and certainly, in the Warsaw \n     Ghetto that is the choice the martyrs, heroes and survivors \n     made. They chose life.\n       And we today, in some small and totally inadequate way, not \n     only remember them, but come to thank them for reminding us \n     that we must always choose life as well.\n       Thank you and God bless you.\n\n           From Remembrance Must Come Truth and Understanding\n\n       Mr. Mead: This week, as Jews come together to remember, \n     from Jerusalem to Buenos Aires from New York to London, \n     Paris, Toronto, we find ourselves asking the same painful and \n     unanswered questions which have tormented us for the past \n     years: How could the nearly total destruction of European \n     Jewry have happened? How could the world have stood by \n     silently?\n       Why were we left so alone and abandoned?\n       Language does not exist to describe what our people endured \n     in those years. We tremble to think what could happen if we \n     allow a new generation to arise, ignorant of the tragedy \n     which is still shaping the future.\n       The dread we have carried in ourselves from the Holocaust \n     has just been aroused again with the publication of shocking \n     details about the atrocious murder of the 1600 Jews in \n     Jedwabne, Poland.\n       On a single day in July, 1941, a German mobile killing unit \n     had arrived to ``cleanse'' the town of the Jews who made up \n     half of its population. But their ``Neighbors'' decided to \n     take the genocide into their own hands. They went on a \n     murderous rampage, killing Jews in the streets. Then they \n     rounded up a thousand more Jews and burned them alive in a \n     barn. Of the town's Jewish population, only seven people \n     survived who were in hiding.\n       The people who murdered those Jews were not strangers. They \n     were not members of an elite political party committed to \n     racial genocide. Nor were they soldiers taking orders. They \n     were their neighbors.\n       We have good reason to fear that there are many more \n     Jedwabne's which have yet to come to light. We are here to \n     remember each community of Jews, which was destroyed.\n       We must also remember that there were righteous gentiles \n     among the Polish population, and throughout Europe, who \n     risked and even sacrificed their lives to protect Jews. I \n     would not be here myself if it had not been for some of those \n     courageous and heroic people. But how few they were.\n       The realization that so many participated and collaborated \n     with our enemy in the nearly total destruction of European \n     Jewry reminds us that the impossible is possible--that the \n     unthinkable can happen. So many stood silently by and watched \n     as the horrors took place before their eyes, so many blinded \n     themselves from recognizing the barbarity of what they saw, \n     and were deaf to our cries for help.\n       Fifty-eight years ago, during the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, I \n     stood in Krasinski Square outside a Catholic church which \n     faced the ghetto wall, a young Jewish boy posing as a \n     gentile. The air throbbed with the blasts of German artillery \n     bombardment. A carousel turned, music blared, and children \n     and their parents rode as I watched the horrifying sight of \n     the ghetto burning. Its houses were in flames, and its \n     remaining inhabitants jumping out of windows. I could not \n     believe that the people around me actually rejoiced and \n     reveled, declaring, ``the Jews are frying!''\n       It is not for us to grant forgiveness for the crimes of the \n     Holocaust. That can come only from the victims. We cannot \n     forget the Nazis Germans who ordered the ``Final Solution.'' \n     Nor can we forget either the ``willing executioners'' who \n     participated in the systematic genocide, or the by-standers.\n       We are learning and documenting how hatred and greed \n     motivated and aided in the destruction of our people. Germany \n     and individuals throughout Europe profited by using Jewish \n     slave labor for military purposes, and for the production of \n     consumer goods for their home front as well.\n       Last Thursday, the State of Israel observed Yom Ha Shoah--\n     everything came to a standstill. Today we stand in resolute \n     solidarity with our brothers and sisters in Israel, where a \n     large community of Holocaust survivors resides, where Arab \n     violence must come to an end, and where both Jews and Arabs \n     must forge a common peaceful destiny. After the Holocaust, we \n     survivors chose life, not hatred; we chose to struggle for \n     understanding rather than to take revenge. We continue to \n     build new families, new generations. We must do all that is \n     possible to ensure that those who follow us will not face \n     evil, ruthless destruction, as was visited upon us. Thus, we \n     remember the past for the sake of our future.\n\n[[Page S4818]]\n\n       Now, more than at any other time in history, the world's \n     wellbeing depends upon the awareness of humankind's \n     interlocking fate. We Holocaust survivors, for whom there \n     were so many enemies and so few rescuers, are determined to \n     extend our commitment to remembrance, education and \n     documentation by bearing witness to what we experienced as \n     fully as we can.\n       We now stand at a half-century's distance from the events \n     which shaped our lives and reshaped history. We look back and \n     remember. Our memory is a warning, for all people and all \n     time.\n       Let us remember!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/10/senate-section/article/S4818-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF JOHN P. WALTERS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce my strong support \nfor President Bush's selection of John P. Walters as the next Director \nof the Office of National Drug Control Policy.\n  John will bring two decades of drug policy experience in the non-\nprofit sector and in government to his mission as the nation's drug \nczar. His passionate commitment to improving the quality of our society \nby decreasing drug use through effective drug education, treatment, and \ninterdiction programs has already touched the lives of many Americans. \nI trust that the Bush Administration will give him the resources and \nauthority his position requires as a sign of its determination to cut \ndrug use in America and provide the moral leadership essential to this \ntask.\n  Many of John's advocates will note his impressive record of public \nservice in the fields of drug interdiction, treatment, and education. \nJohn distinguished himself during the first Bush Administration as \nDeputy Director for Supply Reduction, Chief of Staff and National \nSecurity Director, and Acting Director of the Office of National Drug \nControl Policy. During the Administration of President Reagan, John \nserved as Chief of Staff and Counselor to the Secretary of Education, \nas well as Assistant to the Secretary, the Secretary's Representative \nto the National Drug Policy Board, and the Secretary's Representative \nto the Domestic Policy Council's Health Policy Working Group.\n  But John's work outside of government is equally admirable. John is \ncurrently serving as President of the Philanthropy Roundtable, a \nnational association of charitable donors who are doing great work in \nour communities. He was previously President of the New Citizenship \nProject, an organization created to promote greater civic participation \nin our national life. John also served on the Council on Crime in \nAmerica, a bipartisan commission on violent crime co-chaired by former \nDrug Czar Bill Bennett and former Attorney General Griffin Bell.\n  In 1988, John created the Madison Center, a non-profit organization \ndedicated to early childhood education and drug abuse prevention. From \n1982 to 1985, he served as Acting Assistant Director and Program \nOfficer in the Division of Education Programs at the National Endowment \nof the Humanities.\n  I am confident John will bring strong leadership to our efforts to \ncut drug use. Not so long ago, Nancy Reagan taught our young people to \n``Just Say No'' to drugs. That was just one demonstration of committed \nleadership at the national level. What Nancy Reagan started was \nfollowed up by engaged national leadership, including Drug Czar Bill \nBennett, who used the bully pulpit to change attitudes, and in the \nprocess helped rescue much of a generation. Drug use declined by more \nthan a third in the wake of the Reagan-Bush effort, and teen drug use, \nthe pipeline to future addiction, dropped even faster.\n\n  In fact, drug use in America has declined by 45 percent since 1985. \nDrug prevention, education, and interdiction can make a tangible \ndifference in the supply and use of drugs in this country. Moral \nleadership is critical. Unfortunately, the overall decline in drug use \nobscures a rise in drug consumption of 15 percent during the last seven \nyears and a near doubling of teen drug use over the past 8 years.\n  John Walters' emphasis on targeting both drug supply and demand \nthrough effective drug treatment programs, and his laudable call for \ncultural leadership in fending off illegal narcotics' assault on our \nblessed youth, will help reverse years of drift in our counter-drug \npolicies. I hope he can also play a useful role in refining our drug \ninterdiction strategy in the Andean region and reforming a drug \ncertification law that does more to hinder than help our drug reduction \nefforts overseas. I look forward to John's leadership on these issues, \nbacked by the personal support of the President, and commend his speedy \nconfirmation to my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/10/senate-section/article/S4818-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, earlier this week, this country \nsuffered a tremendous loss with the passing of Steve Green.\n  Steve was a veteran reporter and editorial columnist and a very dear \nperson. He worked as a journalist for forty years, covering issues \nranging from Congress to national security to social policy.\n  I got to know Steve as he kept a watchful on Congress for the Copley \nNews Service and the San Diego Union-Tribune. He had a quick wit, a \nkeen intellect and a great nose for a story. Above all, he was \nscrupulously fair in his reporting. And he believed that as a \njournalist it was his role in life to help this country realize its \ntremendous potential. How very blessed we are that Stephen used his \ntalent with words and his insight to make us a better, more informed \npeople.\n  With a wink Steve could puncture the biggest ego. He had the uncanny \nability to be skeptical without being cynical. He cared for the people \nhe covered without coddling them. He followed serious issues without \nlosing his sense of humor.\n\n[[Page S4819]]\n\n  Let me read from an article filed by Steve's colleague and Copley \nNews veteran reporter Findlay Lewis:\n\n       Mr. Green's 40-year newspaper career embraced a range of \n     interests and assignments, including a political column that \n     was syndicated around the country. In recent years, his \n     reporting focused on Congress, national security issues and \n     social welfare policy. His work in these and other areas \n     earned him a reputation as a quick study and an incisive \n     writer, who could quickly penetrate to the heart of complex \n     issues.\n       ``Steve Green was a colleague I admired greatly,'' said \n     Herbert G. Klein, editor in chief of Copley Newspapers. ``He \n     thrived on professionalism, which leaves a great legacy for \n     all to follow. He was a man of enormous courage.''\n       A native of Malden, Mass., he graduated from Boston's \n     Northeastern University, where he began his newspaper career. \n     While pursuing his undergraduate degree, Mr. Green filed \n     stories for the wire services and several Boston dailies, and \n     also served as editor of the college newspaper.\n       Former colleagues at the [Washington] Star describe Mr. \n     Green in those years as a tireless reporter, who never \n     allowed himself to be beaten on a story by rivals from the \n     larger and better-staffed Washington Post.\n       ``He had a knack for getting scoops,'' recalled Barbara \n     Cochran, one of his editors at the time and president of the \n     Radio-Television News Directors Association. ``When he had a \n     good story going he would get this grin on his face--when he \n     felt he had the goods.''\n       His tenure at the [Washington] Post was followed by an \n     editing stint at the Miami News before arriving at The San \n     Diego Union in 1979 as state and politics editor. In the \n     latter capacity, Mr. Green directed the Union's coverage of \n     the 1980 presidential election and of the state political \n     campaigns two years later.\n       In 1983, Mr. Green joined the Union's editorial board \n     before returning to Washington in January 1984 to fill the \n     newly created position of managing editor in the Washington \n     Bureau of the Copley News Service.\n       Considered a shrewd student of American politics and \n     foreign affairs by his peers, Mr. Green pursued those \n     interests in a column syndicated by the news service and \n     given frequent prominent display by The Washington Times on \n     its op-ed page.\n       By the early 1990s, Mr. Green had returned to reporting, \n     providing coverage of Congress, a beat that he knew well from \n     his duty with Washington newspapers. He wrote in depth about \n     the financing problems likely to confront the nation's social \n     welfare programs, such as Social Security and Medicare, and \n     also played a role in the bureau's coverage of President \n     Clinton's impeachment crisis in the Congress. He later took \n     over the Pentagon beat before falling ill.\n       Survivors include his wife, Ginny Durrin of Washington, a \n     film maker; two daughters from his first marriage--Jennifer \n     Green of San Jose, and Alison Green of Arlington, Va.; \n     brother, Edward Green of Rockville, Md.; sister, Judy Schoen \n     of Lawrenceville, N.J.; and a granddaughter also survive him.\n\n  Steve Green was a wonderful man, a wonderful journalist and anyone \nwho knew him will miss him deeply.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/10/senate-section/article/S4819-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONGRATULATIONS TO MIKE MILLER\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President I rise today to congratulate Mike \nMiller from Mitchell, SD. Mike, a starting small forward for the \nOrlando Magic, has been selected as the National Basketball \nAssociation, NBA, Rookie of the Year. As the fifth overall draft pick \nfrom the University of Florida, he averaged 11.9 points, 4.0 rebounds \nand 1.7 assists this year. Mike scored in double figures 51 times this \nyear and scored a season-high 28 points against the Milwaukee Bucks on \nMarch 23. Although those statistics are very impressive, perhaps the \nmost impressive part of Mike's rookie season was the leadership role \nMike had to assume with the injury to his teammate Grant Hill. He \nresponded to the challenge of filling the shoes of a perennial NBA all-\nstar and he came to be a trusted go-to, clutch player. Of course he \nshowed this type of poise when he made the game winning shot against \nButler in last year's NCAA tournament.\n  By winning this award, Mike has joined the ranks of the very best to \never play basketball. Wilt Chamberlain, Oscar Robertson, Michael Jordan \nand Shaquille O'Neal are just a few of the basketball luminaries who \nMike joins as winners of this award. Those in South Dakota knew that \nMike was destined for great things. As a three-time all-state selection \nand a two time state champion in South Dakota, Miller has showcased his \nabilities for many years. As a father of three children I know how \nproud Tom and Sheryl Miller must feel today. I join the rest of the \nState of South Dakota in congratulating Mike on his remarkable \naccomplishment and look forward to cheering him on as his career moves \nforward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/10/senate-section/article/S4819-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO THE REVEREND LEON H. SULLIVAN\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to remember the The \nReverend Leon Sullivan, a civil rights leader who spent his life \nbreaking down the barriers of racial prejudice, and building in their \nplace a more just world for all of us. Among his many accomplishments, \nReverend Sullivan crafted the famous Sullivan Principles, which helped \nto topple Apartheid in South Africa, and he founded Opportunities \nInvestment Centers, OICs, which have brought new hope and new job \nskills to the lives of people in my state of Wisconsin, and around the \nworld.\n  With everything he did, Reverend Sullivan was both an idealist and a \npragmatist. He righted the wrong of prejudice not just by calling for \nchange, but by charting the course by which that change could occur. \nLeon Sullivan was born in West Virginia in 1922, where his quest for \nracial justice began in early childhood. He desegregated a restaurant \nin his hometown at the age of ten, and worked his way through graduate \nschool as the first African-American coin-box collector for the Bell \nTelephone Company. Later, as pastor of the Zion Baptist Church in \nPhiladelphia, he and other African-American pastors started the highly \nsuccessful Selective Patronage Program, which boycotted businesses that \nrefused to hire minorities.\n  Then, in 1964, Reverend Sullivan, as always, saw hope and possibility \nin an unlikely place: an old jailhouse in Philadelphia. In his eyes, \nthe structure could be remade into a center for helping the unemployed \nreach their full potential. And so it was, through his characteristic \nhard work and determination. By 1969 about 20,000 minority workers were \nenrolled in OICs around the country. The OIC in Milwaukee, where I \nfirst had the honor of meeting Reverend Sullivan, is the world's \nlargest OIC affiliate, and has helped thousands of people in that \ncommunity achieve economic independence. The Opportunities Investment \nCenter of Greater Milwaukee is a leader, not only in Milwaukee, but \nalso nationally, in the provision of local employment, training and \ncommunity development services. The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee \nestablished the Sullivan Professorship in 1979 to strengthen the ties \nbetween the university and the inner city.\n  OICs are now located in South America, England, Poland and throughout \nAfrica. In the creation of the OIC, and in his myriad other endeavors, \nLeon Sullivan was often in the forefront of social change. His name is \nalso well known for the creation, in 1976, of the ``Sullivan \nPrinciples,'' which outlined a code of conduct by which U.S. \ncorporations operating in apartheid-era South Africa could voluntarily \nchoose to abide.\n  As disinvestment pressures on U.S. companies increased, the Sullivan \nPrinciples helped push companies to support education and community \ndevelopment projects outside the workplace that could help improve the \nquality of life for black South Africans.\n  Reverend Sullivan's legacy lives on in so many ways. In South Africa, \nthanks to the Sullivan Principles, U.S. companies operating in South \nAfrica still make it a priority to devote significant resources to \nphilanthropic programs, including job training and efforts to create \npartnerships with black-owned businesses. In Milwaukee, the OIC has \nsucceeded because Reverend Sullivan believed that by empowering people \nwith new skills, he could change lives, and change the world.\n  And he did change the world, from an old jailhouse in Philadelphia, \nto a Saturday school in Johannesburg, to the Opportunities Investment \nCenter in Milwaukee. Leon Sullivan made enormous contributions--to \nlocal communities throughout the United States, and to our global \ncommunity as well. We remember him today as a great leader who believed \nin a more just world, and set out to build it. We are grateful that he \ndid.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/10/senate-section/article/S4819-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4819-S4820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO BOTTOMLINE TECHNOLOGIES\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

Mr President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to the Reverend Mark J. Hurley, the former bishop of the \nCatholic Diocese of Santa Rosa, California. Bishop Hurley passed away \non Monday February 5, 2001, after undergoing surgery for an aneurysm. \nMark Hurley was one of two priests born to a proud Irish Catholic \nfamily. His brother, Francis Hurley, is the Archbishop of Anchorage, \nAlaska.\n  I had the great fortune to make the acquaintance of Mark Hurley \nseveral years ago while traveling in California. He was a deeply \nreligious man, as you would expect, and a very learned individual and \nthe author of several books. He lectured about the tragedy of abortion \nand wrote extensively about medical and genetic research and individual \nprivacy. But he will be remembered most of all for his extraordinary \nwork as the bishop of the six-county North Coast diocese from 1969-\n1986.\n  Pope Paul VI appointed Mark Hurley second bishop of the Santa Rosa \ndiocese in 1969. Prior to his appointment, he was a teacher and \nadministrator for Catholic high schools in San Francisco, Marin and \nOakland and served as vicar general of the Archdiocese of San \nFrancisco. He would become Santa Rosa's longest-serving bishop since \nthe diocese was created. Most importantly, Bishop Hurley was credited \nwith saving the diocese from financial ruin. When he took office the \ndiocese was over $12 million in debt, including $7 million owed to \nparishes and other organizations within the diocese. By imposing strict \nspending limits, a building moratorium and other cutbacks he was able \nto orchestrate the financial recovery that was so desperately needed.\n  After his tenure, Pope John Paul II rewarded Revernd Hurley's efforts \nby transferring him to the Vatican where he was consular to the Sacred \nCongregation for Catholic Education and a member of the Secretariat for \nNon-Believers. He returned to the United States and retired in San \nFrancisco--the same city in which he was born on December 13, 1919.\n  He was acknowledged by many as an intellectual and a world leader on \nreligious matters, but it was his successful tenure as bishop of Santa \nRosa for which he will be remembered most. Santa Rosa's current bishop, \nDaniel Walsh, said of Mark Hurley, ``I believe his most esteemed role \nand responsibility was that of Bishop of Santa Rosa. He labored here \nfrom November 1969 to April 1986. He made a great impact on the diocese \nand we are all beneficiaries of his ministry here.''\n  Mr. President, with the death of Bishop Hurley the Lord has lost a \ndutiful servant, the Catholic faith has lost a pillar of virtue and our \nnation has lost a loving soul that quietly touched and improved the \nlives of many. Mr. President, I know I speak for all my colleagues in \nextending our condolences to his brother, Bishop Francis Hurley, his \nsister Phyllis Porter of San Francisco and to the rest of his family \nand friends. May he rest in peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/10/senate-section/article/S4820-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO CONCORD HOSPITAL\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a \nmental health community education program, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rural Mental \nHealth Accessibility Act of 2001 with Senators Conrad, Domenici, \nJohnson, Roberts, and Nelson from Nebraska. Like all of the rural \nhealth bills I've worked on with my colleagues in the Senate Rural \nHealth Caucus, I am proud of the bipartisan effort behind this \nimportant legislation.\n  I believe, the Rural Mental Health Accessibility Act of 2001 is \ncrucial because it reflects the unique needs of rural communities to \nimprove access to mental health services.\n  Many people do not seek mental health services because of the stigma \nassociated with mental illnesses. This is especially true in rural \nareas where anonymity is more difficult to obtain. This legislation \ncreates the Mental Health Community Education Grant program, which \npermits states and communities to conduct targeted public education \ncampaigns with particular emphasis on mental illnesses, mental \nretardation, suicide, and substance abuse disorders. This new program \nwill go a long way in reducing the stigmatization and misinformation \nsurrounding mental health issues.\n  More than 75 percent of the 518 nationally designated Mental Health \nProfessional Shortage Areas are located in rural areas and one-fifth of \nall rural counties in the nation have no mental health services of any \nkind. Frontier counties have even more drastic numbers as 95 percent of \nthese remote areas do not have psychiatrists, 68 percent do not have \npsychologists and 78 percent do not have social workers. While I'm \nproud that every county in my home state of Wyoming now has a \npsychologist, there are still several counties that are severely \nunderserved and are designated as a Mental Health Shortage Area.\n  Due to the scarcity of mental health specialists in rural \ncommunities, primary care providers are often the only source of \ntreatment. However, primary care providers do not receive the \nspecialized training necessary to recognize the signs of depression and \nother mental illnesses in their patients. The Rural Mental Health \nAccessibility Act of 2001 authorizes an Interdisciplinary Grant program \nthat will permit universities and other entities to establish \ninterdisciplinary training programs where mental health providers and \nprimary care providers are taught side-by-side in the classroom, with \nclinical training conducted in rural underserved communities. This will \nencourage greater collaboration amongst providers and increase the \nquality of care for rural patients.\n\n  I am particularly concerned that suicide rates among rural children \nand adolescents are higher than in urban areas, especially in western \nand frontier states. Additionally, 20 percent of the nation's elderly \npopulation live in rural areas, but only 9 percent of our nation's \nphysicians practice in rural areas. This bill authorizes $30 million \nfor 20 demonstration projects, equally divided, to provide mental \nhealth services to children and elderly residents of long term care \nfacilities located in mental health shortage areas. These projects will \nalso provide mental illness education and targeted instruction on \ncoping and dealing with the\n\n[[Page S4825]]\n\nstressful experiences of childhood and adolescence or aging.\n  To prepare for further expansion of mental telehealth, this bill \nrequires the Director of the National Institute of Mental Health in \nconsultation with the Director of the Office of Rural Health Policy to \nreport to Congress on the efficacy and effectiveness of mental health \nservices delivered through the utilization of telehealth technologies.\n  In crafting this legislation I and my colleagues worked with numerous \noutside organizations with an interest in mental health issues. As a \nresult of this collaboration, the Rural Mental Health Accessibility Act \nof 2001 is strongly supported by the National Rural Health Association, \nthe National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, the American Psychiatric \nAssociation and the American Psychological Association.\n  I believe this legislation is critically important to the health and \nwell-being of our rural communities. I strongly urge all my colleagues \nto support the rural areas in their states by becoming cosponsors of \nthe Rural Mental Health Accessibility Act of 2001.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and letters of \nendorsement from supporting organizations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 859\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

As the nation's \n     largest organization representing children and adults with \n     severe mental illnesses and their families, NAMI is pleased \n     to support this important legislation. Thank you for your \n     leadership in bringing this bipartisan measure forward.\n       Accessing mental illness treatment and services is a \n     particular challenge for individuals living in isolated rural \n     communities. The challenges related to geographic isolation \n     are too often further compounded by the stigma associated \n     with severe mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar \n     disorder, major depression and severe anxiety disorders. \n     Advances in scientific research and medical treatment for \n     these serious brain disorders have been tremendous in recent \n     years. Your legislation will bring these advances in research \n     and treatment to underserved rural areas. The initiatives \n     contained in the rural Mental Health Accessibility Act--\n     community education to address stigma, training for \n     providers, funding for a telehealth services program--are an \n     important step forward for expanding access to treatment in \n     sparsely populated regions of our country. NAMI looks forward \n     to working with you to ensure passage of this legislation in \n     2001.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this important issue for \n     individuals with severe mental illnesses and their families.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Jacqueline Shannon\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            National Rural Health Association,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 4, 2001.\n     Hon. Craig Thomas,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Thomas: on behalf of the National Rural Health \n     Association, I would like to convey our strong support for \n     the Rural Mental Health Accessibility Act of 2001.\n       While a lack of primary care services in rural and frontier \n     areas has long been acknowledged, the scarcity of rural \n     mental health services has only recently received increased \n     attention. At the end of 1997, 76% of designated mental \n     health professional shortage areas were located in \n     nonmetropolitan areas with a total population of over 30 \n     million Americans.\n       The Rural Mental Health Accessibility Act of 2001 would \n     provide important first steps toward increased access to \n     mental health care services in rural and frontier areas. The \n     stigma associated with having a mental disorder and the lack \n     of anonymity in small rural communities leads to under-\n     diagnosis and under-treatment of mental disorders among rural \n     residents. Your legislation\n\n[[Page S4827]]\n\n     would address this problem by creating a Mental Health \n     Community Education Program aimed at reducing the stigma and \n     misinformation surrounding mental health care.\n       In many rural and frontier communities, primary care \n     providers by necessity are responsible for the delivery of \n     mental health services. Because primary care providers often \n     lack specific mental health training, interdisciplinary \n     collaboration and training would increase access for rural \n     residents to appropriate mental health care treatment. The \n     interdisciplinary training grant program created by your \n     legislation would increase collaboration and sharing of \n     information between mental health providers and primary care \n     providers and improve care for rural residents.\n       The NRHA appreciates your ongoing leadership on rural \n     health issues, and stands ready to work with you on enactment \n     of the Rural Mental Health Accessibility Act of 2001, which \n     would increase the availability of mental health care in \n     rural and frontier areas.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Charlotte Hardt,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleagues \nas a cosponsor of the Rural Mental Health Accessibility Act of 2001. \nThis bipartisan effort would take important steps toward improving \naccess to mental health care in rural America.\n  This issue is particularly important to me and my constituents in \nNorth Dakota. Sadly, as compared to the rest of the United States, \nNorth Dakota has the second-highest suicide rate among children ages 10 \nthrough 14, and the sixth-highest suicide rate among teenagers 15 \nthrough 19 years of age. As a result, over the 10 year period from 1987 \nto 1996, the percentage of deaths due to suicide among North Dakota's \nchildren and teens was double the national average. Clearly, suicide \nmakes a much greater impact on child mortality in North Dakota than it \ndoes in the rest of the United States, and it is a leading cause of \ndeath in this age group.\n  In the vast majority of cases, suicide is directly related to mental \nillness, particularly mood disorders such as depression. Depressive \nsymptoms are remarkably common in North Dakota's school-age children, \nwith one screening finding that 21 percent of students had mild \ndepression and 5 percent had moderate-to-severe depression. This level \nof depression is likely a contributing factor to the 2,600 suicide \nattempts by North Dakota's teens reported in 1999.\n  North Dakota is not alone in this crisis. Rather, it is one of a \ngroup of western and Plains states that have elevated youth suicide \nrates. As agricultural difficulties continue to plague rural areas, the \nstress on families and individuals grows greater with each passing \nseason. Farm financial stress has been related to individual \npsychological problems and an increased risk of mental disorders, \nincluding depression, substance abuse, and suicide.\n  It is important to keep in mind that rural areas have a prevalence of \nmental illness similar to urban areas. The difference is that people in \nrural areas have less access to health care, especially mental health \ncare. Availability of mental health treatment is scarce in remote rural \nareas. Additionally, there remains a strong stigma surrounding mental \nillness and its treatment. The bill we introduce today would address \nboth of these problems: reducing the stigma and increasing access to \nmental health services in rural areas.\n  Our bill addresses the problem of stigma through $50 million in \ngrants designed to support community mental health education programs. \nExisting state and community efforts could be sustained and expanded \nthrough these grants, and new efforts could obtain early support. In \naddition, our bill establishes $30 million in demonstration projects \nfor the provision of mental health education in rural public schools \nand nursing homes using televideoconferencing technology. Rural schools \nand nursing homes would have access to information regarding mental \nillness, information that would reduce stigma, enhance understanding, \nand increase recognition of mental disorders. Importantly, suicide \neducation and prevention are to be key parts of these programs.\n  Other provisions of our bill address the access problem to mental \nhealth services found in the majority of rural communities. Since \nmental health care in rural communities is often provided solely by \nprimary care clinics, our bill establishes a $150 million grant program \nto foster close interaction between mental health professionals and \nprimary care physicians. The grants would be available to public \nuniversities or educational institutions to develop side-by-side \ntraining programs for mental health care professionals and primary care \nproviders. These provider teams would give care to patients in \nunderserved, rural areas without regard to the patient's ability to pay \nfor such services. It is expected that primary care providers \nparticipating in such a training program would develop greater comfort \nand improved coordination with colleagues in treating mental illness in \nrural settings.\n\n  Finally, our bill would increase access to mental health care \nprofessionals by taking advantage of the latest telehealth \ntechnologies. Our bill would fund telehealth demonstration projects \nthat would be focused on providing mental health services to hard-to-\nreach populations, such as children, adolescents, and the elderly. \nThese individuals would be able to receive mental health services in \nconvenient sites, such as rural public schools and nursing homes.\n  It is my hope that the Rural Mental health Accessibility Act will \nstrengthen existing community efforts to fight mental illness while \nencouraging the formation of new and innovative programs. I am pleased \nto join Senator Thomas and others in this effort. I urge my colleagues \nto support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Daschle, \n        Mr. Baucus, and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 860. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the treatment of certain expenses of rural letter carriers; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the U.S. Postal Service provides a vital \nand important communication link for the Nation and the citizens of my \nhome state of Iowa. Rural Letter Carriers play a special role and have \na proud history as an important link in assuring the delivery of our \nmail. Rural Carriers first delivered the mail with their own horses and \nbuggies, later with their own motorcycles, and now in their own cars \nand trucks. They are repsonsible for maintenance and operation of their \nvehicles in all types of weather and road conditions. In the winter, \nsnow and ice is their enemy, while in the spring, the melting snow and \nice causes potholes and washboard roads. In spite of these quite \nadverse conditions, rural letter carriers daily drive over 3 million \nmiles and serve 24 million American families on over 66,000 routes.\n  Although the mission of rural carriers has not changed since the \nhorse and buggy days, the amount of mail they deliver has changed \ndramatically. As the Nation's mail volume has increased throughout the \nyears, the Postal Service is now delivering more than 200 billion \npieces of mail a year. The average carrier delivers about 2,300 pieces \nof mail a day to about 500 addresses.\n  Most recently, e-commerce has changed the type of mail rural carriers \ndeliver. This fact was confirmed in a recent GAO study entitled ``U.S. \nPostal Service: Challenges to Sustaining Performance Improvements \nRemain Formidable on the Brink of the 21st Century,'' dated October 21, \n1999. As this report explains, the Postal Service expects declines in \nits core business, which is essentially letter mail, in the coming \nyears. The growth of e-mail on the Internet, electronic communications, \nand electronic commerce has the potential to substantially affect the \nPost Service's mail volume.\n  First-Class mail has always been the bread and butter of the Postal \nService's revenue, but the amount of revenue from First-Class letters \nis declining. E-commerce is providing the Postal Service with another \nopportunity to increase another part of its business. That's because \nwhat individuals and companies order over the Internet must be \ndelivered, sometimes by the Postal Service and often by rural carriers. \nCurrently, the Postal Service has about 33 percent percent of the \nparcel business. Carriers are not delivering larger volumes of business \nmail, parcels, and priority mail packages. But, more parcel business \nwill mean more cargo capacity will be necessary in postal delivery \nvehicles, especially in\n\n[[Page S4828]]\n\nthose owned and operated by rural letter carriers.\n  When delivering greeting cards or bills, or packages ordered over the \nInternet, Rural Letter Carriers use vehicles they currently purchase, \noperate and maintain. In exchange, they receive a reimbursement from \nthe Postal Service. This reimbursement is called an Equipment \nMaintenance Allowance (EMA). Congress recognizes that providing a \npersonal vehicle to deliver the U.S. Mail is not typical vehicle use. \nSo, when a rural carrier is ready to sell such a vehicle, it's going to \nhave little trade-in value because of the typically high mileage, \nextraorindary wear and tear, and the fact that it is probably right-\nhand drive. Therefore, Congress intended to exempt the EMA allowance \nfrom taxation in 1988 through a specific provision for rural mail \ncarriers in the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988.\n\n  That provision allowed an employee of the U.S. Postal Service who was \ninvolved in the collection and delivery of mail on a rural route, to \ncompute their business use mileage deduction as 150 percent of the \nstandard mileage rate for all business use mileage. As an alternative, \nrural carrier taxpayers could elect to utilize the actual expense \nmethod, business portion of actual operation and maintenance of the \nvehicle, plus depreciation. If EMA exceeded the allowable vehicle \nexpense deductions, the excess was subject to tax. If EMA fell short of \nthe allowable vehicle expenses, a deduction was allowed only to the \nextent that the sum of the shortfall and all other miscellaneous \nitemized deductions exceeded two percent of the taxpayer's adjusted \ngross income.\n  The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 further simplified the tax returns of \nrural letter carriers. That Act permitted the EMA income and expenses \n``to wash,'' so that neither income nor expenses would have to be \nreported on a rural letter carrier's return. That simplified taxes for \napproximately 120,000 taxpayers, but the provision eliminated the \noption of filing the actual expense method for employee business \nvehicle expenses. The lack of this option, combined with the dramatic \nchanges the Internet is having on the mail, specifically on rural \ncarriers and their vehicles, is a problem I believe Congress can and \nmust address.\n  The mail mix is changing and already Postal Service management has, \nunderstandably, encouraged rural carriers to purchase larger right-hand \ndrive vehicles, such as Sports Utility Vehicles, SUVs, to handle the \nincrease in parcel loads. Large SUVs are much more expensive than \ntraditional vehicles, so without the ability to use the actual expense \nmethod and depreciation, rural carriers must use their salaries to \ncover vehicle expenses. Additionally, the Postal Service has placed \n11,000 postal vehicles on rural routes, which means those carriers \nreceive no EMA.\n  These developments have created a situation that is contrary to the \nhistorical congressional intent of using reimbursement to fund the \ngovernment service of delivering mail, and also has created an \ninequitable tax situation for rural carriers. If actual business \nexpenses exceed the EMA, a deduction for those expenses should be \nallowed. To correct this inequity, I am introducing a bill today that \nreinstates the ability of a rural letter carrier to choose between \nusing the actual expense method for computing the deduction allowable \nfor business use of a vehicle, or using the current practice of \ndeducting the reimbursed EMA expenses.\n  Rural carriers perform a necessary and valuable service and face many \nchanges and challenges in this new Internet era. We must make sure that \nthese public servants receive fair and equitable tax treatment as they \nperform their essential role in fulfilling the Postal Service's mandate \nof binding the Nation together.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senators Bingaman, Murkowski, Jeffords, \nConrad, Breaux, Rockefeller, Daschle, Baucus, Lincoln and myself in \nsponsoring this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nrecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 860\n\nBe it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United \n                States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CERTAIN EXPENSES OF RURAL LETTER CARRIERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 162(o) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (relating to treatment of certain reimbursed \n     expenses of rural mail carriers) is amended by redesignating \n     paragraph (2) as paragraph (3) and by inserting after \n     paragraph (1) the following:\n       ``(2) Special rule where expenses exceed reimbursements.--\n     Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(A), if the expenses incurred by \n     an employee for the use of a vehicle in performing services \n     described in paragraph (1) exceed the qualified \n     reimbursements for such expenses, such excess shall be taken \n     into account in computing the miscellaneous itemized \n     deductions of the employee under section 67.''\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--The heading for section 162(o) \n     is amended by striking ``Reimbursed''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2001.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce this important \nlegislation with the Chairman of the Finance Committee and several of \nour colleagues that would reduce the costs incurred by rural letter \ncarriers by allowing them to deduct the actual expenses they incur when \nusing their own vehicle to deliver the mail. For many years, rural \nletter carriers were allowed to calculate their deductible expenses by \nusing either a special formula or keeping track of their costs. In \n1997, Congress simplified the tax treatment for letter carriers, but \ndisallowed them the ability to use the actual expense method (business \nportion of actual operation and maintenance of the vehicle, plus \ndepreciation) for calculating their costs. The result is that many \nletter carriers are unable to account for the real expenses they incur \nwhen using their own vehicle to deliver the mail. This problem has been \nexasperated by the increased need for larger vehicles by rural letter \ncarriers, in part, due to the volume and size of parcels. Road \nconditions and severe weather have also increased vehicle costs because \nof the necessity to have an SUV or four wheel drive vehicle. These \nletter carriers must often purchase special vehicles with right hand \ndrive capabilities which are more expensive than the regular \ncounterpart and may have little to no value when it is time to trade \nthem in for a new one. It is important that these mail carriers are not \nforced to pay these costs out of their own pockets.\n  Although the internet has made the world seem smaller, purchased \ngoods must still be delivered. The benefits of internet purchases in \nremote locations is limited if the purchased item cannot be delivered. \nFor this reason, in rural states, such as New Mexico, these letter \ncarriers play an important role in delivering the majority of the \nstate's mail and parcels. On a daily basis, across the nation rural \nletter carriers drive over 3 million miles delivering mail and parcels \nto over 30 million families. We need to be sure that we have not \ncreated a tax impediment for these dedicated individuals. I look \nforward to working with the Chairman and my colleagues to get this \nlegislation passed this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND:\n  S. 861.

For the past decade, DOD has had a program in \nplace to try to develop and maintain small business vendors as a vital \npart of our Nation's defense industrial base. This program, the Mentor-\nProtege program, has also been a principal source of opportunity for \nsmall business, to offset some of the other Federal procurement \npractices that have squeezed small business out of contracting.\n  Those two goals, the enhanced vendor base and improved opportunity, \nare worth emphasizing before I discuss the specific provisions of this \nbill. Why is small business participation in contracting important?\n  Far too often, small business is seen as just another social or \neconomic development program. In Federal contracting, however, it is \nmuch more than that. Small business is a critical, vital, indispensable \npart of our nation's preparedness for its defense.\n\n[[Page S4829]]\n\n  We have been working here in the Senate toward trying to shore up our \ndefense preparedness. For the better part of a decade, DOD has had more \nand more missions with fewer and fewer resources. Now that we are \ntrying to overcome this neglect with additional funding, we must also \nensure that our economic base is strong, as well. It will do little \ngood to have the money to buy defense-related goods and services if \nthere are no vendors available to sell them.\n  The DOD Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization has an \nexcellent slogan that drives this point home. ``Small Business: A \nReadiness Multiplier.''\n  So, keeping small business involved in contracting is a matter of \nself-interest for our Nation. It is a matter of having the goods, the \nservices, the resources for the warfighter to take into battle.\n  Second, small business must have access to contracting as a matter of \neconomic opportunity. The Government is an enormous customer. It \naverages about $180 to $190 billion worth of contracting every year. No \none else has that kind of presence in the marketplace.\n  If the Government spends the lion's share of its money on a handful \nof large insider corporations, it distorts the marketplace. It tends to \ngive unfair advantage to the winning firms, purely because of the \nGovernment's enormous purchasing power.\n  To avoid harming our economy with that kind of market distortion, the \nsmall business program seeks to disperse Government contracts among a \nvariety of vendors. The small business program is not so much an \nintervention in the economy as it is a dilution of the distortion that \nwould otherwise occur.\n  Unfortunately, over the last decade the Government has increasingly \nsqueezed small business out of contracting. As part of the \n``Reinventing Government'' effort, acquisition has been streamlined.\n  Now, I don't mean to suggest that all acquisition reform has been \nharmful. In fact, burdensome processes and bureaucracy also tend to \ndiscourage small business. Large businesses are more likely to have \nlawyers and contracting staff to wade through the bureaucracy, so \nexcessive emphasis on process tends to crowd out small business.\n  But in some areas we have gone too far. Contract bundling is a good \nexample of this. By rolling several small contracts into large \npackages, the Government has made things simpler and faster for the \ncontracting officers. It is administratively simpler to handle one \nbundled contract than ten smaller ones.\n\n  However, that often crowds out small business. A small business owner \nlooks at one of these huge contracts and says, ``Even if I won that \ncontract, I couldn't carry it out. It's too big, and the requirements \nare too complex.'' So she, and it is often women business owners that \nsuffer, she doesn't even bother to bid.\n  Those two issues, the need to improve opportunity and to strengthen \nour defense vendor base, show why we need to take specific steps to \nrestore small business access to procurement opportunities.\n  Fortunately, we have a successful model to build upon!\n  In the Fiscal 1991 defense authorization bill, the Congress adopted a \nprovision to help small firms develop the technical infrastructure \nnecessary to perform Federal contracts effectively. This pilot program, \nthe Mentor-Protege program, provided for prime contractors either to be \nreimbursed for their added costs in providing technical assistance to \nsmall firms, or to receive credit for accomplishing their \nsubcontracting plans in lieu of reimbursement.\n  Experience under the Mentor-Protege pilot program has been very \npositive. We have learned a lot about what it takes to get small \nbusinesses ready to be serious players in Federal procurement. For \nfirms that are simply delivering a specific order for a product, \nperforming on that delivery order is often simple enough.\n  But longer term, larger contracts are more complex. They require \nsustained effort over many months or years. They require a firm to \ncommit to and achieve intermediate milestones on time. They require the \nfirm to maintain quality assurance standards month in and month out, \nyear in and year out. This can be extraordinarily challenging.\n  Mentor firms have demonstrated that they can help train small protege \nfirms to develop that infrastructure, so necessary to be successful in \nlarger Federal contracts.\n  I have a case history right here that I call to the attention of my \ncolleagues. Scott Ulvi, of Anteon Corporation, has written me about his \nexperience in mentoring, and Ray Lopez, of Engineering Services \nNetwork, has written about the value of the training and assistance he \nreceived from Anteon. I call particular attention to Mr. Lopez' \nexperience in successfully receiving Federal contracts, only to have \nthe reality sink in that he was originally unprepared to carry them \nout. His experience is truly instructive of what small business owners \nencounter daily, and I call his letter to the attention of my \ncolleagues. I will ask unanimous consent that both letters be inserted \ninto the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The bill I am offering today would build upon the experience with the \nDOD program and make it governmentwide. Specifically, the Administrator \nof the Small Business Administration would be charged with developing a \ngovernmentwide program that would provide assistance to all types of \nfirms targeted for special procurement procedures under the Small \nBusiness Act.\n  Now, it would not be possible for the SBA to manage every Mentor-\nProtege relationship in the Federal Government. It would be \nadministratively impossible. Thus, my bill calls for the Administrator \nto develop a core Mentor-Protege program, applicable across the \nGovernment, and to reimburse part of the expenses of agencies that \nagree to adopt the SBA program. Agencies would administer the program \nin-house, but would apply to be reimbursed for up to 50 percent of \ncertain expenses incurred in a program that conforms to the \nAdministrator's guidelines.\n  The expenses to be partially reimbursed are those for which an agency \nreimburses the mentoring firms. Mentor firms can get reimbursed from \nthe contracting office for added costs they incur in providing \ntechnical, managerial, and developmental assistance to the protege \nfirm. Under this bill, up to 50 percent of these costs would then in \nturn be reimbursed to the agency from the SBA. The technical assistance \nprovided through this reimbursable program is far and away the most \nvaluable, as the letter from Scott Ulvi of Anteon Corporation \ndescribes. This program seeks to help agencies put together the \nresources they need to make such reimbursements.\n  This program will help all agencies of the Government strengthen \ntheir vendor base, just as it has for the Department of Defense. It \nwill help small businesses develop their abilities to compete for \nlarger contracts, and the taxpayer will be the ultimate winner as a \nresult of that competition. It also meets one of the Bush \nadministration's goals, as described in the recent budget submission, \nof reducing fragmentation among Federal programs by ensuring a uniform, \ncore Mentor-Protege program across the Government.\n  Nothing succeeds like success. The DOD Mentor-Protege program, \nadopted as a pilot in 1991, has been such a success. Now we need to \nlearn from that success and make it available across the Government. My \nbill proposes to do exactly that and I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of the bill and supporting letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 861\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Bond,\n     Chairman, Small Business Committee, Russell Senator Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senate Bond: Anteon Corporation is a mid-sized \n     Government contractor that has been a Department of Defense \n     Mentor since 1997. This program has enabled Anteon to provide \n     valuable assistance to seven small disadvantaged businesses \n     at critical points in their development. We are committed to \n     the success of our protege firms and the Mentor-Protege \n     Program overall. The responsibility of a mentor is a serious \n     one. We recognize this and have established a separate \n     Mentor-Protege organization dedicated to delivering the \n     highest quality mentoring services. This has been made \n     possible primarily by the reimbursement provided under our \n     Mentor-Protege Agreements within the DOD. The financial \n     incentives from DOD's program have produced significant \n     results in several of Anteon's Mentor-Protege Agreements:\n       Anteon and Engineering Services Network, Inc.--March 2001, \n     DoD Nunn-Perry Award winning team--240% Growth in Revenues in \n     18 months; 178% Growth in employees; 1,281% return on \n     investment (ROI) since March 1999.\n       Anteon and CETECH, Inc.--422% Growth in Revenues in 36 \n     months; 400% Growth in employees; 452% ROI over 36 months.\n       Anteon and DaySys, Inc.--217% improvement in Revenues; 128% \n     improvement in profit from 1999 to 2001 (projected).\n       While each firm is certainly unique, the common denominator \n     for the success realized under this program, is the owner's \n     recognition of the value of a mentor and a willingness to \n     accept assistance. Anteon's success as a mentor comes from \n     our commitment and dedication to our protege and the program. \n     Our experience has taught us that a truly successful program \n     must focus on technical development while effectively \n     balancing the infrastructure support so important to small \n     businesses. Technical development is unquestionably the most \n     important component of this program because it increases the \n     value and competitive posture of the protege to the customer. \n     As a result of the DOD Mentor-Protege Program our proteges \n     have been able to receive technical development in such \n     critical areas as: ISO 9000 Quality Management System \n     Certification; Software Engineering Institute Capability \n     Maturity Model preparation; and other high technology \n     development in the disciplines of engineering and information \n     technology. These important skills produce significant return \n     to the Federal Government in terms of increased efficiency, \n     lower costs and higher project success rates.\n       The success of our program is the direct result of \n     knowledge, experience and a great deal of hard work, work \n     that would not have been possible without the support \n     afforded this program by the DOD, both financially and \n     otherwise. This program is what it is today because of the \n     tremendous support and vision of its leaders past and \n     present. Mr. Robert Neal, Mr. George Schultz, and Ms. Janet \n     Koch have shown relentless commitment to the success of the \n     Mentor-Protege program in DOD and deserve the lion's share of \n     recognition for the program's success. The support of the \n     Congress in reauthorizing this program every year for the \n     last decade speaks volumes of the support received by our \n     Nation's leaders. The support for this program must continue \n     and the program must grow to reach the multitude of deserving \n     small businesses that desperately need the assistance.\n       Mentor firms like Anteon receive considerable business, \n     social and political value from this program. That value \n     translates directly to the bottom line by taking part in the \n     growth and success of our proteges as business partners and \n     through our active participation in the small business \n     community. My mentor once told me that the highest calling of \n     a leader is to develop others--I truly believe that. My \n     reward for being a mentor is the gratification of knowing \n     that my efforts have helped to develop the business leaders \n     of tomorrow.\n       Anteon stands ready to assist the Department of Defense, \n     the Congress and the Federal Government in any way possible \n     to ensure the continued success and growth of this most \n     important program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  M.N. Scott Ulvi,\n     Director, Mentor-Protege Programs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Engineering Services\n\n\n                                                Network, Inc.,\n\n                                    Arlington, VA, April 27, 2001.\n     Senator Christopher S. Bond,\n     Chairman, Small Business Committee, Russell Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: I would like to make you aware of what I \n     consider to be the most important small business program \n     currently available to small businesses whether they be \n     minority owned, veteran owned, woman owned, or otherwise. The \n     Mentor-Protege Program is so important that it transcends \n     personalities, race, creed, color or religion. This program \n     has enabled my firm, Engineering Services Network, Inc., to \n     realize remarkable success in a very short period of time. \n     The Mentor-Protege Program deserves continued and increasing \n     support from the Federal government and our Executive Branch.\n       After my retirement from the U.S. Navy in 1994, I \n     considered a career coaching in the secondary education \n     system, I also had an interest in providing high technology \n     services to my former fellow shipmates and the patriots of \n     this great nation. My wife and I made the decision that the \n     transition to a business life would be easier if I could \n     provide services to the organization that meant so much to me \n     for thirty years. Little did I realize the amount of \n     headwork, legwork, anxiety and mental toughness required to \n     enter the field of business. Our first few years became the \n     toughest challenge of our lives. Although I was technically \n     astute in Command, Control, Communication, Combat Systems and \n     the various operational aspects of the United States Navy, I \n     soon realized that I was ill prepared for the challenges \n     presented by owning your own business. I enjoyed a gift that \n     enabled me to bring in business, but quickly found that we \n     lacked the necessary skills and experience within the firm to \n     manage and grow the work that I'd captured. We needed to \n     learn the basic skills of pricing, contract management, and\n\n[[Page S4832]]\n\n     project management in order to perform successfully. On the \n     business side, the basic and key concepts of developing a \n     solid business plan were foreign to me. The significance and \n     meaning of operating assets and liabilities were as \n     unfamiliar to me as the standard operational procedures of an \n     M1 Tank. I was a warrior, not a businessman.\n       After two years of slowly building the organization to 18 \n     employees, surviving delivery order to delivery order, and \n     continually asking ourselves whether the effort was worth the \n     reward, two pivotal events occurred:\n       1. The company received its 8(a) status from the Small \n     Business Administration.\n       2. We entered into an informal Mentor-Protege relationship \n     with Anteon Corporation.\n       The 8(a) program was instrumental in opening doors to \n     market areas in which our corporation would not normally \n     compete. Our informal mentor protege relationship with Anteon \n     provided us access to training resources that allowed us to \n     understand some of the basic concepts of doing business in \n     the DOD arena. This was an important asset for ESN at such a \n     critical point in our business life.\n       In 1999 ESN and Anteon took the next natural step in \n     advancing our relationship by entering into a formal Mentor-\n     Protege relationship through the Defense Information Systems \n     Agency (DISA). In the short four years since its birth, the \n     company had grown to 28 employees and had limped along with \n     limited and inexperienced infrastructure.\n       The formal Mentor-Protege relationship established a far \n     more structured and focused approach to assisting ESN with \n     its developmental needs. Our mentor introduced to us cutting \n     edge and critical ideas, not only in technology but in our \n     financial and other responsibilities as a company. They have \n     helped ESN to implement effective management controls \n     including budgeting and financial management and are largely \n     responsible for catalyzing ESN's commitment to achieve ISO \n     9000 certification in 2001. Our mentor has helped us build a \n     foundation that will take ESN far into the 21st century. \n     After only two short years in our formal Mentor-Protege \n     relationship with Anteon we employ 87 people, which would not \n     have been possible without our Mentor's help. Our progress \n     was recognized by the Department of Defense in March 2001 \n     with the award of the prestigious Nunn-Perry Award. As a \n     result of the progress we have made, ESN is able to \n     contribute to the Gross National Product and provide \n     outstanding technical and engineering skills to our nation's \n     warfighters. I am now a businessman and former warrior.\n       Without the Mentor-Protege Program there would be no \n     ``ESNs'' to contribute to the important cause of keeping our \n     nation safe and free by protecting our country and our \n     national security. As you can tell from this letter, I fully \n     believe in and support the Mentor-Protege Program, \n     established many years ago by our forward thinking leaders, \n     and willingly respond to any call that will help to continue \n     and improve this program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Raymond F. Lopez, Jr.,\n                                                  President & CEO.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Graham, Mr. Reid, \n        Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 862. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nauthorize appropriations for fiscal years 2002 through 2006 to carry \nout the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``State \nCriminal Alien Assistance Program Reauthorization Act of 2001,'' \nbipartisan legislation that would authorize funds to relieve State and \ncounty governments of the some of the high costs of incarcerating \npersons who enter this country illegally and are later convicted of \nfelonies or multiple misdemeanors. I am pleased to be joined in \nintroducing this bill by Senators Jon Kyl, Bob Graham, John McCain, \nHarry Reid, Jeff Bingaman, and John Kerry.\n  The broad principle on which this bill is based is simple: the \ncontrol of illegal immigration is a Federal responsibility. The Federal \ngovernment's failure to control illegal immigration, and the financial \nand human consequences of this failure are, thus, Federal \nresponsibilities as well.\n  More and more, the fiscal consequences of illegal immigration are \nbeing dealt to the states and local counties. The ``State Criminal \nAlien Assistance Program Reauthorization Act of 2001'' would properly \nvest the fiscal burden of incarcerating illegal immigrants who commit \ncrimes with the Federal government. It would do this by authorizing up \nto $750 million for federal reimbursement to the States and county \ngovernments for the direct costs associated with incarcerating \nundocumented felons.\n  At the initiative of my colleague from Florida, Senator Bob Graham, \nthe Federal government took the first steps in 1994 in addressing these \ncosts by authorizing reimbursements to State and local governments \nthrough the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, SCAAP, established \nby the Violent Crime and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. Since 1997, the \nauthorization level for SCAAP has been $650 million. Last year, the \nprovision authorizing SCAAP funding through the Violent Crime Reduction \nTrust Fund expired. Enactment of the reauthorization legislation would \nconstitute an acknowledgment that these costs, though borne by other \nlevels of government, remain the Federal government's obligation.\n  Winning enactment of this authorization bill is half of what Congress \nneeds to do to provide adequate funding to states and counties for this \nimportant program. Congress also must appropriate an adequate level of \nfunding for SCAAP, and my colleagues and I will be working in the \nAppropriations Committee to assure that this is done.\n  This bill would help all states that are experiencing increasing \ncosts from incarcerating undocumented felons, both low-impact and high-\nimpact states. Even in historically low impact states and counties \nSCAAP funding has been on the rise. SCAAP funding to Fairfax County, \nVirginia, for example, has risen from $14,906 in FY 1999 to $2 million \nin FY 2000. In the County of Outgamie, Wisconsin, SCAAP funding has \njumped from $0 in FY 1999 to $548,458 in FY 2000. In the State of \nMississippi, SCAAP funding rose from $47,171 in FY 1999 to $$780,795 in \nFY 2000.\n  Clearly, these numbers suggest that the increasing costs to states \nand local governments for incarcerating criminal aliens is not just a \nproblem for States on the southwest border but, rather, it is a \nnationwide problem.\n  High impact States, like California, continue to face extraordinary \ncriminal alien incarceration costs. In February 1997, there were 17,904 \nundocumented felons in the California correctional system with \nImmigration and Naturalization Service holds. By the end of February \n2001, there were 20,937 illegal alien inmates in the system with INS \nholds. This year, California taxpayers can expect to spend $576.1 \nmillion to pay for what is, indeed, a Federal obligation. In fact, \n1995, the first year in which SCAAP funding was awarded, California has \nspent a total of $3.8 billion in costs directly associated with \nincarcerating undocumented criminal aliens.\n  Local counties often shoulder a disproportional share of the burden \nof criminal aliens as well. In California, for example, counties are \nresponsible for providing local law enforcement, detention, \nprosecution, probation and indigent defense services. While SCAAP only \nreimburses a portion of the costs directly related to the incarceration \nof undocumented criminal aliens, most other indirect criminal justice \nexpenditures, are fully borne by County taxpayers.\n  Furthermore, while funding levels for SCAAP has remained about the \nsame, the number of local governments applying for the awards has \ngreatly increased over the past few years. In fiscal year 1996, local \ngovernments were reimbursed at a rate of approximately 60 percent for \nthe costs of incarcerating criminal aliens convicted of a felony or two \nor more misdemeanors when only 90 jurisdictions applied for such \nreimbursement. For fiscal year 2000, 361 local jurisdictions applied \nfor SCAAP funding, and reimbursement amounted to less than 40 percent \nof the costs incurred by these jurisdictions.\n  SCAAP funding is especially important to Los Angeles County, which \nhas a larger undocumented immigrant population than any single state \nexcept California, and operates the nation's largest local criminal \njustice system. Los Angeles County also has a violent crime rate which \nis far higher than the national average, and accounts for about one out \nof every 16 violent crimes committed in the United States.\n  A recent study conducted by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's \nDepartment concluded that 23 percent of the County's inmate population \nconsisted of criminal aliens in 2000. The study further found that the \nimpact of criminal aliens on the criminal justice system in Los Angeles \nCounty had doubled from approximately $75 million in 1990 to more than \n$150 million in 1999.\n\n[[Page S4833]]\n\n  There are numerous other jurisdictions in California that are \nsignificantly affected by criminal aliens, including the border \ncounties of San Diego and Imperial. Like Los Angeles County, these \ncounties are not being adequately reimbursed for the costs associated \nwith the incarceration of criminal aliens.\n  In FY 1999 San Diego and Imperial counties spent a combined $56 \nmillion on law enforcement and indirect costs involving illegal aliens, \nwhether criminal or not. These costs include criminal alien \nincarceration, justice and court costs, emergency medical care, \nautopsies, and burials of indigents. SCAAP compensated these counties \nfor only $8 million or 15 percent of these costs which went solely to \nthe cost of incarcerating criminal aliens.\n  Border counties, however, are taking a hit in other areas: San Diego, \nhas to spend 7 percent of its total public safety budget to cover other \ncosts, including indigent defense, court and emergency medical costs; \nImperial County expends 16 percent of its public safety budget to cover \nthese costs.\n  The structure of public financing in California makes it extremely \ndifficult for local governments, especially county governments, to \nincrease their sources of revenue. This problem is greatly exacerbated \nwhen they are also forced to pay for costs related to the Federal \nresponsibility of controlling illegal immigration.\n  Without the ability to raise taxes in any significant way to deal \nwith the costs associated with criminal illegal aliens, counties are \nforced to cut back on other expenditures that would otherwise benefit \nthe legal resident population.\n  It is unfortunate, that at a time when Congress is concerned about \nunfunded mandates, the Administration has seen fit to proposed cutting \nSCAAP funding by almost $300 million for fiscal year 2002. Given the \nincreasing numbers of illegal aliens that California and other states \nincarcerate each year, the Administration's decision in this regard is \nperplexing.\n  If the Administration has its way, States and local counties would \nface an unfair set of choices with real consequences: either cut other \nessential local law enforcement programs and community services, or \nraise local taxes. Neither of these are acceptable options.\n  I am pleased that this legislation has the support of such \norganizations as the National Association of Counties and the \nCalifornia Correctional Peace Officers Association. I ask for unanimous \nconsent that their letters in support of this measure be printed in the \nRecord.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that the letter to President Bush, \nsigned by a bipartisan group of Senators, expressing concern about the \nproposed cuts in SCAAP funding and the text of the bill be printed into \nthe Record.\n  I join my colleagues in introducing the SCAAP reauthorization bill \ntoday in hopes that it will go further to alleviate some of the fiscal \nhardships States and local counties incur when they must take on a \nFederal responsibility. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nmove it through the Senate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows;\n\n                                 S. 862\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

George W. Bush, \n     President of the United States, The White House, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We write out of deep concern over your \n     Fiscal Year 2002 Budget proposal to cut funding for the State \n     Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) by nearly 50 \n     percent. We ask that you reconsider this recommendation and, \n     instead, at a minimum, support funding this program at $750 \n     million. SCAAP is a vitally important program that assists \n     states in recovering the costs associated with the \n     incarceration of criminal aliens. We would strongly oppose \n     cuts in this important program.\n       As you are well aware, control of our nation's borders is \n     under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal government. \n     Unfortunately, Federal efforts are often not adequate to \n     combat illegal immigration. As a consequence, such high \n     impact states as California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, \n     Florida, New York, Washington, Nevada and Massachusetts \n     continue to face extraordinary costs associated with \n     incarcerating criminal aliens. Much of these costs are borne \n     by counties, some of which are among the poorest in the \n     nation and traditionally operate with slim budgets and \n     staffing.\n       By some estimates, the total annual cost to states and \n     county governments exceeds $1.6 billion. In light of this \n     growing burden, your FY 02 budget proposal inexplicably \n     recommends cutting funding for this urgently needed program \n     by $300 million.\n       Unless the Administration supports and Congress \n     appropriates sufficient funds for SCAAP, our state and local \n     governments will continue to unfairly shoulder the burden of \n     bearing the costs of a Federal responsibility. Given the \n     upward trend in incarceration costs, any shortfall in SCAAP \n     funding would force states to draw funds away from other, \n     cash-strapped crime control and prevention programs. In \n     short, the impact on the states would be devastating.\n       Therefore, we urge you to support funding for this \n     important program at a level of $750 million.\n           Sincerely,\n     Dianne Feinstein.\n     Bob Graham.\n     Jon Kyl.\n     Harry Reid.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             National Association of Counties,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 1, 2001.\n     Hon. George W. Bush,\n     The President, The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: The National Association of counties \n     strongly supports the State Criminal Alien Assistance program \n     (SCAAP) at least at its full authorization level. However, we \n     believe the program needs to be funded at a much higher level \n     than proposed, in order to address the serious shortfall in \n     meeting costs to counties.\n       As of today, SCAAP only reimburses counties at a rate of 40 \n     percent of actual expenses. To truly meet our annual costs \n     for the incarceration of alien undocumented criminals, this \n     considerable increase in funding would be needed. Moreover, \n     due to recent changes in the administration of the program, \n     significant costs such as inmate recreation and drug \n     treatment expenses are no longer recognized.\n       While immigration policy is solemnly within federal \n     responsibility, many of the expenses associated with it \n     burden counties and state governments. Costs of providing \n     services for undocumented aliens extend to county hospitals \n     and county health departments and county human service \n     agencies. With the upward trend in incarceration costs, \n     counties depend even more on federal programs such as SCAAP \n     since most of our local correctional agencies are at or near \n     capacity.\n       We strongly urge you to fund SCAAP at least at its full \n     authorization level.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Larry E.

We urge you not to reduce the program but rather \n     secure funding at a minimum of the current appropriation \n     level. As of today, SCAAP only partly reimburses the actual \n     expenses borne by state and local governments.

I appreciate the pro active stance \n     that you have taken to counter the proposed funding cut.\n       We have examined Senate Bill 169 and do not feel that it is \n     a reasonable alternative. Each county and state, regardless \n     of its geographic location, should have equal opportunity to \n     apply for reimbursement using the same formula and criteria.\n       The other questions that you posed regarding the efficiency \n     and effectiveness of the current SCAAP program are on point, \n     but we do not have supporting statistics or documentation \n     readily available. I would simply suggest that adequate \n     funding for the program in its current form is of greatest \n     importance.\n       Thank you again for taking the lead to protect the SCAAP \n     program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Cal Henderson,\n     Sheriff.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           California Correctional\n\n\n                                   Peace Officers Association,\n\n                                      Sacramento, CA, May 9, 2001.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Senate Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing on behalf of the \n     California Correctional Peace Officers Association (CCPOA), \n     representing approximately 28,000 correctional officers and \n     parole agents in the State of California, to express our \n     strong support for legislation you plan to introduce to \n     reauthorize the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program \n     (SCAAP).\n       It is our understanding that your bill would reauthorize \n     the SCAAP program at an increased level of $750,000,000 for \n     fiscal years 2002 through 2006. As you know, this program \n     reimburses state and local governments for the costs of \n     incarcerating criminal aliens. This program pays for the \n     incarceration costs of criminals who have illegally entered \n     or stayed in our country, have committed at least one felony \n     or two misdemeanor crimes while in this country, and are \n     serving time in local jails or state prisons. SCAAP \n     recognizes that the federal government has sole jurisdiction \n     over preventing illegal immigration and should be accountable \n     for the consequences of illegal immigration. States and \n     counties should not have to bear the financial consequences \n     of the federal government's failure to prevent illegal \n     immigration.\n       CCPOA was disappointed that the President's $265 million in \n     funding for this program, a decrease of $299 million from \n     last year, because ``SCAAP reimburses a relatively small \n     portion of states incarceration costs and contributes little \n     to reducing violent crime.'' SCAAP does only reimburse a \n     small portion of states' incarceration costs, which is \n     exactly why appropriations for this program need to be \n     increased, not decreased. The program was never intended to \n     reduce violent crime. It was intended, and has succeeded, in \n     allowing state and local resources to be used on state and \n     local crime issues, rather than federal responsibilities.\n       Again, CCPOA commends you for your leadership in this area. \n     Please contact our Washington representative, Shannon Lahey \n     if we can be of any assistance to you in securing the passage \n     of this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Mike Jimenez,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             National Association of Counties,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 9, 2001.\n     Hon. Diane Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I understand you will be \n     introducing legislation tomorrow that will raise the SCAAP \n     authorization level to $750 million annually. The National \n     Association of Counties (NACo) wishes to go on record in \n     support of your legislation.\n       NACo recognizes that securing the nation's border from \n     illegal immigration is clearly the responsibility of the \n     federal government and that Congress should fully reimburse \n     counties for the costs of incarcerating undocumented aliens.\n       We look forward to working with you on this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Larry E. Naake,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today, with my colleagues Senators \nFeinstein, Kyl, and others, to reauthorize the State Criminal Alien \nAssistance Program, or SCAAP.\n  SCAAP was created as part of the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law \nEnforcement Act because the federal government recognized the \nresponsibility we have to alleviate the impact of immigration policy on \nstate and local governments.\n  The federal government has sole jurisdiction over national \nimmigration policy, and we should do all possible so that our federal \ndecisions and actions do not cause a financial burden on states and \nlocalities.\n  SCAAP is a reimbursement program that sends dollars to our counties \nand states to help offset the costs associated with jailing illegal or \ncriminal aliens.\n  SCAAP also established and now facilitates a process to better \nidentify undocumented criminal aliens and to expedite the transfer of \nillegal aliens from state facilities and county jails to federal \ninstitutions in preparation for deportation, or other federal \nproceedings.\n  Thus, I was greatly concerned looking through the President's budget \nthat this program was cut by more than 50 percent this year.\n  At the moment, SCAAP only provides reimbursement for about 37 cents \nof every dollar a state spends on criminal aliens.\n  We barely cover half the costs as is, and this is before the program \nwas cut in half in this most recent budget.\n  For FY99, state and local governments incurred $1.5 billion in costs \nassociated with criminal aliens which were eligible for reimbursement \nunder the SCAAP program. In FY98, costs to state and local governments \nwere even higher: $1.7 billion. This past year, $1.6 billion was spent \nby state and local governments on these concerns. Yet, we funded the \nprogram at $585 million in each of those years.\n  It's not as much reimbursement as is needed, but the reimbursement \ngives an appropriate and respectful amount of relief to state and local \nlaw enforcement budgets for the benefits they are providing to the \nfederal government.\n  The National Governors Association has the reauthorization of this \nprogram as one of their top priorities for this year. I am certain that \nthey also join me in asking that the program at least maintain funding \nlevels of last year, if not a funding increase that will get them a \nmore fair reimbursement for the dollars they spend.\n  The National Association of Counties supports reauthorization and \nfull funding of SCAAP.\n  They make the point that state and local taxpayers should not have to \nbear the costs of criminal aliens. They are a federal responsibility, \nand should be transferred to federal custody in an expeditious manner.\n  Last year, every state, and more than 220 local governments received \nreimbursement under SCAAP.\n  This affects us all. I do not want to see the federal government \nbacktrack on our obligation to state and local governments in the area \nof immigration.\n  Lastly, statements in the President's budget about this program \nconcern me.\n  Two reasons were given for the cut of $299 million which this program \nendured.\n  The first was that it ``reimburses a relatively small portion of \nstates' incarceration costs.''\n\n[[Page S4835]]\n\n  This statement is true. As I've said, it only reimburses state or \nlocal governments about 37 cents of each dollar they spend on illegal \nimmigrants and criminal aliens.\n  However, this is no reason to further cut the program! If anything, \nif we agree on the premise that immigration policy is a federal \nresponsibility, then it is reason to fully fund the program.\n  I have never seen a rationale given where there is clear federal \njurisdiction, like in this case, that specifically says: we can only \nreimburse states a small portion of what we owe them, so let's cut the \nprogram in half. I fail to see how this accomplishes the most effective \npublic policy.\n  The second reason that is given for the program cut is that it has \ncontributed ``little to reducing violent crime.''\n  Again--on it's face--this statement may be true, although I have not \nbeen able to obtain any supporting documentation that verifies it. But, \nregardless, that was never the Congressional intent of the program.\n  The intent of the program, clearly spelled out in the 1994 Crime \nbill, was to reimburse state, and later on through amendments in 1996, \nlocal governments for the costs they incur because of federal \nimmigration policy. And, secondly, to expedite the transfer of criminal \naliens from the state and local facilities where they may be originally \nheld, into the federal system. I would argue that this, in and of \nitself, does reduce crime.\n  But I find it unfair that a program should be penalized with a 50 \npercent budget cut because it failed to achieve a goal that was never \nintended for the program.\n  Whichever side of the immigration debate you may be on--a more \nexpansive immigration policy, or a more restrictive immigration \npolicy--if you agree with the premise that immigration is the \nresponsibility of and obligation of the federal government--then you \nshould join us in our efforts to reauthorize and fully fund the SCAAP \nprogram.\n  I commend my colleagues, especially Senator Feinstein and Senator \nKyl, for their tireless work on this issue. I look forward to seeing \nthe program reauthorized and funded at an appropriate level this \nCongress.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleagues in introducing this important legislation to reauthorize the \nState Criminal Alien Assistance Program, SCAAP. Our bill will provide a \nhigher level of federal reimbursement to states and localities across \nAmerica whose budgets are disproportionately affected by the costs \nassociated with illegal immigration.\n  The premise of our bill, and of current law governing this type of \nfederal reimbursement to the states, is that controlling illegal \nimmigration is principally the responsibility of the federal \ngovernment, not the states. Local jurisdictions in many areas of our \ncountry, and especially along the southwest border, are burdened by the \nexcessive costs of incarcerating criminal illegal aliens and providing \nemergency medical care to illegal immigrants. In a typical year, the \nfederal government reimburses states and localities for less than 40 \npercent of these costs.\n  Regrettably, the Bush Administration's proposed FY 2002 budget would \nslash SCAAP funding by 50 percent from its current, already-\ninsufficient level of $575 million. The National Governors' Association \nand the National Association of Counties, whose members deal with the \nproblem of illegal immigration on a daily basis, believe we should \nincrease, not cut, funding for this program, and I agree. SCAAP money \nflows to all 50 states and 350 local governments, with more applying \nfor this assistance every year. Rather than forcing local residents to \nsubsidize local jails and hospitals because of our government's failure \nto adequately reimburse them for illegal alien incarceration and \nmedical costs, I hope we will take responsibility as a nation for \nprotecting our borders and covering the contingencies that arise at the \nlocal level when we fail to do so.\n  The State Criminal Alien Assistance Program is an important \nexpression of our government's commitment to border control, and to the \nquality of life of Americans who suffer the costs of illegal \nimmigration. I thank my colleagues for considering the merits of our \nbill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 863. A bill to require Medicare providers to disclose publicly \nstaffing and performance in order to promote improved consumer \ninformation and choice; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Patient Safety \nAct. This legislation would require Medicare providers, such as \nhospitals and clinics, to publicly disclose staffing ratios and \nperformance data in order to promote improved consumer information and \nchoice.\n  As we celebrate National Nurses Week, it is hard to ignore our \nnation's burgeoning nurse staffing crisis. As the baby-boom population \nages and begins to require more nursing care, this shortage will only \nget worse. Inadequate staffing levels not only diminish nurses' working \nconditions, but they affect the quality of care patients receive. A \nrecent report by the Department of Health and Human Services, Nurse \nStaffing and Patient Outcomes in Hospitals, confirmed that the number \nof nurses in a hospital makes a difference in the quality of care \npatients receive. One recommendation that came out of the study was the \nneed to develop a system for routinely monitoring outcomes of hospital \npatient care sensitive to nursing and nurse staffing.\n  The Patient Safety Act would help to accomplish this goal by \nrequiring health care institutions to make public specified information \non staffing levels, mix and patient outcomes. At a minimum, they would \nhave to make public: the number of registered nurses providing direct \ncare; the number of unlicensed personnel utilized to provide direct \npatient care; the average number of patients per registered nurse \nproviding direct patient care; patient mortality rate; incidence of \nadverse patient care incidents; and methods used for determining and \nadjusting staffing levels and patient care needs.\n  In addition, health care institutions would have to make public data \nregarding complaints filed with the state agency, the Health Care \nFinancing Administration (HCFA) or an accrediting agency related to \nMedicare conditions of participation. The agency would then have to \nmake public the results of any investigations or findings related to \nthe complaint.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill that would \nimprove the safety of patients by encouraging higher nurse to patient \nratios, and ultimately help retain nurses in the face of a nationwide \nnursing shortage by encouraging safe work environments.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Liberman, and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 864. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nprovide that aliens who commit acts of torture, extrajudicial killings, \nor other specified atrocities abroad are inadmissible and removable and \nto establish within the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice \nan Office of Special Investigations having responsibilities under that \nAct with respect to all alien participants in war crimes, genocide, and \nthe commission of acts of torture and extrajudicial killings abroad; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce with Senators \nLieberman and Levin the Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act of 2001. I \nintroduced similar legislation in the last Congress, and was pleased \nwhen the proposal garnered bipartisan support in both the House and the \nSenate. The measure was introduced in the last Congress by \nRepresentatives Foley, Franks and Ackerman as H.R. 2642 and H.R. 3058, \nand has again been introduced on April 4, 2001, by Representatives \nFoley and Ackerman as H.R. 1449. Moreover, the legislation passed the \nSenate, on November 5, 1999, as part of the Hatch-Leahy ``Denying Safe \nHavens to Internationals and War Criminals Act,'' S. 1754, but \nunfortunately was not acted on by the House. The problem of human \nrights abusers seeking and obtaining refuge in this country is real, \nand requires an effective response with the legal and enforcement \nchanges proposed in this legislation. The loss last week by the United \nStates of its seat on the U.N. Human Rights Commission is highly \nembarrassing and unfortunate, but by ensuring that our country is no \nsafe haven for human rights abusers, we can lead the world by our \nactions.\n\n[[Page S4836]]\n\n  War criminals and human rights abusers have used loopholes in current \nlaw to enter and remain in this country. I have been appalled that this \ncountry has become a safe haven for those who exercised power in \nforeign countries to terrorize, rape, murder and torture innocent \ncivilians. For example, three Ethiopian refugees proved in an American \ncourt that Kelbessa Negewo, a former senior government official in \nEthiopia engaged in numerous acts of torture and human rights abuses \nagainst them in the late 1970's when they lived in that country. The \ncourt's descriptions of the abuse are chilling, and included whipping a \nnaked woman with a wire for hours and threatening her with death in the \npresence of several men. The court's award of compensatory and punitive \ndamages in the amount of $1,500,000 to the plaintiffs was subsequently \naffirmed by an appellate court. See Abebe-Jira v. Negewo, 72 F.3d 844 \n(11th Cir. 1996). Yet, while Negewo's case was on appeal, the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service granted him citizenship.\n  As Professor William Aceves of California Western School of Law has \nnoted, this case reveals ``a glaring and troubling limitation in \ncurrent immigration law and practice. This case is not unique. Other \naliens who have committed gross human rights violations have also \ngained entry into the United States and been granted immigration \nrelief.'' 20 Mich. J. Int'l.L. at 657. In fact, the Center for Justice \nand Accountability, a San Francisco human rights group, has identified \napproximately sixty suspected human rights violators now living in the \nUnited States.\n  Unfortunately, criminals who wielded machetes and guns against \ninnocent civilians in countries like Haiti, Chile, Yugoslavia and \nRwanda have been able to gain entry to the United States through the \nsame doors that we have opened to deserving refugees. We need to lock \nthat door to those human rights abusers who seek a safe haven in the \nUnited States. To those human rights abusers who are already here, we \nshould promptly show them the door out.\n  We have unwittingly sheltered the oppressors along with the oppressed \nfor too long. We should not let this situation continue. We waited too \nlong after the last world war to focus prosecutorial resources and \nattention on Nazi war criminals who entered this country on false \npretenses, or worse, with the collusion of American intelligence \nagencies. Last month, thousands of declassified CIA documents were made \npublic, as a result of the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act that I was \nproud help enact in 1998, and made clear the extent that United States \nrelied on and helped Nazi war criminals. As Eli M. Rosenbaum, the head \nof the Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations, noted, \n``These files demonstrate that the real winners of the Cold War were \nNazi criminals.'' We should not repeat that mistake for other aliens \nwho engaged in human rights abuses before coming to the United States. \nWe need to focus the attention of our law enforcement investigators to \nprosecute and deport those who have committed atrocities abroad and who \nnow enjoy safe harbor in the United States.\n  When I first introduced this bill in 1999, the Pulitzer prize-winning \npaper, the Rutland Herald, opined on October 31, 1999, that:\n\n       For the U.S. commitment to human rights to mean anything, \n     U.S. policies must be strong and consistent. It is not enough \n     to denounce war crimes in Bosnia and Kosovo or elsewhere and \n     then wink as the perpetrators of torture and mass murder slip \n     across the border to find a home in America.\n\n  The Clinton Administration recognized the deficiencies in our laws. \nOne Clinton Administration witness testified in February, 2000:\n\n       Right now, only three types of human rights abuse could \n     prevent someone from entering or remaining in the United \n     States. The types of prohibited conduct include: (1) \n     genocide; (2) particularly severe violations of religious \n     freedom; and (3) Nazi persecutions. Even these types of \n     conduct are narrowly defined.\n\n  Hearing on H.R. 3058, ``Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act,'' before \nthe Subcomm. on Immigration and Claims of the House Comm. On the \nJudiciary, 106th Cong., 2d Sess., Feb. 17, 2000 (Statement of James E. \nCostello, Associate Deputy Attorney General).\n  The Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act closes these loopholes. The \nImmigration and Nationality Act, INA, currently provides that (i) \nparticipants in Nazi persecutions during the time period from March 23, \n1933 to May 8, 1945, (ii) aliens who engaged in genocide, and (iii) \naliens who committed particularly severe violations of religious \nfreedom, are inadmissable to the United States and deportable. See 8 \nU.S.C. Sec. 1182(a)(2)(G) & (3)(E) and Sec. 1227(a)(4)(D). The Justice \nDepartment's specialized OSI unit is authorized under a 1979 Attorney \nGeneral order to investigate only Nazi war criminals, not any other \nhuman rights abuser. The bill would expand the grounds for \ninadmissibility and deportation to (1) add new bars for aliens who have \nengaged in acts, outside the United States, of ``torture'' and \n``extrajudicial killing'' and (2) remove limitations on the current \nbases for ``genocide'' and ``particularly severe violations of \nreligious freedom.''\n\n  The definitions for the new bases of ``torture'' and ``extrajudicial \nkilling'' are derived from the Torture Victim Protection Act, which \nimplemented the United Nations' ``Convention Against Torture and Other \nCruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.'' These \ndefinitions are therefore already sanctioned by the Congress. The bill \nincorporates the definition of ``torture'' codified in the federal \ncriminal code, 18 U.S.C. Sec.  2340, which prohibits:\n\n       an act committed by a person acting under the color of law \n     specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental \n     pain or suffering (other than pain or suffering incidental to \n     lawful sanctions) upon another person within his custody or \n     physical control. 18 U.S.C. Sec.  2340(1).\n\n  ``Severe mental pain or suffering'' is further defined to mean:\n\n       prolonged mental harm caused by or resulting from: (A) the \n     intentional infliction or threatened infliction of severe \n     physical pain or suffering; (B) the administration or \n     application, or threatened administration or application, of \n     mind-altering substances or other procedures calculated to \n     disrupt profoundly the senses or personality; and (C) the \n     threat of imminent death; or (D) the threat that another \n     person will imminently be subjected to death, severe physical \n     pain or suffering, or the administration or application of \n     mind-altering substances or other procedures calculated to \n     disrupt profoundly the senses or personality. 18 U.S.C. Sec.  \n     2340(2).\n\n  The Torture Victim Protection Act also included a definition for \n``extrajudicial killing.'' Specifically, this law establishes civil \nliability for wrongful death against any person ``who, under actual or \napparent authority, or color of law, of any foreign nation . . . \nsubjects an individual to extrajudicial killing,'' which is defined to \nmean ``a deliberated killing not authorized by a previous judgment \npronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial \nguarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples. \nSuch term, however, does not include any such killing that, under \ninternational law, is lawfully carried out under the authority of a \nforeign nation.''\n  The bill would not only add the new grounds for inadmissibility and \ndeportation, it would expand two of the current grounds. First, the \ncurrent bar to aliens who have ``engaged in genocide'' defines that \nterm by reference to the ``genocide'' definition in the Convention on \nthe Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. 8 U.S.C. \n1182(a)(3)(E)(ii). For clarity and consistency, the bill would \nsubstitute instead the definition in the federal criminal code, 18 \nU.S.C. Sec.  1091(a), which was adopted pursuant to the U.S. \nobligations under the Genocide Convention. The bill would also broaden \nthe reach of the provision to apply not only to those who ``engaged in \ngenocide,'' as in current law, but also to cover any alien who has \nordered, incited, assisted or otherwise participated in genocide. This \nbroader scope will ensure that the genocide provision addresses a more \nappropriate range of levels of complicity.\n  Second, the current bar to aliens who have committed ``particularly \nsevere violations of religious freedom,'' as defined in the \nInternational Religious Freedom Act of 1998, IFRA, limits its \napplication to foreign government officials who engaged in such conduct \nwithin the last 24 months, and also bars from admission the \nindividual's spouse and children, if any. The bill would delete \nreference to prohibited conduct occurring within a 24-month period \nsince this limitation is not consistent with the strong stance of the \nUnited States to promote religious\n\n[[Page S4837]]\n\nfreedom throughout the world. As Professor Aceves opines:\n\n       This provision is unduly restrictive . . . The 24-month \n     time limitation for this prohibition is also unnecessary. A \n     perpetrator of human rights atrocities should not be able to \n     seek absolution by merely waiting two years after the \n     commission of these acts. William J. Aceves, supra, 20 Mich. \n     J. Int'l L., at 683.\n\n  In addition, the bill would remove the current bar to admission for \nthe spouse or children. This is a serious sanction that should not \napply to individuals because of familial relationships that are not \nwithin an individual's control. None of the other grounds relating to \nserious human rights abuse prevent the spouse or child of an abuser \nfrom entering or remaining lawfully in the United States. Moreover, the \npurpose of these amendments is to make those who have participated in \natrocities accountable for their actions. That purpose is not served by \nholding the family members of such individuals accountable for the \noffensive conduct over which they had no control.\n  Changing the law to address the problem of human rights abusers \nseeking entry and remaining in the United States is only part of the \nsolution. We also need effective enforcement. As one expert noted:\n\n       [s]trong institutional mechanisms must be established to \n     implement this proposed legislation. At present, there does \n     not appear to be any agency within the Department of Justice \n     with the specific mandate of identifying, investigating and \n     prosecuting modern day perpetrators of human rights \n     atrocities. The importance of establishing a separate agency \n     for this function can be seen in the experiences of the \n     Office of Special Investigations. 20 Mich. J. Int'l L., at \n     689.\n\n  We need to update OSI's mission to ensure effective enforcement. Our \ncountry has long provided the template and moral leadership for dealing \nwith Nazi war criminals. The Justice Department's specialized unit, \nOSI, which was created to hunt down, prosecute, and remove Nazi war \ncriminals who had slipped into the United States among their victims \nunder the Displaced Persons Act, is an example of effective \nenforcement. Since the OSI's inception in 1979, 61 Nazi persecutors \nhave been stripped of U.S. citizenship, 49 such individuals have been \nremoved from the United States, and more than 150 have been denied \nentry.\n  OSI was created almost 35 years after the end of World War II and it \nremains authorized only to track Nazi war criminals. Specifically, when \nAttorney General Civiletti established OSI within the Criminal Division \nof the Department of Justice, that office was directed to conduct all \n``investigative and litigation activities involving individuals, who \nprior to and during World War II, under the supervision of or in \nassociation with the Nazi government of Germany, its allies, and other \naffiliated [sic] governments, are alleged to have ordered, incited, \nassisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution of any person \nbecause of race, religion, national origin, or political opinion.'' \n(Attorney Gen. Order No. 851-79). The OSI's mission continues to be \nlimited by that Attorney General Order.\n  Little is being done about the new generation of international human \nrights abusers and war criminals living among us, and these delays are \ncostly. As any prosecutor, or, in my case, former prosecutor, knows \ninstinctively, such delays make documentary and testimonial evidence \nmore difficult to obtain. Stale cases are the hardest to make. Since I \nintroduced this bill in the last Congress, there have been no further \ndevelopments in the Kelbessa Negewo case, he still remains living in \nAtlanta. In addition, there has been no action taken on Carlos Eugenio \nVides Casanova, the former head of the Salvadoran National Guard, a \nunit whose members kidnaped, raped, and murdered four American \nchurchwomen during the El Salvadoran civil war. Vides Casanova remains \nin the United States.\n  We should not repeat the mistake of waiting decades before tracking \ndown war criminals and human rights abusers who have settled in this \ncountry. War criminals should find no sanctuary in loopholes in our \ncurrent immigration policies and enforcement. No war criminal should \never come to believe that he is going to find safe harbor in the United \nStates.\n  The Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act would amend the Immigration \nand Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. Sec.  1103, by directing the Attorney \nGeneral to establish an Office of Special Investigations (OSI) within \nthe Department of Justice with authorization to investigate, remove, \ndenaturalize, prosecute or extradite any alien who has participated in \nNazi persecution, torture, extrajudicial killing or genocide abroad. \nNot only would the bill provide statutory authorization for Office of \nSpecial Investigation, it would also expand its jurisdiction to deal \nwith any alien who participated in torture, extrajudicial killing and \ngenocide abroad, not just Nazis.\n  The success of OSI in hunting Nazi war criminals demonstrates the \neffectiveness of centralized resources and expertise in these cases. \nOSI has worked, and it is time to update its mission. The knowledge of \nthe people, politics and pathologies of particular regimes engaged in \ngenocide and human rights abuses is often necessary for effective \nprosecutions of these cases and may best be accomplished by the \nconcentrated efforts of a single office, rather than in piecemeal \nlitigation around the country or in offices that have more diverse \nmissions.\n  The bill directs the Attorney General, in determining what action to \ntake against a human rights abuser seeking entry into or found within \nthe United States, to consider whether a prosecution should be brought \nunder U.S. law or whether the alien should be deported to a country \nwilling to undertake such a prosecution. As one human rights expert has \nnoted:\n\n       The justifiable outrage felt by many when it is discovered \n     that serious human rights abusers have found their way into \n     the United States may lead well-meaning people to call for \n     their immediate expulsion. Such individuals certainly should \n     not be enjoying the good life America has to offer. But when \n     we ask the question ``where should they be?'' the answer is \n     clear: they should be in the dock. That is the essence of \n     accountability, and it should be the central goal of any \n     scheme to penalize human rights abusers.\n\n  Hearing on H.R. 5238, ``Serious Human Rights Abusers Accountability \nAct,'' before the Subcomm. on Immigration and Claims of the House Comm. \nOn the Judiciary, 106th Cong., 2d Sess., Sept. 28, 2000 (Statement of \nElisa Massimino, Director, Washington Office, Lawyers Committee For \nHuman Rights).\n  I appreciate that this part of the legislation has proven \ncontroversial within the Department of Justice, but others have \nconcurred in my judgment that the OSI is an appropriate component of \nthe Department to address the new responsibilities proposed in the \nbill. Professor Aceves, who has studied these matters extensively, has \nconcluded that OSI's ``methodology for pursuing Nazi war criminals can \nbe applied with equal rigor to other perpetrators of human rights \nviolations. As the number of Nazi war criminals inevitably declines, \nthe OSI can begin to enforce U.S. immigration laws against perpetrators \nof genocide and other gross violations of human rights.'' 20 Mich. J. \nInt'l. 657.\n  Similarly, the Rutland Herald noted that the INS has never deported \nan immigrant on the basis of human rights abuses, by contrast to OSI's \nactive deportations of ex-Nazis, while maintaining a list of 60,000 \nsuspected war criminals with the aim of barring them from entry. Based \non this record, the Rutland Herald concluded that the legislation \ncorrectly looks to OSI to carry out the additional responsibilities \ncalled for in the bill, noting that:\n\n       It resolves a turf war between the INS and the OSI in favor \n     of the OSI, which is as it should be. The victims of human \n     rights abuses are often victimized again when, seeking refuge \n     in the United States, they are confronted by the draconian \n     policies of the INS. It's a better idea to give the job of \n     finding war criminals to the office that has shown it knows \n     how to do the job.\n\n  Unquestionably, the need to bring Nazi war criminals to justice \nremains a matter of great importance. Funds would not be diverted from \nthe OSI's current mission. Additional resources are authorized in the \nbill for OSI's expanded duties.\n  Finally, the bill directs the Attorney General to report to the \nJudiciary Committees of the Senate and the House on implementation of \nthe new requirements in the bill, including procedures for referral of \nmatters to OSI, any revisions made to INS forms to reflect amendments \nmade by the bill, and the procedures developed, with adequate due \nprocess protection, to obtain sufficient evidence and determine whether \nan alien is deemed inadmissible under the bill.\n\n[[Page S4838]]\n\n  We must honor and respect the unique experiences of those who were \nvictims in the darkest moment in world history. We may help honor the \nmemories of the victims of the Holocaust by pursuing all human rights \nabusers and war criminals who enter our country. By so doing, the \nUnited States can provide moral leadership and show that we will not \ntolerate perpetrators of genocide, extrajudicial killing and torture, \nleast of all here.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a sectional \nanalysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 864\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Sec. 2340, and extrajudicial killing, as defined in \n     the Torture Victim Protection Act, abroad, as well as expand \n     the scope of the current prohibitions on aliens who have \n     engaged in genocide and particularly severe violations of \n     religious freedom;\n       Amend the INA to make clear that aliens who have committed \n     torture, extrajudicial killing or particularly severe \n     violations of religious freedom abroad do not have ``good \n     moral character'' and cannot qualify to become U.S. citizens \n     or for other immigration benefits;\n       Direct the Attorney General to establish the Office of \n     Special Investigation (OSI) within the Criminal Division and \n     expand the OSI's authority to investigate, remove, \n     denaturalize, prosecute, or extradite any alien who \n     participated in torture, genocide and extrajudicial killing \n     abroad--not just Nazi war criminals; and\n       Direct the Attorney General, in consultation with the INS \n     Commissioner, to report to the Judiciary Committees of the \n     Senate and House of Representatives on implementation of \n     procedures to refer matters to OSI, revise INS forms, and \n     procedures to obtain adequate evidence to develop ``watch \n     lists'' of aliens deemed inadmissible under the bill.\n\n\n                          sec. 1. short title\n\n       The bill may be cited as the ``Anti-Atrocity Alien \n     Deportation Act of 2001.''\n\n\n sec. 2. inadmissibility and removability of aliens who have committed \n            acts of torture or extrajudicial killing abroad\n\n       Currently, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) \n     provides that (i) participants in Nazi persecutions during \n     the time period from March 23, 1933 to May 8, 1945, and (ii) \n     aliens who engaged in genocide, are inadmissible to the \n     United States. See 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1182(a)(3)(E)(i)&(ii). \n     Current law also provides that aliens who have participated \n     in Nazi persecutions or engaged in genocide are deportable. \n     See Sec. 1227(a)(4)(D). The bill would amend these sections \n     of the Immigration and Nationality Act by expanding the \n     grounds for inadmissibility and deportation to cover aliens \n     who have committed, ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise \n     participated in the commission of acts of torture or \n     extrajudicial killing abroad and clarify and expand the scope \n     of the genocide bar.\n       Subsection (a) would first amend the definition of \n     ``genocide'' in clause (ii) of section 212(a)(3) of the INA, \n     8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(E)(ii). Currently, the ground of \n     inadmissibility relating to genocide refers to the definition \n     in the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the \n     Crime of Genocide. Article III of that Convention punishes \n     genocide, the conspiracy to commit genocide, direct and \n     public incitement to commit genocide, attempts to commit \n     genocide, and complicity in genocide. The bill would modify \n     the definition to refer instead to the ``genocide'' \n     definition in section 1091(a) of title 18, United States \n     Code, which was adopted to implement United States \n     obligations under the Convention and also prohibits attempts \n     and conspiracies to commit genocide.\n\n[[Page S4839]]\n\n       Specifically, section 1091(a) defines genocide as \n     ``whoever, whether in time of peace or in time of war, . . . \n     with the specific intent to destroy, in whole or in \n     substantial part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious \n     group as such: (1) kills members of that group; (2) causes \n     serious bodily injury to members of that group; (3) causes \n     the permanent impairment of the mental faculties of members \n     of the group through drugs, torture, or similar techniques; \n     (4) subjects the group to conditions of life that are \n     intended to cause the physical destruction of the group in \n     whole or in part; (5) imposes measures intended to prevent \n     births within the group; or (6) transfers by force children \n     of the group to another group.'' This definition includes \n     genocide by public or private individuals in times of peace \n     or war. While the federal criminal statute is limited to \n     those offenses committed within the United States or \n     offenders who are U.S. nationals, see 18 U.S.C. 1091(d), the \n     grounds for inadmissibility in the bill would apply to such \n     offenses committed outside the United States that would \n     otherwise be a crime if committed within the United States or \n     by a U.S. national.\n       In addition, the bill would broaden the reach of the \n     inadmissibility bar to apply not only to those who ``engaged \n     in genocide,'' as in current law, but also to cover any alien \n     who has ordered, incited, assisted or otherwise participated \n     in genocide abroad. This broader scope will ensure that the \n     genocide provision addresses a more appropriate range of \n     levels of complicity.\n       Second, subsection (a) would add a new clause to 8 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1182(a)(3)(E) that would trigger operation of the \n     inadmissibility ground if an alien has ``committed, ordered, \n     incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in'' acts of \n     torture, as defined in section 2430 of title 18, United \n     States Code, or extrajudicial killings, as defined in section \n     3(a) the Torture Victim Protection Act. The statutory \n     language--``committed, ordered, incited, assisted, or \n     otherwise participated in''--is intended to reach the \n     behavior of persons directly or personally associated with \n     the covered acts. Attempts and conspiracies to commit these \n     crimes are encompassed in the ``otherwise participated in'' \n     language. This language addresses an appropriate range of \n     levels of complicity for which aliens should be held \n     accountable, and has been the subject of extensive judicial \n     interpretation and construction. See Fedorenko v. United \n     States, 449 U.S. 490, 514 (1981); Kalejs v. INS, 10 F. 3d \n     441, 444 (7th Cir. 1993); U.S. v. Schmidt, 923 F. 2d 1253, \n     1257-59 (7th Cir. 1991); Kulle v. INS, 825 F. 2d 1188, 1192 \n     (7th Cir. 1987).\n       The definitions of ``torture'' and ``extrajudicial \n     killing'' are contained in the Torture Victim Protection Act, \n     which served as the implementing legislation when the United \n     States joined the United Nations' ``Convention Against \n     Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \n     Punishment.'' This Convention entered into force with respect \n     to the United States on November 20, 1992 and imposes an \n     affirmative duty on the United States to prosecute torturers \n     within its jurisdiction. The Torture Victim Protection Act \n     provides both criminal liability and civil liability for \n     persons who, acting outside the United States and under \n     actual or apparent authority, or color of law, of any \n     foreign nation, commit torture or extrajudicial killing.\n       The criminal provision passed as part of the Torture Victim \n     Protection Act defines ``torture'' to mean ``an act committed \n     by a person acting under the color of law specifically \n     intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or \n     suffering (other than pain or suffering incidental to lawful \n     sanctions) upon another person within his custody or physical \n     control.'' 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2340(1). ``Severe mental pain or \n     suffering'' is further defined to mean the ``prolonged mental \n     harm caused by or resulting from (A) the international \n     infliction or threatened infliction of severe physical pain \n     or suffering; (B) the administration or application, or \n     threatened administration or application, of mind-altering \n     substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt \n     profoundly the senses or personality; and (C) the threat of \n     imminent death; or (D) the threat that another person will \n     imminently be subjected to death, severe physical pain or \n     suffering, or the administration or application of mind-\n     altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt \n     profoundly the senses or personality.'' 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2340(2).\n       The bill also incorporates the definition of \n     ``extrajudicial killing'' from section 3(a) of the Torture \n     Victim Protection Act. This law establishes civil liability \n     for wrongful death against any person ``who, under actual or \n     apparent authority, or color of law, of any foreign nation . \n     . . subjects an individual to extrajudicial killing,'' which \n     is defined to mean ``a deliberated killing not authorized by \n     a previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted \n     court affording all the judicial guarantees which are \n     recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples. Such term, \n     however, does not include any such killing that, under \n     international law, is lawfully carried out under the \n     authority of a foreign nation.''\n       Both definitions of ``torture'' and ``extrajudicial \n     killing'' require that the alien be acting under color of \n     law. A criminal conviction, criminal charge or a confession \n     are not required for an alien to be inadmissible or removable \n     under the new grounds added in this subsection of the bill.\n       The final paragraph in subsection (a) would modify the \n     subparagraph heading to clarify the expansion of the grounds \n     for in admissibility from ``participation in Nazi persecution \n     or genocide'' to cover ``torture or extrajudicial killing.''\n       Subsection (b) would amend section 237(a)(4)(D) of the INA, \n     8 U.S.C. Sec. 1227(a)(4)(D), which enumerates grounds for \n     deporting aliens who have been admitted into or are present \n     in the United States. The same conduct that would constitute \n     a basis of inadmissibility under subsection (a) is a ground \n     for deportability under this subsection of the bill. Under \n     current law, assisting in Nazi persecution and engaging in \n     genocide are already grounds for deportation. The bill would \n     provide that aliens who have committed any act of torture or \n     extrajudicial killing would also be subject to deportation. \n     In any deportation proceeding, the burden would remain on the \n     government to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the \n     alien's conduct brings the alien within a particular ground \n     of deportation.\n       Subsection (c) regarding the ``effective date'' clearly \n     states that these provisions apply to acts committed before, \n     on, or after the date this legislation is enacted. These \n     provisions apply to all cases after enactment, even where the \n     acts in question occurred or where adjudication procedures \n     within the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) or \n     the Executive Office of Immigration Review were initiated \n     prior to the time of enactment.\n\n\n    SEC. 3. INADMISSIBILITY AND REMOVABILITY OF FOREIGN GOVERNMENT \n    OFFICIALS WHO HAVE COMMITTED PARTICULARLY SEVERE VIOLATIONS OF \n                           RELIGIOUS FREEDOM\n\n       This section of the bill would amend section 212(a)(2)(G) \n     of the INA, 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1182(a)(2)(G), which was added as \n     part of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 \n     (IFRA), to expand the grounds for inadmissibility and \n     removability of aliens who commit particularly severe \n     violations of religious freedom. Current law bars the \n     admission of an individual who, while serving as a foreign \n     government official, was responsible for or directly carried \n     out particularly severe violations of religious freedom \n     within the last 24 months. 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1182(c)(2)(G). The \n     existing provision also bars from admission the individual's \n     spouse and children, if any. ``Particularly severe violations \n     of religious freedom'' is defined in section 3 of IFRA to \n     mean ``systematic, ongoing, egregious violation of religious \n     freedom, including violations such as (a) torture or cruel, \n     inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; (B) prolonged \n     detention without charges; (C) causing the disappearance of \n     persons or clandestine detention of those persons; or (D) \n     other flagrant denial of the right to life, liberty, or the \n     security of persons. While IRFA contains numerous provisions \n     to promote religious freedom and to prevent violations of \n     religious freedom throughout the world, including a wide \n     range of diplomatic sanctions and other formal expressions of \n     disapproval, section 212(a)(2)(G) is the only provision which \n     specifically targets individual abusers.\n       Subsection (a) would delete the 24-month restriction in \n     section 212(a)(2)(G) since it limits the accountability, for \n     purposes of admission, to a two-year period. This limitation \n     is not consistent with the strong stance of the United States \n     to promote religious freedom throughout the world. \n     Individuals who have committed particularly severe violations \n     of religious freedom should be held accountable for their \n     actions and should be admissible to the United States \n     regardless of when the conduct occurred.\n       In addition, this subsection would amend the law to remove \n     the current bar to admission for the spouse or children of a \n     foreign government official who has been involved in \n     particularly severe violations of religious freedom. The bar \n     of inadmissibility is a serious sanction that should not \n     apply to individuals because of familiar relationships that \n     are not within an individual's control. None of the other \n     grounds relating to serious human rights abuse prevent the \n     spouse or child of an abuser from entering or remaining \n     lawfully in the United States. Moreover, the purpose of these \n     amendments is to make those who have participated in \n     atrocities accountable for their actions. That purpose is not \n     served by holding the family members of such individuals \n     accountable for the offensive conduct over which they had no \n     control.\n       Subsection (b) would amend section 237(a)(4) of the INA, 8 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1227(A)(4), which enumerates grounds for \n     deporting aliens who have been admitted into or are present \n     in the United States, to add a new clause (E), which provides \n     for the deportation of aliens described in subsection (a) of \n     the bill.\n       The bill does not change the effective date for this \n     provision set forth in the original IFRA, which applies the \n     operation of the amendment to aliens ``seeking to enter the \n     United States on or after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act.''\n\n\nSEC. 4. BAR TO GOOD MORAL CHARACTER FOR ALIENS WHO HAVE COMMITTED ACTS \n OF TORTURE, EXTRAJUDICIAL KILLINGS, OR SEVERE VIOLATIONS OF RELIGIOUS \n                                FREEDOM.\n\n       This section of the bill would amend section 101(f) of the \n     INA, 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1101(f), which provides the current \n     definition of ``good moral character,'' to make clear that \n     aliens who have committed torture, extrajudicial killing--\n     severe violation of religious freedom abroad do not qualify. \n     Good moral character\n\n[[Page S4840]]\n\n     is a prerequisite for certain forms of immigration relief, \n     including naturalization, cancellation of removal for \n     nonpermanent residents, and voluntary departure at the \n     conclusion of removal proceedings. Aliens who have committed \n     torture or extrajudicial killing, or severe violations of \n     religious freedom abroad cannot establish good moral \n     character. Accordingly, this amendment prevents aliens \n     covered by the amendments made in sections 2 and 3 of the \n     bill from becoming United States citizens or benefitting from \n     cancellation of removal or voluntary departure. Absent such \n     an amendment there is no statutory bar to naturalization for \n     aliens covered by the proposed new grounds for \n     inadmissibility and deportation.\n\n\n     SEC. 5. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE OFFICE OF SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS\n\n       Attorney General Civiletti established OSI in 1979 within \n     the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice, \n     consolidating within it all `investigative and litigation \n     activities involving individuals, who prior to and during \n     World War II, under the supervision of or in association with \n     the Nazi government of Germany, its allies, and other \n     affiliated [sic] governments, are alleged to have ordered, \n     incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the \n     persecution of any person because of race, religion, national \n     origin, or political opinion.'' (Att'y Gen. Order No. 851-\n     79). The OSI's mission continues to be limited by that \n     Attorney General Order.\n       This section would amend the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act, 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1103, by directing the Attorney General to \n     establish an Office of Special Investigations within the \n     Department of Justice with authorization to investigate, \n     remove, denaturalize, prosecute or extradite any alien who \n     has participated in Nazi persecution, genocide, torture or \n     extrajudical killing abroad. This would expand OSI's current \n     authorized mission. In order to fulfill the United States' \n     obligation under the ``Convention Against Torture and Other \n     Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment'' to hold \n     accountable torturers found in this country, the bill \n     expressly directs the Department of Justice to consider the \n     availability of prosecution under United States laws for any \n     conduct that forms the basis for removal and \n     denaturalization. In addition, the Department is directed to \n     consider deportation to foreign jurisdictions that are \n     prepared to undertake such a prosecution. Statutory and \n     regulatory provisions to implement Article 3 of that \n     Convention Against Torture, which prohibits the removal of \n     any person to a country where he or she would be tortured, \n     may also be part of this consideration. Additional funds are \n     authorized for these expanded duties to ensure that OSI \n     fulfills its continuing obligations regarding Nazi war \n     criminals.\n\n\n              SEC. 6. REPORT OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACT\n\n       This section of the bill would direct the Attorney General, \n     in consultations with the INS Commissioner to report within \n     six months on implementation of the Act, including procedures \n     for referral of matters to OSI, any revisions made to INS \n     forms to reflect amendments made by the bill, and the \n     procedures developed, with adequate due process protection, \n     to obtain sufficient evidence and determine whether an alien \n     is deemed inadmissible under the bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 865. A bill to provide small businesses certain protections from \nlitigation excesses and to limit the product liability of \nnonmanufacturer product sellers; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 865\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States civil justice system is inefficient, \n     unpredictable, unfair, costly, and impedes competitiveness in \n     the marketplace for goods, services, business, and employees;\n       (2) the defects in the United States civil justice system \n     have a direct and undesirable effect on interstate commerce \n     by decreasing the availability of goods and services in \n     commerce;\n       (3) there is a need to restore rationality, certainty, and \n     fairness to the legal system;\n       (4) the spiralling costs of litigation and the magnitude \n     and unpredictability of punitive damage awards and \n     noneconomic damage awards have continued unabated for at \n     least the past 30 years;\n       (5) the Supreme Court of the United States has recognized \n     that a punitive damage award can be unconstitutional if the \n     award is grossly excessive in relation to the legitimate \n     interest of the government in the punishment and deterrence \n     of unlawful conduct;\n       (6) just as punitive damage awards can be grossly \n     excessive, so can it be grossly excessive in some \n     circumstances for a party to be held responsible under the \n     doctrine of joint and several liability for damages that \n     party did not cause;\n       (7) as a result of joint and several liability, entities \n     including small businesses are often brought into litigation \n     despite the fact that their conduct may have little or \n     nothing to do with the accident or transaction giving rise to \n     the lawsuit, and may therefore face increased and unjust \n     costs due to the possibility or result of unfair and \n     disproportionate damage awards;\n       (8) the costs imposed by the civil justice system on small \n     businesses are particularly acute, since small businesses \n     often lack the resources to bear those costs and to challenge \n     unwarranted lawsuits;\n       (9) due to high liability costs and unwarranted litigation \n     costs, small businesses face higher costs in purchasing \n     insurance through interstate insurance markets to cover their \n     activities;\n       (10) liability reform for small businesses will promote the \n     free flow of goods and services, lessen burdens on interstate \n     commerce, and decrease litigiousness; and\n       (11) legislation to address these concerns is an \n     appropriate exercise of the powers of Congress under clauses \n     3, 9, and 18 of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of \n     the United States, and the 14th amendment to the Constitution \n     of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 102. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Crime of violence.--The term ``crime of violence'' has \n     the same meaning as in section 16 of title 18, United States \n     Code.\n       (2) Drug.--The term ``drug'' means any controlled substance \n     (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act \n     (21 U.S.C. 802)) that was not legally prescribed for use by \n     the defendant or that was taken by the defendant other than \n     in accordance with the terms of a lawfully issued \n     prescription.\n       (3) Economic loss.--The term ``economic loss'' means any \n     pecuniary loss resulting from harm (including the loss of \n     earnings or other benefits related to employment, medical \n     expense loss, replacement services loss, loss due to death, \n     burial costs, and loss of business or employment \n     opportunities) to the extent recovery for such loss is \n     allowed under applicable State law.\n       (4) Harm.--The term ``harm'' means any physical injury, \n     illness, disease, or death or damage to property.\n       (5) Hate crime.--The term ``hate crime'' means a crime \n     described under section 1(b) of the Hate Crime Statistics Act \n     (28 U.S.C. 534 note).\n       (6) International terrorism.--The term ``international \n     terrorism'' has the same meaning as in section 2331 of title \n     18, United States Code.\n       (7) Noneconomic loss.--The term ``noneconomic loss'' means \n     loss for physical or emotional pain, suffering, \n     inconvenience, physical impairment, mental anguish, \n     disfigurement, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of society and \n     companionship, loss of consortium (other than loss of \n     domestic service), injury to reputation, or any other \n     nonpecuniary loss of any kind or nature.\n       (8) Person.--The term ``person'' means any individual, \n     corporation, company, association, firm, partnership, \n     society, joint stock company, or any other entity (including \n     any governmental entity).\n       (9) Punitive damages.--The term ``punitive damages'' means \n     damages awarded against any person or entity to punish or \n     deter such person, entity, or others from engaging in similar \n     behavior in the future. Such term does not include any civil \n     penalties, fines, or treble damages that are assessed or \n     enforced by an agency of State or Federal government pursuant \n     to a State or Federal statute.\n       (10) Small business.--\n       (A) In general.--The term ``small business'' means any \n     unincorporated business, or any partnership, corporation, \n     association, unit of local government, or organization that \n     has fewer than 25 full-time employees as determined on the \n     date the civil action involving the small business is filed.\n       (B) Calculation of number of employees.--For purposes of \n     subparagraph (A), the number of employees of a subsidiary of \n     a wholly owned corporation includes the employees of--\n\n[[Page S4841]]\n\n       (i) a parent corporation; and\n       (ii) any other subsidiary corporation of that parent \n     corporation.\n       (11) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the several \n     States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto \n     Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern \n     Mariana Islands, any other territory or possession of the \n     United States, or any political subdivision of any such \n     State, commonwealth, territory, or possession.\n\n     SEC. 103. LIMITATION ON PUNITIVE DAMAGES FOR SMALL \n                   BUSINESSES.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--Except as provided in section 105, in \n     any civil action against a small business, punitive damages \n     may, to the extent permitted by applicable Federal or State \n     law, be awarded against the small business only if the \n     claimant establishes by clear and convincing evidence that \n     conduct carried out by that defendant with a conscious, \n     flagrant indifference to the rights or safety of others was \n     the proximate cause of the harm that is the subject of the \n     action.\n       (b) Limitation on Amount.--In any civil action against a \n     small business, punitive damages awarded against a small \n     business shall not exceed the lesser of--\n       (1) three times the total amount awarded to the claimant \n     for economic and noneconomic losses; or\n       (2) $250,000,\n\n     except that the court may make this subsection inapplicable \n     if the court finds that the plaintiff established by clear \n     and convincing evidence that the defendant acted with \n     specific intent to cause the type of harm for which the \n     action was brought.\n       (c) Application by the Court.--The limitation prescribed by \n     this section shall be applied by the court and shall not be \n     disclosed to the jury.\n\n     SEC. 104. LIMITATION ON JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY FOR \n                   NONECONOMIC LOSS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--Except as provided in section 105, in \n     any civil action against a small business, the liability of \n     each defendant that is a small business, or the agent of a \n     small business, for noneconomic loss shall be determined in \n     accordance with subsection (b).\n       (b) Amount of Liability.--\n       (1) In general.--In any civil action described in \n     subsection (a)--\n       (A) each defendant described in that subsection shall be \n     liable only for the amount of noneconomic loss allocated to \n     that defendant in direct proportion to the percentage of \n     responsibility of that defendant (determined in accordance \n     with paragraph (2)) for the harm to the claimant with respect \n     to which that defendant is liable; and\n       (B) the court shall render a separate judgment against each \n     defendant described in that subsection in an amount \n     determined under subparagraph (A).\n       (2) Percentage of responsibility.--For purposes of \n     determining the amount of noneconomic loss allocated to a \n     defendant under this section, the trier of fact shall \n     determine the percentage of responsibility of each person \n     responsible for the harm to the claimant, regardless of \n     whether or not the person is a party to the action.\n\n     SEC. 105. EXCEPTIONS TO LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY.\n\n       The limitations on liability under sections 103 and 104 do \n     not apply--\n       (1) to any defendant whose misconduct--\n       (A) constitutes--\n       (i) a crime of violence;\n       (ii) an act of international terrorism; or\n       (iii) a hate crime;\n       (B) results in liability for damages relating to the injury \n     to, destruction of, loss of, or loss of use of, natural \n     resources described in--\n       (i) section 1002(b)(2)(A) of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 \n     (33 U.S.C. 2702(b)(2)(A)); or\n       (ii) section 107(a)(4)(C) of the Comprehensive \n     Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of \n     1980 (42 U.S.C. 9607(a)(4)(C));\n       (C) involves--\n       (i) a sexual offense, as defined by applicable State law; \n     or\n       (ii) a violation of a Federal or State civil rights law; or\n       (D) occurred at the time the defendant was under the \n     influence (as determined under applicable State law) of \n     intoxicating alcohol or a drug, and the fact that the \n     defendant was under the influence was the cause of any harm \n     alleged by the plaintiff in the subject action; or\n       (2) to any cause of action which is brought under the \n     provisions of title 31, United States Code, relating to false \n     claims (31 U.S.C. 3729 through 3733) or to any other cause of \n     action brought by the United States relating to fraud or \n     false statements.\n\n     SEC. 106. PREEMPTION AND ELECTION OF STATE NONAPPLICABILITY.\n\n       (a) Preemption.--Subject to subsection (b), this title \n     preempts the laws of any State to the extent that State laws \n     are inconsistent with this title.\n       (b) Election of State Regarding Nonapplicability.--This \n     title does not apply to any action in a State court against a \n     small business in which all parties are citizens of the \n     State, if the State enacts a statute--\n       (1) citing the authority of this subsection;\n       (2) declaring the election of such State that this title \n     does not apply as of a date certain to such actions in the \n     State; and\n       (3) containing no other provision.\n\n                TITLE II--PRODUCT SELLER FAIR TREATMENT\n\n     SEC. 201. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) although damage awards in product liability actions may \n     encourage the production of safer products, they may also \n     have a direct effect on interstate commerce and consumers of \n     the United States by increasing the cost of, and decreasing \n     the availability of, products;\n       (2) some of the rules of law governing product liability \n     actions are inconsistent within and among the States, \n     resulting in differences in State laws that may be \n     inequitable with respect to plaintiffs and defendants and may \n     impose burdens on interstate commerce;\n       (3) product liability awards may jeopardize the financial \n     well-being of individuals and industries, particularly the \n     small businesses of the United States;\n       (4) because the product liability laws of a State may have \n     adverse effects on consumers and businesses in many other \n     States, it is appropriate for the Federal Government to enact \n     national, uniform product liability laws that preempt State \n     laws; and\n       (5) under clause 3 of section 8 of article I of the United \n     States Constitution, it is the constitutional role of the \n     Federal Government to remove barriers to interstate commerce.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title, based on the \n     powers of the United States under clause 3 of section 8 of \n     article I of the United States Constitution, are to promote \n     the free flow of goods and services and lessen the burdens on \n     interstate commerce, by--\n       (1) establishing certain uniform legal principles of \n     product liability that provide a fair balance among the \n     interests of all parties in the chain of production, \n     distribution, and use of products; and\n       (2) reducing the unacceptable costs and delays in product \n     liability actions caused by excessive litigation that harms \n     both plaintiffs and defendants.\n\n     SEC. 202. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Alcohol product.--The term ``alcohol product'' includes \n     any product that contains not less than \\1/2\\ of 1 percent of \n     alcohol by volume and is intended for human consumption.\n       (2) Claimant.--The term ``claimant'' means any person who \n     brings an action covered by this title and any person on \n     whose behalf such an action is brought. If such an action is \n     brought through or on behalf of an estate, the term includes \n     the claimant's decedent. If such an action is brought through \n     or on behalf of a minor or incompetent, the term includes the \n     claimant's legal guardian.\n       (3) Commercial loss.--The term ``commercial loss'' means--\n       (A) any loss or damage solely to a product itself;\n       (B) loss relating to a dispute over the value of a product; \n     or\n       (C) consequential economic loss, the recovery of which is \n     governed by applicable State commercial or contract laws that \n     are similar to the Uniform Commercial Code.\n       (4) Compensatory damages.--The term ``compensatory \n     damages'' means damages awarded for economic and noneconomic \n     losses.\n       (5) Dram-shop.--The term ``dram-shop'' means a drinking \n     establishment where alcoholic beverages are sold to be \n     consumed on the premises.\n       (6) Economic loss.--The term ``economic loss'' means any \n     pecuniary loss resulting from harm (including the loss of \n     earnings or other benefits related to employment, medical \n     expense loss, replacement services loss, loss due to death, \n     burial costs, and loss of business or employment \n     opportunities) to the extent recovery for that loss is \n     allowed under applicable State law.\n       (7) Harm.--The term ``harm'' means any physical injury, \n     illness, disease, or death or damage to property caused by a \n     product.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \na national media campaign to reduce and prevent underage drinking in \nthe United States; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today along with my good friend and \ncolleague Senator Warner because I am deeply concerned with the \nunderage drinking occurring in America. Alcohol is currently the number \n1 drug problem for America's youth. Alcohol kills 6.5 times more young \npeople in America than all other illicit drugs combined, Pacific \nInstitute for Research and Evaluation.\n  Drinking under the age of 21 is illegal in all 50 states, yet 10.4 \nmillion kids in America consume alcohol illegally, starting on average \nat just 13 years of age, Health People 2010 Study, Health and Human \nServices. In my own state of Nevada, there has been a 3-percent \nincrease since 1997 in the number of teens who report drinking. \nNevada's youth, ages 12-17 are ranked third nationally in reported \nillicit drug or alcohol dependence and 5th in binge alcohol use, \nNational Household Survey, 1999.\n\n[[Page S4843]]\n\n  Alcohol is a major contributing factor in approximately half of all \nyouth homicides, suicides, motor vehicle crashes, death and disability \nin Nevada, Nevada Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 1999. Alcohol is clearly \nthe drug of choice for teenagers throughout America.\n  Specifically in Nevada, 73 percent of 10th graders have tried \nalcohol, while 33 percent drink monthly. The numbers are even greater \nfor high school seniors, 75 percent and 41 percent respectively, Nevada \nSafe and Drug Free Schools Survey.\n  The purpose of our bill the ``National Media Campaign to Prevent \nUnderage Drinking Act of 2001'' is to establish a national campaign to \nreduce and prevent underage drinking in America and will be conducted \nby the Department of Health and Human Services.\n  This bipartisan legislation will educate America's youth and their \nparents about the dangers and consequences of underage drinking. It \nwill use television, print, radio and Internet advertisements to \nhighlight the facts and the negative consequence of underage drinking.\n  Our bill addresses a need for a comprehensive public education \ncampaign aimed at underage drinking. MADD reports that underage \ndrinking contributes to increased motor vehicle crashes, crime, \nviolence, unprotected sex, teenage pregnancy, sexually transmitted \ndiseases, depression, suicide, alcohol dependence, and other drug use.\n  Young people who begin drinking before age 15 are four times more \nlikely to develop alcohol dependence than those who begin drinking \nafter age 21, National Institutes of Health. The more America's youth \ndrink, the more likely they are to drink and drive, American Academy of \nPediatrics. Over 16,000 Americans were killed in alcohol-related motor \nvehicle crashes in 1999 and nearly one million were injured. In 1999, \nover 2,000 young people between the ages of 15-20 lost their lives to \nalcohol-related crashes.\n  Senator Warner and I have chosen to introduce this legislation today \nbecause Prom season, graduation parties, and summer vacations are all \nrapidly approaching. And that means a lot of parents are focused on the \nthreat of teen drinking, and drunk driving. It is however, important \nthat we do not focus on underage drinking only during these types of \nevents. This is something we should address every day of the year, year \nafter year. That is what this legislation does.\n  Additionally, as you all know Mother's Day is this Sunday. I want to \nask that all of you young Americans consider giving your mother a very \nspecial gift this year. Promise her that you won't drink and drive--at \nyour prom, or at your graduation.\n  This independent campaign should be established and should be \nconducted by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human \nServices. Modeled after the Anti-Drug Campaign, the National Media \nCampaign to Prevent Underage Drinking will be separately funded and \nconducted by the Office of Public Health and Science, in conjunction \nwith the Surgeon General, and will be based on scientific research.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the National Media Campaign \nto Prevent Underage Drinking Act of 2001 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 866\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974, Public Health Service Act, and the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 to require that group and individual health insurance coverage and \ngroup health plans provide coverage and group health plans provide \ncoverage of cancer screening; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to \nrequire health insurance plans to cover screening tests for cancer. \nCongresswomen Carolyn Maloney and Sue Kelly are introducing a companion \nbill in the House today.\n  The bill requires plans to cover screening tests including \nmammography and clinical breast examinations for breast cancer, ``pap'' \ntests and pelvic examinations for gynecological cancers, colorectal \nscreening for colon and rectum cancers, and prostate screening for \nprostate cancer.\n  To address future changes in scientific knowledge and medical \npractice, the bill allows the Secretary to change the requirements upon \nthe Secretary's initiative or upon petition by a private individual or \ngroup. This provision is included because we do not yet have screening \ntests for many cancers, including brain tumors, leukemia Hodgkin's \ndisease, and ovarian, liver and pancreatic cancers. These are often not \ndetected until they produce symptoms, at which point the cancer may \nhave advanced significantly.\n  The American Cancer Society has described ``screening'' as ``the \nsearch for disease in persons who do not have disease or who do not \nrecognize that they have symptoms of disease,'' Screening, as defined \nby the American medical Association, is ``health care services or \nproducts provided to an individual without apparent signs or symptoms \nof an illness, injury, or disease for the purpose of identifying or \nexcluding an undiagnosed illness, disease or condition.'' One of the \nmost common screening procedures is the mammogram, which millions of \nwomen get annually to determine if there are suspicious lesions or \nlumps in their breasts.\n  A major way to reduce the number of cancer-related deaths and to \nincrease survival is to increase cancer screening rates. The American \nCancer Society, (ACS), predicts that 563,100 Americans will die of \ncancer this year. With appropriate screening, one-third of cancer \ndeaths could be prevented, says ACS.\n  Screening is the greatest single tool for finding cancers early. \nCancers found early are cancers that do not grow or metastasize and are \ncancers that can be treated more successfully than those that are found \nlate. Early detection can extend life, reduce treatment, and improve \nthe quality of life. For example, people can have colon cancer long \nbefore they know it. They may not have any symptoms, Patients diagnosed \nby a colon cancer screening have a 90 percent chance of survival while \npatients not diagnosed until symptoms are apparent only have a 8 \npercent change of survival.\n  Screening-accessible cancers, such as cancers of the breast, tongue, \nmouth, colon, rectum, cervix, prostate, testis, and skin, account for \napproximately half of all new cancer cases. If all Americans had \nregular cancer screenings, the five-year survival rate for cancers of \nthe breast, tongue, mouth, colon, rectum, cervix, prostate, testis and \nskin could grow from 81 percent to 95 percent.\n  Screening costs less than treatment. For example, Medicare pays from \n$100 to $400 for a colorectal cancer screening test. The cost of \ntreating colorectal cancer from diagnosis to death costs over $51,000, \naccording to the Institute of Medicine.\n  To put cancer deaths in perspective, the number of Americans that die \neach year from cancer exceeds the total number of Americans lost to all \nwars that we have fought in this century. The American Cancer Society \nsays that over 1.3 million new cancer cases will be diagnosed in the \nU.S. this year.\n  Despite our increasing understanding of cancer, unless we act with \nurgency, the cost to the United States is likely to become unmanageable \nin the next 10-20 years. The incidence rate of cancer in 2010 is \nestimated to increase by 29 percent for new cases, and cancer deaths \nare estimated to increase by 25 percent. Cancer will surpass heart \ndisease as the leading fatal disease in the U.S. by 2010. With our \naging U.S. population, unless we act now to change current cancer \nincidence and death rates, according to the September 1998 report from \nthe Cancer March Research. Task Force, we can expect over 2.0 million \nnew cancer cases and 1.0 million deaths per year by 2025. Listen to \nthese startling statistics: One out of every four deaths in the U.S. is \ncaused by cancer. That more than 1,500 Americans will die each day from \ncancer. The National Cancer Institute estimates that approximately 8.2 \nmillion Americans alive today have a history of cancer. One out of \nevery two men, one out of every three women will be diagnosed with \ncancer at some point in their lifetime.\n\n  One of the tragedies of cancer is that we have tools available which \ncan prevent much unnecessary suffering and death. But cancer must be \nprevented and it must be found early.\n  Deaths from colorectal cancer could be cut in half if most people \nover 50 had refuting screenings, for a disease that claims 56,700 a \nyear.\n  Experts cite several barriers that prevent many Americans from \ngetting cancer screenings. These include a lack of insurance coverage, \ninadequate insurance coverage, inability to pay for screenings, a fear \nof discomfort, and the fact that most of American health care is \ncomplaint drive, not preventive.\n  Insurance coverage is a major factor in whether people have \npreventive screenings. In other words, when screenings are covered by \nplans, people are more likely to get them. In California, screening \nrates for cervical and breast cancer are lower for uninsured women, who \nare less likely to have had a recent screening and more likely to have \ngone longer without being screened than women with coverage. In \nMedicare, for example, a study reported in Public Health Reports in \nOctober 1997, found that Medicare coverage increased the use \nof mammograms.\n\n  According to an University of California-Los Angeles Center for \nHealth Policy Research study from February 1998, in California women \nages 18-64, 63 percent of uninsured women had not had a Pap test during \n1997 versus 40 percent of insured women. Additionally, approximately 67 \npercent of uninsured Californian women ages 30-64 had not had a \nclinical breast examination during 1997, compared to 40 percent for \ninsured women in the same age group.\n  The bill we are introducing, by requiring plans to cover screenings, \ncan reduce death, reduce suffering and reduce costs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  A summary of the bill follows:\n\n       Summary of the Comprehensive Cancer Screening Act of 2001\n\n       Requires private health insurance plans to cover cancer \n     screenings consistent with professionally-developed and \n     recognized medical guidelines, specifically: mammograms and \n     clinical breast examinations (for breast cancer); ``pap'' \n     tests and pelvic examinations (for gynecological cancers); \n     colorectal screening (for colon and rectum cancers); prostate \n     cancer screening (for prostate cancers).\n       Authorizes the U.S. Secretary of Health an Human Services \n     by regulation to modify or update the coverage requirements \n     to reflect advances in medical practice or new scientific \n     knowledge, for all cancers as screenings are developed, based \n     on the Secretary's own initiative or upon the petition of an \n     individual or organization.\n\n[[Page S4845]]\n\n       Prohibits health insurance plans from: denying eligibility \n     for the purpose of avoiding the requirements of the bill; \n     providing monetary payments to encourage individuals to \n     accept less than the minimum protections available; \n     penalizing or reducing reimbursement because a provider \n     provides care consistent with these requirements; providing \n     incentives to a provider to encourage the provider to provide \n     care inconsistent with the requirements.\n       Requires plans to provide subscribers full information on \n     the extent of coverage, including covered benefits, cost-\n     sharing requirements, and the extent of choice of providers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire (for himself and Mr. Inhofe):\n  S. 870. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nadditional tax incentives for public-private partnerships in financing \nof highway, mass transit, high speed rail, and intermodal transfer \nfacilities projects, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce \nthe Multi Modal Transportation Financing Act. The United States faces a \nsignificant shortfall in funding for our highway and bridge \ninfrastructure needs. It is incumbent upon us to look at new and \ninnovative ways to make the most of limited resources to address these \nsignificant needs. This bill will lift the existing restrictions on \ntax-exempt bond financing for public agencies seeking greater private \nsector participation in a variety of transportation projects. This \nfinancing tool will serve to manage congestion, build more \ntransportation options, and encourage technological innovation.\n  This bill will adjust the tax code in order to remove a barrier to \nneeded transportation infrastructure investment. Under current Federal \ntax law, highways built by government can be financed through the use \nof tax exempt bonds--but those built by the private sector are not \neligible to use this valuable financing tool, even though this tool is \ncurrently available to the private sector for the construction of \nseaports, airports and other public infrastructure facilities. Tax-\nexempt bonds can reduce interest rates as much as two percentage points \nbelow rates on comparable taxable bond issues and can reduce financing \ncosts by 20-25 percent. While this has been a huge benefit for other \ninfrastructure needs, once the private sector seeks to participate in \nthe development or operation of a government-owned highway or intercity \nrail project, tax-exempt financing is no longer available. Yet these \ntransportation projects costing from $100 million to over $1 billion \nare rendered financially infeasible when subjected to taxable bond \nfinancing, forcing the private sector out of transportation project \ndevelopment.\n  As a result, public/private partnerships in the provision of highway \nfacilities are unlikely to materialize, despite the potential \nefficiencies in design, construction, and operation offered by such \narrangements. By depending solely on public sector tax-exempt \nfinancing, some projects will not be built at all, while projects that \nstill get built are done so much later, at higher cost, \ngreater inefficiency and public sector risk.\n\n  Private sector participation in these transportation projects will \nprovide access to new expertise, greater operating efficiencies, new \nsources of investment capital, and private sector risk sharing. This \npractice of private sector involvement has already been successfully \nimplemented in a number of other countries. U.S. companies are \ncurrently investing billions of dollars in foreign infrastructure \nprojects that are not subject to the United States tax code \ndiscrimination against similar private investment. Increasing the \nprivate sector's role in these countries has offered opportunities for \nconstruction cost savings and more efficient operation.\n  The effort to enhance private sector participation began a few years \nago by my predecessor as chairman of the environment and Public Works \nCommittee, Senator John Chafee. While his legislation did pass the \nSenate, it never made it to the President's desk. It is time for this \nlong over due private sector encouragement to become law.\n  I hope that this bill can be one in a series of new approaches to \nmeeting our substantial transportation infrastructure needs and will be \none of the approaches that will help us find more efficient methods to \ndesign, build, and operate the nation's transportation infrastructure. \nWe should begin by knocking down barriers that discourage the private \nsector from unleashing its full resources to help build this nation's \ntransportation network. I urge my colleague to join me in supporting \nthis vital legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 870\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a concurrent \nresolution calling attention to global e-commerce, a trade issue of \ngreat economic interest to this country. My esteemed colleague Senator \nMcCain and I have drafted this legislation to express the sense of \nCongress on the importance of promoting global electronic commerce. In \nthe House of Representatives, Congresswoman Tauscher and Congressman \nDreier will introduce the very same legislation. I am honored to be \njoined on this resolution by these three knowledgeable and \ndistinguished leaders on technology issues.\n  Our economic landscape is undergoing a fundamental transformation. We \nare transitioning into a ``new economy'', a rapidly evolving, global \nmarketplace that is governed by new rules and driven largely by new \nforces. Those new forces include information technology and the \nInternet. We all recognize that we are witnessing an electronic \nrevolution. There is no shortage of statistics to prove what we are \nseeing all around us. According to a recent U.S. Department of Commerce \nreport, approximately one third of the U.S. economic growth in the past \nfew years has come from information technologies. Worldwide, there are \nmore than 200 countries connected to the Internet today. That is up \nfrom 165 in 1996 and just eight in 1988. Today, more than 300 million \npeople worldwide, more than half in North America, use the Internet. \nWith Internet traffic continuing to double every 100 days, by 2005 more \nthan one billion people will be connected. Importantly, more than \nthree-quarters of them will be outside North America.\n  This digital age brought about by the Internet and information \ntechnology is opening new markets and growth opportunities for all \ntypes of U.S. companies in every corner of this vast country. ``Digital \nTrade'', including cross-border e-commerce transactions for\n\n[[Page S4847]]\n\ngoods and services, global business relationships enabled by electronic \nnetworks, and the goods and services that enable those transactions and \nrelationships, can help new companies to emerge and existing companies \nto flourish. For example, according to a study done for Cisco by the \nGartner Group, Europe's Internet economy is set to grow twenty-fold, \nfrom $53 billion in 1999 to $1.2 trillion in 2004. That growth presents \nreal opportunities for millions of American companies and consumers.\n  We are seeing industry adjust to these new realities and seize these \nnew opportunities. Last year, 60 percent of B-to-B companies were \nbuilding globalized websites designed to reach audiences in many \ncountries and across different cultures. By 2004, the level of \nglobalization is expected to reach 80 percent. Those companies that \nchoose not to globalize their websites project foreign revenue earnings \nthis year of 12 percent. Those companies that do globalize expect \nforeign revenue earnings of 35 percent.\n  To make this picture of the digital age more real, let me move closer \nto home and talk about one of my favorite New Economy companies, \nCoastal Tool. Coastal Tool is a small family-owned business with 12 \nemployees. They are in a very traditional industry, hardware retail, in \na very traditional location, the heart of New England, West Hartford, \nCT. However, Coastal Tool is anything but traditional in its approach \nto business. Early on in the Internet revolution, Coastal Tool adopted \ninformation technology to improve its sales and marketing efforts. They \nunderstood back in the early 1990s what Alan Greenspan speaks of today \nwhen he testifies here on the Hill that there is a strong and \nundeniable link between the adoption of information technology, rising \nproductivity, and increasing economic prosperity. Today, this small \ncompany does 20-30 percent of its business online, selling hand and \npower tools like biscuit joiners and disc grinders. It generates 15-20 \npercent of its revenue from online sales to overseas customers and is \nnow exporting to more than 50 countries. By competing online and \noverseas, Coastal Tool, on the web at www.Coastaltool.com, is a true \nnew economy success story and but one example of how an exponential \ngrowth in information technology adoption and e-commerce are reshaping \nthe global economy.\n  But the global economy and digital trade also present us with \nchallenges. While there are few if any technology barriers to global e-\ncommerce, there are actual and potential policy and political barriers. \nFor example, according to a recent survey of chief information officers \nacross the country by CIO Magazine, approximately one third of the \nrespondents feel that current barriers limit their company's ability to \nconduct e-commerce across international borders. Clearly this is a \nreality and a challenge with which we here in Washington must be \nconcerned. That is why we have worked closely with industry, including \nthe Information Technology Association of American, the Business \nSoftware Alliance, The Information Technology Industry Council, and the \nSemiconductor Industry Association, to draft this very important \nresolution.\n  This resolution describes the incredible opportunity that global e-\ncommerce presents for the U.S. It calls on the Administration to make \ndigital trade, the promotion of cross-border e-commerce, a high \npriority on its trade agenda and to work in good faith with our trading \npartners to encourage its continued growth. More specifically, it \nstates that the U.S. should encourage members of the World Trade \nOrganization to promote the development of infrastructures necessary \nfor e-commerce and refrain from adopting measures that would constitute \nactual or potential trade barriers to electronic commerce. The \nresolution does not take policy positions on specific issues of \ninternational trade. It does take a first step in making sure that \nglobal e-commerce is an issue and an opportunity with which members of \nthis body are familiar.\n  I respectfully urge all of my colleagues here in the Senate to show \ntheir support for U.S. consumer and commercial interests by joining \nSenator McCain and me in sponsoring and working to pass this very \nimportant concurrent resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/10/senate-section/article/S4847-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 37--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS ON \nTHE IMPORTANCE OF PROMOTING ELECTRONIC COMMERCE, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, and Mr. McCain) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 37\n\n       Whereas information technologies have spurred additional \n     growth and efficiency for the United States economy, given \n     consumers greater power and choice, and created new \n     opportunities for entrepreneurs;\n       Whereas an estimated 60 percent of American businesses are \n     involved in electronic commerce;\n       Whereas in 2000, business-to-consumer electronic \n     transactions were estimated at $61,000,000,000 and business-\n     to-business electronic transactions at nearly \n     $200,000,000,000;\n       Whereas economists have shown that the higher a nation's \n     Internet usage, the faster cross-border trade increases, \n     especially among developing nations;\n       Whereas cross-border electronic commerce represents a \n     revolutionary form of international trade, one that will \n     provide new opportunities for growth, efficiency, and rising \n     living standards in the United States and overseas;\n       Whereas in this era of policy development for global \n     electronic commerce, certain policy measures could push \n     Internet users into localized regions of the World Wide Web, \n     significantly reducing long-term opportunities for growth and \n     development;\n       Whereas the current World Trade Organization (WTO) trade \n     rules, including (the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, \n     the General Agreement on Trade in Services, and the Agreement \n     on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property) apply to \n     e-commerce;\n       Whereas the growth of international trade via global \n     electronic commerce could be stunted by domestic policies or \n     measures that have the effect of reducing or eliminating \n     competition; and\n       Whereas carefully coordinated agreements that ensure open \n     markets, broad access, competition, and limited burdens on e-\n     commerce can facilitate growth and development in the United \n     States and overseas: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade \n     Representative should make the promotion of cross-border \n     trade via electronic commerce a high priority;\n       (2) the United States should work in good faith with our \n     trading partners to develop a cross-border trade regime that \n     promotes the continued growth of electronic commerce and \n     advances the interests of Internet buyers and sellers in \n     different countries; and\n       (3) the United States should encourage members of the World \n     Trade Organization to--\n       (A) promote the development of infrastructures that are \n     necessary to conduct e-commerce;\n       (B) promote the development of trade in goods and services \n     via e-commerce;\n       (C) ensure that products delivered electronically receive \n     the most beneficial treatment available under trade \n     agreements relating to similar products that are delivered \n     physically, including market access and nondiscriminatory \n     treatment; and\n       (D) refrain from adopting measures that would constitute \n     actual or potential trade barriers to electronic commerce, \n     and ensure that all other measures are predictable and \n     transparent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/10/senate-section/article/S4847-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4847-S4848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      committee on armed services\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, Dan Bryant is well-known to many of us, \nespecially those of us serving on the Judiciary Committee. We knew him \nfirst as an able member of the House Judiciary Committee staff and \nthrough his work as the Chief Counsel of the House Judiciary \nCommittee's Subcommittee on Crime, working under Chairman Hyde and \nCongressman McCollum. At his confirmation hearing, Mr. Hyde, Mr. \nConyers, Senator Biden and both Senators from Virginia all came to \ntestify on his behalf.\n  Mr. Bryant is respectful of the Senate and, I feel, all Senators. We \nare already working with Mr. Bryant as he is serving as a consultant to \nthe Department while his nomination is pending. His history and current \nwork give me every reason to support his nomination. I look forward to \nworking with him in the days and months ahead. His is a most demanding \njob. I congratulate Dan and his family on his confirmation by the U.S. \nSenate.\n\n\n                      nomination of larry thompson\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee unanimously reported the nomination of Larry Thompson to be \nDeputy Attorney General to the Senate. The Deputy Attorney General is \nnumber two in command at the Department of Justice and plays a key role \nas a top advisor to the Attorney General. Former Deputies include \nWilliam Rogers and Byron White, Nicholas Katzenbach and Warren \nChristopher, Harold Tyler, Jamie Gorelick and Eric Holder.\n  The Deputy has traditionally assumed responsibility for the day-to-\nday operations of the Department. The Deputy often has direct oversight \nof a number of divisions and units within the Department, including the \nFBI and those with criminal jurisdiction. The Deputy position may \nassume even greater significance in this Administration, since we have \nnot seen any indication that there will be an Associate Attorney \nGeneral with whom the Deputy might share those leadership \nresponsibilities.\n  I know that Mr. Thompson is a strong conservative. I have confidence \nthat we can work together. I believe him when he indicates that he is \nprepared to have a candid and responsive relationship with the \nJudiciary Committee, including the Democratic Senators.\n  I know that Mr. Thompson served previously as a United States \nAttorney and that he appreciates, as those of us who served as local \nprosecutors understand, where the front lines of law enforcement are, \nhow they must be supported and that partisan politics have no business \nin law enforcement.\n  It was not only his testimony but the testimony of Mr. Thompson's \nhome State Senators that I found compelling. Both Senator Cleland and \nSenator Miller came to the Committee and gave strong support. Those \nstatements matter. His home state Senators would be expected to know \nhim best and it was clear to me that they know him well.\n  Senator Cleland's endorsement was without reservation. Senator Miller \ndescribed him as a consummate professional, quiet yet strong, someone \nwho exercises enormous common sense, a person of great substance and \nlittle ego, and one who will put principle ahead of politics every \ntime. We were assured that Larry Thompson comes with no agenda, and \nwill base every decision on what is right, not what is popular or \npolitically expedient.\n  With those kinds of endorsements and assurances, and with the frank \nexchanges that we had during the course of the hearing process, I feel \nconfident in supporting the nomination of Larry Thompson. I look \nforward to working with Mr. Thompson in the days ahead and I \ncongratulate Mr. Thompson and his entire family on his confirmation by \nthe U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/10/senate-section/article/S4849-4", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
