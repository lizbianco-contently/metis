The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, with the legislation now before us, I am \nvery happy to see the chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the \nChamber today to lead the discussion on this legislation. This is an \nextremely important piece of legislation. We have waited a long time to \nget to its consideration.\n  I have been somewhat disappointed when I read already in this week's \nnewspapers that the minority has indicated they have scores of \nnonrelevant, nongermane amendments they are going to file on this piece \nof legislation. This is code word for they are going to do everything \nthey can to stop the legislation from passing.\n  That is unfortunate because this legislation, which is commonly \nreferred to as the hate crimes bill, has that name because that is what \nit is about. It is about people with hatred doing criminal acts.\n  Senate consideration of this legislation is much needed and is long \noverdue. It demonstrates, once again, the change that has taken place \nin this body since Senator Leahy began the chairmanship of the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  But for his advocacy, we would not be in this spot; we would not be \nwhere we are now.\n  The chairman of the committee is here, and he has heard me say this \non many occasions. We have done such a good job in the Judiciary \nCommittee. I say ``we'' because the committee doing well reflects on \nall of us. When I think of what we have gone through in this committee, \nwe had the terrorist acts of September 11, which caused us to focus \nimmediately on antiterrorism legislation, which we passed. People \ncomplained because we didn't move that legislation fast enough. Now \npeople are writing that it was one of the best things that happened in \nthis Congress in a long time because the Judiciary Committee slowed us \ndown. We didn't run pell-mell into this legislation but walked \ndeliberately into it. As a result, we have good legislation, not the \nleast of which has a sunset provision in it. If we went too far in any \nway, it sunsetted.\n  The work that has been done by the Judiciary Committee has been \nexcellent. Not only do we have the situation with the terrorist acts of \nSeptember 11 and all the work of the committee as it related thereto, \nbut we had an anthrax attack in Senator Daschle's office. Senator Leahy \nreceived anthrax-laden materials. From whom, we do not know. It was \nenough that it closed down one of the office buildings where 50 \nSenators have their offices. That slowed us down.\n  In spite of that and many other obstacles we have had to overcome, we \nhave moved forward on judges. I don't know the exact number now, but I \nbelieve it is 57 confirmed judges. I believe there is half a dozen or \nso on the calendar, a tremendous amount of work. We are doing the very \nbest we can in that regard.\n  This hate crimes legislation is another example of the work the \nJudiciary Committee has done and the Senate has done generally since \nSenator Jeffords joined our caucus.\n  The present Federal criminal statutes do not respond to hate crimes \nmotivated by a person's gender, sexual orientation, or disability. In \nfact, one of these characteristics, sexual orientation, is the third \nleading motivation behind hate crimes. Everyone has heard of some of \nthe most egregious cases of hate crimes: Matthew Shepard, a very frail \nyoung man, was a gay student at the University of Wyoming. He was \nseverely beaten, left for dead hanging on a fence post. There is no \nquestion this happened because he was gay.\n  James Byrd, Jr., an African American man, was brutally murdered, \nhooked up behind a pickup truck and dragged to his death.\n  These tragedies are not isolated. I indicated on this Senate floor \nearlier this week some of the incidents that have happened in Nevada \nbecause of hatred.\n  In Carson City, our State capital, somebody set a black family's home \non fire and wrote the words ``white power'' and other racial slurs at \nthe scene of the crime.\n  Vandals spray-painted a swastika and other graffiti on religious \nstatues at a Roman Catholic Church in Henderson, NV, where I went to \nhigh school.\n  A black family in Las Vegas found a cross burning on their lawn.\n  Two white men attacked two Muslims with a baseball bat. They beat the \nMuslims with a baseball bat outside a mosque where they had gone to \nworship.\n  Condemning these acts is one thing, but we must legislate against \nthese acts, and that is what this legislation is all about. These types \nof crimes not only infringe on victims' rights, they erode people's \nsense of security and self-worth.\n  Our country was founded on the principle of liberty and justice for \nall, and that means all. When perpetrators of hate crime target anyone, \nthey really are targeting all of us and the principles that make our \ndiverse Nation what it is.\n  We must move forward and continue our program of diversity in this \ncountry. This legislation will help us do that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I compliment the assistant majority leader. \nSeeing Senator Reid on the floor--along with Senator Reed of Rhode \nIsland and Senator Akaka it seems only minutes ago I saw all of them as \nwe were finishing up at 1 o'clock this morning. I appreciate the \ncourtesy of the Senator from Hawaii in letting me speak at this point.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from Nevada did an enormous job in \ngetting the emergency supplemental appropriations bill passed last \nnight. I have told the distinguished senior Senator from Nevada many \ntimes that he has patience this Irish-Italian American probably never \ncould have. But it was his patience, his persistence, and also the \ngreat credibility he has on both sides of the aisle, and the great \nrespect of Senators in both parties, that made it possible for him to \nget that bill passed. Had he not carefully worked with Senator Byrd, \nSenator Stevens, and all the others to get that through, we would still \nbe on the floor and we would not be anywhere near passage. I compliment \nmy friend from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a couple \nhousekeeping matters? I will finish quickly. I say to my friend, I have \nnever ever corrected my friend on the floor, but I will this morning. \nWe did not finish that last night. We finished it this morning.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Right. How time flies when you are having fun.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3807\n\n    (Purpose: To provide reliable officers, technology, education, \n       community prosecutors, and training in our neighborhoods)\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nSenator Biden.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Biden, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 3807.\n\n  Mr. REID.

The cloture motion having been \npresented under rule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the \nmotion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on Calendar No. \n     103, S. 625, a bill to provide Federal assistance to states \n     and local jurisdictions to prosecute hate crimes:\n         Hillary Clinton, Harry Reid, Jack Reed, Russell Feingold, \n           Richard Durbin, Edward Kennedy, Evan Bayh, Charles\n\n[[Page S5247]]\n\n           Schumer, Debbie Stabenow, Maria Cantwell, Daniel Akaka, \n           Ron Wyden, Carl Levin, Daniel Inouye, Joseph Lieberman, \n           E. Benjamin Nelson, Byron Dorgan, Patrick Leahy.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in the Washington Times there is a report \ntoday that says:\n\n  A senior Republican leadership aide said there are 40 to 50 \nRepublican ideas under consideration as possible amendments----\n\n  To this legislation----\n\n     ranging from an alternative hate-crimes bill to tax policy, \n     national security and social issues. Republicans also are \n     considering making permanent tax credits for teachers and \n     relief from the ``marriage penalty'' in the tax code.\n       ``You might even see an amendment that's a complete \n     substitute to the defense authorization bill.''\n\n  I am not going to belabor the point other than to say those are, I \nrepeat, code words to kill this bill, and we are going to do everything \nwe can on this side of the aisle to make sure that hate crimes in \nAmerica are prosecuted and the people against whom there is hatred are \nnot persecuted.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I agree with the senior Senator from \nNevada. Everybody is going to say they are against hate crimes. Nobody \nis going to say they are for hate crimes. But if we are against them, \nthen let's pass laws that give our law enforcement officers the teeth \nto go after hate crimes. Let's not go through the fiction of trying to \namend this bill to death so nothing comes forward. We cannot let \neveryone say they are against hate crimes while some do their best to \nkill the hate crimes legislation.\n  Violent crimes motivated by prejudice and hate are tragedies that \ndemand our attention. These crimes mar our history, from the lynchings \nthat haunted our race relations for more than a century to the recent \nwell-publicized slayings of Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr.\n  Since September 11, we have seen a disturbing increase in crimes \ncommitted against Arabs, Muslims, and those of South Asian descent. In \nother words, hate has been a persistent threat to the public safety, \nespecially the safety of minority group members.\n  I am not naive enough to think we can outlaw hate, but we can make \noutlaws of those who commit hate crimes. We can do a lot more to \nprotect Americans from these crimes, and to ensure equal rights for all \nour citizens.\n  The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act will do just that. It will \nprovide a measure of protection for those who fear the violent \nconsequences of prejudice. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this \nlegislation. I am also proud that it is one of the first bills I moved \nthrough the Judiciary Committee after I became chairman. I had the \nopportunity as a new chairman to set priorities by deciding what would \nbe on the agenda. I made sure this was one of the first bills the \nCommittee considered.\n  I am grateful to Senators Kennedy, Specter, and Smith for their \nbipartisan leadership on this issue. Unfortunately, the bipartisanship \nsurrounding this bill is not universal, as the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nevada has already pointed out. Republicans objected before the \nMemorial Day recess to a unanimous consent request that would have \nallowed this bill to come to the full Senate for debate. I wish they \nhad allowed it to do that. It could have been passed by now.\n  I am glad we can now begin debate. I am honored to open the debate. \nSenator Kennedy is with his family today following a long-time family \ncommitment, but he will join us on Monday to debate this important \nbill.\n  The hate crimes legislation we consider today strengthens current law \nby making it easier for Federal authorities to investigate and \nprosecute crimes based on race, color, religion, and national \norigin. Victims will no longer have to be engaged in a narrow range of \nactivities, such as serving as a juror, to be protected under Federal \nlaw. In other words, if a criminal commits a hate crime against a \njuror, he or she can be prosecuted under Federal law. But if a criminal \ncommits the same hate crime against the same victim, while the victim \nis conducting private business, that criminal is immune from \nprosecution under Federal hate crimes law.\n\n  This bill also focuses the attention and resources of the Federal \nGovernment on the problem of hate crimes committed against people \nbecause of their sexual orientation, or their gender, or their \ndisability. That is an important step.\n  Now, opponents of this legislation like to say that ``all crimes are \nhate crimes.'' But everyone in this Chamber agrees that some crimes are \nmore serious--and more deserving of Federal attention--than others. We \nhave repeatedly increased the Federal role in fighting crime over the \nlast decades, from the hijacking of airplanes to carjacking to drug \ncrimes. So the question we face today is whether crimes motivated by \nprejudice deserve greater Federal attention than the limited amount \nthey receive today. I believe they do, and I know 50 other U.S. \nSenators from both parties who have sponsored this bill agree with me.\n  The crimes we are talking about today are particularly pernicious \ncrimes that affect more than just the victims and their families--they \ninspire fear in those who have no connection to the victim beyond a \nshared characteristic, such as race or disability or sexual \norientation.\n  Mr. President, when James Byrd, Jr., was dragged behind a pickup \ntruck--dragged--one can only imagine the terror and horror he felt in \nthe face of his violent death. He was killed by bigots in Texas in \n1998. Why? For the sole reason that he was black. Think how many \nAfrican Americans throughout our Nation felt diminished as citizens to \nknow that another African American was horribly, brutally killed simply \nbecause of the color of his skin.\n  When Matthew Shepard was murdered in Wyoming, he was left hanging on \na fence. Why? Because he was gay. Don't you think gays and lesbians in \nthe United States felt less safe on the streets and in their homes? \nThese crimes promote fear and insecurity that are distinct from the \nreactions to other crimes. They produce a national reaction. We need to \ntake action to enhance their prosecution.\n  These terrible crimes have also affected my little State of Vermont. \nIn 1996, Julianne Williams and Lollie Winans were murdered in the \nShenandoah National Park in Virginia. Ms. Williams lived in Burlington, \nVT. She and Ms. Winans were planning to move to Huntington, VT, after \ntheir hiking trip to Virginia. (Huntington, VT, I must say, is a \nbeautiful little town, one of the most peaceful places you can \nimagine.) They were murdered.\n  In April, the Justice Department indicted Darrell Davis Rice for \nmurder. The prosecutors invoked the Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhancement \nAct, charging that Mr. Rice killed the two women as part of his plan to \n``assault, intimidate, injure, and kill women because of their \ngender.'' Prosecutors said that Rice had stated that he ``hates gays.'' \nHe said he had taken it upon himself to determine that Ms. Williams and \nMs. Winans ``deserved to die because they were lesbians.'' What a \nhorrible commentary. This man decided in his mind they deserved to die, \nso he was going to kill them.\n  Now, Rice was susceptible to Federal hate crime laws because the \nmurders occurred on Federal land. If he had been indicted for killing \nthese women in Huntington, VT, he would not have been susceptible to \nthis enhancement. So his indictment fell within a narrow window. With \npassage of this act, we can provide Federal protection to women, gays \nand lesbians throughout our Nation.\n\n  All Americans have the right to live, travel, and gather where they \nchoose. In the past, we have responded as a Nation to deter and to \npunish violent denials of civil rights. We have enacted Federal laws to \nprotect the civil rights of all of our citizens for nearly 150 years. \nThis law continues that great and honorable tradition.\n  This bill will strengthen Federal jurisdiction over hate crimes as a \nbackup, but not a substitute, for State and local law enforcement. \nStates will still bear the responsibility for prosecuting most hate \ncrimes. That is important to me as a former State prosecutor.\n  I have a great deal of respect for the law enforcement officers in my \nState,\n\n[[Page S5248]]\n\nsuch as David Demag, the Police Chief in Essex, VT, who is now serving \non the Medal of Valor Review Board. I want the States to have primary \njurisdiction, because they can handle most hate crimes prosecutions. \nBut there are times when Federal assistance is helpful and even \nnecessary. For those cases, we must have this Federal law.\n  In a sign that this legislation respects the proper balance between \nFederal and local authority, it has received strong bipartisan support \nfrom State and local law enforcement organizations across the country. \nThis support convinces me that we should pass this powerful law \nenforcement tool without further delay.\n  Moreover, this bill accomplishes a critically important goal--\nprotecting all of our citizens--without compromising our constitutional \nresponsibilities. It is a tool for combating acts and threats of \nviolence motivated by hatred and bigotry. It doesn't target pure \nspeech--even that speech that you and I and everybody finds offensive \nor disagreeable. The Constitution does not permit us in Congress to \nprohibit the expression of an idea simply because we disagree with it.\n  As Justice Holmes wrote, the Constitution protects not just freedom \nfor the thought and expression we agree with, but freedom for the \nthought that we hate. I am devoted to that principle, and I am \nconfident that this bill does not contradict it. Indeed, Senator \nKennedy, who has been a leader on civil rights for four decades, has \nworked carefully and hard to tailor this needed remedy to the narrowing \nrestrictions of the current very activist Supreme Court.\n  It is long past time to pass this bill. Of course, the Senate has \ndone its part before. In 1999, we passed it as part of the Commerce-\nJustice-State appropriations bill, but the House insisted on its \nremoval. In 2000, the Senate voted 57 to 42 to include it as an \namendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill. That year, \nthe House even voted 232 to 192 to instruct House conferees on the bill \nto agree to the Senate language on hate crimes.\n  Nonetheless, the House Republican leadership insisted on its removal \nand they won. So despite the best efforts of former President Clinton \nand us all, we were twice unable to overcome the opposition of the \nother body. I hope we will this time.\n  I hope the House Republicans will finally allow a vote on this \nmeasure. I urge President Bush to ask them to do so. Think about what \nthe President said so eloquently last week at West Point. I think of \nthis because the distinguished Presiding Officer is a well-respected \ngraduate of West Point.\n\n  When the President spoke at West Point's commencement about our fight \nagainst terrorism, he called it a conflict between good and evil and \nsaid that we cannot allow other nations to ``tolerate the hatred that \nleads to terror.'' He correctly stated that ``there can be no \nneutrality between justice and cruelty.'' He promised that ``the United \nStates will promote moderation and tolerance and human rights.''\n  I agree with President Bush. And I believe that passage of this \nlegislation will show once again that America values tolerance and \nprotects all of its people. I urge the opponents of this legislation to \nconsider the message it sends to the rest of America when, year after \nyear, we are unable to move this broadly supported bill.\n  A majority of the people in the Senate support this bill, a majority \nof the people in the House of Representatives support it, and a \nmajority of Americans support it. Yet a small group blocks it from \ngoing forward. What does that say about our American values?\n  I say to the Republican leadership in the other body and in our own: \nListen to what President Bush has so eloquently said at West Point. \nLet's pass this legislation. The victims of hate deserve our support--\nthe victims do. Those who would impose hateful conduct upon them \ndeserve to know that the United States of America doesn't stand for \nthat. So we need a vote, both in this body and in the House of \nRepresentatives. If we have such a vote, Mr. President, we will once \nagain make it very clear: The U.S. Government does not tolerate hate \nand intolerance, no matter who it is directed against. Making that \nstatement, we make our Nation even stronger.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Hawaii yield for a \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. AKAKA. Yes, I certainly yield to my friend from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \npresentation by the Senator from Hawaii, I be recognized for 20 minutes \nas in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/07/senate-section/article/S5248-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5248-S5249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE BATTLE AGAINST INVASIVE SPECIES\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to a very \nserious problem that burdens not only the State of Hawaii, but also the \nentire country--the problem of exotic and invasive species. Invasive \nspecies are plants, animals, and microbes which are transported from \ntheir native environments, and in the absence of natural predators and \ncompetitors, proliferate and permanently alter their new ``home.'' \nInvasive species are potentially one of the largest economic and \nenvironmental threats in this century, costing the U.S. an estimated \n$100 billion each year and wreaking havoc with the nation's \nbiodiversity. With the rise of global commerce, invasive species have \nfound it easier to find their way to new lands. They arrive in nearly \nevery possible way, including by vessels in ballast water to our ports, \nand by planes via cargo, military and commercial shipments of plants \nand food. Upon arrival, they can have devastating impacts on water \nquality, agriculture, health, and especially the environment and the \neconomy.\n  Nowhere is this situation more evident than in Hawaii. Hawaii has \nsuffered the highest rate of species extinction in the United States, \nand in fact, one of the highest rates of extinction anywhere in the \nworld. The Hawaii State Department of Land and Natural Resources \nestimates that before the arrival of humans, new species became \nestablished in Hawaii once every 70,000 years. Currently, Hawaii \nbecomes home to over 20 new species per year. The Federal interagency \nAquatic Nuisance Species Task Force estimates that Hawaii alone has \n4,465 nonindigenous species. It is a problem of unbelievable magnitude.\n  I would like to bring your attention to a few species in particular. \nMany may have read the recent Washington Post article on the coqui. \nThis small frog is less than two inches long and is beloved in its \nnative home of Puerto Rico. But in Hawaii, we have no native frogs. In \nfact, we have no native reptiles or terrestrial amphibians, no native \nsnakes, iguanas, toads, or even salamanders. In short, our ecosystems \nare not prepared to take on the coqui; there are no natural predators, \nsuch as snakes. Therefore, the impact of the coqui is immense. These \nnocturnal frogs, which make beautiful sounds individually, cause quite \nan uproar when singing in a chorus. Each one can produce a call at 90 \ndecibels. However, at one site on the island of Hawaii, the coqui \npopulation is estimated at over 8,000 frogs an acre. It would sound as \nif 8,000 lawn mowers were running at once. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService has documented 260 infested sites on the Big Island, 40 sites \non Maui, 20 on Oahu, and two on Kauai. Our tourism industries, \nespecially our hotels which are world-renowned for the promise of \nrestful tranquility, are already feeling the impact.\n  The coqui consume an average of 46,000 prey items per night per acre. \nThis puts tremendous predation pressure on Hawaii's native arthropods, \nand provides intense competition for Hawaii's native forest birds, many \nof which are insect-eating as well as threatened or endangered species. \nThe frogs also serve as an additional food source for non-native rats \nand mongoose. Increased populations of rats and mongoose then prey on \nthe already impacted forest birds, which intensifies the effects on \nnative ecosystems and disrupts their delicate balance.\n  The brown tree snake is another example of an invasive species with \ntremendous potential for affecting Hawaii. This snake was introduced to \nGuam in World War II probably as a\n\n[[Page S5249]]\n\nstowaway in ship cargo. It eats any animal smaller than itself, and is \nresponsible for the extinction of twelve native bird species on Guam. \nUp to 13,000 snakes per square mile may occur in some forested areas of \nGuam. A brown tree snake can enter a home, and its venom is life \nthreatening to infants. In fact, one out of every thousand visits to \nthe emergency room in Guam is due to snakebites. It has caused more \nthan 1,200 electric power outages since 1980, some island-wide and \nlasting several days. Approximately every third day there is a snake-\ncaused power outage somewhere on Guam. The outages cost Guam an \nestimated $1--$4 million each year. Research and control of brown tree \nsnakes in Guam cost over $4 million per year.\n  Now the brown tree snake is poised to invade Hawaii, other Pacific \nIslands, and even the U.S. mainland. The snake has already reached \nHawaii several times as a stowaway on flights from Guam. If the brown \ntree snake is accidentally introduced, Hawaii will suffer the same fate \nas Guam. On Guam, you no longer hear the sweet melody of a songbird \nbecause they have all been consumed by the brown tree snake. \nDevelopment of long-term screening measures at airports to prevent this \nintroduction would cost an estimated $2.5 million annually over several \nyears. While this may seem costly, the potential economic impact caused \nby the brown tree snake would be devastating in comparison.\n  Miconia is a large, leafy tree that was introduced to Hawaii in 1959. \nIt was brought intentionally as an ornamental plant; miconia has a \nbeautiful, deep rich purple color on the underside of its leaves. \nHowever, despite its benign appearance, it is an aggressive invader of \nnative and disturbed forests, growing into dense stands that block \nlight to smaller native plants. Miconia has also contributed to erosion \nand landslides because of its shallow root system. It blossoms four \ntimes a year, sending out millions of seeds each time, and the seed \npods remain viable for up to eight years. Miconia is just one example \nof a noxious weed that is a major threat to native Hawaiian plants.\n  All across the country, invasive alien weeds fuel grass and forest \nfires, accelerate soil erosion, and consume critical water resources. \nThe lost productivity of rangelands due to weeds has been estimated at \n$3.6 to $4.5 billion annually. Over 100 million acres of land are \ninfested with weeds, and the infestation is expanding by 10 million \nacres per year. On Federal lands alone, the rate of infestation is \n4,600 acres per day. Noxious weeds destroy or alter natural habitats, \ndamage waterways and power lines, and depress property values. Some are \neven toxic.\n  In Hawaii, Federal, State, and local agencies have joined the \nuniversities and local communities to support efforts to prevent the \nspread of invasive species. The University of Hawaii, Hawaii's \nDepartment of Agriculture and State Department of Land and Natural \nResources, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService, as well as smaller, island-specific citizen groups coordinate \nefforts to research, track and control the coqui. In the case of the \nmiconia, students and volunteers have to hack through a jungle to reach \nthe trees, suffering through mosquito bites and the thorny underbrush. \nThe State employs helicopters to spot plants in places that may have \nbeen missed, and volunteers in some cases drop off 100-foot cliffs to \ndestroy these invaders.\n  Now it is time to do our part in Congress to support these efforts at \nthe Federal level. I have joined 19 of my colleagues in signing a \nletter circulated by my friend, the senior Senator from Michigan, Mr. \nLevin, in support of funding for the National Invasive Species Act of \n1996. This Act provides for ballast water management to prevent the \nintroduction and spread of non-indigenous species into the waters of \nthe United States, provides for a comprehensive program to control the \nbrown tree snake, and provides for invasive aquatic plant management.\n  In 1999, President Clinton signed Executive Order 13112. The \nexecutive order mandates federal agencies to take steps to prevent the \nintroduction and spread of harmful alien species, and coordinate their \nactions with other federal agencies. The goal of the executive order is \nto minimize the negative economic, ecological, and human health impacts \nthat invasive species cause.\n  We must act to turn these goals into reality. Funding for the battle \nagainst invasive species crosscuts almost every Federal agency, \nincluding the U.S. Department of the Interior, Department of \nAgriculture, Department of Defense, and Department of Commerce. Each \nagency has been taking an active role against invasive species. This is \na challenge that must be appreciated and fought on all fronts, and the \nagencies need increased funding in this budget-conscious year. I urge \nmy colleagues to support funding for the effective implementation of \nExecutive Order 13112, the National Invasive Species Act of 1996, and \nfor Federal and State agencies' efforts across the United States in the \nstruggle against invasive and exotic species. Until these efforts are \nfully funded, we do not stand a chance against these destructive \ninvaders.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/07/senate-section/article/S5249-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5249-S5251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CORPORATE GREED\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in recent months I have been conducting \nhearings in the subcommittee that I chair and the Commerce Committee on \nthe issue of the Enron scandal.\n  While conducting those hearings, I received a letter from a \nconstituent of mine in North Dakota. That constituent said he had been \nan employee of the Enron Corporation for a good number of years and had \n$330,000 in his 401(k) retirement account, invested in Enron stock. And \nthen, of course, Enron collapsed. Now that $330,000 is worth $1,700.\n  The folks at the top of Enron made a fortune and got away with their \nfortune, and the company collapsed, the employees lost their shirts, \nand the investors lost their shirts. It is another case of the big \ndoing very well, and the little losing everything they had.\n  It reminds me of the verse in a song by Bob Wells and the Texas \nPlayboys from the 1930s: Little guy picks the cotton, the big guy gets \nthe money. The little bee sucks the blossom, the big bee gets the \nhoney.\n  That is what is going on too often in this country. I am more and \nmore dismayed by what I am reading in the business pages, about the \nscandals at the top levels of a number of corporations in America. I \nhave been reading especially in recent days about Dennis Kozlowski, CEO \nof Tyco International. Mr. Kozlowski resigned under criminal indictment \nfor tax evasion, but he has been criticized for some time for the way \nhis company was playing games with his books.\n  Now, I don't know him. I have never met him. I did not know much \nabout his company until it started making news. But Tyco's problems are \nanother troubling sign about the state of our system of capitalism, the \nsystem by which companies accumulate money in a corporate structure, \nand the system by which people are compensated for their performance.\n\n  I will speak about this in a moment. But first let me mention another \naspect that troubles me about Tyco's story. Because Tyco is one of \nthose companies that, recently, decided to move its corporate \nheadquarters off-shore, to avoid paying their fair share of taxes.\n  In the middle of a war against terrorism, it is unconscionable for an \nAmerican corporation to forsake its country and move off-shore--in a \nso-called ``inversion''--to avoid paying taxes. It really raises \nquestions of patriotism, in my judgment. Who do they think should fight \nthis war on terrorism? Who do they think ought to pay for the war \nagainst terrorism? Who do they think protects their assets and their \ncompany and their business? They want the protection of the U.S. \nmilitary, but they do not want to pay for it.\n  Tyco is one of the world's largest manufacturers and services of \nelectrical and electronic components, as\n\n[[Page S5250]]\n\nwell as undersea telecommunications systems, the largest manufacturer \nof fire protection, and electronic security services. Mr. Kozlowski \nresigned because, according to the allegations, he evaded more than $1 \nmillion in sales taxes on works of art that he acquired by Renoir, \nMonet, and others.\n  I am very interested in the information that has come to light after \nMr. Kozlowski's resignation, criticism of the way he ran the company. \nHe became CEO of Tyco in 1992. He was an accountant by training. In \n1997, he moved Tyco headquarters from New Hampshire to Bermuda, as I \nmentioned. During the late 1990s, the company was in the eyes of many a \nvery successful company.\n  Tyco grew at an amazing pace, and Mr. Kozlowski made a killing on the \nsale of company stock and stock options. In fact, over the past 4 \nyears, this fellow made $325 million in compensation.\n  Then in 1999, the SEC started to investigate allegations that Tyco \nwas engaged in ``questionable'' accounting practices. Mr. Kozlowski \nclaimed to have done nothing wrong. He said publicly he was not about \nto sell off the stock in his company. According to filings with the \nSEC, however, he sold nearly $100 million of his stock as compensation \nin the year 2000 alone.\n  The Tyco stock started to drop rapidly. Tyco disclosed Mr. Kozlowski \nrepaid $70 million in loans to Tyco--using company stock. Tyco shares \nlost $50 billion in January of this year. Last December, the value of \nthis stock was $60; last night, $14.\n  So it is the little guys, the investors, the folks who put their \nmoney in Tyco stock who did not do very well. Mr. Kozlowski got $325 \nmillion in compensation over a 4-year period.\n  I have been reading about this day after day after day, and it \nreminded me of the movie, ``Wall Street.'' That movie had an infamous \ncharacter played by Michael Douglas, named Gordon Gekko. And that \ncharacter delivered the often quoted words: ``Greed is good. Greed is \nright. Greed works. And greed, mark my words, will save . . . that \nmalfunctioning corporation called the USA.''\n  That movie came out in 1987. By today's standards, Gordon Gekko seems \nlike a Boy Scout.\n  The average compensation of the 10 highest paid chief executive \nofficers in America, 20 years ago, was $3.5 million. That was their \naverage compensation. Mr. President, $3.5 million a year was a pretty \ngood compensation package then, and it would be a pretty good package \ntoday. But do you know what it is today? It is $150 million. The \naverage compensation of the 10 most highly compensated CEOs in the \ncountry is $150 million a year.\n\n  Here is a list of some of the compensation paid to CEOs in the year \n2000: $290 million, $225 million, $157 million. These are yearly \ncompensation figures.\n  In the 1980s, when the movie ``Wall Street'' came out and Gordon \nGekko was saying that greed was good, the average pay of a corporation \nhead was about 42 times the pay of the average worker. Today, a CEO's \npay is about 531 times greater than that of the average employee \nworking for the corporation.\n  In one of my hearings on the Enron Corporation we found that Mr. \nFastow, who was the CFO of the Enron Corporation, had a little \npartnership deal that he constructed. Even as an employee of the \ncorporation--highly paid, I might add--he constructed partnerships, \nthat were attached to the corporation, in which he had equity pieces \nand then got a commission to manage. He put $25,000 of his own money \ninto one of these partnerships, and 60 days later took out $4.5 \nmillion.\n  I come from a really small town--300 people--with a very small \nschool--9 in my senior class. But it does not take higher math to \nunderstand what cheating is all about. The hearings I have held on the \nEnron Corporation have described a culture of corruption and cheating \nand, in my judgment, criminal activities. The hearings I have conducted \non Enron with respect to West Coast electricity pricing suggest to me \nrigging of electricity prices to the tune of billions, perhaps tens of \nbillions, of dollars.\n  There is something rotten going on inside some of these \ncorporations--not all of them, but some of them. And who stands to \nlose? The big guys make off with millions and millions of dollars--in \nmost cases tens and hundreds of millions of dollars--and the little \npeople lose their shirt.\n  If I might show some additional charts that describe this saga. The \npay of American corporate executives is not even related to performance \nanymore. CEO pay was up 7 percent last year. Profits are down 35 \npercent. What kind of business do you see that in? The worse they do, \nthe more they make? What kind of accountability exists with respect to \nthe stockholders across this country, the moms and pops who have put \ntheir money in their retirement accounts in these companies, believing \nthese people are doing a good job?\n  I mentioned Enron because I have spent a lot of time on that issue. \nIn 1998 the president was Mr. Ken Lay, who claimed not to have the \nfoggiest idea of what was going on inside his company. If ever there \nwas an ``Onward through the fog'' voice from a CEO, it came from Mr. \nLay. But he got $101 million in compensation for his services, through \nhis sale of Enron stock.\n  Jeffrey Skilling testified before my subcommittee for about 6 hours. \nNobody had the foggiest idea what he said. He apparently served in that \ncorporation as one of its top executives. He heard nothing, saw \nnothing, participated in nothing, and decided he did not want to be a \npart of it anymore. It was the most byzantine hearing I ever held in my \nlife. Here is a guy who claimed to be oblivious to fraud of the largest \nscale, and walked away from the company with $70 million in stock.\n  A couple of weeks ago the CEO of Adelphia, the sixth largest cable \ncompany in the country, resigned. We now discover, as a result of the \n10-K financial statements that are filed with regulators, that Adelphia \nhad $2.3 billion in debt, that was hidden off the balance sheet. Most \nof that was owed to companies that the CEO's family controlled, and \nthat could not be paid back--$2.3 billion.\n\n  Almost all across this country now, workers in corporations--that is, \nthe folks who make corporations function--are discovering that they no \nlonger have defined benefit pension programs. That used to be the bulk \nof the pension programs. Now it is diminished to less than a fourth.\n  While the workers in a corporation are discovering the erosion of \ntheir pensions, the compensation at the top of these corporations is \nskyrocketing, in no relationship to how the corporation is doing.\n  This next chart also shows something interesting, and deeply \ntroubling. The corporations in this country are paying a smaller and \nsmaller percentage of the tax burden in our country. Payroll taxes--\nwhich hit the lowest wage earners in the country much harder than the \ntop wage earners in the country--are growing as a portion of our tax \nburden. And these corporations, as I mentioned, are now increasingly \nlooking to save taxes by renouncing their U.S. citizenship.\n  I know many corporations are responsible, and would never consider \nrunning off to Bermuda to avoid taxes. But some of them are doing so, \nand shame on them. Where is their sense of patriotism here? We are at \nwar against terrorism, and we have corporations making a decision they \ndon't want to be American anymore, they don't want to have an American \nidentity, because to do so you have to pay taxes and pay a portion of \nthe cost of the burden of government, which includes providing for the \ncommon defense and paying the wages and salaries of the men and women \nand the equipment in our armed services. Shame on people who think like \nthat.\n  Franklin Roosevelt, in one of his fireside chats, said:\n\n       Not all of us can have the privilege of fighting our \n     enemies in distant parts of the world. Not all of us can have \n     the privilege of working in a munitions factory or a \n     shipyard, or on the farms or in the oil fields or mines, \n     producing the weapons or raw materials that are needed by our \n     Armed Forces. But there is one front and one battle where \n     everyone in the United States--every man, woman and child is \n     in action. . . . .That front is right here at home, in our \n     daily lives, and in our daily tasks. Here at home, everyone \n     will have the privilege of making whatever self-denial is \n     necessary, not only to supply our fighting men [and women], \n     but to keep the economic structure of our country fortified \n     and secure. . . .\n\n  When I read this and compare it to the stories about American \ncompanies\n\n[[Page S5251]]\n\nmoving their headquarters to a mailbox in Bermuda just to avoid paying \ntaxes, I say shame on them.\n  I think we have to begin to think, here in the Congress: What do we \ndo about the crisis in corporate governance in an increasing number of \nAmerican firms? Where will it go?\n  When the average corporate executive in this country is now making \n530 times the average compensation of workers in the corporation, isn't \nthere something wrong here?\n  We have seen speculative bubbles recently, bubbles that are unhealthy \nin our economy. Is this not just another unhealthy bubble that is going \nto break at some point? Will the American people trust corporate \ngovernance when we have people at the top who are taking hundreds and \nhundreds of millions of dollars out themselves and are not worried \nabout the long-term financial solvency of the corporation, but worried \nonly about what their compensation does relative to the stock value in \nthe next quarter? Because their compensation is tied to short-term \nstock prices, they may have $50 million, $100 million, or $200 million \nat stake for them personally.\n  Will the American people trust corporate governance when we see \ncorporate executives such as Mr. Lay, Mr. Skilling, Mr. Fastow, and \nothers cashing out and putting millions and millions into their bank \naccounts even as they are telling employees, ``Hold onto your stock. \nTomorrow is going to be a better day. Our future is brighter. Hang onto \nyour stock, don't sell''--even as they are furiously selling off their \nshares privately in order to enrich themselves?\n  There are some legislative measures that we ought to consider, in my \njudgement. I will talk more about them later. Today, I wanted to raise \nsome public questions about the state of corporate governance in our \ncountry, and the erosion in confidence in our economic system. And to \nsay that we have some work to do on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/07/senate-section/article/S5251-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5251-S5252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Baucus). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I inquire as to the pending \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is S. 625.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Are we in morning business now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Presiding Officer informs the Senator we \nare not in morning business. We are on the bill.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I thank the Chair and ask I be allowed such time \nas I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak today on the issue of the Local Law \nEnforcement Act of 2001. It is the hate crimes bill that we are now \ntaking up. It is a bill I am pleased to coauthor with Senator Kennedy \nfrom Massachusetts. It is a bill that is appropriately taken up now.\n  I know some of my colleagues, partisans on my side of the aisle, may \nsay that we should not take up something like this at a time of war, a \nwar on terrorism. But I searched my memory. Whenever America has been \nat war before, we have not abandoned domestic issues. Immediately \nfollowing Pearl Harbor, we dealt with all kinds of things, from tax \nrates to civil rights, and the war proceeded. It is not inappropriate \nthat in a time of war on terrorism we focus on domestic terrorism.\n  The President gave a great speech last night. He talked about how we \ncan better create, for our Nation's protection, a more seamless way to \nprovide for the common defense. I look forward to supporting him in \nthat. But I say that hate crimes legislation is part and parcel of that \nsame effort. It is a part of our war on terrorism. It is a part of the \ndischarge of our responsibility to take care of our citizens.\n\n  I have always believed government's first duty is to provide security \nagainst violence to its citizens. We are doing that abroad, and we are \ndoing it perhaps as never before at home. But I think it is very \nappropriate that for a day or 2 the Senate turn its attention to this \nlaw, which was created, in its initial form, more than 30 years ago.\n  Hate crimes legislation is not a new concept. Hate crimes \nlegislation, as I understand its history, was created to give the \nFederal Government the ability to enforce civil rights, in Southern \nStates in particular, where lynching laws were not enforced and where \nmuch violence was committed against our African American brothers and \nsisters.\n  It gave the Federal Government the right, the ability, to show up to \nwork, to provide for the common defense. And that law, which covers \nrace, religion, and national origin, is in effect. It has been fully \nvetted in the United States Supreme Court. It is constitutional. And it \ntruly, as the Court has held, simply adds an element, as we do to all \ncrimes, as to how you consider them, what penalties you apply, and what \nprosecution and vigor you employ.\n  It is entirely appropriate that we now add to this list of race, \nreligion, and national origin, other identified minority groups in this \ncountry who, because of their status, are demonstrably more vulnerable \nto violence, to crime.\n  I have made, for more than a year, the practice of entering in the \nCongressional Record a tragic chronology, a catalog of hate crimes \ncommitted throughout our country.\n  On these charts I have in the Chamber--perhaps you cannot read them \nbecause of the small print--but each of them represents a day in which \nI have identified a hate crime that has been committed in our country. \nThey are committed against African Americans. They are committed \nagainst the disabled. They are committed against women. And they are \ncommitted against gays and lesbians.\n  All of these crimes have one thing in common: they are committed \nagainst a minority community, and they have, at their heart, a \nmalignant heart that hates. And that is the impelling force for \ncommitting violence against a minority person. And the crime is visited \non a minority, on that American, because that is the common thread in \nall of this. They are committed against American citizens.\n  The common thread in this crime against Americans is that it is \nvisited upon an individual, but it terrorizes an entire minority \ncommunity. And we have said, since hate crimes were established back in \nthe 1960s, there are just some things that are so heinous, so at odds \nwith America's best values, that we are just going to say, as a matter \nof law, this is a new category of crime, and we are going to pursue it, \nand we are going to allow all branches of government, all levels of \ngovernment--local, State, and now Federal--to participate in the \npursuit and the prosecution of those who would commit these kinds of \nterrorist activities against a whole community. And that is what we are \ndoing.\n  Today, I am going to add another one to this sad chronology. It \noccurred in Honolulu, HI, in May of last year--a year ago. Two teens \nwere charged with attempted murder after allegedly dousing the tents of \ngay campers with flammable liquid while those campers were inside, \nsetting one on fire in Polihale State Park.\n  Victims in the attack said the perpetrators threw rocks and shouted \nslurs relating to the sexual orientation of the victims prior to \nsetting the tent on fire. Two men were sentenced, then, to 5 years each \nin prison.\n  We all know of the heinous murder committed on James Byrd, who was \ndragged to death on a lonely, dusty Texas road. That shocked America. \nBut in the case of Mr. Byrd, the Federal Government showed up to work \nbecause the Federal hate crimes law applies to issues of race. And the \nlaw enforcement folks in Texas will tell you that the Federal \nGovernment was very helpful in the pursuit, the prosecution, and the \nconviction of the murderers of James Byrd.\n  I think in that same year all of us felt horrified by the murder of \nMatthew Shepard in Wyoming. But in that case, because sexual \norientation was not an allowed category under Federal law, the Federal \nGovernment was prohibited from showing up for work.\n  I wish all Americans could have been with me in my office when I was \nvisited by Wyoming State Troopers--Republicans--advocating to me please \nsupport this because they were overwhelmed with the national focus that \nthis case brought. They really could\n\n[[Page S5252]]\n\nhave used the help of the Federal Government.\n  That is the whole point of this. I personally changed my mind on this \nsubject because of the murder of Matthew Shepard. Frankly, I was \nchagrined that more of my partisans were not at his vigil. I observed \nit in a hotel room on CNN in Oregon. I was disappointed that more of my \nfolks weren't there.\n  Hatred doesn't care if you are a Republican or a Democrat. As \nAmericans, we all ought to be willing to stand up and say: Gosh--at \nevery level of government, local, State, and Federal--let us show up \nfor work and prosecute these most heinous kinds of crimes and murders.\n  I know there are some good, faithful, religious people who believe \nthey should oppose this law because of this one category--the category \nof sexual orientation. They believe that because of their faith and \ntheir religion they cannot support this. But I say you should support \nthis not in spite of your faith, you ought to support it because of \nyour faith.\n  The example that I find in the Scripture which is so compelling is \nthat of Christ. When confronted with a woman who was about to be stoned \nbecause of adultery--he didn't endorse her lifestyle--he saved her \nlife.\n  Should we do any less? I say to people of faith that I don't care how \nyou pray. But if that story inspires you like it does me, because of \nyour faith support this.\n  That reflects the best values of the human heart, and the highest \nvalues of the American people. We ought to say as a matter of law--law \nisn't a teacher, and, no, we can't enforce morality--but we can hold up \nthe law and say this is what we believe.\n  The Ten Commandants are a great example of a law to the children of \nIsrael. They didn't always obey. But it reflected their highest values \nand caused them to live up, in many cases, to the highest of ideals. We \nshould not do any less.\n  I am proud to stand here as a supporter of this expansion of an old \nlaw that reflects our best values.\n  I call upon Republicans, Independents, and Democrats to understand \nthe spirit behind what it is we are doing.\n  Since I have been a U.S. Senator, I have been privileged to serve on \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Every time I leave the shores \nof this blessed land and confront conflicts in Europe, conflicts in \nEurasia, and conflicts in Asia, I am astounded at the tribal angst and \nhatred that besets most parts of this world.\n  I thank God that we live in a land where we have two oceans, two \ncenturies with two relatively peaceful neighbors, and a long time to \navoid the development of these kinds of racial, cultural, and other \nkinds of differences that cause us to want to commit crime, violence, \nand murder against people because of their differences. That reflects \nthe worst of humankind.\n  As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I have decried hate \ncrimes--however you want to describe them--on many continents on this \nplanet. As a Republican, I believe I cannot be silent about hate crimes \ncommitted at home. I think we all ought to step up to the high ideals \nthat this law represents.\n  When I chaired the Subcommittee on Europe, we held a hearing about \nanti-Semitism. We were privileged to have Eli Wiesel come and speak to \nus. In that hearing, he said something about what motivates the kinds \nof angst and hatred that have beset the Jewish people for a millennia \nof time. I want to share with you his words.\n  He said to this committee:\n\n       To hate is to deny the other person's humanity. It is to \n     see in ``the other'' a reason to inspire not pride, but \n     disdain; not solidarity, but exclusion. It is to choose \n     simplistic phraseology instead of ideas. It is to allow its \n     carrier to feel stronger than ``the other,'' and thus \n     superior to ``the other.'' The hater . . . is vain, arrogant. \n     He believes that he alone possesses the key to truth and \n     justice. He alone has God's ear.\n\n  This law that we will be privileged to vote on in a few days makes it \nclear that we include--that we not exclude--what are called hate \ncrimes. Why wouldn't we extend them to other Americans because they are \ndemonstrably more vulnerable?\n  Gays and lesbians--why wouldn't you extend the protection to them? Do \nyou hate them? I don't.\n  I believe it is possible on a principled ground to oppose some things \nthat the gay community wants. I am not for gay marriage. But when it \ncomes to public safety, the dignity of a job, the right to have a roof \nover your head, how can we withhold our help because we don't share a \nlifestyle?\n  I withhold those judgments. I say we should help because we are \nAmericans, and because we aspire to the highest ideals of our \nConstitution and the highest ideals of the religious traditions--as \nvaried as they are--that we hold in this country.\n  We are privileged to live in a land where we separate church and \nstate.\n  I have said to people who are opposed to my support of this law, if \nyou want to talk about sin, then go with me to church. If you want to \ntalk about public policy, let us go together to the Senate, and figure \nout how to protect all people, because that is what our Constitution \nprovides for.\n  I say to folks on my side, this shouldn't be a Republican-Democrat \nissue. This is an issue about the heart. In is an issue entirely \nappropriate to take up in a time and in a war on terrorism. Whether \nterrorism comes from a bin Laden, or whether terrorism comes from a \ncouple of murderers in Wyoming, it is terror, nonetheless, foreign and \ndomestic.\n  Our Constitution calls upon us in its Preamble to provide for the \ncommon defense, and to ensure domestic tranquility. Hate crime laws, \nsince their origin, have helped us to do that. It hasn't stopped it. \nYou can't legislate people to change their hearts. But you can help \nthem to by putting up the law, and saying these are our highest values. \nWe will enforce them with the force of law. By holding them up and \nsetting the example, we can help change hearts and minds.\n  While this law to many is just symbolism, I tell you it can become \nsubstantive, if we all show up for work and live up to our best ideals \nand not fall to the lowest of traits of humankind.\n  I call upon all our colleagues to support this legislation. Let's do \nit with an enormous majority, and let's do it regardless of party \naffiliation. Let's do it because with all of these victims, we share \nthe common thread that we are Americans.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak principally on behalf \nof four important pieces of legislation. Two have important \nimplications for national security, a third would help keep war \ncriminals and those who commit atrocities abroad out of our country and \nthe fourth would add a degree of fairness for law enforcement victims \nof September 11. All have been cleared on the Democratic side of the \naisle.\n  Three are being blocked by holds placed by anonymous Republican \nSenators. One has passed the Senate and is being held up by the \nRepublican leadership in the House. I appeal, again, today to our \nRepublican colleagues to stop holding these important bills hostage, \nremove your secret hold, or at least come forward and identify yourself \nand your concern so that we may debate and make bipartisan progress on \nthese important legislative matters.\n  First is S. 1974, the FBI Reform Act, which I introduced with Senator\n\n[[Page S5253]]\n\nGrassley in February, after extensive oversight hearings.\n  This bill would strengthen the FBI in its fight against terrorism, \nand was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee in April of \nthis year.\n  Since the attacks of September 11, and the anthrax attacks last fall, \nwe have relied on the FBI to detect and prevent acts of catastrophic \nterrorism that endanger the lives of the American people and the \ninstitutions of our country. FBI reform was already important, but the \nterrorist attacks suffered by this country last year have imposed even \ngreater urgency on improving the FBI. The Bureau is our front line of \ndomestic defense against terrorists.\n  Even before those attacks, the Judiciary Committee's oversight \nhearings revealed serious problems at the FBI that needed strong \ncongressional action to fix. We heard about a double standard in \nevaluations and discipline. We heard about record and information \nmanagement problems and communications breakdowns between field offices \nand Headquarters that led to the belated production of documents in the \nOklahoma City bombing case. Despite the fact that we have poured money \ninto the FBI over the last 5 years, we heard that the FBI's computer \nsystems were in dire need of modernization.\n  We heard about how an FBI supervisor, Robert Hanssen, was able to \nsell critical secrets to the Russians undetected for years without ever \ngetting a polygraph. We heard that there were no fewer than 15 \ndifferent areas of security at the FBI that needed fixing.\n  The FBI Reform Act tackles these problems with improved \naccountability, improved security both inside and outside the FBI and \nrequired planning to ensure the FBI is prepared to deal with the \nmultitude of challenges we are facing.\n  Just over the past month, the FBI Director has referred to the \nJustice Department inspector general important matters about the \nhandling of probative information like the Phoenix report before the 9-\n11 attacks. The FBI reform bill expands the Justice Department \ninspector general's authority to investigate all allegations of \nmisconduct at the FBI. The FBI Reform Act also strengthens \nwhistleblower protections for FBI employees who report misconduct to \nMembers of Congress, as Minneapolis Field Office Agent Coleen M. Rowley \ndid.\n  The FBI Reform Act also puts an end to statutory restrictions that \ncontribute to the ``double standard,'' where senior management \nofficials are not disciplined as harshly for misconduct as line agents \nare. Agent Rowley complained about this double standard in her May 21 \nletter criticizing Bureau Headquarters about its handling of the \nMoussaoui case.\n  Just this week the Judiciary Committee held an extensive hearing with \nthe FBI Director, the Department of Justice inspector general and \nSpecial Agent Rowley. Any doubts that this legislation is needed and \nneeded without further delay had to be erased by their candid \ntestimony.\n  The FBI Reform Act was unanimously reported by the oversight \ncommittee for the FBI and reflects our determination to make sure that \nthe FBI is as good and strong as it can be, and, all the more today, \ngiven the higher stakes, as good and as strong as America needs the FBI \nto be. This reform bill is a long stride toward that goal. I urge the \nRepublican Members who have blocked passage of this bill to come \nforward and identify themselves, to speak to Senator Grassley and me \nabout the importance of this legislation, and to share any concerns \nthey may have so that we may proceed without further delay.\n  Last December I introduced S. 1770 to implement two antiterrorism \ntreaties, the Terrorist Bombing Convention and the Suppression of the \nFinancing of Terrorism Convention. The antiterrorist bombing bill would \nbring the United States into immediate compliance with important \ninternational conventions signed by the United States under President \nClinton's leadership.\n  The two antiterrorism treaties at issue were transmitted to the \nSenate for ratification by President Clinton in 1999 and 2000, but not \nacted upon until the Senate reorganized under a Democratic majority \nlast summer.\n  The United States signed these treaties after the tragic terrorist \nbombings at the United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Before \ncontrol of the Senate changed hands, there was no action taken on these \ntreaties in the Foreign Relations Committee. The antibombing treaty in \nparticular sat in the Foreign Relations Committee for approximately 2 \nyears without action during the Clinton administration when the Senate \nwas under Republican control. Senator Biden deserves credit for acting \nquickly to report these treaties within weeks after he assumed \nchairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  Yet even as Senator Biden was pushing to move the treaties themselves \nthrough the Senate, the Bush administration did not transmit proposed \nimplementing legislation to the Judiciary Committee before or during \nthe time that we were working together day and night to write the USA \nPatriot Act, the bipartisan antiterrorism legislation responding to the \nevents of September 11. I remain puzzled why the administration felt \nthat this measure should be separated from that effort.\n  Both treaties require the signatory nations to enact certain, \nprecisely worded criminal provisions in their laws in order to be in \ncompliance. That is what S.1770, the Leahy bill, does. I introduced \nS.1770, on December 5, 2001, shortly after passage of the USA Patriot \nAct, as a separate bill. This was the same day that the Senate agreed \nto ratify both treaties. I then tried to move the bill quickly through \nthe Senate, but an anonymous Republican hold blocked passage.\n  Again this year I tried to move the bill through the Senate, but \nagain there was an anonymous hold from the Republican side of the aisle \nwhich blocked its passage. Had there not been a hold placed on the bill \nlast year, I am quite sure that we could have resolved any remaining \nissues in conference, as the Republican-controlled House was \nsimultaneously passing its own version of my bill.\n  After the anonymous hold was placed on S. 1770 at the end of the last \nsession, we received a letter from the Department of Justice in late \nJanuary of this year about the bill.\n  The letter stated that the Department ``support[ed] the legislation \nbut recommend[ed] several modifications.'' None of the modifications \nwhich the Department recommended dealt with issues that were necessary \nfor compliance with the treaties, the basic purpose of the bill. The \nLeahy bill would bring us into full compliance with those important \nobligations and take away an excuse from nations that are hesitant to \ncooperate in the war against terrorism.\n  The recent spate of horrible suicide bombings around the world and \nthe fact that the convention prohibiting terrorist financing entered \ninto force on April 10, 2002, demonstrate the pressing need for this \nlegislation. As if that was not enough, last month the FBI Director \nwarned that he believes that suicide bombings in the United States are \n``inevitable,'' bringing home the point that this legislation is \nrequired both to fight terrorism at home and abroad. Nevertheless, S. \n1770 has been subjected to an anonymous Republican hold since December \nof last year.\n  In the post-September 11 environment it is almost beyond my \nunderstanding why any Member of this body would secretly obstruct \npassage of an important piece of antiterrorism legislation--yet here we \nare in June, blocked from compliance with two international terrorism \ntreaties by a secret Republican hold.\n  The third bill is S. 864, the Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act, \nwhich I introduced year and was reported by the Judiciary Committee, \nwith bipartisan support, to close loopholes in our immigration laws \nthat have allowed war criminals and human rights abusers to enter and \nremain in this country.\n  I have been appalled that this country has become a safe haven for \nthose who exercised power in foreign countries to terrorize, rape, \nmurder, and torture innocent civilians. A recent report by Amnesty \nInternational claims that nearly 150 alleged human rights abusers have \nbeen identified living here, but warns that this number may be as high \nas 1,000.\n  Observers have noted the irony that in the wake of the September 11, \n2001,\n\n[[Page S5254]]\n\nattacks, hundreds of foreigners have been rounded up though not charged \nwith any terrorism-related crime.\n  Yet at the same time, ``hundreds, if not thousands, of foreign \nnationals who have been plausibly accused of the most heinous human \nrights crimes, including torture and assassination, either have lived \nor still live freely in the U.S.'' [William Schulz, ``The Torturers \nAmong Us,'' New York Review, p. 22, April 25, 2002.]\n  This bill would not only add the new grounds, but also expand current \ngrounds, for inadmissibility and deportation, by barring those aliens \nwho have engaged, outside the United States, in ``torture'' and \n``extrajudicial killing'' and removing artificial limitations on the \ncurrent grounds for exclusion for aliens who commit ``genocide'' and \n``particularly severe violations of religious freedom.'' This bill is \nimportant for the victims of these heinous crimes who seek refuge in \nthis country and important for Americans to show that we will not \ntolerate perpetrators of genocide, extrajudicial killing and torture, \nliving among us.\n  I urge the Republican Members who have blocked passage of this bill \nto come forward and identify themselves, to share any concerns they may \nhave so that we may proceed without further delay.\n  I was pleased when the Senate did take up and pass the Mychal Judge \nPolice and Fire Chaplains Public Safety Officers' Benefit Act of 2002 \nthat I sponsored with Senators Campbell, Schumer, Clinton, and Biden.\n  Named for Chaplain Mychal Judge, who was killed while responding with \nthe New York City Fire Department to the September 11 terrorist attacks \non the World Trade Center, this legislation recognizes the invaluable \nservice of police and fire chaplains in crisis situations by allowing \nfor their eligibility in the Public Safety Officers' Benefit Program. \nFather Judge, while deemed eligible for public safety officer benefits, \nwas survived by his two sisters who, under current law, are ineligible \nto receive payments through the PSOB Program. This is simply wrong and \nmust be remedied.\n  Indeed, Father Judge is among 10 public safety officers who were \nkilled on September 11, but who are ineligible for Federal death \nbenefits because they died without spouses, children, or parents. This \nbill would retroactively correct this injustice by expanding the list \nof those who may receive public safety officer benefits to the \nbeneficiaries named on the most recently executed life insurance policy \nof the deceased officer. This change would go into effect on September \n11 of last year to make sure the families of Father Judge and the nine \nother fallen heroes receive their public safety officer benefits.\n  In addition, this bill would retroactively restructure the Public \nSafety Officers' Benefit Program to specifically include chaplains as \nmembers of the law enforcement and fire units they serve, and would \nmake these chaplains eligible for the one-time $250,000 benefit \navailable to public safety officers who have been permanently disabled \nas a result of injuries sustained in the line of duty, or to the \nsurvivors of officers who have died.\n  This measure is strongly supported by the National Association of \nPolice Organization, the Fraternal Order of Police, and the American \nFederation of State, County and Municipal Employees.\n  Despite its Senate's passage and in spite of the fact that the House \nJudiciary Committee has favorably reported the House companion bill \nwith bipartisan support to the House, the House Republican leadership \nhas refused to follow through with passage of these measure. I urge the \nHouse Republican leadership to reconsider its decision and allow this \nimportant matter to proceed to final passage.\n  These bills are not alone in being blocked by anonymous Republican \nholds. Holds have been placed on other important bills that the \nJudiciary Committee has acted upon and reported favorably to the \nSenate. Let me just cite a couple examples: S. 2010, the Corporate and \nCriminal Fraud Accountability Act, which I introduced after the Enron \ndebacle to restore confidence in our securities; S. 2179, the Law \nEnforcement Tribute Act, which was introduced by Senator Carnahan to \nhelp State and local police pay for memorials to honor fallen officers; \nand S. 407, the Madrid Protocol Implementation Act, to help American \nbusinesses better protect their intellectual property in the \ninternational marketplace.\n  In addition to the Mychal Judge Police and Fire Chaplains Public \nSafety Officers Benefit Act, many other Senate-passed are languishing \nin the House of Representatives. These include the Federal Judiciary \nProtection Act, S. 1099, which I cosponsored with Senator Gordon Smith; \nthe James Guelff and Chris McCurley Body Armor Act, S. 166, which was \nsponsored by Senator Feinstein; and the TEACH Act, S. 487, which I \nsponsored with Senator Hatch. These bipartisan measures were passed by \nunanimous consent through the Senate last year, but have been held \nhostage without action in the House for too many months.\n  None of these 10 matters should be partisan, yet again and again, \nanonymous Republican holds have stopped Senate and congressional \naction. I appeal to my Republican colleagues in the Senate to lift \ntheir secret holds and to the Republicans in both Houses to stop \nobstructing these bipartisan bills, that are intended to protect our \nnational security, our public safety, America's borders, and American \nbusinesses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/07/senate-section/article/S5254-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       ENTREPRENEURS OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

Mr. President, 90 years ago on March 12, 1912, \nthe first troop of 18 Girl Scouts met in the United States. To date, \nthere are nearly 4 million girls and adults who are part of this \nextraordinary program.\n  Today, at the Denver Zoo in my home State of Colorado, Girl Scouts, \ntheir families, and others interested in scouting will be celebrating \nthis 90th anniversary with hands-on activities and a variety of \nentertainment. I would like to congratulate the Mile Hi Council of the \nGirl Scouts on this historic achievement and wish them all the best \nduring today's celebration. What a fantastic way to share the efforts \nof the Girl Scouts nationwide.\n  Throughout the 20th century, the Girl Scouts have been a visible \nforce behind efforts to serve people in times of national unrest. \nDuring World War I, they sold war bonds and collected peach pits for \nthe manufacturing of gas mask filters. Girls collaborated to learn \nabout food preservation and conservation by canning fruits and \nvegetables.\n  When the Great Depression hit, troops of Girl Scouts led community \nrelief efforts to provide the things necessary for basic survival. They \ncollected food and prepared meals for the poor, carved wooden toys for \nchildren, and assisted in hospitals to treat those in need of medical \ncare.\n  By the 1940s, women's involvement in our national security was on the \nrise after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and many women were taking over \npositions once dominated by men. The Girl Scouts led the vanguard of \nyoung women who were interested in helping those enlisted overseas as \nwell as those trying to maintain a sense of normalcy here in the United \nStates. They collected over 1 million articles of clothing for victims \nof war overseas, and put in numerous hours dedicated to farm aid \nprojects. Additionally, they were part of efforts to teach women \nsurvival skills during raids and blackouts.\n  The Girl Scouts have left their mark on endeavors to improve social \nclimate. In 1952, Ebony Magazine reported on their ``progress toward \nbreaking down racial taboos.'' They launched a campaign in the sixties \nto encourage girls to respect every aspect of themselves and to get to \nknow others who are fundamentally different whether it be by race, \nnational origin, or religion.\n  In the last 20 years, the Girl Scouts have worked together to tackle \nissues plaguing society's well-being, such as drug addiction, violent \ncrime, environmental destruction, and the AIDS epidemic. Through \ncollaborative work with the government and local communities, girls \nhave promoted the positive influences of literacy, personal health, and \nindividual responsibility.\n  Now more than ever, we are looking to our young people for a \ncollective face of hope and prosperity for this Nation's future. We \nhave witnessed the vulnerability of human life, but know the strength \nof collective effort and the potential for individual integrity. Our \nnational security and viability as a community depends on this \nstrength.\n  However, recent reports indicate that girls are less likely to pursue \ncareers in math, science, or technology--fields vital to our progress \nin this global economy. Sometime during their teen or preteen years, \nmany girls lose their zest in the classroom and, unfortunately, conform \nto attitudes that boys are inherently better in math and science.\n\n  The Girl Scouts are, again, at the forefront of this issue by \nconfronting the disparity head on. They have collaborated with the \nNational Science Foundation to provide opportunities for girls \ninterested in studying wildlife and environment in Antarctica. In \naddition, they have created programs to provide girls with hands-on \ntechnology training, computer science skills, and access to information \non physics and engineering. Most importantly, the Girl Scouts give \ngirls tools to close the gender gap and the confidence to succeed in \nthese traditionally male-dominated fields.\n  The Girl Scouts have fostered an environment Where Girls Grow \nStrong--their modern mantra. But, while the activities of the Girl \nScouts may change over the years, its commitment to young women \nnationwide is resolute. By encouraging personal responsibility, social \nawareness, community service, and individual freedom, the Girl Scouts \nhave shaped the physical and mental well-being of young women \neverywhere.\n  Thank you for allowing me to congratulate the Girl Scouts on 90 years \nof exceptional achievement. I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing \nthem all the best in the years to come, and in giving a ``Mile Hi'' \nsalute to the Girl Scouts celebrating today in Denver and throughout \nthe Nation.\n  I ask that the Girl Scout Law be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                           The Girl Scout Law\n\n       I will do my best to be\n       honest and fair\n       friendly and helpful,\n       considerate and caring,\n       courageous and strong, and\n       responsible for what I say and do,\n       and to\n       respect myself and others,\n       respect authority,\n       use resources wisely,\n       make the world a better place, and\n       be a sister to every Girl Scout.\n\n[[Page S5256]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/07/senate-section/article/S5255-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5255-S5256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CONGRATULATING THE GIRL SCOUTS ON 90 YEARS OF ACHIEVEMENT\n\n Mr. CAMPBELL.

Mr. President, now, more than ever, Americans \nare expressing their patriotism. Patriotism means different things to \ndifferent people, but for some, like Ed Lawrence, patriotism comes \nthrough his ``determination'' to help others.\n  Mr. Lawrence, a wildlife artist from McGregor, IA, is a retired game \nwarden and a U.S. Air Force veteran. After hearing President George W. \nBush's address to the Nation following the September 11 attacks, \nLawrence was moved into taking action. Although unsure of what \ncontribution he could make, he retreated to his studio and began to \nsketch. Out of his sketches rose images of the American bald eagle with \nthe Stars and Stripes waving behind it. These heart-felt images became \nthe foundation for Mr. Lawrence's work, ``Determination.''\n  With ``Determination,'' Mr. Lawrence was able to give back to the \nnation. At the end of last year, Mr. Lawrence devoted his energy to the \nGrant Wood Chapter of the Red Cross in Cedar Rapids. From the proceeds \nof his ``Determination'' prints, the group was able to pay the shipping \ncosts of care packages sent to troops on hardship assignments in Saudi \nArabia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Kuwait and Uzbekistan. The care packages were \nmeant to send a bit of home abroad and included puzzles, games, \nfootballs, microwave popcorn, toiletries, gum and magazines, among \nother items to boost the troops' morale.\n  In addition to covering the costs of sending out the care packages, \nMr. Lawrence created 911 numbered prints as a special tribute to U.S. \ntroops. He donates these prints to various community group fundraisers. \nThe limited edition prints go to groups willing to sell a print in \nsupport of the Grant Wood Chapter's project.\n  U.S. Armed Force bases that receive donations also receive a special \ncopy of ``Determination.''

The clerk will read the bill by title for the \nfirst time.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2600) to ensure the continued financial capacity \n     of insurers to provide coverage for risks from terrorism.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I now ask for its second reading, but I \nobject to my own request on behalf of the Republicans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection having been heard, the bill will \nreceive its second reading on the next legislative day.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this effort to move this legislation forward \nhas been going on since December. We have tried on many occasions to \nget the minority to agree on coming forward and agreeing to a unanimous \nconsent request so that we can move forward in this body to pass \nterrorism insurance. We have been unable to do that. We have tried in \nmany different ways to do that. We have had the basic bill with two, \nthree, five amendments. We have been very willing to work with them in \nany way to move this forward.\n  The real estate industry, the insurance industry, and builders all \nover the country are desperate for this insurance. After September 11, \nmany businesses all over the country have been unable to go forward \nwith construction projects. So I hope this rule 14 on which we have \njust moved will allow us to have this legislation brought before the \nSenate, and we believe we have agreed to come forward with a bill. Some \nbelieve there should be tort reform. We have agreed in the underlying \nlegislation that we would agree there should not be punitive damages \nfor the money the Government puts forward. We have agreed to that. A \nlot of our constituents don't like that. We have consented to that.\n  If people believe more should be done, let them offer an amendment. \nWe can agree to a time agreement or not, but this legislation is very \nimportant to the economic viability and vitality of this country. I \nhope this effort will not be thwarted. This legislation has been pushed \nby Senators Dodd, Sarbanes, and Schumer, and it will go forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/07/senate-section/article/S5258-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5258-S5259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 2143\n\n  Mr. REID.
