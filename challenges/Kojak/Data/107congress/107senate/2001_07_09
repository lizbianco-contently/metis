It is the leader's expectation we will finish \nthis bill tomorrow. There are other appropriations bills we would like \nto finish this week also. In fact, the leader has every desire to \nfinish the Interior appropriations bill and the supplemental bill this \nweek. We will hear more from the leader at a subsequent time. But these \nare the two bills we must finish this week, and if we can finish them \nThursday, that will be fine. I am sure, if we can't, the leader will \nwant to go into Friday to complete the bills, or if it takes longer \nthan that. I think they are both capable of being finished very \nquickly.\n  There are no rollcall votes today. There will be no rollcall votes \nuntil 2:15 tomorrow after the party caucuses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/09/senate-section/article/S7293-8", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7293-S7294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  BIPARTISAN PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before we adjourned for the recess, the \nSenate passed the bipartisan McCain-Kennedy-Edwards Patients' Bill of \nRights and proved that protecting patients' rights is not a partisan \nissue. We can all be proud of the strong bipartisan compromises we \nreached which have the support of virtually every health care provider \ngroup in this country. This bill has achieved such overwhelming support \nbecause it represents a balanced approach to ensuring patient safety \nand health plan accountability\n\n[[Page S7294]]\n\nwithout significantly raising premiums or employer costs.\n  This landmark legislation will ensure that every privately insured \nAmerican can enjoy important patient protection. For example, the bill \nwill ensure that patients can have access to emergency room care; women \ncan easily access OB/GYN services; children can access the specialty \ncare they need; patients can access the prescription drugs prescribed \nfor them; patients can participate in potential lifesaving clinical \ntrials; patients can access necessary specialists, even if it means \ngoing out of the plan's provider network; chronically ill patients can \nreceive the specialty care they need in an attempt to save their lives; \npatients with ongoing health care needs have continuity of care; and \npatients can hold their managed care plan accountable when plan \ndecisions to withhold or limit care result in injury or death.\n  When I went home this past week people said, What does the bill do? \nBriefly, it is very old-fashioned in nature. It allows a doctor to \nrender care that that doctor believes is appropriate to take care of \nthat patient, whether it be prescribing drugs, whether it be surgery or \nother treatment. That is what the bill does.\n  Passage of this bill would not have been possible without the \ndedication and hard work of many people. First of all, the \ndistinguished majority leader, Mr. Daschle, was involved in this \nlegislation in its formative stage and every day we were in the \nChamber. I think this showed to the American public what most of us \nhave known for many years--that Senator Daschle really is a great \nleader. He indicated we were going to finish the bill before the Fourth \nof July break. Some people smiled, some snickered, and some thought it \nwould be totally impossible. But it was done. It was done with all \namendments being offered. Cloture was not filed. It was the way \nlegislation should move. We spent some long hours in this Chamber, but \nas a result of his leadership we were able to do this work. This is an \nissue on which he has been working for 5 years; for 5 years we have \nwaited to pass this meaningful and enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights \nthat will protect all privately insured Americans. And I say again, \nSenator Daschle was able to forge bipartisan support for this critical \nlegislation and ensure passage as a result of his patience.\n  We indeed also have to acknowledge the work done by the chairman of \nthe Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Senator Ted \nKennedy. He was on this floor every minute of every day not only for \nthe 2 weeks it took to pass the Patients' Bill of Rights but for 2 \nweeks prior to do the education bill. He has worked on this issue \nlonger than anyone, was able to confront every contentious amendment, \nand managed to keep the integrity of the bill totally intact. Senator \nKennedy did great work. It shows what a fine Senator he is. Those of us \nwho depend on him for leadership always have this bill to look to, to \nindicate what a great Senator he is.\n\n  Senator Kennedy has had wide experience. One of the leaders in this \nbill was someone without the experience of Senator Kennedy but who did \ngreat work: Senator Edwards of North Carolina. He proved his skill, his \nleadership, and his dedication to being a legislator by his work on \nthis meaningful Patients' Bill of Rights. He has, since he came to the \nSenate, been a tireless voice for America's patients, and I and the \nrest of America are grateful for his contributions to the rest of this \nlegislation.\n  Finally, I extend my thanks to Senator John McCain from the other \nside of the aisle. During his run for President of the United States, \nSenator McCain promised the American people he would work to pass a \nPatients' Bill of Rights, and he did that. His name was first on this \nbill and he was involved as we proceeded through this legislation. He \nhas been an extraordinary leader on this issue. Without his work, this \nbill would not have been possible.\n  It would not be fair to talk only about the proponents of this \nlegislation. Senator Judd Gregg did an outstanding job on this bill. He \nwas here the entire 2 weeks. He had some difficult issues to work \nthrough. I think he did an excellent job of bringing the amendments \nthat were meaningful to the floor at the right time. We were able to \nhave complete and fair debate. I always had great appreciation of him.\n  I served with Senator Gregg when he became a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives. He left to become a two-term Governor of the State of \nNew Hampshire. He came back--to the Senate.\n  I always had great respect for his abilities and certainly they were \nevident during the work he did on the Patients' Bill of Rights. Even \nthough he was on the losing side of votes on many of the amendments \nthat were offered, he was always a gentleman and a scholar. I think he \ndid himself and this Senate very well with his work.\n  The Senate-passed Patients' Bill of Rights contains every one of the \npatient protections listed in President Bush's statement of principles. \nI hope the House of Representatives will work towards swift passage of \nthis bill and that the President will sign into law this truly \nbipartisan legislation that will improve the quality of life for all \nAmericans.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will state the time until 12:30 \np.m. will be under the control of the Senator from Illinois, Mr. \nDurbin, or his designee, and from 12:30 p.m. until 1 p.m. the time will \nbe under the control of the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Thomas, or his \ndesignee.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator from Wyoming wishes to say a \nfew words, I am happy to yield him time under our time. How much time \ndoes the Senator want?\n  Mr. THOMAS. I was going to ask the question the President pro tempore \nhas already answered. Thank you.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from North Dakota has the rest of the time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, later this week and perhaps through the \nsummer we will have a discussion in both the Senate and the House about \na very controversial issue. This administration and this Government \nwill allow Mexican long-haul truckers to move across the border from \nMexico into this country to drive their trucks on the highways and \nbyways of this country unrestricted on the grounds that the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement requires us to do so. However, after \nsigning NAFTA the previous administration decided, because of serious \nsafety concerns, not to allow the Mexican truckers to come in \nunrestricted on America's highways. At the moment, we allow them to \ncross the border and operate only in a zone within 20-miles from the \nMexican border, on short-haul trucks.\n  The Bush administration is now going to lift that restriction. That \nis going to cause some very serious controversy. I want to explain \ntoday why that is an important issue.\n  A San Francisco Chronicle reporter named Robert Collier recently went \non a 3-day trip with a long-haul trucker in Mexico. His article in the \nSan Francisco Chronicle is quite interesting and quite revealing. I ask \nunanimous consent to have it printed at the conclusion of my remarks in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DORGAN. What is this issue of Mexican trucks coming into the \nUnited States? Why is it important and why will it provoke controversy? \nSimply, the issue is this: We inspect just 1 to 2 percent of the \nMexican trucks that come into this country and operate within the 20-\nmile restriction. And 36 percent of those Mexican trucks are turned \nback into Mexico for serious safety violations.\n  In other words, up to now, we have told Mexican truckers: We will not \nallow you to drive on American roads because you don't meet American \nsafety standards. Mr. President, 98 to 99 percent of the trucks were \nnever inspected at all because we do not have nearly enough inspectors \nat the border. But of those that were inspected, 36 percent were turned \nback into Mexico for serious safety violations.\n  Mexico has a regime of safety issues dealing with truckers that is \nvery lax. They are printed at the end of the article I previously \nmentioned. Let me run through a few of these. It says:\n\n[[Page S7295]]\n\n  Hours-of-service limits for drivers: In the United States, we limit \ntruckers to 10 hours of consecutive driving and then they must rest. \nThat is all you can do in the United States, 10 hours. In Mexico, the \nsky is the limit. In fact, this reporter rode with one Mexican long-\nhaul trucker for 3 days. In 3 days of driving a truck, the Mexican \ndriver slept 7 hours--7 hours in 3 days. There is no restriction on \nhours with respect to Mexican drivers and truckers.\n  Random drug tests: In the United States, yes for all drivers; in \nMexico, no.\n  Automatic disqualification for certain medical conditions: In the \nUnited States, yes; in Mexico, no.\n  Standardized logbooks: In the United States, yes, and you better fill \nthem out. In Mexico, virtually no truckers use a logbook. The new law \nis not enforced.\n  Maximum weight limit for trucks: In the United States, 80,000 pounds; \nin Mexico, 135,000 pounds.\n  The point is, under NAFTA, it has been determined that the United \nStates should allow Mexican long-haul truckers into this country \nunrestricted. I wonder if you want a Mexican trucker in your rear-view \nmirror on an American interstate, coming down the highway with \nquestionable brakes, with questionable equipment, in a circumstance \nwhere over a third of all the trucks that we have inspected--and we \nhave only inspected an infinitesimal number--over a third of them have \nbeen found to have serious safety violations.\n  This isn't rocket science. Of course, we should not allow \nunrestricted long-haul truckers to come into this country on America's \nroads; not until they meet all the requirements for safety that we \nrequire of our own trucking companies and our own drivers. This is not \na hard question.\n  On the appropriations bill in the House of Representatives there was \nan amendment added that prohibits funding for permitting Mexican \ntruckers to come into this country on an unrestricted basis. I have \nindicated I intend to offer a similar amendment in the Senate. I have \noffered stand-alone legislation which is more comprehensive than that, \nbut it seems to me it is useful to offer language identical to that of \nthe House because then it would be non-conferenceable and the \nrestriction would become law when the appropriations bill is signed.\n  Senator Murray, the chair of the Transportation Appropriations \nsubcommittee, talked to me and I know she is working on some language. \nI have not yet had an opportunity to see what that language is, but I \nappreciate the work she is doing. I hope when the appropriations bill \nleaves the Senate, we will have included similar or identical language \nto that in the House; language that says we will not allow Mexican \nlong-haul trucks into this country on an unrestricted basis \njeopardizing the safety of Americans who are driving on the roads--\nvirtually all citizens who are driving on our roads. We do not want \nthese safety questions to have to be in their minds.\n  This is a very important issue. It is one more evidence of a trade \nstrategy that is inherently weak, that trades away our interests. How \ncan we adopt a trade policy with another country that says: Oh, by the \nway, we will not allow anything that reflects safety issues from one \nside or the other to come in the way of trade?\n  It doesn't make any sense to me.\n  This is a paramount example of trading away our ability to make \nsafety on America's roads something that is of significant concern. We \nhave not gotten to the position of requiring safety equipment, driver's \nlogs, and hours of service restrictions just because we want to \nregulate; we did it out of concern for safety. When you are driving \ndown the road and have an 18-wheel truck behind you full of tons and \ntons of material, you want to make sure that truck has been inspected, \nthat the truck has safety equipment, and that the truck is not going to \ncome through the back of your car right up to the rearview mirror if \nyou happen to put on your brakes in an emergency.\n  This is an important issue on its own. Giving up our ability to \ndecide whether we will allow unsafe trucks to enter United States \nhighways from Mexico is almost unforgivable. But it is part and parcel \nof a trade policy that has been bankrupt for a long while.\n  That brings me to another question about trade agreements. The \nadministration is talking a lot now about fast-track. They want fast-\ntrack ability to do new trade agreements. I have some advice for them. \nI say: If you really want to fast-track something, why don't you fast-\ntrack solving some trade problems that you, along with previous \nadministrations, have created through signing past trade agreements. \nDon't deal with Congress if you need fast-track legislative authority \nfor anybody or anything; deal with fast-track trade solutions yourself.\n  Let me give you some examples of issues that the Administration might \nwant to fast-track.\n  Today, in Canada, they are loading trucks and railroad cars full of \nmolasses to bring into the United States. The molasses is loaded with \nBrazilian sugar and sent to Canada so it can be added to molasses. The \nmolasses is a carrier that is used to circumvent our quota on sugar \nimports. They subvert the sugar quota by sending Brazilian sugar \nthrough Canada loaded as molasses. It is called stuffed molasses. It is \nfundamentally unfair trade, but we can not get anything done about it.\n  If you want fast track, let's fast track a solution to solving the \nstuffed molasses scheme.\n  Fast track: How about this? Do you know how many American movies we \ngot into China last year? Ten. Ten American movies got into China--a \ncountry with an $80 billion trade surplus with the United States. This \nis intellectual property. It is entertainment. We got 10 movies into \nChina because they say: That is all you can get into our country.\n  What about the issue of automobiles? Do you know how many automobiles \nwe bought from Korea last year? Americans bought 450,000 cars from \ncompanies building cars in Korea. Do you know how many United States-\nproduced cars were sold in the country of Korea last year? Twelve \nhundred--four hundred and fifty thousand to twelve hundred. Why? \nBecause Korea doesn't want American cars in Korea. So they ship us \ntheir cars and then keep our cars out.\n  How about something more parochial that comes from the rich soil of \nthe Red River Valley that I represent? They grow wonderful potatoes--\nthe best potatoes in the world. One of the things you can do with \npotatoes is make potato flakes and ship those flakes around the world. \nThey are used in fast food. So you try to ship potato flakes to Korea. \nGuess what you find. Shipping potato flakes to Korea means that Korea \nimposes a 300-percent tariff on potato flakes. Imagine that. Poor \nlittle potato flakes with a 300-percent tariff.\n  In all of the issues about tariffs, everybody talks about tariffs and \nreducing tariffs. Twelve years after we reached a beef agreement with \nJapan--a country that every year has a $50 billion to $80 billion trade \nsurpluses with us--there still remains on every pound of T-bone steaks \nsent to Tokyo a 38.5-percent tariff. Can you imagine that? Every pound \nof American beef getting into Japan still has a 38.5-percent tariff. \nWhen they reached the beef agreement, my God, you would have thought \nthey had just won the Olympics. They had dinners and congratulated each \nother--good for all of these folks who reach trade agreements. Yet, \ntwelve years later, we still have a 38.5-percent tariff on every single \npound of beef we send to Japan.\n\n  That is just a sample. Potato flakes, cars to Korea, beef to Japan, \nstuffed molasses from Canada, and movies to China--you name it.\n  I say to those who come to us saying we want fast track: look, you \ndon't need fast track from Congress. I am sure not going to give it to \nyou. You don't deserve it. You have constructed trade agreements that, \nNo. 1, threaten safety in this country by saying to us in those \nagreements you have to let trucks that are fundamentally unsafe come in \nfrom Mexico. You constructed trade agreements that have allowed the \nCanadians to dump durum wheat across our border.\n  I have told the story repeatedly--it bears telling again--of driving \nup to the border in a little 12-year-old orange truck with a farmer \nnamed Earl Jenson, and all the way to the Canadian border we saw 18-\nwheeler after 18-wheeler hauling Canadian durum wheat south. It was \nsuch a windy day that the\n\n[[Page S7296]]\n\ngrain was coming out from under the tarps of these big semis hauling \nCanadian durum wheat, splattering against our windshield every time we \nmet one. I counted a lot of trucks coming from the other border.\n  When we got to the border with the 12-year-old 2-ton orange truck \nwith a small amount of durum on it, we were told: You can't take that \ninto Canada. You can't take American durum wheat into Canada. So we got \nturned around with the little 12-year-old orange truck, despite the \nfact that all of these semis all day long came down from Canada--\nevidence, it seems to me, of just one more thorn that exists in this \ntrade circumstance, one more burr under the saddle for all those \nfarmers and ranchers out there who have been taken by unfair trade \nagreements negotiated by our trade negotiators who should have known \nbetter, by trade negotiators who did not seem to stand up for this \ncountry's interest in the final agreement. They were more interested in \ngetting an agreement than they were in getting a fair agreement.\n  Again, I say to the Trade Ambassador and others, if you want fast \ntrack, hold up a mirror and say this in the morning: Fast track for me \nmeans solving trade problems, solving the Canadian durum problem, \nsolving the Canadian stuffed molasses problem, solving the problem of \nour getting cars into Korea, potato flakes into Korea, movies into \nChina, and beef into Japan.\n  I can stand here and cite a couple of dozen more, if you like.\n  Show us you can solve problems rather than creating problems, then \ncome back to us and talk. But don't suggest to me that we do something \nfor you to negotiate a new agreement unless you have solved the \nproblems of the old trade agreements--yes, GATT, NAFTA, you name it, \nright on down the road.\n  I have always, when I have spoken about trade, threatened to suggest \nthat we require our trade negotiators to wear uniforms. In the \nOlympics, they wear a jersey. It says ``U.S.A.'' across the chest. So \nat least in some quiet moment in some negotiating meeting someplace, \nthese trade negotiators who seem so quick to lose are willing to look \ndown and see whom they really represent.\n\n  Will Rogers used to say, ``The United States of America has never \nlost a war and never won a conference.'' He surely must have been \nthinking about our trade negotiators, because in agreement after \nagreement after agreement we seem to end up on the short end.\n  That is especially true with a trade agreement that now puts us in a \ncircumstance where we are told we are supposed to allow Mexican long-\nhaul trucks to come into this country under the provisions of the trade \nagreement notwithstanding the safety issues. That is not fair. It is \nnot right. To do so would not be standing up for the best interests of \nthe American people.\n  We are going to have a fight about this. We are going to have \ncontroversy about it. But as I said when I started, this ought not be \nrocket science. We cannot and should not decide that these trade \nagreements either force us or allow us to sacrifice the basic safety of \nthe American people. It doesn't matter whether it is safety on the \nroads, safety with respect to food inspection, you name it. We cannot \nand should not allow these trade agreements to force us to sacrifice \nsafety.\n  We should insist just once and for a change that our trade \nnegotiators stand up for this country's interest. There is nothing \ninappropriate and nothing that ought to persuade us to be ashamed of \nstanding up for our best economic interests. Yes, we can do that in a \nway that enriches all of the world and in a way that helps pull others \nup and assist others in need.\n  We can do that, but we also ought to understand we have people in \nneed in this country. American family farmers are going broke. We have \nall kinds of people losing their jobs in the manufacturing sector. \nManufacturing is a sector in this country that is very important and \nhas been diminishing rather than expanding.\n  So let's decide to do the right thing with respect to trade. I want \nexpanded trade. I want robust trade. I do not believe we should \nconstruct walls. I do not believe that a protectionist--using the \npejorative term--is someone who enhances this country's interests. But \nusing the term ``protection,'' let me just be quick to point out there \nis nothing wrong with protecting our country's best interests with \nrespect to trade agreements that will work for this country.\n  So we will have this discussion this week on the Transportation \nAppropriations bill, that will be under the able leadership of Senator \nMurray. My expectation is we will resolve this in a way that is \nthoughtful and in a way that expresses common sense in dealing with \nMexican long-haul truckers coming into this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n            [From the San Francisco Chronicle, Mar. 4, 2001]\n\nMexico's Trucks on Horizon--Long-Distance Haulers Are Headed into U.S. \n                        Once Bush Opens Borders\n\n                          (By Robert Collier)\n\n       Altar Desert, Mexico.--[Editor's Note: This week, the Bush \n     administration is required by NAFTA to announce that Mexican \n     long-haul trucks will be allowed onto U.S. highways--where \n     they have long been banned over concerns about safety--rather \n     than stopping at the border. The Chronicle sent a team to get \n     the inside story before the trucks start to roll.]\n       It was sometime way after midnight in the middle of \n     nowhere, and a giddy Manuel Marquez was at the wheel of 20 \n     tons of hurtling, U.S.-bound merchandise.\n       The lights of oncoming trucks flared into a blur as they \n     whooshed past on the narrow, two-lane highway, mere inches \n     from the left mirror of his truck. Also gone in a blur were \n     Marquez's past two days, a nearly Olympic ordeal of driving \n     with barely a few hours of sleep.\n       ``Ayy, Mexico!'' Marquez exclaimed as he slammed on the \n     brakes around a hilly curve, steering around another truck \n     that had stopped in the middle of the lane, its hood up and \n     its driver nonchalantly smoking a cigarette. ``We have so \n     much talent to share with the Americans--and so much \n     craziness.''\n       Several hours ahead in the desert darkness was the border, \n     the end of Marquez's 1,800-mile run. At Tijuana, he would \n     deliver his cargo, wait for another load, then head back \n     south.\n       But soon, Marquez and other Mexican truckers will be able \n     to cross the border instead of turning around. Their feats of \n     long-distance stamina--and, critics fear, endangerment of \n     public safety--are coming to a California freeway near you.\n       Later this week, the Bush administration is expected to \n     announce that it will open America's highways to Mexican \n     long-haul trucks, thus ending a long fight by U.S. truckers \n     and highway safety advocates to keep them out.\n       Under limitations imposed by the United States since 1982, \n     Mexican vehicles are allowed passage only within a narrow \n     border commercial zone, where they must transfer their cargo \n     to U.S.-based long-haul trucks and drivers.\n       The lifting of the ban--ordered last month by an \n     arbitration panel of the North American Free Trade \n     Agreement--has been at the center of one of the most high-\n     decibel issues in the U.S.-Mexico trade relationship.\n       Will the end of the ban endanger American motorists by \n     bringing thousands of potentially unsafe Mexican trucks to \n     U.S. roads? Or will it reduce the costs of cross-border trade \n     and end U.S. protectionism with no increase in accidents?\n       Two weeks ago, as the controversy grew, Marquez's employer, \n     Transportes Castores, allowed a Chronicle reporter and \n     photographer to join him on a typical run from Mexico City to \n     the border.\n       The three-day, 1,800 mile journey offered a window into a \n     part of Mexico that few Americans ever see--the life of \n     Mexican truckers, a resourceful, long-suffering breed who, \n     from all indications, do not deserve their pariah status \n     north of the border.\n       But critics of the border opening would also find proof of \n     their concerns about safety:\n       --American inspectors at the border are badly undermanned \n     and will be hard-pressed to inspect more than a fraction of \n     the incoming Mexican truckers.\n       California--which has a much more rigorous truck inspection \n     program than Arizona, New Mexico or Texas, the other border \n     states--gave full inspections to only 2 percent of the \n     920,000 short-haul trucks allowed to enter from Mexico last \n     year.\n       Critics say the four states will be overwhelmed by the \n     influx of Mexican long-haul trucks, which are expected to \n     nearly double the current volume of truck traffic at the \n     border.\n       --Most long-distance Mexican trucks are relatively modern, \n     but maintenance is erratic.\n       Marquez's truck, for example, was a sleek, 6-month-old, \n     Mexican-made Kenworth, equal to most trucks north of the \n     border. But his windshield was cracked--a safety violation \n     that would earn him a ticket in the United States but had \n     been ignored by his company since it occurred two months ago.\n       A recent report by the U.S. Transportation Department said \n     35 percent of Mexican trucks that entered the United States \n     last year were ordered off the road by inspectors for safety \n     violations such as faulty brakes and lights.\n       --Mexico's domestic truck-safety regulation is extremely \n     lax. Mexico has no functioning truck weigh stations, and \n     Marquez\n\n[[Page S7297]]\n\n     said federal police appear to have abandoned a program of \n     random highway inspections that was inaugurated with much \n     fanfare last fall.\n       --Almost all Mexican long-haul drivers are forced to work \n     dangerously long hours.\n       Marquez was a skillful driver, with lightning reflexes \n     honed by road conditions that would make U.S. highways seem \n     like cruise-control paradise. But he was often steering \n     through a thick fog of exhaustion.\n       In Mexico, no logbooks--required in the United States to \n     keep track of hours and itinerary--are kept.\n       ``We're just like American truckers, I'm sure,'' Marquez \n     said with a grin. ``We're neither saints nor devils. But \n     we're good drivers, that's for sure, or we'd all be dead.''\n       Although no reliable statistics exist for the Bay Area's \n     trade with Mexico, it is estimated that the region's exports \n     and imports with Mexico total $6 billion annually. About 90 \n     percent of that amount moves by truck, in tens of thousands \n     of round trips to and from the border.\n       Under the decades-old border restrictions, long-haul trucks \n     from either side must transfer their loads to short-haul \n     ``drayage'' truckers, who cross the border and transfer the \n     cargo again to long-haul domestic trucks. The complicated \n     arrangement is costly and time-consuming, making imported \n     goods more expensive for U.S. consumers.\n       Industry analysts say that after the ban is lifted, most of \n     the two nations' trade will be done by Mexican drivers, who \n     come much cheaper than American truckers because they earn \n     only about one-third the salary and typically drive about 20 \n     hours per day.\n       Although Mexican truckers would have to obey the U.S. legal \n     limit of 10 hours consecutive driving when in the United \n     States, safety experts worry that northbound drivers will be \n     so sleep-deprived by the time they cross the border that the \n     American limit will be meaningless. Mexican drivers would \n     not, however, be bound by U.S. labor laws, such as the \n     minimum wage.\n       ``Are you going to be able to stay awake?'' Marcos Munoz, \n     vice president of Transportes Castores jokingly asked a \n     Chronicle reporter before the trip. ``Do you want some \n     pingas?''\n       The word is slang for uppers the stimulant pills that are \n     commonly used by Mexican truckers. Marquez, however, needed \n     only a few cups of coffee to stay awake through three \n     straight 21-hour days at the wheel.\n       Talking with his passengers, chatting on the CB radio with \n     friends, and listening to tapes of 1950s and 1960s ranchera \n     and bolero music, he showed few outward signs of fatigue.\n       But the 46-year-old Marquez, who has been a trucker for 25 \n     years, admitted that the burden occasionally is too much.\n       ``Don't kid yourself,'' he said late the third night. \n     ``Sometimes, you get so tired, so worn, your head just \n     falls.''\n       U.S. highway safety groups predict an increase in accidents \n     after the border is opened.\n       ``Even now, there aren't enough safety inspectors available \n     for all crossing points,'' said David Golden, a top official \n     of the National Association of Independent Insurers, the main \n     insurance-industry lobby.\n       ``So we need to make sure that when you're going down \n     Interstate 5 with an 80,000-pound Mexican truck in your \n     rearview mirror and you have to jam on your brakes, that \n     truck doesn't come through your window.''\n       Golden said the Bush administration should delay the \n     opening to Mexican trucks until border facilities are \n     upgraded.\n       California highway safety advocates concur, saying the \n     California Highway Patrol--which carries out the state's \n     truck inspections--needs to be given more inspectors and \n     larger facilities to check incoming trucks' brakes, lights \n     and other safety functions.\n       Marquez's trip started at his company's freight yard in \n     Tlalnepantla, an industrial suburb of Mexico City. There, his \n     truck was loaded with a typical variety of cargo--electronic \n     components and handicrafts bound for Los Angeles, and \n     chemicals, printing equipment and industrial parts for \n     Tijuana.\n       At the compound's gateway was a shrine with statues of the \n     Virgin Mary and Jesus. As he drove past, Marquez crossed \n     himself, then crossed himself again before the small Virgin \n     on his dashboard.\n       ``Just in case, you know,'' he said. ``The devil is always \n     on the loose on these roads.''\n       In fact, Mexican truckers have to brave a wide variety of \n     dangers.\n       As he drove through the high plateaus of central Mexico, \n     Marquez pointed out where he was hijacked a year ago--held up \n     at gunpoint by robbers who pulled alongside him in another \n     truck. His trailer full of canned tuna--easy to fence, he \n     said--was stolen, along with all his personal belongings.\n       What's worse, some thieves wear uniforms.\n       On this trip, the truck had to pass 14 roadblocks, at which \n     police and army soldiers searched the cargo for narcotics. \n     Each time, Marquez stood on tiptoes to watch over their \n     shoulders. He said, ``You have to have quick eyes, or they'll \n     take things out of the packages.''\n       Twice, police inspectors asked for bribes--``something for \n     the coffee,'' they said. Each time, he refused and got away \n     with it.\n       ``You're good luck for me,'' he told a Chronicle reporter. \n     ``They ask for money but then see an American and back off. \n     Normally, I have to pay a lot.''\n       Although the Mexican government has pushed hard to end the \n     border restrictions, the Mexican trucking industry is far \n     from united behind that position. Large trucking companies \n     such as Transportes Castores back the border opening, while \n     small and medium-size ones oppose it.\n       ``We're ready for the United States, and we'll be driving \n     to Los Angeles and San Francisco,'' said Munoz, the company's \n     vice president.\n       ``Our trucks are modern and can pass the U.S. inspections. \n     Only about 10 companies here could meet the U.S. standards.''\n       The border opening has been roundly opposed by CANACAR, the \n     Mexican national trucking industry association, which says it \n     will result in U.S. firms taking over Mexico's trucking \n     industry.\n       ``The opening will allow giant U.S. truck firms to buy \n     large Mexican firms and crush smaller ones,'' said Miguel \n     Quintanilla, CANACAR's president. ``We're at a disadvantage, \n     and those who benefit will be the multinationals.''\n       Quintanilla said U.S. firms will lower their current costs \n     by replacing their American drivers with Mexicans, yet will \n     use the huge American advantages--superior warehouse and \n     inventory-tracking technology, superior warehouse and \n     inventory-tracking technology, superior access to financing \n     and huge economies of scale-to-drive Mexican companies out of \n     business.\n       Already, some U.S. trucking giants such as M.S. Carriers, \n     Yellow Corp. and Consolidated Freightways Corp. have invested \n     heavily in Mexico.\n       ``The opening of the border will bring about the \n     consolidation of much of the trucking industry on both sides \n     of the border,'' said the leading U.S. academic expert on \n     NAFTA trucking issues, James Giermanski, a professor at \n     Belmont Abbey College in Raleigh, N.C.\n       The largest U.S. firms will pair with large Mexican firms \n     and will dominate U.S.-Mexico traffic, he said.\n       But Giermanski added that the increase in long-haul cross-\n     border traffic will be slower than either critics or \n     advocates expect, because of language difficulties, Mexico's \n     inadequate insurance coverage and Mexico's time-consuming \n     system of customs brokers.\n       ``All the scare stories you've heard are just ridiculous,'' \n     he said. ``The process will take a long time.''\n       In California, many truckers fear for their jobs. However, \n     Teamsters union officials say they are trying to persuade \n     their members that Marquez and his comrades are not the \n     enemy.\n       ``There will be a very vehement reaction by our members if \n     the border is opened,'' said Chuck Mack, president of \n     Teamsters Joint Council 7, which has 55,000 members in the \n     Bay Area.\n       ``But we're trying to diminish the animosity that by \n     focusing on the overall problem--how (the opening) will help \n     multinational corporations to exploit drivers on both sides \n     of the border.''\n       Mexican drivers, however, are likely to welcome the \n     multinationals' increased efficiency, which will enable them \n     to earn more by wasting less time waiting for loading and \n     paperwork.\n       For example, in Mexico City, Marquez had to wait more than \n     four hours for stevedores to load his truck and for clerks to \n     prepare the load's documents--a task that would take perhaps \n     an hour for most U.S. trucking firms.\n       For drivers, time is money, Marquez's firm pays drivers a \n     percentage of gross freight charges, minus some expenses. His \n     three-day trip would net him about $300. His average monthly \n     income is about $1,400--decent money in Mexico, but by no \n     means middle class.\n       Most Mexican truckers are represented by a union, but it is \n     nearly always ineffectual--what Transportes Castores \n     executives candidly described as a ``company union.'' A few \n     days before this trip, Transportes Castores fired 20 drivers \n     when they protested delays in reimbursement of fuel costs.\n       But Marquez didn't much like talking about his problems. He \n     preferred to discuss his only child, a 22-year-old daughter \n     who is in her first year of undergraduate medical school in \n     Mexico City.\n       Along with paternal pride was sadness.\n       ``Don't congratulate me,'' he said. ``My wife is the one \n     who raised her. I'm gone most of the time. You have to have a \n     very strong marriage, because this job is hell on a wife.\n       ``The money is OK, and I really like being out on the open \n     road, but the loneliness . . .'' He left the thought \n     unfinished, and turned up the volume on his cassette deck.\n       It was playing Pedro Infante, the famous bolero balladeer, \n     and Marquez began to sing.\n       ``The moon of my nights has hidden itself.\n       ``Oh little heavenly virgin, I am your son.\n       ``Give me your consolation,\n       ``Today, when I'm suffering out in the world.''\n       Despite the melancholy tone, Marquez soon became jovial and \n     energetic. He smiled widely and encouraged his passengers to \n     sing along. Forgoing his normal caution, he accelerated \n     aggressively on the curves.\n       His voice rose, filling the cabin, drowning out the hiss of \n     the pavement below and the rush of the wind that was blowing \n     him inexorably toward the border.\n\n\n               How NAFTA Ended the Ban On Mexico's Trucks\n\n       The North American Free Trade Agreement, which went into \n     effect in January 1994, stipulated that the longtime U.S. \n     restrictions on Mexican trucks be lifted.\n       Under NAFTA, by December 1995, Mexican trucks would be \n     allowed to deliver loads all\n\n[[Page S7298]]\n\n     over the four U.S. border states--California, Arizona, New \n     Mexico and Texas--and to pick up loads for their return trip \n     to Mexico. U.S. trucking firms would get similar rights to \n     travel in Mexico. And by January 2000, Mexican trucks would \n     be allowed throughout the United States.\n       However, bowing to pressure from the Teamsters union and \n     the insurance industry, President Clinton blocked \n     implementation of the NAFTA provisions. The Mexican \n     government retaliated by imposing a similar ban on U.S. \n     trucks.\n       As a result, the longtime status quo continues: Trucks from \n     either side must transfer their loads to short-haul \n     ``drayage'' truckers, who cross the border and transfer the \n     cargo again to long-haul domestic trucks.\n       The complicated arrangement is time-consuming and \n     expensive. Mexico estimates its losses at $2 billion \n     annually; U.S. shippers say they have incurred similar costs.\n       In 1998, Mexico filed a formal complaint under NAFTA, \n     saying the U.S. ban violated the trade pact and was mere \n     protectionism. The convoluted complaint process lasted nearly \n     six years, until a three-person arbitration panel finally \n     ruled Feb. 6 that the United States must lift its ban by \n     March 8 or allow Mexico to levy punitive tariffs on U.S. \n     exports.\n\n\n                     COMPARING TRUCKING REGULATIONS\n\n       The planned border opening to Mexican trucks will pose a \n     big challenge to U.S. inspectors, who will check to be sure \n     that trucks from Mexico abide by stricter U.S. truck-safety \n     regulations. Here are some of the differences:\n       Hours-of-service limits for drivers--In U.S.: yes. Ten \n     hours' consecutive driving, up to 15 consecutive hours on \n     duty, 8 hours' consecutive rest, maximum of 70 hours' driving \n     in eight-day period; in Mexico: no.\n       Driver's age--In U.S.: 21 is minimum for interstate \n     trucking; in Mexico: 18.\n       Random drug test--In U.S.: yes, for all drivers; in Mexico: \n     no. Automatic disqualification for certain medical conditions \n     in U.S.: yes; in Mexico: no.\n       Logbooks--In U.S.: yes, standardized logbooks with date \n     graphs are required and part of inspection criteria; in \n     Mexico: a new law requiring logbooks is not enforced, and \n     virtually no truckers use them.\n       Maximum weight limit (in pounds)--In U.S.: 80,000; in \n     Mexico: 135,000.\n       Roadside inspections--In U.S.: yes; in Mexico: an \n     inspection program began last year but has been discontinued.\n       Out-of-service rules for safety deficiencies--In U.S.: yes; \n     in Mexico: not currently, program to be phased in over two \n     years.\n       Hazardous materials regulations--In U.S.: a strict \n     standards, training, licensure and inspection regime; in \n     Mexico: much laxer program with far fewer identified \n     chemicals and substances, and fewer licensure requirements.\n       Vehicle safety standards--In U.S.: comprehensive standards \n     for components such as antilock brakes, underride guards, \n     night visibility of vehicle; in Mexico: newly enacted \n     standards for vehicle inspections are voluntary for the first \n     year and less rigorous than U.S. rules.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The time under the control of \nthe majority has expired.\n  Under the previous order, the time until 1 p.m. shall be under the \ncontrol of the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Thomas, or his designee.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I am going to talk about two different \nsubjects this morning. The two subjects are the energy crisis, No. 1, \nand, No. 2, the situation in the Middle East. There is some connection \nbetween those two, and I will go into that in a moment. But I would \nlike to treat them as separate subjects and begin with the discussion \nof what I still refer to as the energy crisis. My colleague from \nWyoming, Senator Thomas, will be addressing that briefly as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/09/senate-section/article/S7298-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7298-S7300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE ENERGY CRISIS\n\n  Mr. KYL. I suspect that most of my colleagues, as myself, talked to a \nlot of our constituents over the Fourth of July recess who reminded us \nof the fact that out in America there is still a problem with an energy \nshortage. I know I had to gas up my vehicle, as did a lot of other \nAmericans, when I drove up to the mountains in Arizona. I had a \nwonderful time. I marched in a Fourth of July parade in Show Low, AZ, \nreally the heart of America as far as I am concerned. Folks out there \nare still concerned because they recognize that Washington is \ndithering; that we are not doing anything to solve the problem of an \nenergy shortage in this country.\n  Some people may call it a crisis; other people may not; but the fact \nis we have had a wake-up call. The question is, Will we answer the call \nor are we simply going to dither around, ignore it, and play partisan \npolitics?\n  My own view is that there is no better opportunity for us to show \nbipartisanship, to work together toward a solution to a common problem \nthat affects all Americans, than working together to solve this energy \nshortage problem.\n  This is something on which the administration has weighed in. They \nhave taken the issue very seriously. Very early in his term, the \nPresident asked Vice President Cheney to convene a group of people to \ncome up with some suggestions on what we could do--both short term and \nlong term--to address this energy shortage problem.\n  The Vice President, along with a lot of others, came up with a series \nof recommendations which I would like to have us consider in the \nSenate. They are recommendations which deal with new production, with \nconservation--a majority of the recommendations, incidentally, deal \nwith conservation, even though that has largely been ignored in the \nmedia--and recommendations dealing with new energy sources, something \nin which I am very interested--hydrogen fuel cells, and a whole lot of \nthings.\n  The fact is, this is a serious effort. While the Republicans held the \nmajority in the Senate, a bill was introduced which embodied many of \nthese recommendations. Under the then-Republican leadership, it was \ngoing to be our program to take up that energy legislation in this \nSenate Chamber starting today or tomorrow. Sadly, that is not going to \nhappen. The Democratic leadership announced some time ago that it had \ndifferent priorities and that the Senate Chamber would not be the place \nfor debate about the energy shortage the week following the Fourth of \nJuly recess.\n  It is my understanding that hearings have been scheduled and both the \nFinance Committee and the Energy Committee will be taking up different \npieces of legislation. There will be hearings on the administration's \nplan, as well as other ideas. And that is good. But we need to deal \nwith this problem while we have had this wake-up call and not kick it \nto the back burner where we will forget about it and then, in another \nyear or two, realize we wasted a couple of years that could have been \nspent in finding new energy sources, putting them into play, and \nproviding an opportunity for Americans to enjoy the kind of prosperity \nwe can enjoy with the proper mix of good energy sources.\n\n  There are basically two issues. One deals with the cost of producing \nelectricity and how that electricity will be produced. The other has to \ndo with the reality that Americans are going to use a great deal of \nenergy--petroleum products primarily, and primarily for transportation. \nThat is not going to change in the near term, despite the fact that \nover the long run we will have to come up with some alternatives.\n  I mentioned hydrogen fuel cells as one of those possibilities. It is \na little closer than I think most people would recognize. We put money \ninto basic research at the Federal Government level. The administration \nhas pushed for that as part of their energy plan. I hope we can move \ndown that path.\n  But in the meantime, we have to be realistic about the fact that \nAmericans are going to continue to drive their automobiles. We are \ngoing to have to continue to have gasoline. We cannot wish that problem \naway. The question is, Do we rely strictly on the sources of oil from \nthe Middle East, for example, or do we recognize that it really puts us \nbehind the 8 ball if the OPEC countries want to constrain supplies and \nincrease prices? Or if there is jeopardy to those sources from military \nconflict, will we have to once again send our troops and spend a great \ndeal of energy and money to protect those energy sources as we did \nduring the Persian Gulf war? That is one path we can take.\n  There are some in this country who would have us ignore the potential \nfor energy development in this country. I think we ought to have a plan \nthat both recognizes the potential within the United States for oil \nproduction as well as buying what we can on the market internationally.\n  The other aspect of that problem is refineries. We have not built new \nrefineries in this country for 20 to 25 years. We have actually had \nsome shut down. As one of my Democratic colleagues said during a \nhearing in the Finance Committee a couple weeks ago, she is a\n\n[[Page S7299]]\n\nlittle disappointed about the fact that there is criticism of \nrefineries making money. She said: What are my business folks in my \nState to do--be in the business to lose money? The fact is, they are in \nthe business to make money. In the process of making money, they make \npetroleum products that we demand when we go to the service station.\n  When I filled up my vehicle last week, I wanted gasoline to be in \nthat pump so I could drive my family where we were going. We have a lot \nof demand in this country. It is we who have the demand, not the oil \ncompanies. They are the ones that provide the product and the \nrefineries that refine that product so that we can meet our demand. Yet \nthere is a great deal of criticism about anybody who would make money \nin producing one of these products. That is the only way we get the \nproducts.\n  The free market system has served us well. We ought to be very \ncareful about denigrating the suppliers who have made it possible for \nus to enjoy our standard of living.\n  So my view, just to summarize, is that we should consider the \nPresident's recommendations in a bipartisan spirit. We should move \nalong quickly with the hearings that I understand have been scheduled. \nAnd we should bring to this Senate Chamber, as soon as possible, the \nlegislation or other recommendations that will enable us to deal with \nthis issue now, when we have had the wake-up call, and not kick it down \nthe road a couple years to when we can see some real problems not just \nin the State of California but spreading throughout this country in \nenergy cost increases, potential blackouts and brownouts, and the like. \nThis is the time to deal with that problem.\n  Mr. President, to conclude, I rise today to express my concern that \nthe Senate Democratic leadership has not yet scheduled floor time to \nallow the full Senate to promptly address the energy crisis that \nthreatens all Americans. Having just returned from the July 4th recess \nin Arizona, I can tell you that not all Americans share the view that \nthis should be a low legislative priority. Most of them want to deal \nwith the problem in a bipartisan way.\n  Because of its effect on the national economy as well as peoples' \nindividual pocketbooks, I am particularly troubled that the energy \ncrisis seems to take a back seat to other issues on the new \nleadership's agenda. This is not the bipartisanship those leaders urged \nwhen they were in the minority.\n  The United States faces the most serious energy shortage since the \noil embargoes of the 1970s. We all know about California's problems \nwith rolling blackouts and soaring energy bills. The President thought \nit important enough to travel to California last month to address this \nproblem firsthand. Unfortunately, energy shortages and price increases \nare spreading to other parts of the country.\n  I want to make it as clear as I can that we should quickly address \nthe energy recommendations offered by the administration. With oil \nconsumption expected to grow by over six million barrels per day over \nthe next 20 years, natural gas consumption to jump 50 percent and \nelectricity demands to rise by 45 percent, we must act aggressively to \nincrease production in each of these areas before the entire nation \nsuffers from the shortfall. Just to meet expected electricity demands, \nfor example, we must begin now to build between 1,300 and 1,900 new \npower plants over the next 20 years.\n  To address this reality, we should act now on the 105 recommendations \nof Vice President Cheney's energy task force. This plan makes 45 \nrecommendations to modernize and increase conservation through tax \ncredits and the expansion of Energy Department conservation programs. \nIt proposes 35 ways to diversify our energy supply and expand our \ninfrastructure by encouraging new pipelines, generating plants and \nrefineries, and streamlining our regulatory process. And this proposal \nstrengthens America's national security by decreasing our dependence on \nforeign oil through increased energy production within our borders.\n  Some opponents of the President and Vice President rely on ad hominem \nattacks, misinformation, and demagoguery to cast aspersions on the \nadministration's proposals. They claim that, because the President and \nVice President were once connected to the oil business, they somehow \nare disqualified from energy discussions. On the contrary--these are \npeople who actually know something firsthand about the problems in the \nenergy industry. They do not benefit personally from efforts to \nincrease energy production.\n  Opponents of this energy strategy applaud the recent imposition of \nprice caps to the western states. However, price caps do nothing to \nincrease energy supplies, and could very well discourage investment in \nnew generation power production by artificially limiting a producer's \nreturn on his or her investment. Indeed, California's two largest \nutilities are basically bankrupt as a result of artificial price caps \non retail electricity prices. I am particularly concerned about \nprice caps because Arizona, unlike California, has moved aggressively \nto permit new power plants needed to satisfy the state's growing demand \nfor electricity. FERC's recent imposition of price caps could result in \ndelayed construction or cancellation of these new facilities.\n\n  Opponents also say that the President's proposal will not encourage \nconservation. As an Arizonan, I certainly support commonsense \nconservation efforts that help preserve our natural resources. But \nthese opponents must not have read the President's plan, for he devotes \nthe bulk of his recommendations to efforts to enhance conservation. \nAmong many provisions, the administration endorses tax credits to \nencourage use of more energy efficient products, such as hybrid or \nfuel-cell vehicles. It extends conservation programs in the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy. It \nincreases funding for conservation technologies and orders federal \nagencies to reduce their energy usage by at least 10 percent. In total, \nthe administration proposes $795 million for conservation programs as \npart of its overall budget allocation for the Department of Energy.\n  While these conservation efforts are important, we must also \nacknowledge that we cannot conserve our way out of an energy crisis. \nCalifornia has dramatically reduced its electricity use over the last \ntwo months, yet still faces the possibility of rolling blackouts. We \nmust increase supply in the near-term or face even worse shortages than \nwe have now.\n  Opponents also claim that we can meet our increased demand with \nrenewable energy sources. We should support research into renewable \nenergy technologies, such as hydrogen and fuel cells. Remember that, \neven so, non-hydro renewable energy produced only two percent of our \nenergy supply last year and the Department of Energy reports that \nrenewable energy will only produce, at most six percent of our energy \nsupply by the year 2020. That isn't nearly enough to meet the growing \ndemands of the next few decades.\n  Opponents also claim that the President's energy plan promotes \n``dangerous'' energy use, such as nuclear energy and oil drilling. \nLet's address nuclear energy first. This is an energy resource that \ncurrently provides 22 percent of America's electricity needs, while \nproducing no harmful emissions. Nuclear energy is safer than any \ncomparable energy generation; capacity is more than 90 percent; power \nproduction is at an all-time high; and the costs are the lowest on \nrecord and continuing to fall. Nuclear energy use is neither a novel \nnor a risky concept; France receives 80 percent of all of its \nelectricity from nuclear power.\n  There is a problem with disposal of nuclear waste, but it isn't so \nserious that the critics of nuclear power are concerned with finding an \nanswer. They appear to be happy enough with current on-site storage. \nObviously, other countries more ``green'' than the U.S. have resolved \nthe waste issue. The fact is that it's not a technology problem but a \npolitical problem.\n  Increased oil drilling has proven as controversial, yet it shouldn't \nbe. Drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, for example, is a \ncommonsense and safe proposal to increase domestic oil production. It \nis also very limited in scope. Oil exploration would occur in only a \nsmall portion of ANWR, in an area one-fifth the size of Washington's \nDulles Airport. Technological advances have reduced any supposed risks \nto the environment. Drilling pads are roughly 80 percent smaller than \nthey were a generation ago and high-tech drilling\n\n[[Page S7300]]\n\nallows for access to supplies as far as six miles away from a single, \ncompact drilling site.\n  Two concerns are raised: oil spills and harm to wildlife. The threat \nof spills is far greater from ocean-going tankers than from the Alaska \npipeline. And the caribou have prospered since drilling began on \nAlaska's North Slope.\n  This modest effort in ANWR would provide enormous benefits, producing \nas much as 600,000 barrels of oil a day for the next 40 years--exactly \nthe amount we currently import from Iraq. Moreover, oil drilling \nutilizes a smaller portion of our environment than the alternative \nenergy sources advocated by others. The Resource Development Council \nfor Alaska reports that, to produce 50 megawatts of power, natural gas \nproduction uses two to five acres of land, solar energy consumes 1,000 \nacres, wind power uses 4,000 acres, and oil drilling--less than one-\nhalf of an acre. That is real conservation of our natural resources.\n  As it stands now, American consumers already depend on foreign and \noften hostile nations for more than half of our oil supply. In 20 \nyears, that percentage will increase to 64 percent. Doesn't it make \nmore sense to invest in domestic production so that we are not held \nhostage to the whims of OPEC and the need to militarily defend our \ninterests in the major oil-producing regions?\n  In conclusion, I commend President Bush and Vice President Cheney for \nproducing serious and honest proposals to enact a long-term energy \nstrategy on behalf of American consumers. A worsening energy crisis \nrequires all of us to act swiftly on these proposals before the \nsituation becomes more widespread.\n  I urge our new Democratic leaders to take this proposal seriously and \nfind a way to bring solutions to the floor of the Senate. As these \nleaders know from their days in the minority, it is much easier to find \na way to accommodate the minority's requests than fight them. I hope \nthe new leadership will act in a truly bipartisan way and consider the \nadministration's ideas. We're all in this energy shortage together. \nDemocrats should work with Republicans for the good of all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/09/senate-section/article/S7300-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7300-S7303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE MIDDLE EAST\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I would like to change gears a little bit \nand talk about another subject that is very distressing. Throughout \nthis break I would turn the television on to the evening news, and \ninvariably there would be a story about yet more violence in the Middle \nEast. It really got me thinking about the fundamental issue that I \nthink a lot of Americans have ignored.\n  We wring our hands. We wish that the parties could get together, that \nthere could be peace in the Middle East, and that they could put their \nproblems behind them and live in harmony.\n  So we ask--and I see newspeople basically asking different versions \nof this question--why can't they just go back to the peace process? Of \ncourse, Secretary Powell urged both parties to agree to a cease-fire, \nwhich temporarily they did, yet every single day there has been a \nbombing or other terrorist attack or attempt in the State of Israel.\n  The Israeli people have said: Peace is a two-way street. If Yasser \nArafat and the PLO are not willing to enforce the multiple cease-fire \nagreements and the peace process that we thought we had agreed to \nbefore, then we will have to enforce the law, and that includes going \nafter those terrorists who threaten our people. No nation can do \notherwise.\n  I rise to comment briefly on this notion of ``returning to the peace \nprocess.'' The problem is that the 1993 Oslo accords, which were the \ngenesis of this thing we call ``the peace process,'' we now learn were \nfundamentally flawed. That is now apparent to the Israeli people, \ndespite significant differences. Talk about a robust democracy. It \nexists in Israel. You have very strongly held views by different \ncitizens in Israel, and they fight it out. During their election \nprocess, they had a very robust election contest. Then they come \ntogether with a leader, and they hope to be unified as a people.\n  They had desperately wanted, to borrow someone else's famous phrase, \nto give peace a chance. As a result, they tried to make the Oslo \naccords of 1993 work. What they found after Camp David, just about a \nyear ago this month, was that the PLO was unwilling at the end of the \nday to make the kinds of commitments that would be necessary for a \nlasting peace in the region. The reason for that is a fundamental \ndifference of approach.\n  For the Israelis, it has been a question of buying peace with \nconcessions, primarily of land, of territory. But the PLO and other \nArab or Muslim groups in the Middle East apparently never had any \nintention of providing the quid pro quo of peace. Instead, too much of \ntheir effort has been focused on the illegitimacy, in their view, of \nthe Israeli State, of the fundamental disagreement with the action that \nthe United Nations took after World War II to literally create a \nhomeland for the Jewish people. Because that homeland was taken from \nterritory which the Palestinians saw as their lands, they have never \nbeen willing to concede the legitimacy of the Israeli State.\n  At Camp David, after historic concessions were made by Prime Minister \nBarak, concessions which had to do with the most basic rights of the \nIsraeli citizens--to name their own capital and to have that capital an \nundivided city, Jerusalem; concessions with respect to over 90 percent \nof the West Bank land returned to the Palestinians; concessions made in \nremoving its troops from Lebanon and a whole variety of other things--\nafter all of those concessions had been made and there was an \nopportunity to seize the moment, Yasser Arafat, on behalf of the PLO, \nsaid no, he wanted one more thing. He wanted the right of return of all \nof the Palestinians, maybe 2 to 4 million people, maybe more, who he \nclaims were dispossessed in order to create the Jewish state. All of \nthose people had to have the right to go back to their homes.\n  That, of course, was the ultimate deal breaker. No Israeli leader \ncould ever agree to that concession. That would literally have meant \nthe end of the Jewish state as it is. As a result, those accords of a \nyear ago, that discussion at Camp David of a year ago, concluded with \nno agreement. It exposed the fundamental fallacy of the Oslo accords in \nthe first instance.\n  Very briefly, there were three essential premises of the Oslo \naccords. The first was that if the PLO was given this 30,000-manned \narmed force, that could be used to suppress violence rather than to \npromote more agitation in the Middle East. The idea was that whereas a \ndemocratic society such as Israel had a hard time dealing with these \nterrorists, a firm dictatorial Yasser Arafat, with an armed 30,000-\nmanned force, could put down these terrorists and bring peace to the \narea. Of course, the force expanded significantly beyond that which had \nbeen agreed to and eventually it was used to promote violence, not to \nsuppress it.\n  The second premise was that Israel could withdraw from the territory \nbefore a final peace accord was reached without losing its bargaining \npower or military deterrent. It had worked the other way around with \nregard to Egypt. Egypt, in good faith with President Sadat, dealt with \nthe Israeli leaders up front. Israel ceded the land after the peace \nagreement was obtained. But peace was restored between Israel and Egypt \nas a result. That withdrawal of Israeli forces from Egyptian land prior \nto the peace ensuing was a true trade of land for peace. But under the \nOslo accords, the situation was reversed. Israel was required to \nwithdraw first and then negotiate. The result, of course, has been no \ncredible peace.\n  The third premise is that peace could be made with the PLO. In Israel \nthere had been a consensus all along among all of the parties, \nincluding Labor and Likud, that it was not possible to deal with the \nPLO because, A, the Palestinian organization was philosophically \ncommitted to Israel's destruction. It is hard to deal with people in a \npeace process who are absolutely committed to your destruction.\n  Secondly, the PLO's previous negotiations had been based on terrorism \nas the means of achieving their objectives. No Israeli government had \nbeen willing to negotiate with an entity committed to its destruction \nthrough violence.\n  This peace process changed that. The Israeli leaders, in a leap of \nfaith, said: All right, we will deal with the PLO, despite this \nhistoric background.\n\n[[Page S7301]]\n\n  The process itself became the basis for this understanding. A new \nassumption was basically created. If you are in the process of \nnegotiating, then the quality of the people on the other side really \ndidn't matter. That is why the Israelis were willing to make this leap \nof faith. It almost became a secular religion. In this country people \ntalked about the peace process almost as the end in itself rather than \nthe means to an end.\n  It turns out that the nature of the leadership of the negotiating \nparties does matter. So do the actions on the ground. The quality of \nthe other people is fundamental to the success of the negotiations. The \nparties were never close, as some thought. Rather, the question really \nis whether peace was ever achievable given the Palestinian objectives.\n  That is why I say the fundamental assumptions of the peace process, \nof the Oslo accords, were flawed. In the end, none of the three \npremises turned out to be correct. They all turned out to be false. The \nIsraeli people now understand that.\n  The question now is how to repair the damage that resulted from an \nadherence to this peace process where Israel gave up more and more and \nmore and, in the end, got no peace. Ever since the Secretary of State \nand other officials before him went to the Middle East, there has been \na bombing or an attempt every single day, an attempt of terrorism. \nThere is no peace.\n  Hopefully, this helps to explain in brief form why it is not possible \nto simply return to the peace process as if there were some magic in \nthat Oslo process. The Oslo process is dead. The reason it is dead is \nbecause it was premised on fundamental fallacies. That is why the \nIsraeli people cannot go back to that flawed process.\n  We in the United States should not be critical of that decision on \nthe part of the Israeli people. The Israeli people are not to blame for \ndealing now with a situation of violence and lawlessness and terror in \nas firm a way as they possibly can to protect their own citizens. No \ncountry could do otherwise. And for Americans to be so presumptuous as \nto lecture the Israelis about overreacting and urging them to return to \na peace process which they now recognize was fundamentally flawed is \nthe height of arrogance. We in the U.S. have to be much more \nunderstanding about the difficulties of achieving peace.\n\n  Fundamentally, Madam President, I think what we have to recognize is \nthat as long as the leadership of the other side in this controversy--\nprimarily the PLO--is not democratically based but is totalitarian, as \nlong as there is not an involvement of all of the Palestinian people in \nthe decisions on the other side, there will continue to be conflict.\n  The nature of the leadership on the other side matters, and it \nmatters greatly. Until there is a democratically elected Palestinian \nGovernment, until the leaders are accountable to the people, whom I \nsuspect want peace as much as anybody else in the region or in the \nworld, then we are not likely to get the kind of peaceful resolution \nfor which we all hope.\n  So what I hope right now is that the American people will be \nunderstanding of the position of the Israeli Government; that they will \nbe supportive of this long-time ally, the nation of Israel; that they \nwill recognize that there is no moral equivalence between acts of \nterror on the one hand and attempting to enforce the law on the other \nhand; that they will be supportive both in terms of military and \neconomic support but also psychologically and not buy into this notion \nthat there is repression on the part of the Israeli Government against \nthe Palestinians which is the cause of the problem.\n  This whole idea of moral equivalence is wrong. If we go back to the \nfounding of the Jewish state by the United Nations and recognize what \nwas attempted there and the moral legitimacy of the Israeli State, then \nI think Americans will more carefully calibrate their criticism of the \nIsraeli Government and understand that it is going to take a long time; \nthat hearts have to change before there can be peace; and probably the \nbest opportunity is for democracy to take hold in the Arab States so \nthat the leaders are accountable to the people because in the long run, \nmost people really want peace. They want to live together; they want to \nengage in commerce together; and they do not want to continue to send \ntheir sons and daughters to die for causes that are whipped up by their \nleadership--to die unnecessarily.\n  That is why I urge my colleagues in the Senate today, the \nadministration in Washington, and the American people generally, to \nlearn to listen carefully and to recognize that the peace process was \nbased upon flawed assumptions, and not to urge the Israelis to act in \nways that would be inimical both to their own immediate self-interests \nin terms of safety and the long-term interests of peace. It is a \ndifficult subject, one that we have to confront; and we have to stand \nby an ally and also recognize the legitimacy of other Arab aspirations \nand Muslim aspirations in the Middle East, in which we have a great \nstake as well. As long as we fail to recognize the complexity of this \nsituation and understand the process that was urged for so long cannot \nbe the basis for future peace negotiations, we are not going to be able \nto proceed in a constructive way.\n  I hope the American people, as a result of these comments and others, \nwill support the administration in its very delicate and difficult \nnegotiations in that region and will be supportive of the Members of \nthis body who seek to promote the kind of peace that will be not just \ntemporary but lasting.\n  Mr. President, yet again Israel's restraint and unilateral acceptance \nof a ``cease fire'' has been met with terrorist acts perpetrated \nagainst an innocent civilian population. The recent tragic deaths of 20 \nIsraeli teenagers and serious wounding of another 48 by a Palestinian \nsuicide bomber were stark and deeply sad reminders that the key to \npeace in the Middle East does not depend on the State of Israel.\n  I am extremely concerned that the doctrine of moral equivalence has \ntaken root among many in the United States and around the world with \nrespect to perceptions of Arab-Israeli violence. While over the years \nIsrael may have taken steps with which we do not always agree, the \nnotion that it operates on the same moral plane as its adversaries is \npatently false. The suicide bombing, deliberately targeted against \nIsraeli youth, was not the result of individuals driven to extremes by \nperceived Israeli intransigence in peace talks. It was, in fact, the \naction of organized groups committed to Israel's total destruction.\n  At the urging of Secretary of State Colin Powell, the Israeli \nGovernment has entered into cease fires. The attacks continue. When the \nIsraelis identify and eliminate the specific perpetrators of these mass \nterrorist killings, they are called murderers. Meanwhile, the world \nwrings its hands and asks why the parties can't just return to return \nto the ``peace process.'' This is a good time to answer that question, \nbeginning with an assessment of what went wrong with the Oslo peace \nprocess.\n  The effect of the violence in Israel today cannot be overstated. \nAfter the failure of the Camp David summit just a year ago, and the \nsubsequent reignition of violence, Israel has suffered from an \nunrelenting assault on its people. The result has been a total \nreassessment in Israel of the premises of the Oslo peace process--\npremises which have turned out to be invalid.\n  Let's go back to 1993. The first of three basic premises of Oslo was \nthat, if the PLO were given a 30,000-man armed force, it would be used \nto suppress, not to perpetuate, armed violence. Yitzhak Rabin was \nDefense Minister back in 1987 when the intifada started. The failure to \nstop it was a turning point for Rabin; it caused him to decide then to \nbegin a peace process. He thought that if Israel couldn't handle the \nintifada, maybe Arafat could. But soon the 30,000-man force became a \n40,000-man force, and anti-tank weapons, shoulder-fired weapons and \nother prohibited arms found their way into the Palestinian force's \narsenal--weapons that are now pointed and fired at Israeli communities. \nAll of this has occurred in violation of the Oslo Accords.\n  So the first premise--that the PLO would actually control the \nintifada with a 30,000-man force--turned out to be false.\n  The second premise was that Israel could withdraw from territory \nbefore a final peace accord was reached without losing its bargaining \npower or sacrificing physical security. In the case of\n\n[[Page S7302]]\n\nits dealings with Egypt, Israel had ceded land after the peace \nagreement was obtained. That withdrawal had worked as a true trade of \nland for peace. But, under the Oslo Accords, Israel was required to \nwithdraw first and then negotiate. The result has been no credible \npeace.\n  This premise of Oslo had been based on the assumption that Israel was \nfinally strong enough to be able to relinquish land while preserving \nits ability to deter violence. So Israel withdrew from the West Bank, \nexcept for a few military posts authorized in the Oslo agreement, and \nin May of 2000 also withdrew from southern Lebanon. Both actions \nappeared to the Arab terrorist organizations and the Palestinian \nAuthority as a retreat from a successful campaign of violence. After \nthe intifada, Israel withdrew from the West Bank. After the terrorism \nof Hezbollah, Israel withdrew from Lebanon. The PA understandably saw \nviolence as a way to achieve its goals.\n  So the second premise of Oslo--that Israel could withdraw first and \nachieve its peace objectives later--has also proven false. Arafat and \nthe PA interpreted the withdrawals simply as a sign of weakness thus \nemboldening them to incite the violence that has continued unabated \nsince Rosh Hashana.\n  The third, and central, premise of Oslo was that peace could be made \nwith the PLO. In Israel, there was a consensus until 1993 among all \nparties, including Labor and Likud, that it was not possible to deal \nwith the PLO. There were two reasons for this view: first, the PLO was \nphilosophically committed to Israel's destruction; and, second, the \nPLO's negotiations had been historically based on terrorism. No \nprevious Israeli government had been willing to negotiate with an \nentity committed to its destruction through violence.\n  But in 1993, Oslo created a new assumption: If you had a process--a \nprocess of negotiating--then the quality of people on the other side \ndid not really matter. The process became almost like a secular \nreligion. The process was the important thing, and so actions on the \nground didn't matter. This notion had roots in Western dealings with \nleaders in countries like North Korea, Iraq, and the Soviet Union.\n  It turns out, though, that the nature of leadership does matter, and \nso do actions on the ground. The quality of people on the other side is \nfundamental to the success of negotiations. It is the people, not the \nprocess, that matters.\n  The fact is, the parties were never as close as many believed. The \nissue was never the desirability of peace, or what either the United \nStates or Israel could do to bring it about. Rather, the question was \nwhether peace was ever achievable given Palestinian objectives. Yet \nwhen Barak and Arafat were near the end of negotiations, Arafat raised \none more demand: that Israel must agree to the right of return, and \nadmit more than a million Palestinians into Israel.\n  This notion is anathema to all Israelis. Even those on the left \noppose the right of return because of its consequences; literally, the \nend of Israel as a Jewish state. Israel could not survive the return of \nover a million Palestinians and continue to exist as a Jewish state. \nBarak made unprecedented concessions at Camp David. Even Leah Rabin \ncomplained that Barak's concessions would cause her late husband to \nturn over in his grave. This move by Arafat was so shocking that \nvirtually all Israelis lost confidence in the process. Barak lost all \nsupport. And a radical reassessment of realities set in.\n  Despite the disappointment at the failure of negotiations, the \nawakening of the Israeli people to the faulty premises and the reality \nof the failure of the Oslo Accords is a healthy development. The Bush \nAdministration seems to have assimilated much of the Israeli attitude, \nand has been careful to avoid involving itself in the effort to restart \nthe ``peace process'' at this time. For the future, it is helpful to \nacknowledge the falseness of the three key Oslo premises. The Oslo \nprocess had ended up doing severe damage to Israel's deterrent--its \nability to match concessions with tangible peace.\n\n  The principal goal now should be to repair that damage. Amid all the \nIsraeli concessions and gestures, it was assumed that there would be \nreciprocity on the part of the Palestinians. But the Arabs believed \nshowing reciprocity would be a sign of weakness on their part. The \nevidence abounds. More Israelis were killed by terrorist acts after \nOslo then in the decade before. The PLO did not fulfill the promises it \nmade; for example, disarming the terrorists--in fact, releasing from \nprison some of the most dangerous Hamas terrorists--limiting its arms, \nand guaranteeing peace.\n  Moreover, and perhaps even more disturbing for the long run, the \nPalestinian authority created schools with a curriculum of brainwashing \ntheir children in hatred and violence. A shocked New York Times \nreporter last summer wrote of the creation of summer camps that even \ntaught assassination. Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu paints \nthe picture of posters throughout Palestinian communities showing a \nmenacing Israeli soldier, armed to the teeth, towering over a pitiful \nlooking Arab youngster who holds only one thing. Do you know what it \nis? A key. And every Arab child knows what it is. The Key to an Arab \nhome in Jaffa, or Haifa, or any other Arab community of pre-1967 \nPalestine. So much for the view that the parties were ``just this \nclose.'' All of this has caused a reassessment of the realities, and, \nas I said, that is a healthy development at this point.\n  One must view the situation today clear eyed and in strategic terms. \nIt is a situation of more than just military or economic power. For \nIsrael it is quite simply a question of morale. Israel's problem right \nnow is not that it lacks either economic or military power, but rather \nthat its people have been following a conceptual and intellectual \napproach to achieving peace which has turned out to be false. The \nresult has been confusion, frustration, and a problem of morale that \ncan only be dealt with by reevaluation of the conceptual and \nintellectual approach to achieving peace. The people were sold on a \n``process,'' and now find that the presumptions underlying that process \nwere illusions. Their disillusionment has set them adrift because they \nsee they have lost territory and credibility that would never have been \nlost by military force.\n  The Camp David concessions are especially galling now that there is a \nrecognition that they were based upon false premises, a quid pro quo \nthat was never to be reciprocated by the Palestinians. It makes the \nlast several years seem very lost indeed. So the Israelis are revising \ntheir thinking.\n  Those of us who have cared about the security of Israel and have \nwatched the process over the years, viewed it with great anxiety \nbecause we worried it might have resulted in irreversible losses. And \nyet, with the last election, we see the Israeli people rethinking the \npremises of Oslo and charting a course to recover the initiative. The \nfact that Ariel Sharon, with all his political baggage, won so \noverwhelmingly suggests that the Israeli people are prepared to do what \nit takes to defend their state and to survive. Like England fighting \nback from its unpreparedness in the 30's and the United States after \nits military decline of the 1970's, Israel seems to have said, ``This \nfar and no more,'' and begun to rethink its approach to achieving peace \nand security. Countries seem to have a way of being better than their \nfailed leaders, and we can hope that the Israelis are on their way back \nwith a more realistic and sober view of what will be required for their \nlong-term security--what kind of approach will provide real, lasting \npeace.\n  It is recognized that peace is not available now, but that it can \nbecome available in the future. The key to peace is a more democratic \nand much less corrupt leadership. There are moderate Palestinians, but \nthey are not politically relevant right now. The Palestinians have been \ncursed with leaders who have always seemed to be wrong for the times. \nIn World War I, Palestinian leaders sided with the Turks against the \nBritish; in World War II, with the Nazis against the allies; in the \nCold War, with the Soviets against the West; and in the Persian Gulf \nWar, with Saddam against the coalition of allies.\n  Given his long record as an ideologue, a terrorist, a breaker of \npromises and fount of untruth, it should not really surprise anyone \nthat Arafat remains what he has always been. As Charles Krauthammer \nrecently noted\n\n[[Page S7303]]\n\nin the Weekly Standard, ``[Arafat] proved, even to much of the Israeli \nleft, that the entire theory of preemptive concessions, magnanimous \ngestures, rolling appeasement was an exercise in futility.''\n  The key to peace is a Palestinian leadership that would appeal to the \nbetter nature of the Palestinian people, one that would reflect their \naspirations for a prosperous and peaceful future--not one that exploits \ntheir misery through a policy of physically and vitriolically attacking \nIsrael. In short, a democratic government. As my friend Douglas Feith \nexpressed the point in an article in Commentary: ``A stable peace [is] \npossible . . . only if the Palestinians first evolved responsible \nadministrative institutions and leadership that enjoyed legitimacy in \nthe eyes of its own people, refrained from murdering its political \nopponents, operated within and not above the law, and practiced \nmoderation and compromise at home and abroad.'' This would, of course, \nbe a boon not only for the Israelis, but for the Palestinians--indeed \nespecially for the Palestinians.\n  For over fifty years, the United States and Israel have been bound \ntogether in a relationship that has weathered many efforts to drive a \nwedge between us. With the coincident election of a new leader in each \ncountry, our two great nations have an opportunity to reassess the \nlessons recent history has to teach us. For my part, I am optimistic \nthat the new American administration will place a great value on our \nrelationship with the Israeli people; and I am optimistic that the \nIsraelis will maintain the strength and morale that they will need to \nawait a change in Palestinian leadership. At that point there will be \nmuch more the Israelis can do to secure their future.\n  The United States should not push Israel into a process or into an \nagreement with which the government and people of Israel are not \ncompletely comfortable, with their security ensured. It is their \nexistence that is at stake, and we must take no actions that jeopardize \ntheir security.\n  My colleague from Wyoming would like to use the remainder of our \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I appreciate the time. I thank my friend \nfrom Arizona for his comments on energy. Certainly, I can't think of an \nissue that affects more people and is more likely to become a crisis \nagain than energy. We had some touch of it and backed off of it a \nlittle. California is doing a little better than it was. Gas prices are \ntending to stabilize or even come down.\n  The real cause of the problem is still there. I am surprised, \nfrankly, that the Senate leadership hasn't been willing to go forward \nand at least give us a date as to the time in which we can undertake \nthis question of energy and energy supply. We have gone now 8, 10 years \nwithout a policy regarding energy, not having any real direction with \nregard to what we are going to do. We have become 60-percent dependent \non OPEC and overseas oil. We haven't developed refineries, new \ntransmission lines, or pipelines in order to move energy from where it \nis to where it is needed, and still our leadership here refuses to move \nforward.\n  I think we will again be facing the same kind of situation we just \nhad if we don't move to find a long-term resolution, and we can.\n  We now have a policy from the administration, one that deals with \ndomestic production. There is access to public lands, much of it \nstanding in Alaska or in many places that could indeed have production \nwithout damage to the environment. We can do that.\n  We can talk about conservation. We can talk about renewables. We have \nto have a policy to cause us to do some of these things.\n  The transportation is vitally important. In Wyoming, we have great \nsupplies of coal, for example. In order to mine and move that energy to \nwhere the market is, you have to have some transmission. There are a \nnumber of ways to do that, and we can if we decide to and commit \nourselves to do it.\n  Research, clean coal: Our coal in Wyoming is clean, and it can be \ncleaner if we have research to do that.\n  Diversity: We can't expect to have only one source of supply for all \nthe energy we use. We are heavy energy users, and most of us are not \nwilling to make many changes to that.\n  I am grateful for the comments of my friend, and I hope we can get \nthe leadership here to set the agenda to move toward doing something \nthere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/09/senate-section/article/S7303-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7303-S7304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                USING SNOW MACHINES IN YELLOWSTONE PARK\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I know it is now summer, but I will now \ntalk about using snow machines in the Yellowstone Park in the \nwintertime. It is a question that has become quite political, as a \nmatter of fact. There have been letters sent to the Department of the \nInterior from the Senate on both sides.\n  For a number of years, in Grand Teton, in Yellowstone Park, and many \nof the other parks, the principal access people have had in the \nwintertime to enjoy their park was with snow machines. It has been done \nfor a long time, really. Frankly, there hasn't been much management of \nthat technique, unfortunately. The park officials have not had much to \ndo with it. They have not sought to organize how and where it is done, \nseparate the snow machines from the cross-country skiers, which can be \ndone so each can have their own opportunity. It has to manage numbers \nsometimes, for instance, if they become too large around Christmas \nvacation.\n  They can make changes, but they have not done that. They have an \nopportunity, and we have an opportunity to have much cleaner machines, \nwhich are less noisy and which are less polluting. The manufacturers \nhave indicated they can and will do this. Of course, they need some \nassurance from EPA that having done it, they will be able to use these \nmachines. But none of these things have happened. Instead, because of \nthe difficulties that are, in fact, there and without management, an \nEIS study went on for several years.\n  Unfortunately, toward the end, instead of going on through with the \nregular system of input, the Assistant Secretary of the Interior went \nout and said this is what the answer is going to be. The answer was to \ndo away with individual snow machines in the parks over a period of a \ncouple of years. That isn't what is designed to happen when you have \nEIS studies and when you involve local communities and local people and \nthen have somebody from Washington come and make the decision. But that \nis what did happen.\n  Furthermore, the regulation that was agreed to in the study was put \nbefore the public the last day of the last administration when there \nwas no opportunity to do anything about it. So what has happened is \nthat there has been a lawsuit filed. I have introduced a bill that \nwould allow not to continue snow machines the way they have been but, \nrather, to do the management technique, manage the numbers and the \nsites, and also set specifications so that manufacturers can meet them \nand you can go forward.\n  What is the purpose of the park? It is to preserve the resources and \nto allow the owners to enjoy them. This is the way that you have access \nin the wintertime.\n  So this has become somewhat of a discussion, somewhat of a \ncontroversy. I am hopeful that they can come to an agreement--and this \nadministration is working toward coming to an agreement--in which these \nchanges could be made. Nobody is suggesting to continue to do it the \nway it has been done in the past. But there can be changes made that \nwill indeed allow access and protect the environment and the animals \nand the rural environment at the same time. We can do those things.\n  One other word on national parks.\n  The Grand Teton National Park was expanded in 1950. When that was \ndone, there were a number of lands that were brought into the park, and \namong them were several school sections that belonged to the State of \nWyoming. They are now in the park as inholdings and therefore cannot be \nmanaged by the park but cannot be used for anything else. Therefore, we \nhave two losers: One is the park which has these inholdings it cannot \nhandle; second is the school sections are to finance education, and \nthey are not bringing in revenue to the State of Wyoming.\n  To make a long story short, I have a bill I hope will be before the \ncommittee\n\n[[Page S7304]]\n\nsoon to allow the Secretary of the Interior and the State of Wyoming to \ncome to some agreement in finding a value for those lands by using an \nappraiser upon which they agree and then work out an arrangement to \neither trade those lands for other Federal lands outside the park, \ntrade them for mineral royalties, or sell but come to some financial \narrangement.\n  I hope we can get some support for something that will be useful to \nGrand Teton National Park as well as the State of Wyoming.\n  I think our time has expired. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/09/senate-section/article/S7304-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate \nwill now proceed to the consideration of S. 1077, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1077) making supplemental appropriations for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 2001, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today, the Senate is debating S. 1077, the \nSupplemental Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2001.\n  On June 1, 2001, President Bush asked Congress to consider a \nsupplemental request for $6.5 billion, primarily for the Department of \nDefense. The draft supplemental bill that is before us totals $6.5 \nbillion, not one dime above the President's request--not one thin dime \nabove the President's request. It contains no emergency funding. The \nPresident has said that he will not support such emergency spending, so \nthe Committee has not included any emergency designations in this bill. \nUnrequested items in the bill are offset.\n  S. 1077 funds the President's request for additional defense spending \nfor health care, for military pay and benefits, for the high costs of \nnatural gas and other utilities, for increased military flying hours, \nand for other purposes. The bill includes a net increase of $5.54 \nbillion for the Department of Defense and $291 million for defense-\nrelated programs of the Department of Energy.\n  While the Appropriations Committee has approved most of the \nPresident's request for the Department of Defense, I stress the \nimportance of accountability for these and future funds. Financial \naccountability remains one of the weakest links in the Defense \nDepartment's budget process. Just last month, the General Accounting \nOffice reported that, of $1.1 billion earmarked for military spare \nparts in the fiscal year 1999 supplemental, only about $88 million \ncould be tracked to the purchase of spare parts. The remaining $1 \nbillion, or 92 percent of the appropriation, was transferred to \noperations and maintenance accounts, where the tracking process broke \ndown.\n  Perhaps a substantial portion of the money appropriated for spare \nparts was spent on spare parts; perhaps it was not. But, given the way \nthe money was managed, nobody knows for sure and that, it seems to me, \nis an unacceptable circumstance, because one thing we do know for sure \nis that an adequate inventory of spare parts is a key component of \nreadiness and the Defense Department apparently does not have an \nadequate inventory of spare parts. So we must do better in making sure \nthese dollars for spare parts go for spare parts.\n  The supplemental funding bill before us today includes another $30 \nmillion for spare parts, this time specifically for the Army. As former \nPresident Reagan would have said, here we go again. To forestall a \nrepeat of the problems that arose in accounting for spare parts \nexpenditures provided in the fiscal year 1999 supplemental, the \ncommittee, at my request, approved report language requiring the \nSecretary of Defense to follow the money and to provide Congress with a \ncomplete accounting of all supplemental funds appropriated for spare \nparts. The intent of this provision is to ensure that money \nappropriated by Congress for the purchase of spare parts does not get \nshifted into any other program.\n  The supplemental appropriations bill, as reported by the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, provides $300 million for the Low Income \nEnergy Assistance Program, an increase of $150 million above the \nPresident's request, to help our citizens cope with high energy costs. \nThe bill also includes $161 million that was not requested for grants \nto local education agencies under the Education for the Disadvantaged \nProgram in response to the most recent poverty and expenditure data. \nAlso provided is $100 million as an initial United States contribution \nto a global trust fund to combat AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. In \naddition, $92 million requested by the President for the Coast Guard is \nincluded, as is $115.8 million requested for the Treasury Department \nfor the cost of processing and mailing out the tax rebate checks.\n  In addition, the bill includes $84 million for the Radiation Exposure \nTrust Fund to provide compensation to the victims of radiation \nexposure. We thank Senators Domenici and Bingaman for their leadership \nin assisting those who were involved in the mining of uranium ore and \nthose who were downwind from nuclear weapons tests during the Cold War.\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee's bill includes a number of \noffsets to pay for these additional items. Members should be on notice \nthat, with passage of this bill, we are at the statutory cap for budget \nauthority in Fiscal Year 2001. I say to colleagues on both sides of the \naisle that any amendments that are offered will need to be offset. \nExceeding the statutory cap could result in an across-the-board cut in \nall discretionary spending, both for defense programs and for non-\ndefense programs. I urge Members to avoid the spectacle of a \ngovernment-wide sequester by finding appropriate offsets for \namendments.\n  There is another reason to insist on offsets for any additional \nspending. During debate on the recent tax-cut bill, I argued that the \ntax cuts contained in that bill could return the Federal budget to the \ndeficit ditch. I stressed that the tax cuts were based on highly \nsuspect ten-year surplus estimates and that if those estimates proved \nillusory, the tax-cut bill would result in spending the Medicare \nsurplus. Now, before the ink is even dry on the President's signature \non that tax bill, we may find ourselves headed back into the deficit \nditch and headed in the direction of cutting into the Medicare surplus.\n  Our distinguished Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Kent \nConrad, has prepared an analysis of the budget picture for Fiscal Year \n2001, the current fiscal year, based on recent economic projections \nfrom the President's own Director of the National Economic Council, \nLawrence Lindsey. The tax-cut bill reduced the surplus by $74 billion \nin Fiscal Year 2001 alone. As a result, Chairman Conrad is projecting a \nraid on the Medicare Trust Fund in Fiscal Year 2001 of $17 billion.\n  Any efforts to increase spending in this bill without offsets will \nonly make this problem worse.\n  The President asserted in his Budget Blueprint that the authority of \nthe Congress and the President to designate funding as an emergency has \nbeen abused. The Administration has indicated in its Statement of \nAdministration Policy of June 19, 2001, that the President does not \nintend to designate the $473 million of emergency funding contained in \nthe House-passed bill as emergency spending.\n  The administration further states that, ``emergency supplemental \nappropriations should be limited to extremely rare events.'' The Senate \nsupplemental bill contains no emergency designations. Nonetheless, I do \nbelieve that it is appropriate for Congress and the President to use \nthe emergency authority from time to time in response to natural \ndisasters and other truly unforseen events in the nature of disasters.\n\n[[Page S7305]]\n\n  As I mentioned earlier, this supplemental appropriations bill \nprovides immediate relief through the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram, LIHEAP, for American families being hit hard by this energy \ncrisis. Moreover, it includes funding to help educate our most needy \nstudents through the Education for the Disadvantaged Program. To help \noffset the cost of these two supplementals, a rescission of unallocated \ndislocated worker funds under the Workforce Investment Act was also \nincluded in the committee bill.\n  The States have accumulated a large, unexpended balance of dislocated \nworker funds due to start-up delays with the Workforce Investment Act \nof 1998. These funds are estimated to exceed $600 million for the \nprogram year that ended on June 30, 2001. Although the rescission of \ndislocated worker funds will reduce the Fiscal Year 2001 appropriation \nfrom $1.59 billion to $1.37 billion, the Labor Department projects that \nthe carryover funds from the previous program year will more than \noffset the rescission. Federal funding, including carryover balances, \nwill actually increase by $423 million in program year 2001, or 25 \npercent above the level for program year 2000.\n  Furthermore, report language was included in the supplemental \nappropriations bill expressing the Senate Appropriations Committee's \nsupport for the Workforce Investment Act, the dislocated worker \nprogram, and the committee's intent to carefully monitor the need for \nenhanced job-training services. Should it be determined that additional \nfunds are needed, the Appropriations Committee will do all it can to \nensure that sufficient funds are included in the Fiscal Year 2002 \nDepartments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations bill.\n  Pursuant to the unanimous consent agreement, Senator Stevens and I \nwill be offering a managers' amendment that contains a number of \namendments that have been agreed to by both sides. One of the items in \nthe managers' amendment is an amendment of mine to provide $3 million \nto hire additional USDA inspectors to promote the proper treatment of \nlivestock. Another item would provide $20 million to help farmers in \nthe Klamath Basin in Oregon and California. The cost of these and other \nprovisions contained in the managers' amendment is fully offset.\n  I have noted in the press recently some stories that greatly concern \nme. I believe the American people are concerned and are becoming \nincreasingly sensitive to the treatment of animals. Reports of cruelty \nto animals through improper livestock production and slaughter \npractices have hit a nerve with the American people. The recent \nannouncements by major food outlets, such as McDonalds, that they would \nonly buy products from suppliers that could assure certain levels of \nhumane animal treatment speak volumes to changes in public \nexpectations.\n  The managers' amendment will provide an additional $3 million through \nthe USDA Office of the Secretary for activities across three department \nmission areas to protect and promote humane treatment of animals. Of \nthe $3 million provided, no less than $1 million is directed to \nenforcement of the Animal Welfare Act, under which standards for \nlivestock production, laboratory animals, and so-called puppy mills are \nestablished. In addition, no less than $1 million is directed for \nactivities under the Federal Meat Inspections Act, which will enhance \nhumane treatment in the slaughter of animals in facilities under the \njurisdiction of Federal inspection. Finally, an amount up to $500,000 \nis directed for the development and demonstration of technologies that \ncan be used by producers, processors, and others to provide better care \nof animals at all stages of their lives.\n  Mr. President, I shall, in conclusion, ask unanimous consent--but not \nright at this point--that certain newspaper articles which have been \nwritten with respect to the slaughter of animals, and the inhumane \nslaughter of animals, be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  This bill responds to the President's supplemental request for \nnecessary defense spending, and it also provides funding for important \ndomestic priorities. It is not one dime--not one thinly, much-worn \ndime--over the President's request. It is within the statutory spending \nlimits. It is a responsible bill, and I urge Members to support it.\n  Before yielding the floor, let me express my thanks to the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, who is the \nranking member on the Appropriations Committee in the Senate. He is the \nformer chairman of the committee with whom I had the great pleasure of \nserving for several years in that position. And I believe it is a \nblessing, indeed, for me, as I stand on this floor today to present \nthis bill, to also be able to say that Senator Stevens and I stood \nshoulder to shoulder, and we shall continue to work shoulder to \nshoulder, as we moved forward with this bill.\n  I cannot adequately express my appreciation to him and to his staff \nand to my own staff for the great work and the excellent cooperation \nthat have been shown in connection with the preparation and \npresentation of this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator make his unanimous consent \nrequest at this time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I do make that unanimous consent request.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 10, 2001]\n\n                        They Die Piece by Piece\n\n\n In Overtaxed Plants, Humane Treatment of Cattle Is Often a Battle Lost\n\n                           (By Joby Warrick)\n\n       Pasco, Wash.--It takes 25 minutes to turn a live steer into \n     steak at the modern slaughterhouse where Ramon Moreno works. \n     For 20 years, his post was ``second-legger,'' a job that \n     entails cutting hocks off carcasses as they whirl past at a \n     rate of 309 an hour.\n       The cattle were supposed to be dead before they got to \n     Moreno. But too often they weren't.\n       ``They blink. They make noises,'' he said softly. ``The \n     head moves, the eyes are wide and looking around.''\n       Still Moreno would cut. On bad days, he says, dozens of \n     animals reached his station clearly alive and conscious. Some \n     would survive as far as the tail cutter, the belly ripper, \n     the hide puller. ``They die,'' said Moreno, ``piece by \n     piece.''\n       Under a 23-year-old federal law, slaughtered cattle and \n     hogs first must be ``stunned''--rendered insensible to pain--\n     with a blow to the head or an electric shock. But at \n     overtaxed plants, the law is sometimes broken, with cruel \n     consequences for animals as well as workers. Enforcement \n     records, interviews, videos and worker affidavits describe \n     repeated violations of the Humane Slaughter Act at dozens of \n     slaughterhouses, ranging from the smallest, custom butcheries \n     to modern, automated establishments such as the sprawling IBP \n     Inc. plant here where Moreno works.\n       ``In plants all over the United States, this happens on a \n     daily basis,'' said Lester Friedlander, a veterinarian and \n     formerly chief government inspector at a Pennsylvania \n     hamburger plant. ``I've seen it happen. And I've talked to \n     other veterinarians. They feel it's out of control.''\n       The U.S. Department of Agriculture oversees the treatment \n     of animals in meat plants, but enforcement of the law varies \n     dramatically. While a few plants have been forced to halt \n     production for a few hours because of alleged animal cruelty, \n     such sanctions are rare.\n       For example, the government took no action against a Texas \n     beef company that was cited 22 times in 1998 for violations \n     that included chopping hooves off live cattle. In another \n     case, agency supervisors failed to take action on multiple \n     complaints of animal cruelty at a Florida beef plant and \n     fired an animal health technician for reporting the problems \n     to the Humane Society. The dismissal letter sent to the \n     technician, Tim Walker, said his disclosure had ``irreparably \n     damaged'' the agency's relations with the packing plant.\n       ``I complained to everyone--I said, `Lookit, they're \n     skinning live cows in there,' '' Walker said. ``Always it was \n     the same answer: `We know it's true. But there's nothing we \n     can do about it.' ''\n       In the past three years, a new meat inspection system that \n     shifted responsibility to industry has made it harder to \n     catch and report cruelty problems, some federal inspectors \n     say. Under the new system, implemented in 1998, the agency no \n     longer tracks the number of humane-slaughter violations its \n     inspectors find each year.\n       Some inspectors are so frustrated they're asking outsiders \n     for help: The inspectors' union last spring urged Washington \n     state authorities to crack down on alleged animal abuse at \n     the IBP plant in Pasco. In a statement, IBP said problems \n     described by workers in its Washington state plant ``do not \n     accurately represent the way we operate our plants. We take \n     the issue of proper livestock handling very seriously.''\n\n[[Page S7306]]\n\n       But the union complained that new government policies and \n     faster production speeds at the plant had ``significantly \n     hampered our ability to ensure compliance.'' Several \n     animal welfare groups joined in the petition.\n       ``Privatization of meat inspection has meant a quiet death \n     to the already meager enforcement of the Humane Slaughter \n     Act,'' said Gail Eisnitz of the Humane Farming Association, a \n     group that advocates better treatment of farm animals. ``USDA \n     isn't simply relinquishing its humane-slaughter oversight to \n     the meat industry, but is--without the knowledge and consent \n     of Congress--abandoning this function altogether.''\n       The USDA's Food Safety Inspection Service, which is \n     responsible for meat inspection, says it has not relaxed its \n     oversight, In January, the agency ordered a review of 100 \n     slaughterhouses. An FSIS memo reminded its 7,600 inspectors \n     they had an ``obligation to ensure compliance'' with humane-\n     handling laws.\n       The review comes as pressure grows on both industry and \n     regulators to improve conditions for the 155 million cattle, \n     hogs, horses and sheep slaughtered each year. McDonald's and \n     Burger King have been subject to boycotts by animal rights \n     groups protesting mistreatment of livestock.\n       As a result, two years ago McDonald's began requiring \n     suppliers to abide by the American Meat Institute's Good \n     Management Practices for Animal Handling and Stunning. The \n     company also began conducting annual audits of meat plants. \n     Last week, Burger King announced it would require suppliers \n     to follow the meat institute's standards.\n       ``Burger King Corp. takes the issues of food safety and \n     animal welfare very seriously, and we expect our suppliers to \n     comply,'' the company said in a statement.\n       Industry groups acknowledge that sloppy killing has \n     tangible consequences for consumers as well as company \n     profits. Fear and pain cause animals to produce hormones that \n     damage meat and cost companies tens of millions of dollars a \n     year in discarded product, according to industry estimates.\n       Industry officials say they also recognize an ethical \n     imperative to treat animals with compassion. Science is \n     blurring the distinction between the mental processes of \n     humans and lower animals--discovering, for example, that even \n     the lowly rat may dream. Americans thus are becoming more \n     sensitive to the suffering of food animals, even as they \n     consume increasing numbers of them.\n       ``Handling animals humanely,'' said American Meat Institute \n     president J. Patrick Boyle, ``is just the right thing to \n     do.''\n       Clearly, not all plants have gotten the message.\n       A Post computer analysis of government enforcement records \n     found 527 violations of humane-handling regulations from 1996 \n     to 1997, the last years for which complete records were \n     available. The offenses range from overcrowded stockyards to \n     incidents in which live animals were cut, skinned or scalded.\n       Through the Freedom of Information Act, The Post obtained \n     enforcement documents from 28 plants that had high numbers of \n     offenses or had drawn penalties for violating humane-handling \n     laws. The Post also interviewed dozens of current and former \n     federal meat inspectors and slaughterhouse workers. A \n     reporter reviewed affidavits and secret video recordings made \n     inside two plants.\n       Among the findings:\n       One Texas plant, Supreme Beef Packers in Ladonia, had 22 \n     violations in six months. During one inspection, federal \n     officials found nine live cattle dangling from an overhead \n     chain. But managers at the plant, which announced last fall \n     it was ceasing operations, resisted USDA warnings, saying its \n     practices were no different than others in the industry. \n     ``Other plants are not subject to such extensive scrutiny of \n     their stunning activities,'' the plant complained in a 1997 \n     letter to the USDA.\n       Government inspectors halted production for a day at the \n     Calhoun Packing Co. beef plant in Palestine, Tex., after \n     inspectors saw cattle being improperly stunned. ``They were \n     still conscious and had good reflexes,'' B.V. Swamy, a \n     veterinarian and senior USDA official at the plant, wrote. \n     The shift supervisor ``allowed the cattle to be hung \n     anyway.'' IBP, which owned the plant at the time, contested \n     the findings but ``took steps to resolve the situation,'' \n     including installing video equipment and increasing training, \n     a spokesman said. IBP has since sold the plant.\n       At the Farmers Livestock Cooperative processing plant in \n     Hawaii, inspectors documented 14 humane-slaughter violations \n     in as many months. Records from 1997 and 1998 describe hogs \n     that were walking and squealing after being stunned as many \n     as four times. In a memo to USDA, the company said it fired \n     the stunner and increased monitoring of the slaughter \n     process.\n       At an Excel Corp. beef plant in Fort Morgan, Colo., \n     production was halted for a day in 1998 after workers \n     allegedly cut off the leg of a live cow whose limbs had \n     become wedged in a piece of machinery. In imposing the \n     sanction, U.S. inspectors cited a string of violations in the \n     previous two years, including the cutting and skinning of \n     live cattle. The company, responding to one such charge, \n     contended that it was normal for animals to blink and arch \n     their backs after being stunned, and such ``muscular \n     reaction'' can occur up to six hours after death. ``None of \n     these reactions indicate the animal is still alive,'' \n     the company wrote to USDA.\n       Hogs, unlike cattle, are dunked in tanks of hot water after \n     they are stunned to soften the hides for skinning. As a \n     result, a botched slaughter condemns some hogs to being \n     scalded and drowned. Secret videotape from an Iowa pork plant \n     shows hogs squealing and kicking as they are being lowered \n     into the water.\n       USDA documents and interviews with inspectors and plant \n     workers attributed many of the problems to poor training, \n     faulty or poorly maintained equipment or excessive production \n     speeds. Those problems were identified five years ago in an \n     industry-wide audit by Temple Grandin, an assistant professor \n     with Colorado State University's animal sciences department \n     and one of the nation's leading experts on slaughter \n     practices.\n       In the early 1990s, Grandin developed the first objective \n     standards for treatment of animals in slaughterhouses, which \n     were adopted by the American Meat Institute, the industry's \n     largest trade group. Her initial, USDA-funded survey in 1996 \n     was one of the first attempts to grade slaughter plants.\n       One finding was a high failure rate among beef plants that \n     use stunning devices known as ``captive-bolt'' guns. Of the \n     plants surveyed, only 36 percent earned a rating of \n     ``acceptable'' or better, meaning cattle were knocked \n     unconscious with a single blow at least 95 percent of the \n     time.\n       Grandin now conducts annual surveys as a consultant for the \n     American Meat Institute and McDonald's Corp. She maintains \n     that the past four years have brought dramatic improvements--\n     mostly because of pressure from McDonald's, which sends a \n     team of meat industry auditors into dozens of plants each \n     year to observe slaughter practices.\n       Based on the data collected by McDonald's auditors, the \n     portion of beef plants scoring ``acceptable'' or better \n     climbed to 90 percent in 1999. Some workers and inspectors \n     are skeptical of the McDonald's numbers, and Grandin said the \n     industry's performance dropped slightly last year after \n     auditors stopped giving notice of some inspections.\n       Grandin said high production speeds can trigger problems \n     when people and equipment are pushed beyond their capacity. \n     From a typical kill rate of 50 cattle an hour in the early \n     1900s, production speeds rose dramatically in the 1980s. They \n     now approach 400 per hour in the newest plants.\n       ``It's like the `I Love Lucy' episode in the chocolate \n     factory,'' she said. ``You can speed up a job and speed up a \n     job, and after a while you get to a point where performance \n     doesn't simply decline--it crashes.''\n       When that happens, it's not only animals that suffer. \n     Industry trade groups acknowledge that improperly stunned \n     animals contribute to worker injuries in an industry that \n     already has the nation's highest rate of job-related injuries \n     and illnesses--about 27 percent a year. At some plants, \n     ``dead'' animals have inflicted so many broken limbs and \n     teeth that workers wear chest pads and hockey masks.\n       ``The live cows cause a lot of injuries,'' said Martin \n     Fuentes, an IBP worker whose arm was kicked and shattered by \n     a dying cow. ``The line is never stopped simply because an \n     animal is alive.''\n\n\n                          a ``brutal'' harvest\n\n       At IBP's Pasco complex, the making of the American \n     hamburger starts in a noisy, blood-spattered chamber shielded \n     from view by a stainless steel wall. Here, live cattle emerge \n     from a narrow chute to be dispatched in a process known as \n     ``knocking'' or ``stunning.'' On most days the chamber is \n     manned by a pair of Mexican immigrants who speak little \n     English and earn about $9 an hour for killing up to 2,050 \n     head per shift.\n       The tool of choice is a captive-bolt gun, which fires a \n     retractable metal rod into the steer's forehead. An effective \n     stunning requires a precision shot, which workers must \n     deliver hundreds of times daily to balky, frightened animals \n     that frequently weigh 1,000 pounds or more. Within 12 seconds \n     of entering the chamber, the fallen steer is shackled to a \n     moving chain to be bled and butchered by other workers in \n     a fast-moving production line.\n       The hitch, IBP workers say, is that some ``stunned'' cattle \n     wake up.\n       ``If you put a knife into the cow, it's going to make a \n     noise: It says, `Moo!' '' said Moreno, the former second-\n     legger, who began working in the stockyard last year. ``They \n     move the head and the eyes and the leg like the cow wants to \n     walk.''\n       After a blow to the head, an unconscious animal may kick or \n     twitch by reflex. But a videotape, made secretly by IBP \n     workers and reviewed by veterinarians for The Post, depicts \n     cattle that clearly are alive and conscious after being \n     stunned.\n       Some cattle, dangling by a leg from the plant's overhead \n     chain, twist and arch their backs as though trying to right \n     themselves. Close-ups show blinking reflexes, an unmistakable \n     sign of a conscious brain, according to guidelines approved \n     by the American Meat Institute.\n       The video, parts of which were aired by Seattle television \n     station KING last spring, shows injured cattle being \n     trampled. In one graphic scene, workers give a steer electric \n     shocks by jamming a battery-powered prod into its mouth.\n       More than 20 workers signed affidavits alleging that the \n     violations shown on tape are commonplace and that supervisors \n     are aware of them. The sworn statements and videos were \n     prepared with help from the Humane Farming Association. Some \n     workers had taken part in a 1999 strike over what they said \n     were excessive plant production speeds.\n\n[[Page S7307]]\n\n       ``I've seen thousands and thousands of cows go through the \n     slaughter process alive,'' IBP veteran Fuentes, the worker \n     who was injured while working on live cattle, said in an \n     affidavit. ``The cows can get seven minutes down the line and \n     still be alive. I've been in the side-puller where they're \n     still alive. All the hide is stripped out down the neck \n     there.''\n       IBP, the nation's top beef processor, denounced as an \n     ``appalling aberration'' the problems captured on the tape. \n     It suggested the events may have been staged by ``activists \n     trying to raise money and promote their agenda. . . .\n       ``Like many other people, we were very upset over the \n     hidden camera video,'' the company said. ``We do not in any \n     way condone some of the livestock handling that was shown.''\n       After the video surfaced, IBP increased worker training and \n     installed cameras in the slaughter area. The company also \n     questioned workers and offered a reward for information \n     leading to identification of those responsible for the video. \n     One worker said IBP pressured him to sign a statement denying \n     that he had seen live cattle on the line.\n       ``I knew that what I wrote wasn't true,'' said the worker, \n     who did not want to be identified for fear of losing his job. \n     ``Cows still go alive every day. When cows go alive, it's \n     because they don't give me time to kill them.''\n       Independent assessments of the workers' claims have been \n     inconclusive. Washington State officials launched a probe in \n     May that included an unannounced plant inspection. The \n     investigators say they were detained outside the facility for \n     an hour while their identities were checked. They saw no acts \n     of animal cruelty once permitted inside.\n       Grandin, the Colorado State professor, also inspected IBP's \n     plant, at the company's request; that inspection was \n     announced. Although she observed no live cattle being \n     butchered, she concluded that the plant's older-style \n     equipment was ``overloaded.'' Grandin reviewed parts of the \n     workers' videotape and said there was no mistaking what she \n     saw.\n       ``There were fully alive beef on that rail,'' Grandin said.\n\n\n                        inconsistent enforcement\n\n       Preventing this kind of suffering is officially a top \n     priority for the USDA's Food Safety Inspection Service. By \n     law, a humane-slaughter violation is among a handful of \n     offenses that can result in an immediate halt in production--\n     and cost a meatpacker hundreds or even thousands of dollars \n     per idle minute.\n       In reality, many inspectors describe humane slaughter as a \n     blind spot: Inspectors' regular duties rarely take them to \n     the chambers where stunning occurs. Inconsistencies in \n     enforcement, training and record-keeping hamper the agency's \n     ability to identify problems.\n       The meat inspectors' union, in its petition last spring to \n     Washington state's attorney general, contended that federal \n     agents are ``often prevented from carrying out'' the mandate \n     against animal cruelty. Among the obstacles inspectors face \n     are ``dramatic increases in production speeds, lack of \n     support from supervisors in plants and district offices . . . \n     new inspection policies which significantly reduce our \n     enforcement authority, and little to no access to the areas \n     of the plants where animals are killed,'' stated the petition \n     by the National Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals.\n       Barbara Masters, the agency's director of slaughter \n     operations, told meat industry executives in February she \n     didn't know if the number of violations was up or down, \n     thought she believed most plants were complying with the law. \n     ``We encourage the district offices to monitor trends,'' she \n     said. ``The fact that we haven't heard anything suggests \n     there are no trends.''\n       But some inspectors see little evidence the agency is \n     interested in hearing about problems. Under the new \n     inspection system, the USDA stopped tracking the number of \n     violations and dropped all mentions of humane slaughter from \n     its list of rotating tasks for inspectors.\n       The agency says it expects its watchdogs to enforce the law \n     anyway. Many inspectors still do, though some occasionally \n     wonder if it's worth the trouble.\n       ``It always ends up in argument: Instead of re-stunning the \n     animal, you spend 20 minutes just talking about it,'' said \n     Colorado meat inspector Gary Dahl, sharing his private views. \n     ``Yes, the animal will be dead in a few minutes anyway. But \n     why not let him die with dignity?''\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 10, 2001]\n\n                   Big Mac's Big Voice in Meat Plants\n\n                           (By Joby Warrick)\n\n       Kansas City, Mo.--Never mind the bad old days, when \n     slaughterhouses were dark places filled with blood and \n     terror. As far as the world's No. 1 hamburger vendor is \n     concerned, Happy Meals start with happy cows.\n       That was the message delivered in February by a coterie of \n     McDonald's consultants to a group of 140 managers who oversee \n     the slaughter of most of the cattle and pigs Americans will \n     consume this year. From now on, McDonald's says, its \n     suppliers will be judged not only on how cleanly they \n     slaughter animals, but also on how well they manage the small \n     details in the final minutes.\n       Starting with cheerful indoor lighting.\n       ``Cows like indirect lighting,'' explained Temple Grandin, \n     an animal science assistant professor at Colorado State \n     University and McDonald's lead consultant on animal welfare. \n     ``Bright lights are a distraction.''\n       And only indoor voices, please.\n       ``We've got to get rid of the yelling and screaming coming \n     out of people's mouths,'' Grandin scolded.\n       So much attention on atmosphere may seem misplaced, given \n     that the beneficiaries are seconds away from death. But \n     McDonald's, like much of the meat industry, is serious when \n     it comes to convincing the public of its compassion for the \n     cows, chickens and pigs that account for the bulk of its \n     menu.\n       Bloodied in past scrapes with animal rights groups, \n     McDonald's has been positioning itself in recent years as an \n     ardent defender of farm animals. It announced last year it \n     would no longer buy eggs from companies that permit the \n     controversial practice of withholding food and water from \n     hens to speed up egg production.\n       Now the company's headfirst plunge into slaughter policing \n     is revolutionizing the way slaughterhouses do business, \n     according to a wide range of industry experts and observers.\n       ``In this business, you have a pre-McDonald's era and a \n     post-McDonald's era,'' said Grandin, who has studied animal-\n     handling practices for more than 20 years. ``The difference \n     is measured in light-years.''\n       Others also have contributed to the improvement, including \n     the American Meat Institute, which is drawing ever-larger \n     crowds to its annual ``humane-handling'' seminars, such as \n     the one in Kansas City. The AMI, working with Grandin, issued \n     industry-wide guidelines in 1997 that spell out proper \n     treatment of cows and pigs, from a calm and orderly delivery \n     to the stockyards to a quick and painless end on the killing \n     floor.\n       But the driving force for change is McDonald's, which \n     decided in 1998 to conduct annual inspections at every plant \n     that puts the beef into Big Macs. The chain's auditors \n     observe how animals are treated at each stage of the process, \n     keeping track of even minor problems such as excessive \n     squealing or the overuse of cattle prods.\n       The members of McDonald's audit team say their job is made \n     easier by scientific evidence that shows tangible economic \n     benefits when animals are treated well. Meat from abused or \n     frightened animals is often discolored and soft, and it \n     spoils more quickly due to hormonal secretions in the final \n     moments of life, industry experts say.\n       ``Humane handling results in better finished products,'' \n     AMI President J. Patrick Boyle said. ``It also creates a \n     safer workplace, because there's a potential for worker \n     injuries when animals are mishandled.''\n       Not everyone is convinced that slaughter practices have \n     improved as much as McDonald's surveys suggest. Gail Eisnitz, \n     investigator for the Humane Farming Association, notes that \n     until the past few months, all McDonald's inspections were \n     announced in advance.\n       ``The industry's self-inspections are meaningless,'' \n     Eisnitz said. ``They're designed to lull Americans into a \n     false sense of security about what goes on inside \n     slaughterhouses.''\n       But Jeff Rau, an animal scientist who attended the Kansas \n     City seminar on behalf of the Humane Society of the United \n     States, saw the increased attention to animal welfare as a \n     hopeful step.\n       ``The industry has recognized it has some work to do,'' Rau \n     said. ``The next step is to convince consumers to be aware of \n     what is happening to their food before it gets to the table. \n     People should understand that their food dollars can carry \n     some weight in persuading companies to improve.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                           Eulogy of the Dog\n\n                          (By George G. Vest)\n\n       Warrensburg, MO, Sept. 23, 1870.--Gentlemen of the jury. \n     The best friend a man has in the world may turn against him \n     and become his enemy. His son or daughter whom he has reared \n     with loving care may prove ungrateful. Those who are nearest \n     and dearest to us, those whom we trust with our happiness and \n     our good name, may become traitors to their faith. The money \n     that a man has he may lose. It flies away from him perhaps \n     when he needs it most. A man's reputation may be sacrificed \n     in a moment of ill-considered action. The people who are \n     prone to fall on their knees to do us honor when success is \n     with us may be the first to throw the stone of malice when \n     failure settles its cloud upon our heads. The one absolutely \n     unselfish friend that a man can have in this selfish world, \n     the one that never deserts him, the one that never proves \n     ungrateful or treacherous, is the dog.\n       Gentlemen of the jury, a man's dog stands by him in \n     prosperity and in poverty, in health and in sickness. He will \n     sleep on the cold ground when the wintry winds blow and the \n     snow drives fiercely, if only he can be near his master's \n     side. He will kiss the hand that has no food to offer, he \n     will lick the wounds and sores that come in encounter with \n     the roughness of the world. He guards the sleep of his pauper \n     master as if he were a prince.\n       When all other friends desert, he remains. When riches take \n     wings and reputation falls to pieces, he is as constant in \n     his love as the sun in its journey through the heavens. If \n     fortune drives the master forth an outcast into the world, \n     friendless sand homeless, the faithful dog asks no higher \n     privilege than that of accompanying him, to guard him against \n     danger, to fight against his enemies. And when the last scene \n     of all comes, and death takes his master in its embrace and\n\n[[Page S7308]]\n\n     his body is laid in the cold ground, no matter if all other \n     friends pursue their way, there by his graveside will the \n     noble dog be found, his head between his paws and his eyes \n     sad but open, in alert watchfulness, faithful and true, even \n     unto death.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, after Senator Stevens presents his \nstatement, if he has no objection, I will present the managers' \namendment. And at that time I will also ask unanimous consent that if \nthat managers' amendment may be agreed to, that a second managers' \namendment may be in order if necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I join the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee in presenting this bill, S. 1077, to the Senate today. It \nprovides necessary supplemental funds for the remainder of fiscal year \n2001.\n  Let me start off by thanking Senator Byrd for his kind comments. It \nis a pleasure, once more, to present a supplemental bill to the Senate \ntogether with my great friend from West Virginia. He is chairman now. I \nwas chairman last year. I can tell the Senate, it makes no difference \nas far as we are concerned. We work together. We may have slight \ndisagreements from time to time, but we work those out before coming to \nthis Chamber. I commend him for the way he is now proceeding--as \nrapidly as possible--to catch up on the schedule of the appropriations \nbills so we may do our best to complete them all by the end of this \nfiscal year.\n  As stated by Senator Byrd, this bill, as reported by our committee, \nconforms to the budget resources available for this year in both budget \nauthority and outlays. The bill also matches the total request \nsubmitted by President Bush of $6.5 billion.\n  The bill does not present any emergency appropriations. All spending \nis within the budget caps set by Congress and within the President's \nrequest.\n  I commend the chairman for reporting this bill out of the committee \njust 1 day after the House passed the companion measure, H.R. 2216. Our \ncommittee had only 2 weeks to consider the President's request and \nHouse adjustments, and sent this bill forward with a unanimous vote in \nthe committee. That is a great compliment to Senator Byrd as the \nchairman of the committee.\n  I am pleased to join him in recommending the bill to the Senate. I \nurge all Members to support the bill and to adhere to the tight \nspending limits that have been adhered to by the committee itself. \nNearly 90 percent of the funding provided in this bill meets the \nongoing needs of the Department of Defense.\n  I join also in commending the senior Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye, \nthe chairman of the Defense Subcommittee, for his determination to meet \nthe readiness, quality of life, and health care needs of the men and \nwomen who serve in our Nation's Armed Forces.\n  In addition to the amounts requested by the President, funds are \nprovided in the bill for the direct care system for military medicine. \nAdditional funds are also proposed for Army real property maintenance \nand spare parts advocated by General Shinseki, the Army Chief of Staff. \nFunds are also provided for Navy ship depot maintenance and engagement \ninitiatives for the commander in chief of the U.S. Pacific Command.\n  Based on extensive hearings by the Defense Subcommittee and numerous \ndiscussions with the Secretary of Defense, these amounts are adequate \nto meet the military's needs through the end of this fiscal year.\n  This bill is no substitute for the significant increase in defense \nfunds that have been sought by the President in his budget amendment. \nHe has sought an additional $18.4 billion over the original request for \nfiscal year 2002. We are looking here only at amounts needed through \nSeptember 30 of this year, 2001. Just 83 days from now, we will see the \nend of this fiscal year.\n  Amendments may be offered that would provide additional funds for \nthis year--for 2001. I urge my colleagues to withhold such amendments. \nWe have adequately discussed the needs with the Department, and we \nbelieve there are no additional funds that could be spent within this \nfiscal year of 2001.\n\n  We will have an opportunity to assess the needs of the Department \nthrough the Defense authorization and appropriations bills for 2002, \nthe fiscal year that we will address starting on October 1 of this \nyear. We cannot address all those needs here. We do not need to deal \nwith the 2002 requests in a 2001 supplemental appropriations bill.\n  I join my colleagues in their belief that we need additional \nresources for our national defense. I shall do my best to support the \nrequest of the President, and all other funding that we might be able \nto achieve, to really deal with the Department of Defense needs.\n  The underfunding of the past cannot be corrected in one supplemental \nbill. The new Secretary and the President of the United States have \nasked for our patience while they set new priorities and determine the \nmost vital needs for our Armed Forces. We have had significant changes \nin our military strategy, and we should accord the President of the \nUnited States and the Secretary of Defense the courtesy they have \nrequested and wait for their report.\n  We need to move this bill out of the Senate today. I join Senator \nByrd in committing to hold this bill to the level set by the committee \nand by the President for this fiscal year.\n  We need to get the military the money they need by getting this bill \nto conference and out of conference this week so that they will have \nthese funds available for the remainder of this year. I also commit to \nworking with my colleagues to secure the funding later this month, and \nin September, for fiscal year 2002 and future years.\n  In addition to the military requirements, there are several pressing \ndisaster relief challenges that face our National Government. Through \nseveral conversations with the Director of the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency, Joe Allbaugh, I am anxious about the level of FEMA \ndisaster relief funding available for the rest of this calendar year.\n  So far, no further supplemental request has been received from the \nOffice of Management and Budget for this fiscal year. It is my hope \nthat additional information will be available to the conferees on this \nbill later this week.\n  Challenges from tropical storm Allison, ice storms in the Southeast, \nand other disasters continue to stress our response capability. \nEspecially damaging was the loss to the medical research programs in \nHouston, TX, during the storm Allison.\n  The Senator from Texas, a member of our committee, has worked \ntirelessly to find means to address that crisis, and I look forward to \nworking with her on that effort to the maximum extent possible.\n  With no budget constraints, I could support additional funding for \nthe Department of Defense, for FEMA, for LIHEAP, and several other \npriorities sought by many of our colleagues.\n  We were asked by the President to limit funding in this bill to such \namounts as could be spent during the remainder of this fiscal year. \nThat is a reasonable request. We were also asked to live within the \nmoneys available under the funding caps set by the Congress. We have \nalready voted on that this year, and we feel constrained by those \nlimits.\n  We were asked to break the cycle of ``emergency'' appropriations as \nsimply a tool to get around budget limits. We do not support those \nactions, and the executive branch in the past has required emergency \nappropriations each year. We hope we will not have to pursue that \npolicy in the future.\n  This bill meets the demands of the Congress and the President of the \nUnited States for budget constraints.\n  We hope we can go to conference this week with the House. If the \nSenate passes this bill, as we hope, early tomorrow morning, that will \ntake place.\n  I implore all Senators to work with us today to complete this bill so \nthe funds can get to the Armed Forces by the end of this week.\n  We have been in sort of a vicious cycle in recent years whereby the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs and the Chiefs themselves have had to \ndetermine how much they could spend in the early parts of the fiscal \nyear because of constraints placed on them due to the deviation of \nfunds for peacekeeping and other activities. That has led every year to \na supplemental. This is one of those supplementals for funds necessary \nto carry out the basic needs of our military during the summertime. The \nsteaming hours of our Navy, the flying hours of our Air Force and our\n\n[[Page S7309]]\n\nMarines and Navy, the ground exercises by our Army, and the activities \nthat take place throughout the world by our men and women in the armed \nservices demand additional money.\n  This is the bill to fund those for the remainder of July and August \nand September. Those activities will depend upon the passage of this \nbill.\n  The sooner we can pass this bill, the better off we will be in terms \nof the training and the activities of our men and women in the armed \nservices to assure their capabilities to defend this country.\n  I urgently support this bill. I urgently urge the Senate to pass it \nas soon as possible.\n  I request the cooperation of every Member of the Senate in trying to \nhelp us accomplish that objective no later than tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today in support of \nS. 1077, the Supplemental Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2001.\n  The Senate bill provides $8.477 billion in new discretionary budget \nauthority, offset by the rescission of $1.933 billion of budget \nauthority provided in previous years, for a net increase of $6.544 \nbillion. As a result of this additional budget authority, outlays will \nincrease by $1.291 billion in 2001. The Senate bill meets its revised \nsection 302(a) and 302(b) allocations for budget authority and is well \nunder--by more than $1 billion--those allocations for outlays.\n  I commend Chairman Byrd and Senator Stevens for their bipartisan \neffort under unusual circumstances in bringing this important measure \nto the floor within its allocation and without resorting to unnecessary \nemergency designations. This bill provides important resources to our \nuniformed personnel, including funding statutory increases in pay and \nhealth care. In addition, it provides assistance to low-income families \nfor heating and education.\n  I urge adoption of the bill.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that a table displaying the Budget \nCommittee scoring of this bill printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n             S. 1077, SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001\n  [Spending comparsions--Senate-reported bill (in millions of dollars)]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     Discretionary  Mandatory    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget Authority.................       6,544           936     7,480\n  Outlays..........................       1,291           936     2,227\nAmounts available within Senate\n 302(a) allocation:\n  Budget Authority.................       6,545           936     7,481\n  Outlays..........................       2,487           936     3,423\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget Authority.................       6,545           936     7,481\n  Outlays..........................       1,341           936     2,277\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority.................       6,543           936     7,479\n  Outlays..........................       1,232           936     2,168\n \n  SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO\n \nAmounts available within Senate\n 302(a) allocation:\n  Budget Authority.................

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cochran). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 861\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I shall send to the desk a managers' \namendment supported by Senator Stevens and myself. It consists of a \npackage of amendments. These amendments have been cleared on both \nsides, and I know of no controversy concerning them.\n  The first is an amendment by Senators Hutchison and Inhofe for storm \ndamage repair at military facilities in Texas and Oklahoma.\n  The next amendment is offered by Senators Torricelli and Corzine to \nconvey surplus firefighting equipment in New Jersey.\n  The next is an amendment by myself to make technical corrections in \nthe energy and water chapter in title I.\n  Next is an amendment for storm damage repair at military facilities \nin Texas and Oklahoma offered by Senators Hutchison and Inhofe.\n  Next is an amendment by Senator Stevens to increase the authorization \nfor the Bassett Army Hospital.\n  Next is an amendment to provide $3 million for the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture for humane treatment of animals. That is my amendment. It \nis fully offset by a later amendment.\n  Next is an amendment offered by Senators Grassley, Roberts, and \nStevens to expedite rulemaking for crop insurance.\n  Next is an amendment by Senators Feinstein and Boxer and Smith of \nOregon and Wyden to provide $20 million for the Klamath Basin. Funding \nis offset in a later amendment.\n  This will be followed by an amendment by myself in the agriculture \nchapter to provide an offset for the $3 million for humane treatment of \nanimals.\n  Next is an amendment to increase a rescission in the committee bill \nfor the oil and gas guarantee program by $4.8 million.\n  Next is an amendment to strike section 2101 of the committee bill \ndealing with the Oceans Commission.\n  Next is an amendment to clarify the use of D.C. local funds to \nprevent the demolition by neglect of historic properties, followed by \nan amendment to redirect the expenditure of $250,000 within the Western \nArea Power Administration, followed by an amendment by Senator Burns to \nprovide a transfer of $3 million for the Bureau of Land Management \nenergy permitting activities.\n  Next is an amendment by Senator Harkin to clarify the timing of the \ndislocated worker rescission in the committee bill.\n  This will be followed by a technical change to a heading in the bill.\n  Next is an amendment offered by Senator Domenici to make a technical \ndate correction in the Perkins Vocational Education Act.\n  Next is an amendment by myself and Senator Stevens to authorize the \nexpenditure of $20 million previously appropriated, subject to \nauthorization, to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for digital \nconversion by local stations.\n  Next is an amendment to allow the Architect of the Capitol to make \npayments to Treasury for water and sewer services provided by the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  These will be followed by amendments by Senators Murray and Stevens \nto, one, appropriate $16,800,000 to repair damage caused in Seattle by \nthe Nisqually earthquake; two, appropriate $2 million for a joint U.S.-\nCanada commission dealing with connection of the Alaska Railroad to the \nNorth American system; and, three, make certain technical corrections. \nThe funding is offset by rescissions.\n\n  Next is an amendment by Senator Inouye to transfer $1 million from \nthe Morris K. Udall Foundation to the Native Nations Institute.\n  And finally an amendment to name a building in the State of Virginia \nfor a late House colleague, Norm Sisisky, on behalf of Senator Warner.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the amendments be considered en bloc and \nthat the reading of the amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the managers' \namendment be agreed to and that it be considered as original text for \nthe purpose of further amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, it is my \nunderstanding that the chairman of the committee will offer another \nunanimous consent request for a second managers' amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I make that request in conjunction with the request \npending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S7310]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment by number \nfor the information of the Senate.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], for himself and \n     Mr. Stevens, proposes an amendment numbered 861.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has been agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 861) was agreed to:\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator's unanimous consent request included the \nrequest for a second managers' amendment; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That request has been granted.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this would be a very good time for all of \nour colleagues to offer their amendments if they have amendments. \nSenator Stevens and I are prepared to listen to Senators propose their \namendments, and we are prepared to respond to their proposals. Much \ntime could be saved if Senators will come to the floor and offer those \namendments at the very earliest. Of course, if Senators don't have \namendments, that will suit the two of us just as well.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, seeing no other Senator who seeks \nrecognition at this time, I shall speak on another matter \nnotwithstanding the fact that the Pastore rule has not run its course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/09/senate-section/article/S7310-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7310-S7312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CRUELTY TO ANIMALS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, a few months ago, a lady by the name of Sara \nMcBurnett accidentally tapped a sports utility vehicle from behind on a \nbusy highway in California. The angry owner of the bumped vehicle, Mr. \nAndrew Burnett, stormed back to Ms. McBurnett's car and began yelling \nat her; and then reached through her open car window with both hands, \ngrabbed her little white dog and hurled it onto the busy roadway. The \nlady sat helplessly watching in horror as her frightened little pet ran \nfor its life, dodging speeding traffic to no avail. The traffic was too \nheavy and the traffic was too swift.\n  Imagine her utter horror. Recently, Mr. Burnett was found guilty of \nanimal cruelty by a jury in a California court, so my faith in the \nwisdom of juries was restored. Ever since I first heard about this \nmonstrous, brutal, barbaric act, I have wondered what would drive any \nsane person to do such a thing. There are some people who have blamed \nthis senseless and brutal incident on road rage. But it was not just \nroad rage, it was bestial cruelty. It was and is an outrage. It was an \nact of sheer depravity to seize a fluffy, furry, innocent little dog, \nand toss it onto a roadway, and most certainly to be crushed under tons \nof onrushing steel, iron, glass, and rubber, while its terrified owner, \nand perhaps other people in other vehicles, watched.\n  There is no minimizing such cruelty and resorting to the lame excuse \nthat, ``after all, it was just a dog.''\n  The dog owner, Ms. McBurnett, puts the incident in perspective. Here \nis what she said: It wasn't just a dog to me. For me, it was my child. \nA majority of pet owners do believe their pets to be family members. \nThat is the way I look at my little dog, my little dog Billy--Billy \nByrd. I look at him as a family member. When he passes away, I will \nshed tears. I know that. He is a little white Maltese Terrier. As a pet \nowner and dog lover, I know exactly what that lady means, and so did \nmillions of other dog lovers who could never even fathom such an act.\n  For my wife and me, Billy Byrd is a key part of our lives at the Byrd \nHouse in McLean. He brings us great joy and wonderful companionship. As \nI said on this floor just a few months ago, if I ever saw in this world \nanything that was made by the Creator's hand that is more dedicated, \nmore true, more faithful, more trusting, more undeviant than this \nlittle dog, I am at a loss to state what it is. Such are the feelings \nof many dog owners.\n  Dogs have stolen our hearts and made a place in our homes for \nthousands of years. Dogs fill an emotional need in man and they have \nendured as our close companions. They serve as guards and sentries and \nwatchdogs; they are hunting companions. Some, like Lassie and Rin Tin \nTin, have become famous actors. But mostly, these sociable little \ncreatures are valued especially as loyal comforters to their human \nmasters. Petting a dog can make our blood pressure drop. Try it. Our \nheart rate slows down. Try it. Our sense of anxiety diminishes, just \ngoes away. Researchers in Australia have found that dog owners have a \nlower risk of heart disease, lower blood pressure, and lower \ncholesterol levels than those people who do not own dogs. Researchers \nin England have demonstrated that dog owners have far fewer minor \nhealth complaints than those people without a dog. Our dogs are about \nthe most devoted, steadfast companions that the Creator could have \ndesigned. They are said to be man's best friend and, indeed, who can \ndispute it?\n  The affection that a dog provides is not only unlimited, it is \nunqualified, unconditional. A faithful dog does not judge its owner, it \ndoes not criticize him or her, it simply accepts him or her; it accepts \nus as we are, for who we are, no matter how we dress, no matter how \nmuch money we have or don't have, and no matter what our social \nstanding might be or might not be. No matter what happens, one's dog is \nstill one's friend.\n  A long, frustrating day at work melts into insignificance--gone--with \nthe healing salve of warm, excited greetings from one's ever faithful, \neternally loyal dog.\n  President Truman was supposed to have remarked: If you want a friend \nin Washington, buy a dog. I often think about Mr. Truman's words. No \nwonder so many political leaders have chosen the dog as a faithful \ncompanion and canine confidante. Former Senate Republican leader, \nRobert Dole, was constantly bringing his dog, ``Leader''--every day--to \nwork with him. President Bush has ``Barney'' and ``Spot.'' President \nTruman had an Irish setter named ``Mike.'' President Ford had a golden \nretriever named ``Lucky.'' The first President Bush had Millie.\n  Of course, there was President Franklin Roosevelt and his dog, \n``Fala.'' They had such a close relationship that his political \nopponents once attempted to attack him by attacking his dog. Eleanor \nRoosevelt recalled that for months after the death of her husband, \nevery time someone approached the door of her house, Fala would run to \nit in excitement, hoping that it was President Roosevelt coming home.\n  The only time I remember President Nixon becoming emotional, except \nwhen he was resigning the Presidency, perhaps more so in the first \ninstance, was in reference to his dog ``Checkers.''\n  At the turn of the century, George G. Vest delivered a deeply \ntouching summation before the jury in the trial involving the killing \nof a dog, Old Drum. This occurred, I think, in 1869. There were two \nbrothers-in-law, both of whom had fought in the Union Army. They lived \nin Johnson County, MO. One was named Leonidas Hornsby. The other was \nnamed Charles Burden.\n  Burden owned a dog, and he was named ``Old Drum.'' He was a great \nhunting dog. Any time that dog barked one could know for sure that it \nwas on the scent of a raccoon or other animal.\n  Leonidas Hornsby was a farmer who raised livestock and some of his \ncalves and lambs were being killed by animals. He, therefore, swore to \nshoot any animal, any dog that appeared on his property.\n\n[[Page S7311]]\n\n  One day there appeared on his property a hound. Someone said: \n``There's a dog out there in the yard.'' Hornsby said: ``Shoot him.''\n  The dog was killed. Charles Burden, the owner of the dog, was not the \nkind of man to take something like this lightly. He went to court. He \nwon his case and was awarded $25. Hornsby appealed, and, if I recall, \non the appeal there was a reversal, whereupon the owner of the dog \ndecided to employ the best lawyer that he could find in the area.\n  He employed a lawyer by the name of George Graham Vest. This lawyer \ngave a summation to the jury. Here is what he said:\n\n       The best friend that a man has in this world may turn \n     against him and become his enemy. His son or daughter whom he \n     has reared with loving care may prove ungrateful. Those who \n     are nearest and dearest to us, those whom we trust with our \n     happiness and our good name may become traitors to their \n     faith. The money that a man has, he may lose. It flies away \n     from him perhaps when he needs it most. A man may sacrifice \n     his reputation in a moment of ill-considered action.\n       The people who are prone to fall on their knees and do us \n     honor when success is with us may be the first to throw the \n     stone of malice when failure settles its cloud upon our \n     heads. The one absolutely unselfish friend that a man can \n     have in this selfish world, the one that never deserts him, \n     the one that never proves ungrateful or treacherous, is the \n     dog.\n       Gentlemen of the jury, a man's dog stands by him in \n     prosperity and in poverty, in health and in sickness. He will \n     sleep on the cold ground when the wintry winds blow, and the \n     snow drives fiercely, if only he can be near his master's \n     side. He will kiss the hand that has no food to offer, he \n     will lick the wounds and sores that come in encounter with \n     the roughness of the world. He guards the sleep of his pauper \n     master as if he were a prince.\n       When all other friends desert, he remains. When riches take \n     wings and reputation falls to pieces, he is as constant in \n     his love as the Sun in its journey through the heavens.\n       If fortune drives the master forth and outcast into the \n     world, friendless and homeless, the faithful dog asks no \n     higher privilege than that of accompanying him, to guard him \n     against danger, to fight against his enemies.\n       And when the last scene of all comes, death takes the \n     master in its embrace and his body is laid in the cold \n     ground, no matter if all other friends desert him and pursue \n     their way, there by his graveside will the noble dog be \n     found, his head between his paws and his eyes sad but open in \n     alert watchfulness, faithful and true, even unto death.\n\n  Well, of course, George Vest won the case. It was 1869 or 1870. In \n1879 he ran for the U.S. Senate and was elected and served in the \nSenate for 24 years. The citizens in Warrensburg, MO, decided to build \na statue to Old Drum, and that statue stands today in the courtyard at \nWarrensburg. Harry Truman contributed $250 to the building of the \nstatue. I generally ask new Senators from Missouri have they heard \nabout Old Drum. I asked that of Kit Bond one day and he remembered, so \nupon his first occasion to visit Warrensburg, MO, after that, he \nbrought me a picture of the statue of Old Drum.\n  So, just a little pat, a little treat, a little attention for the dog \nis all that a pet asks. How many members of the human species can love \nso completely? How does man return that kind of affection?\n  I remember a recent news program that told of a man who was going \naround killing dogs and selling the meat from them. A couple of years \nago, NBC News reported that American companies were importing and \nselling toys made in China that were decorated with the fur from dogs \nthat were raised and then slaughtered just for that purpose.\n  And now we have this monster--I do not hesitate to overrate him--who, \nbecause of cruelty and rage, decided that he had the right to grab a \nharmless little dog and hurl it to its certain death. It makes one \nponder the question, doesn't it, Which was the animal? Burnett, or Leo, \nthe little dog? Of course we know the answer.\n  The point is this: We have a responsibility to roundly condemn such \nabject cruelty. Apathy regarding incidents such as this will only lead \nto more deviant behavior. And respect for life, all life, and for \nhumane treatment of all creatures is something that must never be lost.\n  The Scriptures say in the Book of Proverbs, ``A righteous man \nregardeth the life of his beast, but the tender mercies of the wicked \nare cruel.''\n  Mr. President, I am concerned that cruelty toward our faithful \nfriend, the dog, may be reflective of an overall trend toward animal \ncruelty. Recent news accounts have been saturated with accounts of such \nbrutal behavior. A year or two ago, it was revealed that macabre videos \nshowing small animals, including hamsters, kittens, and monkeys, being \ncrushed to death were selling for as much as $300 each. And just a few \nday ago, there were local news accounts of incidents in Maryland \ninvolving decapitated geese being left on the doorsteps of several \nhomes in a Montgomery County community.\n\n  Our inhumane treatment of livestock is becoming widespread and more \nand more barbaric. Six-hundred-pound hogs--they were pigs at one time--\nraised in 2-foot-wide metal cages called gestation crates, in which the \npoor beasts are unable to turn around or lie down in natural positions, \nand this way they live for months at a time.\n  On profit-driven factory farms, veal calves are confined to dark \nwooden crates so small that they are prevented from lying down or \nscratching themselves. These creatures feel; they know pain. They \nsuffer pain just as we humans suffer pain. Egg-laying hens are confined \nto battery cages. Unable to spread their wings, they are reduced to \nnothing more than an egg-laying machine.\n  Last April, the Washington Post detailed the inhumane treatment of \nlivestock in our Nation's slaughterhouses. A 23-year-old Federal law \nrequires that cattle and hogs to be slaughtered must first be stunned, \nthereby rendered insensitive to pain, but mounting evidence indicates \nthat this is not always being done, that these animals are sometimes \ncut, skinned, and scalded while still able to feel pain.\n  A Texas beef company, with 22 citations for cruelty to animals, was \nfound chopping the hooves off live cattle. In another Texas plant with \nabout two dozen violations, Federal officials found nine live cattle \ndangling from an overhead chain. Secret videos from an Iowa pork plant \nshow hogs squealing and kicking as they are being lowered into the \nboiling water that will soften their hides, soften the bristles on the \nhogs and make them easier to skin.\n  I used to kill hogs. I used to help lower them into the barrels of \nscalding water, so that the bristles could be removed easily. But those \nhogs were dead when we lowered them into the barrels.\n\n  The law clearly requires that these poor creatures be stunned and \nrendered insensitive to pain before this process begins. Federal law is \nbeing ignored. Animal cruelty abounds. It is sickening. It is \ninfuriating. Barbaric treatment of helpless, defenseless creatures must \nnot be tolerated even if these animals are being raised for food--and \neven more so, more so. Such insensitivity is insidious and can spread \nand is dangerous. Life must be respected and dealt with humanely in a \ncivilized society.\n  So for this reason I have added language in the supplemental \nappropriations bill that directs the Secretary of Agriculture to report \non cases of inhumane animal treatment in regard to livestock \nproduction, and to document the response of USDA regulatory agencies.\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture agencies have the authority and \nthe capability to take action to reduce the disgusting cruelty about \nwhich I have spoken.\n  Oh, these are animals, yes. But they, too, feel pain. These agencies \ncan do a better job, and with this provision they will know that the \nU.S. Congress expects them to do better in their inspections, to do \nbetter in their enforcement of the law, and in their research for new, \nhumane technologies. Additionally, those who perpetuate such barbaric \npractices will be put on notice that they are being watched.\n  I realize that this provision will not stop all the animal life in \nthe United States from being mistreated. It will not even stop all \nbeef, cattle, hogs and other livestock from being tortured. But it can \nserve as an important step\n\n[[Page S7312]]\n\ntoward alleviating cruelty and unnecessary suffering by these \ncreatures.\n  Let me read from the Book of Genesis. First chapter, versus 24-26 \nreads:\n\n       And God said--\n\n  Who said? God said.\n\n       And God said, Let the Earth bring forth the living creature \n     after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the \n     Earth after his kind: and it was so.\n       And God made--\n\n  Who made?\n\n       And God made the beasts of the earth after his kind, and \n     cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon \n     the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.\n       And God said--\n\n  Who said? God said. Who said?\n\n       And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our \n     likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the \n     sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and \n     over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that \n     creepeth upon the Earth.\n\n  Thus, Mr. President, God gave man dominion over the Earth. We are \nonly the stewards of this planet. We are only the stewards of His \nplanet. Let us not fail in our Divine mission.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n[[Page S7313]]\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for reorganizing certain B-1 \n                             bomber forces)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.  . None of the funds available to the Department of \n     Defense for fiscal year 2001 may be obligated or expended for \n     retiring or dismantling, or for preparing to retire or \n     dismantle, any of the 93 B-1B Lancer bombers in service as of \n     June 1, 2001, or for transferring or reasigning any of those \n     aircraft from the unit, or the facility; to which assigned as \n     of that date.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, recently the Air Force revealed as part of \nits programmed budget decision its plan to cut the B-1B force structure \nby more than one-third. This has a substantial impact on a variety of \nAir Force bases that currently have a B-1B mission, and actually \neliminates the B-1B entirely from Mountain Home Air Force Base in my \nState, from McConnell Air Force Base in Kansas, and from Robbins Air \nForce Base in Georgia.\n  Such a drawdown in the B-1B fleet has the same national impact as \nwould BRAC. Clearly, decisions of this magnitude should not be made \nwithout consultation with Congress. There was no opportunity for advice \nand consent on the part of the Air Force or the Office of the Secretary \nof Defense.\n  Therefore, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself and Senator \nRoberts to preempt any precipitous action by the Department of Defense \nthat could circumvent the right of Congress to review such a \nsignificant change in our Air Force defense structure.\n  This amendment will prevent any 2001 funds from being used for the \npreparation of retiring, dismantling, or reassigning any portion of the \nB-1B fleet. This would allow Congress the necessary time to consider \nthe significance of the Air Force's decision and its impact with regard \nto the fiscal year 2002 defense budget.\n  The B-1B satisfies a very specific warfighting requirement as our \nfastest long-range strategic bomber capable of flying intercontinental \nmissions without refueling. With its flexible weapons payloads and a \nhigh carrying capacity, it is extremely effective against time-\nsensitive and mobile targets.\n  While cutting the force structure is advocated as a means of cost \nsavings and weapons upgrade, it comes at a significant national \nsecurity cost. Removal of the B-1B from Mountain Home Air Force Base \ncalls into question DOD's support of the composite wing which is the \nbasis for the air expeditionary wing concept and raises other long-term \nstrategic and mission questions.\n  The composite wing is our Nation's ``911 call'' in times of conflict \nthat require rapid reaction and deployment over long distances. Do we \nwant to eliminate our nation's 911 call, particularly in light of a \nfuture defense strategy that requires the increase capabilities that \nthe B-1B offers as a long-range, low-altitude, fast-penetration bomber?\n  Mountain Home Air Force Base is unique.\n  At Mountain Home, we train our men and women in uniform as they are \nexpected to fight by bringing together the composite wing and an \nadjacent premier training range with significant results that will \nensure that we are the next generation air power leader. We have \ncomposite wing training twice a month, premier night low-altitude \ntraining, dissimilar air combat training, and the current composite \nwing configuration fulfills the air expeditionary wing requirement 100 \npercent. Without the B1-B in the composite wing, our target load \ncapability is reduced by 60 percent.\n  Removal of the B1-B from the three bases will actually increase costs \nwhile reducing operational readiness: The B1 missions for the National \nGuard at McConnell and Robbins Air Force bases have a 15 percent higher \nmission capable rate than active duty units at Dyess Air Force Base in \nTexas and Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, with 25 percent \nless cost per flying hour, due to decreased wear and tear on the \naircraft. Also, the National Guard repairs B-1 engines for the whole \nfleet at 60 percent of the depot cost. As a result of the high costs \nassociated with traveling to others bases for training, other B1-B \nwings from Dyess Air Force Base and Ellsworth Air Force Base take part \nonly once a year in composite wing training, whereas the B1-B wing at \nMountain Home Air Force Base conducts this type of training twenty four \ntimes per year. The result is that aviators from Mountain Home are \nrated higher in operational inspections and training because of the \nenhanced training opportunities which they receive at reduced cost to \nthe government.\n  The Department of Defense shouldn't make budget decisions which \nchange major national security objectives without congressional review. \nMilitary budget decision should be made for the right reasons and not \nbe based on playing political favors, especially when it impacts our \noperational capability and readiness, and will cost the government more \nmoney in the long run. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment which will provide Congress with time to review the Air \nForce's decision and its effects on our national defense structure.\n  I have another amendment for proposal that is to be drafted and that \nI believe the ranking member will offer before the 6 o'clock deadline. \nI will speak briefly to that amendment. It deals with grain and \ncommodity sales to Israel.\n  Israel, as we all know, began to receive cash transfer assistance in \n1979 which replaced, in part, commodity import program assistance. In \nlieu of assistance specifically for commodity purchases, Israel agreed \nto continue to purchase United States grain, of which it has purchased \n1.6 million metric tons every year since, or until this year, 2001, and \nship half of it in privately owned United States-flagged commercial \nvessels. That, in essence, was the agreement in 1979.\n  Despite a level of United States aid in every year since 1984 that \nhas been higher than the 1979-1983 level, Israel never increased its \ngrain imports. That was kind of the quid pro quo: As our rates \nincreased, support would go up, and so would their purchases of \ncommodities. Had proportionality been the test, Israel would have \nreached the 2.45 million tons at least at one point. It never has. \nHowever, Israel has consistently cited proportionality in reference to \nthe 2001 Foreign Operations appropriation act in stating its intent to \ncut purchases of approximately 1.2 million metric tons in this fiscal \nyear. This cut is disproportionately greater than the reduction of the \nU.S. aid from the 2000-2001 fiscal period and is not consistent with \ncongressional intent.\n  My amendment, which will be proposed later this afternoon, reshapes \nthis, ensuring that a side letter agreement, with the terms of at least \nas favorable treatment as those in the year 2001, would be more \nconsistent with past congressional intent and previous bilateral \nrelations. Proportionality is something that I don't think can be or \nshould be effectively argued whereas they did not respond when our aid \nincreases went up.\n  We will be bringing a letter to the floor insisting that Israel stay \nconsistent with what was agreed to following 1979 as it related to \nturning, if you will, commodity import programs into cash transfer \nassistance. We think we have honored our agreement with Israel. The \namendment simply requires them to honor their agreement with us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I enjoyed reading the Washington Post this \nmorning and listening to the weekend talk shows. I noticed I was the \nsubject of a number of the articles and a number of the shows. I must \nsay, I didn't recognize the policy that was being ascribed to me. \nSomehow, people have taken what I have proposed and twisted it and \ndistorted it in a way that is almost unrecognizable. I think after \nexamination it is clear why they have done that, but we will get into \nthat in a moment.\n  The first article I would refer to is Robert Novak's piece in this \nmorning's Washington Post that was headlined, ``Kent Conrad's Show \nTrial.''\n\n[[Page S7314]]\n\n  Mr. Novak asserted that a hearing that I will be chairing later this \nweek to talk about the fiscal condition of the country and where we are \nheaded is some kind of a show trial. I want to assure Mr. Novak and \nanyone else who is listening, I have no interest in show trials. I do \nhave a very serious interest in where we find ourselves after the \nfiscal policy that the President proposed has been adopted in the \nCongress because I think it has created serious problems.\n  Mr. Daniels, the head of the Office of Management and Budget, was on \none of the talk shows this weekend and said I was engaged in what he \nreferred to as ``medieval economics.'' I kind of like better the way \nMr. Novak referred to me. He accused me of ``antique fiscal \nconservatism.'' ``Antique fiscal conservatism,'' that is the \ncharacterization he applied to the policies I proposed. Mr. Daniels \ncalled it ``medieval economics.''\n  What is it that I have talked about that has aroused such ire? All I \nhave said is I don't think we ought to be using the trust funds of \nMedicare and Social Security for other purposes.\n  That is what I have said. I think that is the right policy. I don't \nthink we should be using the trust funds of Social Security and \nMedicare for other purposes. After I made that statement, and after I \nnoted that the latest numbers that come from this administration \nsuggest that in fact we will be doing precisely that this year and next \nyear, Mr. Daniels responded by suggesting that means Senator Conrad \nfavors a tax increase at a time of an economic slowdown.\n  That is not my proposal. That is not what I suggested. In fact, my \nrecord is precisely the opposite of that. They know that. They know \nthat as the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee this year, I \ndidn't propose a tax increase in the midst of an economic slowdown. It \nis precisely the opposite of that. I proposed a $60 billion tax \nreduction as part of the Democratic alternative to the budget the \nPresident proposed. In fact, I supported much more tax relief as fiscal \nstimulus in this year than the President had in his plan.\n  So, please, let's not be mischaracterizing my position and suggesting \nI was for a tax increase at a time of economic slowdown. That is not \nthe truth. That isn't my record. My record is absolutely clear. Through \nall of the records of the Budget Committee and the debate on the floor, \nboth during the budget resolution and the tax bill, my record is as \nclear as it can be. I favored fiscal stimulus this year, more fiscal \nstimulus than the President proposed--not a tax increase, a tax cut.\n  We are going to have a debate, and the debate is required because we \nhave a serious problem developing. Let's have it in honest terms. Let's \nnot mischaracterize people's positions. Mr. Daniels, don't \nmischaracterize my position. You know full well I have not called for a \ntax increase in times of an economic slowdown. You know full well that \nmy record was calling for a tax cut--in fact, more of a tax cut in this \nyear of economic slowdown than the President was calling for.\n  It is true that over the 10 years of the budget resolution I called \nfor a substantially smaller tax cut than the President proposed because \nI was concerned about exactly what happened. Let's turn to that because \nthis is what set off this discussion.\n  As we look at the year we are now in, fiscal year 2001, if we start \nwith the total surplus of $275 billion and take out the Social Security \ntrust fund surplus of $156 billion and the Medicare trust fund of $28 \nbillion, that leaves us with $92 billion. The cost of the President's \ntax cut which actually passed the Congress wasn't what he proposed. It \nwas substantially different than he proposed because it was more front-\nend loaded, $74 billion this year. And $33 billion of that is a \ntransfer out of this year into next year--a 2-week delay in corporate \ntax receipts in order to make 2002 look better, because they knew they \nwere going to have a problem of raiding the Medicare trust fund in \n2002.\n  What did they do? They delayed certain corporate receipts by 2 \nweeks--$33 billion worth--and put them over into 2002. That added to \nthe cost of the tax bill.\n  There is only $40 billion of real stimulus in this tax bill that is \ngoing to go out into the hands of the American people during this year. \nBut the cost is $74 billion because of this cynical device they use to \ndelay corporate tax receipts to make 2002 look better.\n  As we go down and look at the cost of other budget resolution \npolicies for this year--largely the bill that is on the floor right \nnow, the supplemental appropriations bill for certain emergencies--and \nwe look at possible economic revisions that their own administration \nhas suggested will come--that is, we are not going to receive the \namount of revenue anticipated--we then see that we are into the \nMedicare trust fund by $17 billion this year. That is what it shows for \nthis year.\n\n  We had distinguished economists testify before the Budget Committee. \nBased on what they said, next year we are going to not only be using \nthe entire Medicare trust fund surplus but we are actually going to be \nusing some of the Social Security trust fund as well, $24 billion next \nyear; that is, if we take into account a series of other policy choices \nthat are going to have to be made.\n  That is the question I am raising. Mr. Daniels wants to change that \ninto a discussion of having a tax increase this year. I don't know \nanyone who is advocating a tax increase this year. I am certainly not. \nI advocated a tax reduction. But we don't have a forecast of economic \nslowdown for the next 10 years. That is not the forecast of the \nadministration. They are forecasting strong economic growth. That is \ntheir forecast. Yet with a forecast of strong economic growth starting \nnext year, we see that we are into the Medicare trust fund and the \nSocial Security trust fund next year. We have problems with the two \nfunds in 2003 and 2004, and that is before a single appropriations bill \nhas passed.\n  This is not a question of the Congress spending more money and \nputting us back into the deficit ditch. That is not this situation. We \nare in trouble just based on the budget resolution that was passed--the \nRepublican budget resolution, I might add.\n  Their tax cut--the tax cut supported by this President, and the \nreduction in revenue that they themselves are predicting--we have \ntrouble going into the Medicare and Social Security trust funds just on \nthe basis of those factors: The budget resolution that they endorsed, \nthe tax cut that they proposed and the President signed, and the \neconomic slowdown that they are predicting.\n  We are into the trust funds already. That is before the President's \nrequest for additional funding for defense. He has already asked for \n$18 billion for next year. That has a 10-year effect of over $200 \nbillion.\n  The question I am raising is, Where should that money come from? We \nare already into the trust fund before the President's defense request. \nShould that come out of the trust funds of Medicare and Social \nSecurity? Should we raise taxes to fund it? Should we cut other \nspending to fund it? Where should the money come from? Or, does the \nadministration believe we should just go further into the Social \nSecurity and Medicare trust funds? I hope that is not what they believe \nbecause I think that would be a mistake.\n  Again, this is all within the context of their forecast of a stronger \neconomy, of a growing economy. Is that circumstance the right policy to \nfund the President's additional spending requests for defense and the \nright policy to take it out of the Medicare trust fund or the Social \nSecurity trust fund? I don't think so. I think that is a serious \nmistake. As I say, we are already in trouble. We are already into the \ntrust funds before the President's defense request, before any new \nspending for education.\n  Remember that the Senate just passed, almost unanimously, a bill that \nauthorized more than $300 billion of new spending for education. It is \nnot in the budget resolution. We can see that if we fund just a part of \nthat--if we only fund $150 billion of it--that makes the situation with \nthe trust funds more serious.\n  This is before any funding for natural disasters. There is no funding \nfor natural disasters in the budget. Yet we know we spend $5 billion to \n$6 billion a year on natural disasters. Should that funding come out of \nthe Medicare and Social Security trust funds? That is exactly where we \nare headed.\n\n[[Page S7315]]\n\n  The question is, Is that the right policy? That is before the tax \nextenders are dealt with. Those are popular measures such as the \nresearch and development tax credit and the wind and solar energy \ncredits. Some of them run out this year. We are going to extend them. \nYet that is not in the budget.\n  Is it the right policy to take the funds necessary to extend those \ntax credits out of the Medicare and Social Security trust \nfunds? Because that is what we are poised to do.\n\n  The alternative minimum tax--that now affects some 2 million \ntaxpayers, but under the tax bill that has passed it is going to affect \n35 million taxpayers--just to fix the part of the alternative minimum \ntax that is caused by the tax bill we just passed would cost over $200 \nbillion to fix. That is not in the budget. Should that money come out \nof the Medicare and Social Security trust funds? Because that is what \nwe are poised to do.\n  I have said I do not think that is a good policy. I do not think we \nshould pay for a defense buildup out of the trust funds of Social \nSecurity and Medicare. I do not think we should pay for additional \neducation funding out of the trust funds. I do not think we should pay \nfor natural disasters or tax extenders or the alternative minimum tax \nfix out of the Medicare and Social Security trust funds. Because we \nneed to run surpluses there to prepare for the retirement of the baby \nboom generation. That is the money that is being used to pay down the \npublicly held debt.\n  I think, as I have said, at a time of strong economic growth--which \nis what is in the forecast--as a policy we should not be using the \nMedicare and Social Security trust funds to fund other parts of \ngovernmental responsibility. I think that is a profoundly wrong policy. \nAny private-sector organization in America that tried to use the \nretirement funds of their employees to fund the operations of the \norganization would be headed for a Federal institution, but it would \nnot be the Congress of the United States; they would be headed for a \nFederal prison because that is fraud, to take money that is intended \nfor one purpose and to use it for another.\n  We have stopped that practice. In the last year we stopped raiding \nthe trust funds to use those moneys for other purposes. We have stopped \nit. We have used that money to pay down debt. That is the right policy.\n  I hope very much we do not go back to the bad old days of raiding \nevery trust fund in sight in order to make the bottom line look as if \nit balances. I suggest to my colleagues, using the Medicare trust fund \nor the Social Security trust fund for the other costs of Government is \nnot a responsible way to operate. That is the point I have made.\n  I do not advocate a tax increase at a time of economic slowdown. I \nwant to repeat, my proposal that I gave my colleagues was for a \nsubstantial tax cut this year, fiscal stimulus, $60 billion of fiscal \nstimulus that I supported in this year. But we are not talking about an \neconomic slowdown being projected by this administration for the next \n10 years. They are projecting a strong return to economic growth.\n  I just saw the Secretary of the Treasury, the top spokesman on \neconomic policy for this administration, at a meeting overseas saying \nthey anticipate a return to strong economic growth next year. That is \ntheir projection. That is their forecast.\n  What I am saying is, if we are in a period of strong economic growth, \nit is not right to raid the trust funds of Medicare and Social Security \nfor other purposes. It is just wrong. It should not be done. But that \nis exactly where we are headed. The record is just as clear as it can \nbe. We are going to be into the Medicare trust fund and even the Social \nSecurity trust fund next year just with the budget resolution that has \npassed, just with the tax cut that has passed, and just with the \nslowdown in the economy that we already see. That is where we are. That \nis before any additional money for defense. That is before any \nadditional funding for education. That is before any money for natural \ndisasters or tax extenders or to fix the AMT problem. And that is \nbefore additional economic revisions we anticipate receiving in August \nfrom the Congressional Budget Office.\n\n  When we factor in those matters, what we see is a sea of red ink, \nwhat we see is a very heavy invasion of both the Medicare trust fund \nand the Social Security trust fund. That is where we are headed.\n  The question I am posing to my colleagues, and to this \nadministration, is, Does that make any sense as a policy? I do not \nthink so. I do not think this is where we want to go, especially given \nthe fact that we know in 11 years the baby boomers start to retire and \nthen our fiscal circumstance changes dramatically.\n  We have to get ready for that eventuality. The first thing to get \nready is not to raid the Medicare trust fund and the Social Security \ntrust fund at a time of surpluses. That is just wrong. They can call me \nan antique fiscal conservative. They can call me somebody who is \nadvocating medieval economics. I do not think so. I do not think this \nis antique fiscal conservatism. I think this is good old-fashioned, \nMidwestern common sense. You do not take the retirement funds of your \ncitizens to fund the operation of Government. You do not take the \nhealth care funds of your people for other operations of Government. \nThere is not a private-sector company in America that could do that.\n  I think this is very clear, the circumstance we face. We are already \nin trouble just with the budget resolution that has passed, just with \nthe tax cut that has passed, and just with the economic slowdown that \nis being forecasted in the next 2 years. The trouble only gets more \nsevere, only gets deeper, when you factor in the President's request \nfor a big increase in defense. I think it is fair to ask the President, \nand this administration, how do you intend to pay for it? Do you intend \nto use the money from the trust funds to pay for this big buildup in \ndefense? Do you intend to use the Medicare and Social Security trust \nfunds to pay for natural disasters? Do you intend to use the Medicare \nand Social Security trust funds to pay for the tax extenders? I think \npeople deserve to know what their recommendation is.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude as I began by saying I am not for a \ntax increase at a time of economic slowdown. That does not make good \neconomic sense. The administration is not forecasting an economic \nslowdown next year or for the years to follow. They are forecasting \nstrong economic growth. Yet the policies they have laid out and the \nplan they have put in place lead to huge, dramatic raids on both the \nMedicare and the Social Security trust funds each and every year for \nthe next 9 years. I believe that is a mistake. I do not support that \npolicy.\n  I support, certainly, fiscal stimulus at a time of economic downturn. \nBut when we have forecasts of strong economic growth, to build in a \npolicy that says the way we pay for the operations of this Government \nis to take money from the Medicare trust fund and the Social Security \ntrust fund--count me out. I don't care what name you call me, I don't \nwant any part of it. I don't care if I am the only vote that says: I am \nnot, at a time of economic growth, for using the trust funds of \nMedicare and Social Security to fund the other operations of \nGovernment. That is wrong. I believe it is wrong in every way. And I \nwant no part of it. But that is where we are headed.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator would yield for a question.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I noticed some press coverage today by \nsome folks who were raising some questions about my colleague's \nnumbers. I wonder if the Senator would answer this question. Is it not \nthe case that this question of tax cuts and fiscal policy was always \nbased on surpluses we do not yet have? Is it not the case that this \nrosy scenario everybody talked about--especially conservatives coming \nto the floor of the Senate--was: ``This economy is going to grow \nforever. Let's anticipate surpluses year after year after year. And \nlet's put in place tax and spending decisions that anticipate that''?\n  My colleague, Senator Conrad, and I and others repeatedly said the \nconservative viewpoint would be a viewpoint that says let's be \ncautious. Yes, when we have surpluses, let's provide some tax cuts. \nLet's provide some investments we need. But let's be a little bit \ncautious in case those surpluses don't materialize.\n\n[[Page S7316]]\n\n  Yet here we are, just a couple of months from those fiscal policy \ndecisions, and we are going to have a midsession review by the Office \nof Management and Budget which is what I would like to ask the chairman \nof the Budget Committee about. That midsession review almost certainly \nwill tell us this economy is much softer than anticipated and we will \nnot have the surpluses we expected. Things might get better, but they \nmight not. And if they don't, we might very well head back into very \nsignificant deficit problems.\n  I ask my colleague, when does the Office of Management and Budget \ngive us their midsession review? Is that supposed to be in July?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Typically, we would get it in July or August. We are \nhearing already from the Congressional Budget Office that they \nanticipate that the forecast will be somewhat reduced because economic \ngrowth is not as strong as was anticipated. That means we will have \nless revenue than was in the forecast.\n  My colleague and I warned repeatedly that these 10-year forecasts are \nuncertain. Nobody should be counting on every penny to actually be \nrealized.\n  Some said to us in rejoinder: There is going to even be more money. I \nremember some of my colleagues on the Budget Committee saying they \nthink the forecast is too low.\n  I hope over time that will be the case. I hope the economy strongly \nrecovers. I hope we have even more revenue. That would be terrific. But \nI don't think we can base Government policy on that. We certainly can't \nbet on every dime of the revenue that is in a 10-year forecast.\n  The reason it matters so much is because if we look ahead--these are \nthe years of surpluses we are in now--but, according to the Social \nSecurity, what happens, starting in the year 2016, we start to run into \ndeficits in both Medicare and Social Security. Medicare is the yellow \npart of the bars; Social Security is the red. These surpluses that we \nnow enjoy turn to massive deficits.\n  That is why some of us think we have to save the Social Security \ntrust fund for Social Security and the Medicare trust fund for \nMedicare, and that while that is necessary, it is not sufficient. We \nneed to do even more than that to prepare for what is to come because \nwe have a demographic tidal wave called the baby boom generation. They \nare going to turn these surpluses we have now into deficits. And if we \nstart, at a time of surpluses, by raiding the trust funds, this \nsituation becomes much worse, far more serious.\n  I don't think name calling is going to carry the question here. They \ncan accuse me of medieval economics or antique fiscal conservatism. I \ndon't think it is either one to say you ought to reserve the trust \nfunds of Medicare and Social Security for the purposes intended. You \nought not to use the money to finance the other functions of \nGovernment, however worthy the other functions are. I don't think we \nshould use the money at a time of economic growth, which is what the \nadministration is projecting for next year and beyond. Yet we see, \naccording to the most recent numbers, that we are already into the \ntrust funds. That is before a single appropriations bill has passed the \nSenate, before a single one has passed.\n  The question is, Are we going to dig the hole deeper? What are we \ngoing to do about the President's defense request? He wants $18 billion \nnext year. The effect over 10 years is in the range of $200 billion \nfrom a request like that. That is not in the budget. Since we are \nalready into the trust funds, it simply means that if we were to \napprove such a request, we would go deeper into the trust funds and \nMedicare and Social Security to defend or to finance that defense \nbuildup.\n  How are we going to pay for natural disasters? At a time of economic \ngrowth, should we be funding natural disasters out of the trust funds \nof Medicare and Social Security? I don't think so. Should we fund the \ntax extenders by taking the money out of the trust funds of Social \nSecurity and Medicare? I don't think so.\n  They may call that antique fiscal conservatism. I will wear that as a \nbadge of honor, that policy of protecting the trust funds of Medicare \nand Social Security. Call me any name you want. That is exactly the \nright thing to do. Certainly in a time of economic growth, you should \nnot be using trust fund money to fund the other needs of Government. \nThat is shortsighted. It is irresponsible. It is wrong. I am not going \nto support it.\n  I believe at the end of the day the American people will not support \nit because they have common sense. They know this doesn't add up. They \nknow if you have already got a problem, you don't dig the hole deeper \nbefore you start filling it in. That is just common sense.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska).

Mr. President, one of the primary reasons I wanted to \nserve as a Senator was to have an opportunity to bring fiscal \nresponsibility to our Nation and help reduce our national debt. As many \nof my colleagues know, for decades successive Congresses and Presidents \nspent money on items that, while important, they were unwilling to pay \nfor or, in the alternative, do without. In the process, Washington ran \nup a staggering debt and mortgaged our future. Today our national debt \nstands at about $5.7 trillion. That costs about $200 billion a year in \ninterest payments.\n  From the time I arrived in the Senate, I have worked to rein in \nspending and lower the national debt. Over the past 2\\1/2\\ years, I \nhave cosponsored and sponsored a number of amendments designed to bring \nfiscal discipline to the Federal Government. In March of 1999, I \noffered an amendment to use whatever on-budget surplus as calculated in \nthe fiscal year 2000 budget to pay down the debt. In March of 2000, I \nagain offered my amendment to use the on-budget surplus calculated for \nfiscal year 2001 for debt reduction. In an effort to bring spending \nunder control, Senator Allard and I offered an amendment in June of \n2000 to direct $12 billion of fiscal year 2000 on-budget surplus toward \ndebt reduction. The amendment passed by an overwhelming 95-3 and \ncommitted Congress to designate the on-budget surpluses to reduce the \nnational debt, keeping these funds from being used for additional \nGovernment spending. Our amendment provided the mechanism to assure \nthat Congress would begin the serious task of paying down the debt.\n  Further, this past April, Senator Feingold, Senator Gregg, and I \noffered an amendment to the fiscal year 2002 budget designed to tighten \nenforcement of existing spending controls. Our amendment created an \nexplicit point of order against directed scoring and abuses of \nemergency spending.\n  Even with all the amendments I proposed and cosponsored to bring \nFederal spending under control, I have never lost sight of the fact \nthat we need to enact a Social Security lockbox. Make no mistake, \nadopting a Social Security lockbox is not about Social Security \nbenefits. Social Security beneficiaries will not know the difference if \nwe pass or do not pass a Social Security lockbox. What we are doing \ntoday will not have an impact at all on the beneficiaries. The \namendment I am offering today will permanently lockbox the Social \nSecurity surplus and prevent it from being used for any other purpose.\n  For decades, the Social Security surplus was used by Congress after \nCongress and President after President to offset Federal spending. For \nmany of those years, Members of both the House and Senate worked to put \nthe Social Security surplus off limits from being used for such Federal \nspending. We talked a lot about it. In 1999, after years of wrangling, \nin a landmark budget agreement passed in 1995, the Federal Government \nfinally achieved a balanced budget. With this good news, it became \napparent that Congress and the President would not need to use the \nSocial Security surplus for spending. This was made possible by our \neconomic prosperity which guaranteed and generated a huge increase in \ntax revenues, which we know about, and in turn a massive on-budget \nsurplus. Because the United States was running in the black for the \nfirst time in recent memory, Social Security surpluses were used to pay \ndown the national debt instead of being used for spending. Indeed, \nsince 1999, there has been a political consensus not to return to \nspending that surplus.\n  However, the economic prosperity this Nation enjoyed as recently as \nmonths ago is fading, although I hope this is only a temporary \nsituation. Surplus projections are likely to be revised downward. Yet \nCongressional yearning for more spending has not abated.\n\n  For fiscal year 2001, Congress, with the encouragement of the Clinton \nadministration, increased nondefense discretionary spending 14.3 \npercent. That is something people have not taken into consideration. \nNondefense discretionary spending in the last budget was 14.3 percent \nabove the year before and increased overall spending by 8 percent, \nwhich was way above inflation. All of this was on top of large \nincreases in the previous years' budgets.\n  If we fund the education bill that the Senate recently passed, which \nincreases spending by 62 percent or $14 billion, and if we spend the \n$18.4 billion increase in defense spending that the administration is \ntalking about, we could end up spending a portion of the on-budget \nsurplus of fiscal year 2003 and beyond. Part of the reason for this is \nthe fact that the tax reduction was more front-end loaded than the \nPresident had originally planned.\n  Frankly, if the economy really falters, we could bump up against the \nSocial Security trust fund next year. Nearly everyone in this Chamber \nagrees we should not spend that surplus, and the public has grown to \nexpect that Congress won't return to spending it. This year's budget \nresolution was designed in part to avoid spending that surplus.\n  At the moment, we are de facto lockboxing Social Security. Therefore, \nit makes perfect sense to take the next step and lockbox these funds \npermanently. It is the best possible action we could take to bring \nfiscal discipline to the 107th Congress.\n  On the one hand, it guarantees we don't touch Social Security, and on \nthe other it ensures we will continue to pay down debt, which fulfills \nthe commitment we have all made and which will give us the interest \nsavings. It is a two-for: We won't spend it; second, it will allow us \nto continue to pay down the national debt substantially. That is part \nof what I refer to as the three-legged stool. That three-legged stool \nin terms of my support for the budget resolution was: Hold spending \ndown, reduce debt, and reduce taxes. But all three of them have to be \npresent. We have to preserve that one stool of reducing the national \ndebt.\n  If my colleagues think back to the 1980s, they will remember the \ndramatic increase in the national debt, primarily because of the use of \nthe Social Security surplus. I was here. I was president of the \nNational League of Cities. I came to this Congress before the Finance \nCommittee and supported the Republican proposal to limit spending in \n1985. What we saw happen during that period of time was that taxes were \nreduced and spending went up. Republicans wanted to spend on defense, \nthe Democrats wanted to spend on social programs, and the way they paid \nfor it was to use the Social Security surplus.\n  I don't want that to happen while I am a Member of the Senate. I \ndon't think any of my other colleagues want that to happen again.\n  The 1999 budget was the first time in over three decades that \nCongress did\n\n[[Page S7318]]\n\nnot use Social Security to pay for Federal spending. Again, in 2000, \nCongress did not use Social Security spending, although I must say it \nwas hand-to-hand combat to make sure it wasn't used. There was direct \nscoring, there was emergency spending, and all kinds of other gimmicks \nbecause CBO had said we were spending the Social Security surplus, and \nthe only thing that saved us was we got back here in January and CBO \ncame out with new projections and said the budget surplus was more than \nwhat we had originally anticipated it to be.\n  Although the economy is not as robust as it was a year ago, we must \nresist the temptation to fall off the wagon of fiscal responsibility \nand resist the urge to resume spending that Social Security trust fund. \nThe amendment we are offering guarantees we will not fall off the \nwagon. It contains two enforcement mechanisms: A supermajority point of \norder written in statute and automatic across-the-board spending cuts. \nOur amendment creates a statutory point of order against any bill, \namendment, or resolution that would spend the Social Security surplus \nany of the next 10 years. Waiving the point of order would require the \nvotes of 60 Senators. In addition, if the Social Security surplus were \nspent, the Office of Management and Budget would impose automatic \nacross-the-board cuts in discretionary and mandatory spending to reduce \nthe amount of the surplus that was spent.\n  We are talking about mandatory spending; we are talking about the \nfact that it will exempt Social Security and those things that are \ncontained in the Deficit Control Act of 1985. My understanding is that \nis about $33 billion that would be subject to sequester or reduction.\n  This amendment will only trigger the automatic reduction if spending \nof the surplus exceeds one-half of 1 percent of the total outlay \nexpenditure. In other words, it is not going to be one of those things \nthat will happen automatically. It has a provision that says, if it is \nshown you have spent over one-half of 1 percent of the Social Security \nsurplus, then the trigger will go into effect.\n  That is because we are talking about a $2 trillion budget and I think \nthere ought to be some kind of flexibility in the amendment. I think, \nfrankly, it is something that is intellectually honest to do. The only \nexceptions to the lockbox would be a state of war as declared by \nCongress or a recession defined as two successive quarters of negative \neconomic growth.\n  For the past 2\\1/2\\ years I have fought to make sure we in the Senate \nhold ourselves accountable for the spending decisions that we make. \nThus far, our spending choices, whether I have agreed with them or not, \nhave involved on-budget surplus dollars. But I believe we need to \nprepare to protect Social Security funds from being used for even more \nspending, should our budget surplus fade. That is what will happen. If \nwe keep this spending up, and then the surplus isn't there, there is \ngoing to be a great temptation for this body to invade the Social \nSecurity surplus.\n  Some of my colleagues in the Senate might argue we do not need a \nseparate law establishing a Social Security lockbox since it already \nexists in the budget. Some of my colleagues might also swear that we \nwould never return to the days when the Social Security trust fund was \nused as the Government's private piggy bank. Invariably we are told to \nhave faith that this institution called Congress will do the right \nthing when it comes to spending.\n  I am a firm believer in Ronald Reagan's philosophy: Trust but verify. \nIn my view, a permanent statutory Social Security lockbox is the best \nway to verify that the Social Security surplus remains untouched by \nthose who would spend it. It would also force Congress to fiscal \ndiscipline and to make the hard choices in prioritizing our spending \nwith the funds that we have today at our disposal.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The amendments are laid aside. The Senator \nfrom North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, very briefly, I thank Senator Byrd for \nintroducing my amendment in the second degree to the amendment of the \nSenator from Ohio, and indicate to my colleagues the nature of the \namendment. I think the Senator from Ohio is going in basically the \nright direction, but I do not think he is protecting both of the trust \nfunds. I have offered, in the second degree, my amendment that would \nprotect both the Social Security trust fund and the Medicare trust fund \nbecause I think both deserve protection. I think both are in danger.\n  Unfortunately, as I said several moments ago with respect to where we \nfind ourselves, after the budget resolution is passed, after the tax \ncut is passed, and with the anticipated reduction in the revenue \nforecast because of the slowdown in the economy, we see we are headed \nfor being into the Medicare trust fund this year, the Medicare and \nSocial Security trust fund next year and for all the years that follow. \nThat is before any appropriations have passed. That is before the \nPresident's major request for additional defense spending.\n  We are already in trouble. We are already headed for raiding the \ntrust funds of Medicare and Social Security. So I am glad the Senator \nfrom Ohio has sent up an amendment. I have provided an amendment in the \nsecond degree that I think is stronger and provides additional \nprotection and acknowledges that we have a responsibility not just to \nthe Social Security trust fund but to the Medicare trust fund as well.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 867\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. If I could at this moment, on a separate matter, I send \nan amendment to the desk to the underlying bill. This amendment is to \nprovide emergency funding for a situation we have just encountered on \none of the Indian reservations in my State, the Turtle Mountain Indian \nReservation. It is offset so it does not add to the overall cost of the \nsupplemental. But we have found a situation that is extraordinarily \nserious on the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation.\n  Very briefly, I will just describe that and then end so my colleague \nfrom Missouri, who is seeking recognition, can gain the floor.\n  Over 200 homes on the Turtle Mountain Reservation are infested with \nblack mold; 40 percent of them that have been tested have the worst \nkind of black mold. This is throughout the structures. It is in the \nbasements. It is running up the studs, in the ceilings, in the \ninsulation. People in these homes are sick. We have had two infants \ndie. People who are in the families and medical experts on the \nreservations believe their deaths are related to the conditions in \nthese homes.\n  It is because of extraordinarily wet conditions in that part of our \nState. We have had 7 years of wet conditions. It is as though these \nhouses are in a sponge and the sponge is full and the houses are \nwicking up the surface water. In fact, if you look in the crawl spaces \nof these homes, they are filled with water and that water has found its \nway up through the entire structure and has created the perfect \nenvironment for this black mold growth.\n  We have had the CDC there, the Corps of Engineers, and FEMA. It is a \ncrisis situation that requires emergency housing for some 200 families.\n  The tribal chairman told me he is about to move people into a school \ngymnasium because the conditions in these homes are so bad.\n\n  I went there personally over the break. I can testify it is the worst \nsituation I have seen, and I have dealt with black mold in our own home \nhere in Washington, DC, in just one small area, where seven times our \nhome flooded because the city sewer system could not handle torrential \ndownpours here. We are the low spot on the block. It cost me $4,000 and \nthree contractors to fix just a small part of one corner of our house.\n  These are houses that have it throughout. The basements are loaded \nwith black mold. It is in the studding. In fact you can see it in the \nbeams across the ceilings of these homes.\n  In every home we went into, people testified to the illnesses. In \nfact, the tribal chairman himself is ill from these circumstances.\n  This is an emergency situation that simply must be addressed. \nObviously, the committee could not have known about it because nobody \nknew about it. But I offer that amendment for that purpose, and I thank \nmy colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I thank my \ndistinguished colleague, the manager of the bill.\n  I have two matters which I wish to address today.\n  First, I say to my colleague from North Dakota that we are very \nconcerned about the situation he described. And, with the chairman of \nthe VA-HUD subcommittee, we will look into this serious problem he has \noutlined. We thank him and commend him for bringing it to the attention \nof this body.\n  I have two measures.\n  First, I don't believe there is a Member of this body who has \nwaterways in his or her State who doesn't understand the importance of \nthe work done by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Within the beltway, \nhowever, items such as flood control and river transportation are \nviewed as some sort of luxury we can do without. We can't do without \nthem. I have been there. I have seen the devastation and the \nheartbreak. I have seen the families in great crisis. I have seen the \nfarms and the homes and the communities destroyed. Unless you have been \nthere, you cannot really appreciate it.\n  Clearly, the view in some eastern editorial boardrooms is rather \nclouded, and elite drawing rooms can't see that there are people who \nlive and work along and depend upon the river. These are the people \nabout whom we should be concerned.\n  I invite those who can tell us how to manage the rivers to come out \nand take a look at our rivers sometime. They might be very surprised at \nwhat they find.\n  In the State of Missouri, we have nearly 1,000 miles of land \nbordering the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. Water transportation is \nlow cost, safe, fuel efficient, and provides an insurance policy \nagainst runaway shipping costs charged by railroads that otherwise \nwould face no competition. The environmental community assumes that \nmonopolists don't raise prices. They do. But on the environmental side, \nto put the benefits of water transportation in perspective, One medium-\nsized 15-barge tow carries the same amount of grain as 870 tractor \ntrailor trucks. Clearly, this comparison demonstrates the fuel \nefficiency and clean air benefits to the environment. It also reduces \ncongestion, reduces highway wear and tear, improves safety, and costs \nless.\n\n  In Missouri, one-third of our agricultural production comes from the \n100-year-flood plain. The Washington Post, that still believes food \ncomes from the grocery store and not the farm, believes that this land \nshould not be in production and flood protection should be a low \npriority.\n  Those who criticize the projects administered by the Corps typically \ndo it from a safe distance. One of the biggest critics of the Corps in \nthe Midwest sits safely behind a 500-year urban flood wall.\n  Policymakers in Washington stress exports and jobs but many fail to \nmake the connection between exports and the transportation necessary to \nexport. Unless we have purged the laws of physics and unless there are \nstrange new business practices which don't require buyers to take \ndelivery of sold goods, then transportation ultimately remains \nnecessary.\n  Policymakers in Washington stress the need for additional power \nproduction that is good for the environment but propose inadequate \nbudgets and policies for hydropower generation.\n  In the last Administration, policy and budgets to undermine the Corps \nwhere almost an annual event. Regrettably, the most recent budget \nproposed for fiscal year 2002 shows no recognition of how important the \nmission of the Corps is. I have a flood control project in Kansas City \nthat will protect industries employing 12,000 people. The budget \nrequest for 2002 asks for enough money to keep the contractors busy for \na fraction of the year. So not only is the project delayed, and not \nonly does delay subject the citizens to prolonged flood risk \nunnecessarily, but the delay increases the cost of the project which I \nwould expect the number-crunchers at OMB to find compelling if nothing \nelse gets their attention.\n  Regrettably, the supplemental request does not include one red cent \nfor operations and maintenance for the Corps of Engineers \nnotwithstanding flood control, navigation, hydropower generation and \nenvironmental needs resulting from Midwestern flooding on the upper \nMississippi, a Pacific earthquake which occurred in February, Tropical \nStorm Allison which occurred weeks ago as well as remaining problems \nassociated with Hurricane Floyd and ice storms in the South.\n  Specifically, there are needs estimated to be: $50 million in \nresponse to the Midwest flooding; $47 million in the Southwest impacted \nby ice storms; $37 million for the Atlantic Seaboard in response to \nHurricane Floyd and other weather events; $59 million for the Pacific \nNorthwest to repair earthquake damage, stabilize hydropower facilities \nand correct major environmental deficiencies; and $30 million in \nresponse to the tropical storm which occurred early this month that \naffected Galveston and the New Orleans District.\n  My office has made inquiries at several districts that serve Missouri \nand have learned that they expect to be out of O funds to dredge the \nMississippi River in a matter of weeks, which will risk the execution \nof water commerce on the nation's most important waterway.\n  When weather events occur, sediments build up, damage is done to \nlevees and engineering structures such as wing dikes making repairs \nnecessary and resources to dredge our ports and rivers necessary.\n  The House recognized this omission and included an additional $130 \nmillion for O for the Corps. Their markup occurred before there was \nany idea of what Allison had left behind.\n\n[[Page S7322]]\n\n  I do not want to have to wait for economic decline, either regional \nor national, to try to make the case that we cannot continue to take \nour factors of production for granted. The growing estrangement of some \ndecisionmakers and the media from the history and reality behind food, \nenergy, and natural resource production in this country must be \ncorrected. It will either be corrected ahead of a crisis or in response \nto a crisis. We have a strong economy for a reason and if we do not \ntake care of our infrastructure, we will go into economic decline for a \nreason.\n  While we are undermining our infrastructure, competing nations are \nupdating theirs. How many states have to have their lights turned out \nbefore we consider how are factories are powered, how our trucks are \nfueled and how our homes are heated? I regret that the need for \nefficient transportation, energy, and protection of people and property \nis a case that must be made but we can take action now for a fraction \nof what neglect, inaction and apathy will cost us later.\n  I know there is a bipartisan recognition that our water \ninfrastructure is growing old and not serving the American people \nadequately. While there has always been bipartisan support for the \nmission of the Corps, I fear that the budgets do not match the need.\n  Over the last two years Corps projects have experienced a series of \nweather-related events that have left much of our water resources \ninfrastructure in an alarming state of disrepair. In the most severe \ncases, temporary repairs were made to correct immediate hazards to \npublic health and safety, while other work still awaits adequate \nfunding. Harbor channels have lost sufficient depth and width for safe \nnavigation, rivers are choked with debris, embankments are dangerously \neroded, power outages are more frequent, and environmental preservation \nmeasures are short-changed. Unless the Corps receives supplemental \nfunding, many navigation channels will not be able to accommodate \nnormal commercial flow and flood control projects will be in serious \njeopardy of failure. Recent damages and deterioration of hydroelectric \nfacilities coupled with the national energy crisis have underscored the \nurgent need to undertake necessary repairs to hydropower projects in \nthe Pacific Northwest.\n  While I will withhold offering an amendment at this time, I will do \nwhat I can do in conference to urge conferees to accept the House \ncorrection of the omission.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, my second item deals with the defense \nbudget.\n  While the administration's request for a supplemental appropriations \nbill for the Department of Defense includes what the administration \nbelieves is the minimum needed to get by for the remainder of this \nfiscal year (01), I respectfully disagree with their definition of \n``minimum.''\n  Although we are hearing promises of an amended '02 budget with a huge \ndefense plus-up, it is clear that the Defense Department appropriations \nbill for 2002 may indeed be the last of the 13 appropriations bills we \nwill consider this year. That unfortunate timing may threaten the \navailability of all the extra funds many believe the Pentagon \ndesperately needs. Simply put, there is no guarantee that the money the \nPentagon needs will be there when the Senate takes up the amended \nDefense appropriation bill for 2002.\n  We must stop kicking the can down the road with promises to our \nforces--their need is urgent, they need help now. The problem will only \ncontinue to worsen, we need to act now.\n  Just last week, the Navy's top officer, Admiral Vern Clark, said he \nis trying to rid the United States Navy of the ``psychology of \ndeficiency''--the acceptance of sustained resource shortages as a \nnormal condition.\n  Sadly, Mr. President, this ``psychology of deficiency'' has not only \ninfected the culture of our Armed Forces, but I am afraid it has become \nthe culture.\n  The vast majority of the enlisted troops and officers on active duty \ntoday know only a culture of getting by on the minimum funding \npossible. They call it ``doing more with less,'' but the reality has \nbeen for almost a decade now, one of ``doing too much with too \nlittle.''\n  That is simply unacceptable. Every day, soldiers, sailors, airmen and \nmarines risk their very lives for the values that have made this \ncountry the more powerful beacon of freedom the world has every known.\n  And in exchange for their lives, what do we do? We give them barely \nenough money to accomplish their mission safely. The bare minimum and \nno more. That is how we repay our troops? No wonder our Armed Forces \nhave suffered from a persistent morale problem that has manifested \nitself in a chronic inability to hold onto large numbers of our most \ntalented troops.\n  The ``bare minimum'' of funding is no way for our society to uphold \nour end of the social contract with our troops. That is not how we keep \nfaith with those who defend our Nation's interests at their own \npersonal risk.\n  How badly have we fallen short on our end of the social contract?\n  At the current level of funding, it will take 160 years to replace \nthe Navy's shore infrastructure. The backlog of maintenance and repair \nexceeds $5.5 billion.\n  Recently the Marine Corps Commandant spoke about the terrible funding \nchoices we force him to make. In order to keep marines ready for combat \nin case war breaks out in the near-term, the Commandant has to steal \nmoney from accounts dedicated to modernizing the Marine Corps for \ntomorrow's wars. If this persists, the Marine Corps may find itself on \na battlefield in the future without the proper, modern equipment to \nhelp guarantee a quick victory with few U.S. casualties.\n  Even with the supplemental, the Army does not have the $145.1 million \nit needs to run its specialty training and schools. That means \nthousands of soldiers may not qualify in their combat specialties, \nwhich directly affects the combat readiness of Army units. When we tell \nour soldiers ``sorry, we don't have enough money to train you properly \nto do your job,'' what do you think the effect is on morale? The impact \nis devastating. That is what each of our services has had so much \ndifficulty holding onto: Retaining its most skilled workers.\n\n  Our U.S. Air Force is currently operating and maintaining the oldest \nfleet in our history. On average, our aircraft are about 22 years old \nand getting older. An aging fleet costs more, both in effort and \ndollars, to operate and maintain.\n  Last year, while we flew only 97 percent of our programmed flying \nhours, doing so cost us 103 percent of our budget. Over the past 5 \nyears, our costs per flying hour have risen almost 50 percent. That is \na terrible cycle: Older planes cost more to maintain, which robs money \nfrom accounts to buy new planes, and so on. It is a death spiral for \nour Air Force.\n  Time and again history has shown us the folly of funding our troops \nas if peace will persist forever, as if war will never come. I thought \nthis country learned that lesson in the opening days of the Korean war \nwhen Americans were caught unprepared, underequipped, and undertrained, \nand many paid with their lives.\n  I know the President of the United States knows this. I know \nSecretary of Defense Rumsfeld knows this. These are good men who know \nit is time to get the U.S. military on a more solid footing. I have \nworked closely with them in the past. I will continue to work with \nthem. They will find me to be their most loyal supporter in this \neffort. But we can no longer afford to wait. We must act now.\n  That is why I am rising today to offer an amendment to add $1.45 \nbillion to the fiscal year 2001 supplemental appropriations for the \nDefense Department. The amendment seeks to add the funds to the Defense \nDepartment that are needed, and can be spent, in what remains of the \nfourth quarter of the current fiscal year.\n  The amendment includes funds that will be directed exclusively to the \noperations and maintenance accounts of each of the four services. This \nis money the Pentagon needs right now to ensure that critical repairs \nand training are not delayed further.\n  There are emergency designations in this measure. All the money \nappropriated must be obligated by September 30 of this year. And the \nmoney shall be available only to the extent\n\n[[Page S7323]]\n\nthat an official budget request for that specific dollar amount \nincludes the designation of the entire amount of the request as an \nemergency requirement as defined in the Balanced Budget and Emergency \nDeficit Control Act of 1985, as amended, and is transmitted by the \nPresident to the Congress. We must begin to tell our troops that indeed \nhelp is on the way, that this is the time to send the help.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 872\n\n  Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk and ask unanimous \nconsent that it be included in the qualified list of amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the July edition of the American Legion \nmagazine features a remarkable statement of obvious truth by a much \nmaligned American who deserves far better than the petty sniping he \nendures at the hands of cunning politicians and the media, neither of \nwhom would acknowledge the truth if they fell over it in the middle of \nthe street.\n  U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas pulled no punches in this \narticle. His piece in the American Legion magazine was headed, \nappropriately, ``Courage v. Civility.'' Mr. Justice Thomas knows a good \nbit about both. He is, himself, a civil gentleman who possesses great \ncourage.\n  The subhead on his piece pinpoints a great deal about how a good many \nAmerican freedoms are being lost. One of the things he says is, those \nwho censor themselves put fear ahead of freedom. I will quote briefly \nfrom two or three statements made by the distinguished Justice of the \nSupreme Court.\n  He said:\n\n       I do not believe that one should fight over things that \n     don't really matter. But what about things that do matter? It \n     is not comforting to think that the natural tendency inside \n     us is to settle for the bottom, or even the middle of the \n     stream.\n       This tendency, in large part, results from an overemphasis \n     on civility. None of us should be uncivil in our manner as we \n     debate issues of consequence. No matter how difficult it is, \n     good manners should be routine. However, in the effort to be \n     civil in conduct, many who know better actually dilute firmly \n     held views to avoid appearing ``judgmental.'' They curb their \n     tongues not only in form but also in substance. The \n     insistence on civility in the form of our debates has the \n     perverse effect of cannibalizing our principles, the very \n     essence of a civil society. That is why civility cannot be \n     the governing principle of citizenship or leadership.\n       By yielding to a false form of civility, we sometimes allow \n     our critics to intimidate us. As I have said, active citizens \n     are often subjected to truly vile attacks; they are branded \n     as mean-spirited, racist, Uncle Tom, homophobic, sexist, etc. \n     To this we often respond (if not succumb), so as not to be \n     constantly fighting, by trying to be tolerant and \n     nonjudgmental--i.e., we censor ourselves. This is not \n     civility. It is cowardice, or well-intentioned self-deception \n     at best.\n\n  I shall not quote further from this super article written by Mr. \nJustice Clarence Thomas, but I do ask unanimous consent the article by \nhim be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the American Legion Magazine, July 2001]\n\n                          Courage v. Civility\n\n\n         those who censor themselves put fear ahead of freedom\n\n                          (By Clarence Thomas)\n\n       My beliefs about personal fortitude and the importance of \n     defending timeless principles of justice grew out of the \n     wonderful years I spent with my grandparents, the years I \n     have spent in Washington and my interest in world history--\n     especially the history of countries in which the rule of law \n     was surrendered to the rule of fear, such as during the rise \n     of Nazism in what was then one of the most educated and \n     cultured countries in Europe.\n       I have now been in Washington, D.C., for more than two \n     decades. When I first arrived here in 1979, I thought there \n     would be great debates about principles and policies in this \n     city.\n       I expected citizens to feel passionately about what was \n     happening in our country, to candidly and passionately debate \n     the policies that had been implemented and suggest new ones.\n       I was disabused of this heretical notion in December 1980, \n     when I was unwittingly candid with a young Washington Post \n     reporter. He fairly and thoroughly displayed my naive \n     openness in his op-ed about our discussion, in which I had \n     raised what I thought were legitimate objections to a number \n     of sacred policies, such as affirmative action, welfare, \n     school busing--policies I felt were not well serving their \n     intended beneficiaries. In my innocence, I was shocked at the \n     public reaction. I had never been called such names in my \n     entire life.\n       Why were these policies beyond question? What or who placed \n     them off limits? Would it not be useful for those who felt \n     strongly about these matters, and who wanted to solve the \n     same problems, to have a point of view and to be heard? \n     Sadly, in most forums of public dialogue in this country, the \n     answer is no.\n       It became clear in rather short order that on very \n     difficult issues, such as race, there was no real debate or \n     honest discussion. Those who raised questions that suggested \n     doubt about popular policies were subjected to intimidation. \n     Debate was not permitted. Orthodoxy was enforced.\n       Today, no one can honestly claim surprise at the venomous \n     attacks against those who take positions that are contrary to \n     the canon laid down by those who claim to shape opinions. \n     Such attacks have been standard fare for some time.\n       If you trim your sails, you appease those who lack the \n     honesty and decency to disagree on the merits but prefer to \n     engage in personal attacks. A good argument diluted to avoid \n     criticism is not nearly as good as the undiluted argument, \n     because we best arrive at truth through a process of honest \n     and vigorous debate. Arguments should not sneak around in \n     disguise, as if dissent were somehow sinister. One should not \n     be cowed by criticism.\n       In my humble opinion, those who come to engage in debates \n     of consequence, and who challenge accepted wisdom, should \n     expect to be treated badly. Nonetheless, they must stand \n     undaunted. That is required. And that should be expected, for \n     it is bravery that is required to secure freedom. * * * For \n     brutes, the most effective tactic is to intimidate an \n     opponent into the silence of self-censorship.\n       In September 1975, The Wall Street Journal published a book \n     review by Michael Novak of Thomas Sowell's book, ``Race and \n     Economics.'' The opening paragraph changed my life. It reads:\n       ``Honesty on questions of race is rare in the United \n     States. So many and unrecognized have been the injustices \n     committed against blacks that no one wishes to be unkind, or \n     subject himself to intimidating charges. Hence, even simple \n     truths are commonly evaded.''\n       This insight applies with equal force to very many \n     conversations of consequence today. Who wants to be denounced \n     as a heartless monster? On important matters, crucial \n     matters, silence is enforced.\n       Even if one has a valid position, and is intellectually \n     honest, he has to anticipate nasty responses aimed at the \n     messenger rather than the argument. The objective is to limit \n     the range of the debate, the number of messengers and the \n     size of the audience. The aim is to pressure dissenters to \n     sanitize their message, so as to avoid being subjected to \n     hurtful ad hominem criticism. Who wants to be caluminated? \n     It's not worth the trouble.\n       But is it worth it? Just what is worth it, and what is not? \n     If one wants to be popular, it is counterproductive to \n     disagree with the majority. If one just wants to tread water \n     until the next vacation, it isn't worth the agony. If one \n     just wants to muddle through, it is not worth it. In my \n     office, a little sign reads: ``To avoid criticism, say \n     nothing, do nothing, be nothing.''\n       None of us really believes that the things we fear \n     discussing honestly these days are really trivial--and the \n     reaction of our critics shows that we are right. If our \n     dissents are so trivial, why are their reactions so intense? \n     If our ideas are trivial, why the headhunting? Like you, I do \n     not want to waste my time on the trivial. I certainly have no \n     desire to be browbeaten and intimidated for the trivial.\n       What makes it all worthwhile? What makes it worthwhile is \n     something greater than all of us. There are those things that \n     at one time we all accepted as more important than our \n     comfort or discomfort--if not our very lives: Duty, honor, \n     country! There was a time when all was to be set aside for \n     these. The plow was left idle, the hearth without fire, the \n     homestead abandoned.\n       To enter public life is to step outside our more confined, \n     comfortable sphere, and to face the broader, national sphere \n     of citizenship. What makes it all worthwhile is to devote \n     ourselves to the common good.\n       It goes without saying that we must participate in the \n     affairs of our country if we think they are important and \n     have an impact on our lives. But how are we to do that? In \n     what manner should we participate?\n       I do not believe that one should fight over things that \n     don't really matter. But what about things that do matter? It \n     is not comforting to think that the natural tendency inside \n     us is to settle for the bottom, or even the middle of the \n     stream.\n       This tendency, in large part, results from an overemphasis \n     on civility. None of us should be uncivil in our manner as we \n     debate issues of consequence. No matter how difficult it is, \n     good manners should be routine. However, in the effort to be \n     civil in conduct, many who know better actually dilute firmly \n     held views to avoid appearing ``judgmental.'' They curb their \n     tongues not only in form but also in substance. The \n     insistence on civility in the form of our debates has the \n     perverse effect of cannibalizing our principles, the very \n     essence of a civil society. That is why civility cannot be \n     the governing principle of citizenship or leadership.\n       By yielding to a false form of civility, we sometimes allow \n     our critics to intimidate us. As I have said, active citizens \n     are often subjected to truly vile attacks; they are branded \n     as mean-spirited, racist, Uncle Tom, homophobic, sexist, etc. \n     To this we often respond (if not succumb), so as not to be \n     constantly fighting, by trying to be tolerant and\n\n[[Page S7326]]\n\n     nonjudgmental--i.e., we censor ourselves. This is not \n     civility. It is cowardice, or well-intentioned self-deception \n     at best.\n       The little-known story of Dimitar Peshev shows both the \n     power of self-deception and the explosive effect of telling \n     the truth and the dangers inherent in allowing the rule of \n     law and the truth to succumb to political movements of the \n     moment.\n       Peshev was the vice president of the Bulgarian Parliament \n     during World War II. He was a man like many--simple and \n     straightforward, not a great intellectual, not a military \n     hero--just a civil servant doing his job as best he could, \n     raising his family, struggling through a terrible moment in \n     European history.\n       Bulgaria was pretty lucky because it managed to stay out of \n     the fighting, even though the Nazis had placed the Bulgarian \n     government--and the king--under enormous pressure to enter \n     the war on the side of the Axis, or at a minimum to permit \n     the destruction of the Bulgarian Jews. Bulgaria had no \n     tradition of widespread anti-semitism, and the leaders of the \n     country were generally unwilling to turn over their own \n     citizens to certain death. But like all the other European \n     countries, Bulgaria moved toward the Holocaust in small \n     steps.\n       Peshev was one of many Bulgarian officials who heard rumors \n     of the new policy and constantly queried his ministers. They \n     lied to him, and for a time he believed their lies. Perhaps \n     the ministers somehow believed the lies themselves. But in \n     the final hours, a handful of citizens from Peshev's hometown \n     raced to Sofia to tell him the truth: that Jews were being \n     rounded up, that the rains were waiting.\n       According to the law, such actions were illegal. So Peshev \n     forced his way into the office of the interior minister, \n     demanding to know the truth. The minister repeated the \n     official line, but Peshev didn't believe him. He demanded \n     that the minister place a telephone call to the local \n     authorities and remind them of their legal obligations. This \n     brave act saved the lives of the Bulgarian Jews. Peshev then \n     circulated a letter to members of Parliament, condemning the \n     violation of the law and demanding that the government ensure \n     that no such thing take place.\n       According to his biographer, Peshev's words moved all those \n     ``who until that moment had not imagined what could happen \n     but who now could not accept what they had discovered.'' He \n     had broken through the wall of self-deception and forced his \n     colleagues to face the truth.\n       There is no monument to this brave man. Quite the contrary, \n     the ministers were embarrassed and made him pay the price of \n     their wickedness. He was removed from the position of vice \n     president, publicly chastised for breaking ranks and \n     politically isolated.\n       But he had won nonetheless: The king henceforth found ways \n     to stall the Nazis; the leader of the Bulgarian Orthodox \n     Church publicly defended the country's Jews; and even the \n     most convinced anti-Semites in the Bulgarian government dared \n     not advocate active cooperation with the Third Reich.\n       After the war, when the communists took over Bulgaria, they \n     rewrote the wartime history to give the Communist Party \n     credit for saving the Jews. Peshev was sent to the Gulag, and \n     his story was only rediscovered after the collapse of the \n     Soviet Union.\n       Pope John Paul II has traveled the entire world challenging \n     tyrants and murderers of all sorts, speaking to millions of \n     people, bringing them a single, simple message: ``Be not \n     afraid.''\n       He preached this message to people living under communist \n     tyranny in Poland, in Czechoslovakia, in Nicaragua and in \n     China: ``Be not afraid.'' He preached it to Africans facing \n     death from marauding tribes and murderous disease: ``Be not \n     afraid.'' And he preached it to us, warning us how easy it is \n     to be trapped in a ``culture of death'' even in our \n     comfortable and luxurious country: ``Be not afraid.''\n       Those three little words hold the power to transform \n     individuals and change the world. They can supply the quiet \n     resolve and unvoiced courage necessary to endure the \n     inevitable intimidation.\n       Today we are not called upon to risk our lives against some \n     monstrous tyranny. America is not a barbarous country. Our \n     people are not oppressed, and we face no pressing \n     international threat to our way of life, such as the Soviet \n     Union once posed.\n       Though the war in which we are engaged is cultural, not \n     civil, it tests whether this ``nation: conceived in liberty . \n     . . can long endure.'' President Lincoln's words do endure: \n     ``It is . . . for us [the living] to be here dedicated to the \n     great task remaining before us . . . that from these honored \n     dead we take increased devotion to the cause for which they \n     gave the last full measure of devotion . . . that we here \n     highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain . \n     . . that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of \n     freedom . . . and that government of the people . . . by the \n     people . . . for the people . . . shall not perish from the \n     earth.\n       The founders warned us that freedom requires constant \n     vigilance and repeated action. It is said that, when asked \n     what sort of government the founders had created. Benjamin \n     Franklin replied that they had given us ``a republic, if you \n     can keep it.'' Today, as in the past, we need a brave civic \n     virtue, not a timid civility, to keep our republic. Be not \n     afraid.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/09/senate-section/article/S7326-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE CORPORATION FOR NATIONAL SERVICE\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, on July 18 here in Washington, the American \nCollege of Neuropsychopharmacology will be honoring its members who \nhave won the Nobel Prize for Medicine or Physiology. The honorees \ninclude the three Nobel Prize winners from the year 2000: Dr. Arvid \nCarlsson from Goteborg University in Sweden, Dr. Paul Greengard from \nRockefeller University in New York City, and Dr. Eric Kandel from \nColumbia University in New York City. Also being honored is the 1970 \nNobel Prize winner, Dr. Julius Axelrod from the National Institutes of \nHealth in Maryland. Together, these Nobel Prize winners have helped us \nbegin to understand how that most mysterious and important human organ, \nthe brain, actually works.\n  The brain is a huge collection of nerve cells, connected to each \nother in complicated networks. Nerve impulses, which are the means of \ncommunicating information from the brain to the various parts of the \nbody, are conducted from one end of a nerve cell to another by a form \nof electrical action. Dr. Axelrod's work set the stage for our modern \nknowledge of brain neurochemistry by establishing the important role of \nneurotransmitters, which are chemicals that serve to transmit these \nnerve impulses from one nerve cell to another through a connecting \nregion called the synapse. A key first step in understanding the brain \nwas this discovery that, as nerve impulses move from nerve cell to \nnerve cell, they switch from an electrical conduction to a chemical \nconduction and then back again to an electrical conduction.\n  Dr. Carlsson started to fill in this general outline by discovering \nthat the chemical dopamine was one of these important chemicals that \ntransmits nerve signals from one nerve cell to another. Moreover, \ndopamine seemed to be very important in controlling body motions. Dr. \nCarlsson's work with experimental animals who were deficient in \ndopamine led to the seminal discovery that Parkinson's disease in \nhumans, a disabling and progressive disease associated with tremors and \nimpaired mobility, was directly related to a deficiency of dopamine in \ncertain parts of the brain. This landmark finding led directly to the \ntreatment of Parkinson's disease with L-dopa, a drug that is converted \nto dopamine in the body. To this very day, the foundation for treatment \nof this illness is the use of medications that increase dopamine in the \nbrain or mimic its action there.\n  Dr. Carlsson also discovered that the drugs used to treat \nschizophrenia, a severe mental illness affecting thought processes, \nalso seemed to work by affecting the action of dopamine in the\n\n[[Page S7327]]\n\nbrain. In contrast to the situation with Parkinson's disease, in which \nadministration of L-dopa seemed to work by increasing dopamine in the \nbrain, the antipsychotic drugs such as thorazine, which are used to \ntreat schizophrenia, seemed to work by blocking the action of dopamine \nin the brain. To this very day, medications that block the effects of \ndopamine remain the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia. Dr. \nCarlsson's work was instrumental in establishing the biological \nfoundation of mental illness, which has led to our ability to target \ntreatment of such disorders with medications based on their specific \nbiochemical cause.\n  Dr. Greengard carried this line of work one step further, examining \nexactly how such neurotransmitters work as they transfer nerve impulses \nfrom one nerve cell to another through the connecting region called the \nsynapse. He described in detail the cascade of chemical reactions that \noccurs as the neurotransmitter chemicals stimulate the next nerve cell \nin the nerve pathway, which results in conversion of the nerve impulse \nback into an electrical signal. Particularly important was the \ndiscovery of the different speeds at which these nerve signals are \ntransmitted across the synapse. This framework enabled him to \nestablish, on a molecular and biochemical level, the mechanism of \naction of various drugs that act on the central nervous system.\n  Finally, Dr. Kandel expanded the context of this research area by \nshowing how such complex processes as memory and learning are directly \nrelated to the basic biochemical foundations outlined by Drs. \nGreengard, Carlsson, and Axelrod. In detailed studies in animals, Dr. \nKandel showed that the process of memory was associated with specific \nchanges in the shape and functioning of the synapse region that \nconnects pairs of nerve cells. This research revealed that these \nconnections between nerve cells, rather than being just passive \njunctions, are actually vitally important in the complicated processes \nof the nervous system.\n  The brain could be said to be the ultimate human frontier. As \nscientists pieced together the function of all the other organs in the \nbody over the last few centuries, the brain remained an enigma. The \nwork of Drs. Axelrod, Carlsson, Greengard, and Kandel starts to clear \naway some of the mystery that surrounds the brain, and this research \nhas already led to practical, clinical advances to help millions of \npeople with neurological and mental disorders such as Parkinson's \ndisease and schizophrenia. This basic understanding of how the brain \nworks is clearly necessary for understanding of the numerous brain \ndisorders that affect many more millions of people worldwide, some of \nwhich are just starting to be elucidated. Moreover, these pioneering \nstudies have opened the door to the development of targeted medications \nto treat such illnesses. I am particularly excited about the \npossibility that this research will unlock the key to the medical \ntreatment of substance abuse disorders, whose social impact in our \ncountry is enormous. On behalf of the many people who stand to live \nlonger and more fulfilling lives as a result of their discoveries, I \nextend my deepest congratulations to these esteemed Nobel laureates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/09/senate-section/article/S7327-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, today in New York the United Nations \nconvened the conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light \nWeapons in All its Aspects, the first effort by the U.N. to address the \npressing issue of small arms trafficking.\n  The mass proliferation of small arms--shoulder-mounted missiles, \nassault weapons, grenade launchers, high-powered sniper rifles and \nother tools of death--is fueling civil wars, terrorism and the \ninternational drug trade throughout the world.\n  The grimmest figures come from developing countries where light, \ncheap and easy to use small arms and light weapons, such as AK-47s and \nsimilar military assault rifles, have become the weapons of choice of \nnarco-traffickers, terrorists and insurgents.\n  The problem is staggering: An estimated 500 million illicit small \narms and light weapons are in circulation around the globe, and in the \npast decade four million people have been killed by them in civil war \nand bloody fighting.\n  Nine out of 10 of these deaths are attributed to small arms and light \nweapons. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross, \nmore than 50 percent of those killed are believed to be civilians.\n  Starting today, the United Nations will host a conference on the \nIllicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All its Aspects. At \nthis conference, the U.N., for the first time, will seek to devise \ninternational standards and procedures for curtailing small arms \ntrafficking. It is an issue of extreme importance to the United States. \nNot only because of the violence and devastation itself, but because of \nthe threat these weapons pose to our political, economic and security \ninterests.\n  The volume of weaponry has fueled cycles of violence and been a major \nfactor in the devastation witnessed in recent conflicts in Africa, the \nBalkans, and South Asia, among other places. These conflicts undermine \nregional stability and endanger the spread of democracy and free-\nmarkets around the world. Here are a few examples.\n  In Mexico a lethal flow of guns south from the United States has fed \nthat nation's drug war. Hundreds of thousands of weapons over the last \ndecade have flooded into Mexico from the United States. Authorities \nrecently traced a sale of 80 Chinese assault weapons from a San Diego \ngunshop to a Tijuana weapons dealer for $27,000. Many of these ended up \nin the hands of the Arellano Felix drug cartel and are believed \nresponsible for at least 21 deaths, including two infants, six children \nand a pregnant 17- year-old girl shot and killed during a mass murder \nat Rancho el Rodeo in September 1998.\n  In Albania more than 650,000 weapons and 20,000 tons of explosives \ndisappeared from government depots in the three years leading up to the \noutbreak of violence in the Balkans, according to the U.N. The \ncontinued presence of the weapons poses a very real threat to NATO and \nU.S. peacekeepers in the region.\n  And in Colombia, the continued instability is in part due to the \ntorrential flow of rifles and pistols to rebel groups and drug gangs \nwho have used the imported weapons to murder judges, journalists, \npolice officers, as well as innocent passers-by.\n  The increased access by terrorists, guerrilla groups, criminals, and \nothers to small arms and light weapons puts in jeopardy U.S. law \nenforcement efforts, business people based or traveling overseas, and \neven U.S. tourists.\n  In approaching the United Nations Conference, it is critical that the \nU.S. government negotiate and support making the trafficking of small \narms traceable and eliminate the secrecy that permits thousands of \nweapons to fuel crime and war without anyone's knowledge of their \nsource.\n  It is my hope the United Nations will move to create international \nprocedures to control the proliferation of small arms and light \nweapons. The United States has some of the strongest arms export \ncontrols in the world, and it is in the U.S. interest to see that those \nstandards are equaled by the world community.\n\n[[Page S7328]]\n\n  In addition, the United States has a moral responsibility to push for \nthe development of measures that stop weapons from winding up in the \nhands of abusive government forces, terrorists and drug-traffickers.\n  Specifically, the U.S. Government should champion a conference \nprogram of action that mandates countries' early negotiations on \nlegally binding procedures: a Framework Convention on International \nArms Transfers that sets out export criteria based on countries' \ncurrent obligations under international law; and an International \nAgreement on Marking and Tracing that develops systems for adequate and \nreliable marking of arms at manufacture and import and record-keeping \non arms production, possession and transfer.\n  The Program of Action must also include the establishment of regional \nand international transparency mechanisms and concrete steps to achieve \nimproved implementation and enforcement of arms embargoes.\n  United States leadership should ensure that the conference is the \nfirst step, not the last, in the international community's efforts to \ncontrol the spread of small arms and light weapons.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, several people who opposed the \nnomination of Theodore B. Olson to be Solicitor General made charges \nthat contained serious factual errors. These are not, I believe, \ndebatable questions of interpretation when the facts are carefully \nexamined. We have had our bipartisan investigation and hearing, and we \nhave confirmed Mr. Olson, and we should move on; but we owe it to Mr. \nOlson, to future nominees, and to the Senate as an institution to make \nsure that the record is correct.\n  Before turning to some specific errors, I want to emphasize that Mr. \nOlson responded to all of the committee's questions. Mr. Olson is one \nof the Nation's most talented lawyers and most dedicated public \nservants. He completed our questionnaire; he answered the questions \nasked at the hearing; he responded to more than one hundred written \nfollow-up questions; and he repeatedly offered to meet with any Senator \nwho had any further questions. He was clear, he was candid, he was \nresponsive. Indeed, every thing that critics suggest Mr. Olson tried to \nhide, Mr. Olson in fact volunteered to the Committee, either in his \nresponse to the committee's questionnaire or in his responses to our \nquestions.\n  One inaccurate claim was that Mr. Olson engaged in word games in his \nanswers about the American Spectator's ``Arkansas Project.'' In fact, \nat the committee hearing, it was clear that the committee and Mr. Olson \nhad a shared understanding of that phrase, and Mr. Olson's answers \nexpressly responded within that framework. The questions specifically \ncharacterized the ``Arkansas Project'' as involving only the project \npursuant to which ``Richard Mellon Scaife funneled money through the \nAmerican Spectator'' to investigate the Clintons. Those were the words \nused in the question, and Mr. Olson adopted those words in his answers. \nThere is no indication that any Senator, or Mr. Olson, intended the \nterm ``Arkansas Project'' to refer to anything other than the Scaife-\nfunded journalistic efforts to investigate the Clintons' history in \nArkansas.\n  Thus, there were no word games by Mr. Olson. It is Mr. Olson's \ncritics who played word games, by retroactively changing the meaning of \nthe ``Arkansas Project'' to embrace essentially every Clinton-related \narticle published or even considered by the American Spectator magazine \nin the 1990s. That was not the way the committee or Mr. Olson used that \nterm at the hearing, and it is wrong and unfair to suggest otherwise.\n  At the very least, if any Senator was somehow personally uncertain \nwhat Mr. Olson intended when he was answering questions concerning the \n``Arkansas Project,'' that Senator could have followed up at the \nhearing. No Senator did.\n  Second, some have argued that Mr. Olson improperly attempted to \nminimize his role in the so-called ``Arkansas Project'' during his \nconfirmation hearing. The charges include allegations that only \nbelatedly did Mr. Olson ``admit'' that he and his firm provided legal \nservices to the American Spectator, that he had discussions in social \nsettings with those working on Arkansas Project matters, and that he \nhimself authored articles for the magazine paid for out of the special \nRichard Mellon Scaife fund.\n  Each of these allegations, however, is contradicted by the factual \nrecord. Mr. Olson consistently stated that he and others at his law \nfirm performed legal services for the American Spectator beginning in \n1994, that they billed the magazine for those services at their normal \nmarket rates, and that the magazine paid them only for the legal \nservices actually performed. Indeed, that Mr. Olson's firm provided \nlegal services to the American Spectator has been widely known and a \nmatter of public record for several years. It is not something that he \n``admitted'' under close questioning. Those legal services--involving \nsuch things as book contracts and employee disputes--were not ``in \nconnection with'' the ``Arkansas Project,'' and any suggestion to the \ncontrary, based on the record as I know it, is wrong as a matter of \nfact.\n\n  As for Mr. Olson's presence in social settings with individuals \nassociated with the ``Arkansas Project,'' the questions were asked and \nMr. Olson never made any attempt to conceal or minimize his attendance \nat those social events. He stated that he was unaware of any \ndiscussions at those events concerning the Scaife-funded efforts to \ninvestigate Clinton scandals, and no one has contradicted that \ntestimony. Indeed, every knowledgeable individual--including one of Mr. \nOlson's chief critics--has confirmed that testimony. I also understand \nthat journalists employed by other magazines and newspapers--\ncompetitors of the American Spectator--and a wide range of other \npersons also attended those social events. Thus, they also had \ndiscussions ``in social settings'' with those working on Arkansas \nProject matters, but no responsible person would assert that their \nattendance at those events made them participants in the American \nSpectator's ``Arkansas Project.''\n  Mr. Olson also testified during his hearing about his authorship and \nco-authorship of several articles critical of the Clintons and other \npublic officials. Indeed, he voluntarily provided copies of those \nAmerican Spectator articles to the Judiciary Committee in his response \nto the committee's standard questionnaire, well in advance of his \nconfirmation hearing. It is simply not correct, as a matter of fact, to \nsuggest that he only ``admitted'' his authorship of the articles after \nthe committee hearing.\n  As to the American Spectator's internal bookkeeping for its payments \nto Mr. Olson or his law firm, it seems plain that Mr. Olson had no way \nof knowing how the Spectator categorized those payments for its own \npurposes, any more than taxpayers will know from the face of the check \nto what internal account the Government will charge the rebate checks \nflowing from President Bush's tax cut. Mr. Olson said that he never \neven saw the checks which were sent to his law firm's headquarters in \nLos Angeles in payment of routine client billings. All of this is in \nthe record.\n  There was no ``expansion'' or change in Mr. Olson's testimony on the \nforegoing points over the last several weeks. It is similarly \ninaccurate to say, as some critics do, that Mr. Olson ``modified'' his \nanswers, ``changed'' his recollections, or ``conceded'' additional \nknowledge. To a remarkable degree, Mr. Olson has clearly and \nconsistently answered the questions we asked him. His testimony, \nmoreover, has been fully confirmed by the individuals most closely \nassociated with the ``Arkansas Project,'' including the editor-in-\nchief, editor, and publisher of the American Spectator magazine during \nthe relevant time period, as well as the three individuals who \nprimarily performed the investigative journalism funded by the \n``Arkansas Project.'' Each of these individuals stepped forward \nvoluntarily to confirm the accuracy of Mr. Olson's testimony. Indeed, \nthere is no one with percipient knowledge of these events who has \ncontradicted Mr. Olson.\n  Third, some mistakenly attempt to create a conflict in Mr. Olson's \ntestimony by confusing the amounts he was paid for writing articles for \nthe American Spectator with the very different amounts that Mr. Olson's \nlaw firm received for providing legal services to the American \nSpectator over a span of\n\n[[Page S7329]]\n\nmany years. Mr. Olson told the Senate that he was paid from $500 to \n$1,000 for his articles that appeared in the American Spectator \nmagazine, whereas his firm received $94,405 for legal services.\n  The attempt to create a conflict on this issue requires mixing apples \nwith oranges. There were two different types of payments, for different \ntypes of services. In his April 19 answers, Mr. Olson explained that in \naddition to the $500 to $1,000 fees he received for the articles, his \nlaw firm ``has received payments for legal services rendered to the \n[American Spectator] Foundation from time to time, by me and by others \nat the firm, at our normal market rates.'' Given that those legal fees \nwere for legal services provided to the magazine over a period of more \nthan 5 years, involving the work of several attorneys, the $94,405 \nfigure is in no way surprising. More significantly, Mr. Olson at all \ntimes distinguished between the firm's legal fees, and the separate, \ncomparatively modest amounts he received personally for writing \narticles for the magazine. It is, again, a factual mistake to suggest \nthat he ever sought to confuse those two amounts.\n  Fourth, some have criticized Mr. Olson for allegedly refusing to \nrespond to an allegation about American Spectator dinner parties. I \nquestion whether the Senate should even get into this issue of who \nattended what dinner parties, given the absence of any serious issue \nhere, and the freedom of speech and press values inherent in a \nmagazine's activities. But this particular allegation was dubious and \nmade by a source who publicly contradicted himself on this very \nallegation. The allegation appeared only in the pages of the Washington \nPost. No Senator asked Mr. Olson about that particular allegation, and \nwe have never imposed on nominees of either party an obligation to \ntrack down and respond to every far-fetched or baseless charge that \nmight find its way into print. Moreover, one member of the committee \ndid make an inquiry about Mr. Olson's social contacts with employees of \nthe American Spectator and Mr. Olson fully answered that question in \nwriting. So it is factually incorrect to state that he refused to \nrespond to that question.\n  Fifth, Mr. Olson's statement that his legal services for the American \nSpectator magazine were not for the purpose of conducting \ninvestigations of the Clintons is allegedly contradicted by the fact \nthat Mr. Olson's firm was compensated for legal research to prepare a \nchart outlining the Clintons' criminal exposure, as research for a \nFebruary 1994 article Mr. Olson co-authored entitled, `Criminal Laws \nImplicated by the Clinton Scandals: A Partial List.' This charge again \nis contradicted by record facts. The 1994 engagement letter for Mr. \nOlson's professional services expressly provided that Mr. Olson and his \nfirm were not engaged ``to do any independent factual research.'' In \nfact, there is nothing in the public record to suggest that Mr. Olson's \nwork in connection with that article, or for the magazine at any time, \ninvolved factual investigation of the Clintons. Comparing the publicly-\navailable applicable Federal criminal code provisions, to publicly-\navailable newspaper stories concerning allegations regarding the \nClintons, cannot be described as an ``investigation'' of the Clintons.\n  While there were other factual inaccuracies in the attacks on Mr. \nOlson, this list demonstrates that the concerns raised regarding Mr. \nOlson's candor before the Judiciary Committee were unjustified.\n  It is particularly noteworthy that Robert Bennett, one of the most \nnotable lawyers in this country and counsel to then-President Clinton, \nrejected the claim that Mr. Olson was less than candid in his responses \nto the Senate Judiciary Committee. More than almost any other person, \nhe knows that facts of the Clinton matters. During an interview with \nWolf Blitzer on CNN on May 22, Mr. Bennett stated: ``I have recently \nread [Mr. Olson's] responses to the Senate, and I have looked at a lot \nof the material, and if I were voting, I would say that Ted Olson was \nmore than candid with the Senate.'' Mr. Bennett is independent; he had \nno partisan axe to grind in favor of Mr. Olson in connection with this \nnomination; he, in fact, was a lead counsel for President Clinton for \nseveral years; he was not maneuvering for advantage in future \nnomination battles; he is a lawyer experienced in weighing evidence and \ncross-examining witnesses; he looked at the evidence; and his \nconclusion that these allegations are ill-founded is worthy of our \nrespect.\n  I agree wholeheartedly with Mr. Bennett. I too have reviewed Mr. \nOlson's statements before the committee regarding his role in the \n``Arkansas Project,'' and I find Mr. Olson's statements to be clear and \naccurate.\n  The Washington Post editorial board also shares this view. On May 18, \nafter all of the questions regarding the ``Arkansas Project'' had been \nraised, the Washington Post endorsed Mr. Olson's nomination to be \nSolicitor General, noting ``Mr. Olson is one of Washington's most \ntalented and successful appellate lawyers, a man who served with \ndistinction in the Justice Department during the 1980s and whose work \nis widely admired across party lines.'' According to the Washington \nPost, ``Mr. Olson's prior service at the Justice Department indicates \nthat he understands the difference between the roles of private citizen \nand public servant.'' As for Mr. Olson's testimony regarding his role \nin the ``Arkansas Project,'' the Washington Post concluded that \n``there's no evidence that his testimony was inaccurate in any \nsignificant way,'' and that ``the Democrats would be wrong to block Mr. \nOlson.'' [Emphasis added.]\n  The Senate thus far has not done a good job of reviewing President \nBush's nominees, and in many cases has made upstanding individuals the \nvictims of partisan attacks. The deeply partisan vote over the \nSolicitor Generalship was a low point. I strongly believe that every \nnominee deserves fairness in this process and a full chance to get his \nor her position into the record and considered. It is not right to \nleave the record incomplete. I hope that, by setting the record \nstraight, the Senate can move on and treat future nominees more fairly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/09/senate-section/article/S7329-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

COLEMAN SR.\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I acknowledge the life and \naccomplishments of a distinguished and principled public servant who \nserved as a minister in my home State of Michigan, Reverend Hurley J. \nColeman Sr. Today, people will be gathering in Saginaw, MI, to pay \ntribute to and celebrate the life of a man who for nearly five decades, \nserved as a leader, spiritual mentor and role model in his community.\n  Throughout his life, Reverend Coleman dedicated himself to serving \nhis family, his church and his God. The esteem in which he was held by \nall who knew him is due to the fact that Pastor Coleman's life was a \npowerful testimony to the message he preached weekly at Coleman Temple \nChurch of God in Christ.\n  Considered one of the deans of the Saginaw clergy, Pastor Coleman's \ncareer had a humble beginning. Licensed as a minister in the Church of \nGod in Christ in 1953, Pastor Coleman's first congregation gathered for \nworship in his home. A short four years after the inception of this \ncongregation, they broke ground for a new church. This facility now \nserves over 300 members--an amazing number considering that the \nPastor's first congregation included only six members.\n\n[[Page S7330]]\n\n  During his tenure as pastor, Hurley Coleman played a pivotal role in \nthe struggle for racial equality and other civil rights causes. In \nthese efforts, he has been able to unite people of different races and \ndenominations around the common goal of improving life for all people.\n  I believe that nothing bears witness to the depth and integrity of \nPastor Coleman's ministry and life more than his family. Pastor Coleman \nand his wife Martha were married for 51 years. During this time they \nserved the community and were able to raise 10 children. These \nchildren: Hurlette Dickens, Hurley Jr., Charles, Ritchie, Ronnie, E. \nYvonne Lewis, Myra Williams, Elaine Bonner, Evelyn Yeager and Edna \nColeman, are pillars in their community who have followed their \nparent's example of service to others.\n  The vitality and strength of our Nation is due, in a large part, to \nthe dedication and efforts of individuals like the Reverend Hurley J. \nColeman Sr. Reverend Coleman and his wife were a dedicated couple whose \nlove for one another and their family touched the entire community that \nthey tirelessly sought to serve. I am sure that my Senate colleagues \nwill join me in honoring the memory of the Reverend Hurley J. Coleman \nSr., and in wishing his family well in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/09/senate-section/article/S7330-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO ANGELA PEREZ BARAQUIO\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Angela Perez Baraquio of Honolulu, HI, on being named as \nMiss America 2001.\n  Angela received a BA in education from the University of Hawaii, \nManoa, and earned academic awards in college including: University \nDean's List, Golden Key National Honor Society Member, 1998-1999, Donna \nMercado Kim Academic Scholarship, Sibyl Nyborg Haide Student Teaching \nGrant and Evelyn Siu Foo Scholarship in Elementary Education.\n  Angela is a K-3rd grade physical education teacher and 5th-8th grade \ncoach and athletic director at Holy Family Catholic Academy. She is \nactive in her local community as Choir Director at St. Augustine by the \nSea Catholic Church in Waikiki.\n  Her platform, Character in the Classroom: Teaching Values, Valuing \nTeachers, recognizes the important contributions that teachers make in \nour country and encourages the adoption of character development \nprograms in schools throughout the United States. Angela aspires to \ncomplete a Master's degree in Education to accomplish her platform \ngoals.\n  Angela is visiting New Hampshire for the first time on July 11, 2001. \nShe has been invited by the University of New Hampshire to be a keynote \nspeaker at ``New Hampshire Celebrates Team Nutrition Day.'' The special \nevent held during the University of New Hampshire's 2-week institute \nfor school professionals recognizes the efforts of administrators and \nteachers who develop programs that provide nutritional and fitness \ninstruction for the youth of the state. Now in its fifth year, the \ninstitute is the only one of its kind in the United States.\n  The Miss America Organization is one of the Nation's leading \nachievement programs and the world's largest provider of scholarships \nfor young women. The Miss American Organization provides young women \nwith the opportunity to grow personally and professionally while \ninstilling a spirit of community service through a variety of \ncommunity-based programs.\n  As a former schoolteacher, I commend Angela for her selfless \ndedication to the education of the young people of Hawaii and our \ncountry. I wish her well as she continues her education and continues \nto enrich the lives of the children in Hawaii.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/09/senate-section/article/S7330-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WESTMINSTER CHRISTIAN ACADEMY\n\n   Mr. BOND.

Such determination shall be made in \n     accordance with the medical exigencies of the case and as \n     soon as possible, but in no case later than 72 hours after \n     the time the request is received by the plan or issuer under \n     this subparagraph.\n       (C) Ongoing care.--\n       (i) Concurrent review.--\n\n       (I) In general.--Subject to clause (ii), in the case of a \n     concurrent review of ongoing care (including \n     hospitalization), which results in a termination or reduction \n     of such care, the plan or issuer must provide by telephone \n     and in printed form notice of the concurrent review \n     determination to the individual or the individual's designee \n     and the individual's health care provider in accordance with \n     the medical exigencies of the case and as soon as possible, \n     with sufficient time prior to the termination or reduction to \n     allow for an appeal under section 103(b)(3) to be completed \n     before the termination or reduction takes effect.\n       (II) Contents of notice.--Such notice shall include, with \n     respect to ongoing health care items and services, the number \n     of ongoing services approved, the new total of approved \n     services, the date of onset of services, and the next review \n     date, if any, as well as a statement of the individual's \n     rights to further appeal.\n\n       (ii) Rule of construction.--Clause (i) shall not be \n     construed as requiring plans or issuers to provide coverage \n     of care that would exceed the coverage limitations for such \n     care.\n       (2) Retrospective determination.--A group health plan, or \n     health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage, \n     shall make a retrospective determination on a claim for \n     benefits in accordance with the medical exigencies of the \n     case and as soon as possible, but not later than 30 days \n     after the date on which the plan or issuer receives \n     information that is reasonably necessary to enable the plan \n     or issuer to make a determination on the claim, or, if \n     earlier, 60 days after the date of receipt of the claim for \n     benefits.\n       (c) Notice of a Denial of a Claim for Benefits.--Written \n     notice of a denial made under an initial claim for benefits \n     shall be issued to the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee \n     (or authorized representative) and the treating health care \n     professional in accordance with the medical exigencies of the \n     case and as soon as possible, but in no case later than 2 \n     days after the date of the determination (or, in the case \n     described in subparagraph (B) or (C) of subsection (b)(1), \n     within the 72-hour or applicable period referred to in such \n     subparagraph).\n       (d) Requirements of Notice of Determinations.--The written \n     notice of a denial of a claim for benefits determination \n     under subsection (c) shall be provided in printed form and \n     written in a manner calculated to be understood by the \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee and shall include--\n       (1) the specific reasons for the determination (including a \n     summary of the clinical or scientific evidence used in making \n     the determination);\n       (2) the procedures for obtaining additional information \n     concerning the determination;

INTERNAL APPEALS OF CLAIMS DENIALS.\n\n       (a) Right to Internal Appeal.--\n       (1) In general.--A participant, beneficiary, or enrollee \n     (or authorized representative) may appeal any denial of a \n     claim for benefits under section 102 under the procedures \n     described in this section.\n       (2) Time for appeal.--\n       (A) In general.--A group health plan, or health insurance \n     issuer offering health insurance coverage, shall ensure that \n     a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized \n     representative) has a period of not less than 180 days \n     beginning on the date of a denial of a claim for benefits \n     under section 102 in which to appeal such denial under this \n     section.\n       (B) Date of denial.--For purposes of subparagraph (A), the \n     date of the denial shall be deemed to be the date as of which \n     the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee knew of the denial \n     of the claim for benefits.\n       (3) Failure to act.--The failure of a plan or issuer to \n     issue a determination on a claim for benefits under section \n     102 within the applicable timeline established for such a \n     determination under such section is a denial of a claim for \n     benefits for purposes this subtitle as of the date of the \n     applicable deadline.\n       (4) Plan waiver of internal review.--A group health plan, \n     or health insurance issuer offering health insurance \n     coverage, may waive the internal review process under this \n     section. In such case the plan or issuer shall provide notice \n     to the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized \n     representative) involved, the participant, beneficiary, or \n     enrollee (or authorized representative) involved shall be \n     relieved of any obligation to complete the internal review \n     involved, and may, at the option of such participant, \n     beneficiary, enrollee, or representative proceed directly to \n     seek further appeal through external review under section 104 \n     or otherwise.\n       (b) Timelines for Making Determinations.--\n       (1) Oral requests.--In the case of an appeal of a denial of \n     a claim for benefits under this section that involves an \n     expedited or concurrent determination, a participant, \n     beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized representative) may \n     request such appeal orally. A group health plan, or health \n     insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage, may \n     require that the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or \n     authorized representative) provide written confirmation of \n     such request in a timely manner on a form provided by the \n     plan or issuer. In the case of such an oral request for an \n     appeal of a denial, the making of the request (and the timing \n     of such request) shall be treated as the making at that time \n     of a request for an appeal without regard to whether and when \n     a written confirmation of such request is made.\n       (2) Access to information.--\n       (A) Timely provision of necessary information.--With \n     respect to an appeal of a denial of a claim for benefits, the \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized \n     representative) and the treating health care professional (if \n     any) shall provide the plan or issuer with access to \n     information requested by the plan or issuer that is necessary \n     to make a determination relating to the appeal. Such access \n     shall be provided not later than 5 days after the date on \n     which the request for information is received, or, in a case \n     described in subparagraph (B) or (C) of paragraph (3), by \n     such earlier time as may be necessary to comply with the \n     applicable timeline under such subparagraph.\n       (B) Limited effect of failure on plan or issuer's \n     obligations.--Failure of the participant, beneficiary, or \n     enrollee to comply with the requirements of subparagraph (A) \n     shall not remove the obligation of the plan or issuer to make \n     a decision in accordance with the medical exigencies of the \n     case and as soon as possible, based on the available \n     information, and failure to comply with the time limit \n     established by this paragraph shall not remove the obligation \n     of the plan or issuer to comply with the requirements of this \n     section.\n       (3) Prior authorization determinations.--\n       (A) In general.--A group health plan, or health insurance \n     issuer offering health insurance coverage, shall make a \n     determination on an appeal of a denial of a claim for \n     benefits under this subsection in accordance with the medical \n     exigencies of the case and as soon as possible, but in no \n     case later than 14 days from the date on which the plan or \n     issuer receives information that is reasonably necessary to \n     enable the plan or issuer to make a determination on the \n     appeal and in no case later than 28 days after the date the \n     request for the appeal is received.\n       (B) Expedited determination.--Notwithstanding subparagraph \n     (A), a group health plan, or health insurance issuer offering \n     health insurance coverage, shall expedite a prior \n     authorization determination on an appeal of a denial of a \n     claim for benefits described in subparagraph (A), when a \n     request for such an expedited determination is made by a \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized \n     representative) at any time during the process for making a \n     determination and a health care professional certifies, with \n     the request, that a determination under the procedures \n     described in subparagraph (A) would seriously jeopardize the \n     life or health of the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee \n     or the ability of the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee \n     to maintain or regain maximum function. Such determination \n     shall be made in accordance with the medical exigencies of \n     the case and as soon as possible, but in no case later than \n     72 hours after the time the request for such appeal is \n     received by the plan or issuer under this subparagraph.\n       (C) Ongoing care determinations.--\n       (i) In general.--Subject to clause (ii), in the case of a \n     concurrent review determination described in section \n     102(b)(1)(C)(i)(I), which results in a termination or \n     reduction of such care, the plan or issuer must provide \n     notice of the determination on the appeal under this section \n     by telephone and in printed form to the individual or the \n     individual's designee and the individual's health care \n     provider in accordance with the medical exigencies of the \n     case and as soon as possible, with sufficient time prior to \n     the termination or reduction to allow for an external appeal \n     under section 104 to be completed before the termination or \n     reduction takes effect.\n       (ii) Rule of construction.--Clause (i) shall not be \n     construed as requiring plans or issuers to provide coverage \n     of care that would exceed the coverage limitations for such \n     care.\n       (4) Retrospective determination.--A group health plan, or \n     health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage, \n     shall make a retrospective determination on an appeal of a \n     claim for benefits in no case later than 30 days after the \n     date on which the plan or issuer receives necessary \n     information that is reasonably necessary to enable the plan \n     or issuer to make a determination on the appeal and in no \n     case later than 60 days after the date the request for the \n     appeal is received.\n       (c) Conduct of Review.--\n       (1) In general.--A review of a denial of a claim for \n     benefits under this section shall be conducted by an \n     individual with appropriate expertise who was not involved in \n     the initial determination.\n       (2) Peer review of medical decisions by health care \n     professionals.--A review of an appeal of a denial of a claim \n     for benefits that is based on a lack of medical necessity and \n     appropriateness, or based on an experimental or \n     investigational treatment, or requires an evaluation of \n     medical facts--\n       (A) shall be made by a physician (allopathic or \n     osteopathic); or\n       (B) in a claim for benefits provided by a non-physician \n     health professional, shall be made by reviewer (or reviewers) \n     including at least one practicing non-physician health \n     professional of the same or similar specialty;\n\n     with appropriate expertise (including, in the case of a \n     child, appropriate pediatric expertise) and acting within the \n     appropriate scope of practice within the State in which the \n     service is provided or rendered, who was not involved in the \n     initial determination.\n       (d) Notice of Determination.--\n       (1) In general.--Written notice of a determination made \n     under an internal appeal of a denial of a claim for benefits \n     shall be issued to the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee \n     (or authorized representative) and the treating health care \n     professional in accordance with the medical exigencies of the \n     case and as soon as possible, but in no case later than 2 \n     days after the date of completion of the review (or, in the \n     case described in subparagraph (B) or (C) of subsection \n     (b)(3), within the 72-hour or applicable period referred to \n     in such subparagraph).\n       (2) Final determination.--The decision by a plan or issuer \n     under this section shall be treated as the final \n     determination of the plan or issuer on a denial of a claim \n     for benefits. The failure of a plan or issuer to issue a \n     determination on an appeal of a denial of a claim for \n     benefits under this section within the applicable timeline \n     established for such a determination shall be treated as a \n     final determination on an appeal of a denial of a claim for \n     benefits for purposes of proceeding to external review under \n     section 104.\n       (3) Requirements of notice.--With respect to a \n     determination made under this section, the notice described \n     in paragraph (1) shall be provided in printed form and \n     written in a manner calculated to be understood by the \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee and shall include--\n       (A) the specific reasons for the determination (including a \n     summary of the clinical or\n\n[[Page S7341]]\n\n     scientific evidence used in making the determination);\n       (B) the procedures for obtaining additional information \n     concerning the determination; and\n       (C) notification of the right to an independent external \n     review under section 104 and instructions on how to initiate \n     such a review.\n\n     SEC. 104.

include the reasons for the determination;\n       (III) include any relevant terms and conditions of the plan \n     or coverage; and\n       (IV) include a description of any further recourse \n

the independent medical \n     reviewer, shall make a determination within the overall \n     timeline that is applicable to the case under review as \n     described in subsection (e), except that if the entity \n     determines that a referral to an independent medical reviewer \n     is not required, the entity shall provide notice of such \n     determination to the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee \n     (or authorized representative) within such timeline and \n     within 2 days of the date of such determination.\n       (d) Independent Medical Review.--\n       (1) In general.--If a qualified external review entity \n     determines under subsection (c) that a denial of a claim for \n     benefits is eligible for independent medical review, the \n     entity shall refer the denial involved to an independent \n     medical reviewer for the conduct of an independent medical \n     review under this subsection.\n       (2) Medically reviewable decisions.--A denial of a claim \n     for benefits is eligible for independent medical review if \n     the benefit for the item or service for which the claim is \n     made would be a covered benefit under the terms and \n     conditions of the plan or coverage but for one (or more) of \n     the following determinations:\n       (A) Denials based on medical necessity and \n     appropriateness.--A determination that the item or service is \n     not covered because it is not medically necessary and \n     appropriate or based on the application of substantially \n     equivalent terms.\n       (B) Denials based on experimental or investigational \n     treatment.--A determination that the item or service is not \n     covered because it is experimental or investigational or \n     based on the application of

grounds that require an evaluation of \n     the medical facts by a health\n\n[[Page S7342]]\n\n     care professional in the specific case involved to determine \n     the coverage and extent of coverage of the item or service or \n     condition.\n       (3) Independent medical review determination.--\n       (A) In general.--An independent medical reviewer under this \n     section shall make a new independent determination with \n     respect to whether or not the denial of a claim for a benefit \n     that is the subject of the review should be upheld, reversed, \n     or modified.\n       (B) Standard for determination.--The independent medical \n     reviewer's determination relating to the medical necessity \n     and appropriateness, or the experimental or investigation \n     nature, or the evaluation of the medical facts of the item, \n     service, or condition shall be based on the medical condition \n     of the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (including the \n     medical records of the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee) \n     and valid, relevant scientific evidence and clinical \n     evidence, including peer-reviewed medical literature or \n     findings and including expert opinion.\n       (C) No coverage for excluded benefits.--Nothing in this \n     subsection shall be construed to permit an independent \n     medical reviewer to require that a group health plan, or \n     health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage, \n     provide coverage for items or services for which benefits are \n     specifically excluded or expressly limited under the plan or \n     coverage in the plain language of the plan document (and \n     which are disclosed under section 121(b)(1)(C)). \n     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, any \n     exclusion of an exact medical procedure, any exact time limit \n     on the duration or frequency of coverage, and any exact \n     dollar limit on the amount of coverage that is specifically \n     enumerated and defined (in the plain language of the plan or \n     coverage documents) under the plan or coverage offered by a \n     group health plan or health insurance issuer offering health \n     insurance coverage and that is disclosed under section \n     121(b)(1) shall be considered to govern the scope of the \n     benefits that may be required: Provided, That the terms and \n     conditions of the plan or coverage relating to such an \n     exclusion or limit are in compliance with the requirements of \n     law.\n       (D) Evidence and information to be used in medical \n     reviews.--In making a determination under this subsection, \n     the independent medical reviewer shall also consider \n     appropriate and available evidence and information, including \n     the following:\n       (i) The determination made by the plan or issuer with \n     respect to the claim upon internal review and the evidence, \n     guidelines, or rationale used by the plan or issuer in \n     reaching such determination.\n       (ii) The recommendation of the treating health care \n     professional and the evidence, guidelines, and rationale used \n     by the treating health care professional in reaching such \n     recommendation.\n       (iii) Additional relevant evidence or information obtained \n     by the reviewer or submitted by the plan, issuer, \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or an authorized \n     representative), or treating health care professional.\n       (iv) The plan or coverage document.\n       (E) Independent determination.--In making determinations \n     under this subtitle, a qualified external review entity and \n     an independent medical reviewer shall--\n       (i) consider the claim under review without deference to \n     the determinations made by the plan or issuer or the \n     recommendation of the treating health care professional (if \n     any); and\n       (ii) consider, but not be bound by the definition used by \n     the plan or issuer of ``medically necessary and \n     appropriate'', or ``experimental or investigational'', or \n     other substantially equivalent terms that are used by the \n     plan or issuer to describe medical necessity and \n     appropriateness or experimental or investigational nature of \n     the treatment.\n       (F) Determination of independent medical reviewer.--An \n     independent medical reviewer shall, in accordance with the \n     deadlines described in subsection (e), prepare a written \n     determination to uphold, reverse, or modify the denial under \n     review. Such written determination shall include--\n       (i) the determination of the reviewer;\n       (ii) the specific reasons of the reviewer for such \n     determination, including a summary of the clinical or \n     scientific evidence used in making the determination; and\n       (iii) with respect to a determination to reverse or modify \n     the denial under review, a timeframe within which the plan or \n     issuer must comply with such determination.\n       (G) Nonbinding nature of additional recommendations.--In \n     addition to the determination under subparagraph (F), the \n     reviewer may provide the plan or issuer and the treating \n     health care professional with additional recommendations in \n     connection with such a determination, but any such \n     recommendations shall not affect (or be treated as part of) \n     the determination and shall not be binding on the plan or \n     issuer.\n       (e) Timelines and Notifications.--\n       (1) Timelines for independent medical review.--\n       (A) Prior authorization determination.--\n       (i) In general.--The independent medical reviewer (or \n     reviewers) shall make a determination on a denial of a claim \n     for benefits that is referred to the reviewer under \n     subsection (c)(3) in accordance with the medical exigencies \n     of the case and as soon as possible, but in no case later \n     than 14 days after the date of receipt of information under \n     subsection (c)(2) if the review involves a prior \n     authorization of items or services and in no case later than \n     21 days after the date the request for external review is \n     received.\n       (ii) Expedited determination.--Notwithstanding clause (i) \n     and subject to clause (iii), the independent medical reviewer \n     (or reviewers) shall make an expedited determination on a \n     denial of a claim for benefits described in clause (i), when \n     a request for such an expedited determination is made by a \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized \n     representative) at any time during the process for making a \n     determination, and a health care professional certifies, with \n     the request, that a determination under the timeline \n     described in clause (i) would seriously jeopardize the life \n     or health of the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee or the \n     ability of the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee to \n     maintain or regain maximum function. Such determination shall \n     be made as soon in accordance with the medical exigencies of \n     the case and as soon as possible, but in no case later than \n     72 hours after the time the request for external review is \n     received by the qualified external review entity.\n       (iii) Ongoing care determination.--Notwithstanding clause \n     (i), in the case of a review described in such subclause that \n     involves a termination or reduction of care, the notice of \n     the determination shall be completed not later than 24 hours \n     after the time the request for external review is received by \n     the qualified external review entity and before the end of \n     the approved period of care.\n       (B) Retrospective determination.--The independent medical \n     reviewer (or reviewers) shall complete a review in the case \n     of a retrospective determination on an appeal of a denial of \n     a claim for benefits that is referred to the reviewer under \n     subsection (c)(3) in no case later than 30 days after the \n     date of receipt of information under subsection (c)(2) and in \n     no case later than 60 days after the date the request for \n     external review is received by the qualified external review \n     entity.\n       (2) Notification of determination.--The external review \n     entity shall ensure that the plan or issuer, the participant, \n     beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized representative) and \n     the treating health care professional (if any) receives a \n     copy of the written determination of the independent medical \n     reviewer prepared under subsection (d)(3)(F). Nothing in this \n     paragraph shall be construed as preventing an entity or \n     reviewer from providing an initial oral notice of the \n     reviewer's determination.\n       (3) Form of notices.--Determinations and notices under this \n     subsection shall be written in a manner calculated to be \n     understood by a participant.\n       (f) Compliance.--\n       (1) Application of

denial, the plan or issuer, upon the receipt of such \n     determination, shall authorize coverage to comply with the \n     medical reviewer's determination in accordance with the \n     timeframe

certification upon a \n     showing of cause. The Secretary, or organization, shall \n     revoke a certification or deny a recertification with respect \n     to an entity if there is a showing that the entity has a \n     pattern or practice of ordering coverage for benefits that \n     are specifically excluded under the plan or coverage.\n       (vii) Petition for denial or withdrawal.--An individual may \n     petition the Secretary, or an organization providing the \n     certification involves, for a denial of recertification or a \n     withdrawal of a certification with respect to an entity under \n     this subparagraph if there is a pattern or practice of such \n     entity failing to meet a requirement of this section.\n       (viii) Sufficient number of entities.--The appropriate \n     Secretary shall certify and recertify a number of external \n     review entities which is sufficient to ensure the timely and \n     efficient provision of review services.\n       (D) Provision of information.--\n       (i) In general.--A qualified external review entity shall \n     provide to the appropriate Secretary, in such manner and at \n     such times as such Secretary may require, such information \n     (relating to the denials which have been referred to the \n     entity for the conduct of external review under this section) \n     as such Secretary determines appropriate to assure compliance \n     with the independence and other requirements of this section \n     to monitor and assess the quality of its external review \n     activities and lack of bias in making determinations.

EFFECTIVE DATES.\n\n       (a) Group Health Coverage.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2) and subsection \n     (d), the amendments made by sections 201(a), 401, and 403 \n     (and title I insofar as it relates to such sections) shall \n     apply with respect to group health plans, and health \n     insurance coverage offered in connection with group health \n     plans, for plan years beginning on or after October 1, 2002 \n     (in this section referred to as the ``general effective \n     date'').\n       (2) Treatment of collective bargaining agreements.--In the \n     case of a group health plan maintained pursuant to one or \n     more collective bargaining agreements between employee \n     representatives and one or more employers ratified before the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the amendments made by \n     sections 201(a), 401, and 403 (and title I insofar as it \n     relates to such sections) shall not apply to plan years \n     beginning before the later of--\n       (A) the date on which the last collective bargaining \n     agreements relating to the plan terminates (excluding any \n     extension thereof agreed to after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act); or\n       (B) the general effective date;\n\n     but shall apply not later than 1 year after the general \n     effective date. For purposes of subparagraph (A), any plan \n     amendment made pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement \n     relating to the plan which amends the plan solely to conform \n     to any requirement added by this Act shall not be treated as \n     a termination of such collective bargaining agreement.\n       (b) Individual Health Insurance Coverage.--Subject to \n     subsection (d), the amendments made by section 202 shall \n     apply with respect to individual health insurance coverage \n     offered, sold, issued, renewed, in effect, or operated in the \n     individual market on or after the general effective date.\n       (c) Treatment of Religious Nonmedical Providers.--\n       (1) In general.--Nothing in this Act (or the amendments \n     made thereby) shall be construed to--\n       (A) restrict or limit the right of group health plans, and \n     of health insurance issuers offering health insurance \n     coverage, to include as providers religious nonmedical \n     providers;\n       (B) require such plans or issuers to--\n       (i) utilize medically based eligibility standards or \n     criteria in deciding provider status of religious nonmedical \n     providers;\n       (ii) use medical professionals or criteria to decide \n     patient access to religious nonmedical providers;\n       (iii) utilize medical professionals or criteria in making \n     decisions in internal or external appeals regarding coverage \n     for care by religious nonmedical providers; or\n       (iv) compel a participant or beneficiary to undergo a \n     medical examination or test as a condition of receiving \n     health insurance coverage for treatment by a religious \n     nonmedical provider; or\n       (C) require such plans or issuers to exclude religious \n     nonmedical providers because they do not provide medical or \n     other required data, if such data is inconsistent with the \n     religious nonmedical treatment or nursing care provided by \n     the provider.\n\n[[Page S7360]]\n\n       (2) Religious nonmedical provider.--For purposes of this \n     subsection, the term ``religious nonmedical provider'' means \n     a provider who provides no medical care but who provides only \n     religious nonmedical treatment or religious nonmedical \n     nursing care.\n       (d) Transition for Notice Requirement.--The disclosure of \n     information required under section 121 of this Act shall \n     first be provided pursuant to--\n       (1) subsection (a) with respect to a group health plan that \n     is maintained as of the general effective date, not later \n     than 30 days before the beginning of the first plan year to \n     which title I applies in connection with the plan under such \n     subsection; or\n       (2) subsection (b) with respect to a individual health \n     insurance coverage that is in effect as of the general \n     effective date, not later than 30 days before the first date \n     as of which title I applies to the coverage under such \n     subsection.\n\n     SEC. 502. COORDINATION IN IMPLEMENTATION.\n\n       The Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services shall ensure, through the execution of an \n     interagency memorandum of understanding among such \n     Secretaries, that--\n       (1) regulations, rulings, and interpretations issued by \n     such Secretaries relating to the same matter over which such \n     Secretaries have responsibility under the provisions of this \n     Act (and the amendments made thereby) are administered so as \n     to have the same effect at all times; and\n       (2) coordination of policies relating to enforcing the same \n     requirements through such Secretaries in order to have a \n     coordinated enforcement strategy that avoids duplication of \n     enforcement efforts and assigns priorities in enforcement.\n\n     SEC. 503. SEVERABILITY.\n\n       If any provision of this Act, an amendment made by this \n     Act, or the application of such provision or amendment to any \n     person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional, the \n     remainder of this Act, the amendments made by this Act, and \n     the application of the provisions of such to any person or \n     circumstance shall not be affected thereby.\n\n                   TITLE VI--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n\n     SEC. 601. NO IMPACT ON SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND.\n\n       (a) In General.--Nothing in this Act (or an amendment made \n     by this Act) shall be construed to alter or amend the Social \n     Security Act (or any regulation promulgated under that Act).\n       (b) Transfers.--\n       (1) Estimate of secretary.--The Secretary of the Treasury \n     shall annually estimate the impact that the enactment of this \n     Act has on the income and balances of the trust funds \n     established under section 201 of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 401).\n       (2) Transfer of funds.--If, under paragraph (1), the \n     Secretary of the Treasury estimates that the enactment of \n     this Act has a negative impact on the income and balances of \n     the trust funds established under section 201 of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401), the Secretary shall transfer, \n     not less frequently than quarterly, from the general revenues \n     of the Federal Government an amount sufficient so as to \n     ensure that the income and balances of such trust funds are \n     not reduced as a result of the enactment of such Act.\n\n     SEC. 602. CUSTOMS USER FEES.\n\n       Section 13031(j)(3) of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1985 (19 U.S.C. 58c(j)(3)) is amended \n     by striking ``2003'' and inserting ``2011, except that fees \n     may not be charged under paragraphs (9) and (10) of such \n     subsection after March 31, 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 603.

SENSE OF SENATE WITH RESPECT TO PARTICIPATION IN \n                   CLINICAL TRIALS AND ACCESS TO SPECIALTY CARE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer among \n     women, excluding skin cancers.\n       (2) During 2001, 182,800 new cases of female invasive \n     breast cancer will be diagnosed, and 40,800 women will die \n     from the disease.\n       (3) In addition, 1,400 male breast cancer cases are \n     projected to be diagnosed, and 400 men will die from the \n     disease.\n       (4) Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer \n     death among all women and the leading cause of cancer death \n     among women between ages 40 and 55.\n       (5) This year 8,600 children are expected to be diagnosed \n     with cancer.\n       (6) 1,500 children are expected to die from cancer this \n     year.\n       (7) There are approximately 333,000 people diagnosed with \n     multiple sclerosis in the United States and 200 more cases \n     are diagnosed each week.\n       (8) Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder of the \n     central nervous system affecting 1,000,000 in the United \n     States.\n       (9) An estimated 198,100 men will be diagnosed with \n     prostate cancer this year.\n       (10) 31,500 men will die from prostate cancer this year. It \n     is the second leading cause of cancer in men.\n       (11) While information obtained from clinical trials is \n     essential to finding cures for diseases, it is still research \n     which carries the risk of fatal results. Future efforts \n     should be taken to protect the health and safety of adults \n     and children who enroll in clinical trials.\n       (12) While employers and health plans should be responsible \n     for covering the routine costs associated with federally \n     approved or funded clinical trials, such employers and health \n     plans should not be held legally responsible for the design, \n     implementation, or outcome of such clinical trials, \n     consistent with any applicable State or Federal liability \n     statutes.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) men and women battling life-threatening, deadly \n     diseases, including advanced breast or ovarian cancer, should \n     have the opportunity to participate in a federally approved \n     or funded clinical trial recommended by their physician;\n       (2) an individual should have the opportunity to \n     participate in a federally approved or funded clinical trial \n     recommended by their physician if--\n       (A) that individual--\n       (i) has a life-threatening or serious illness for which no \n     standard treatment is effective;\n       (ii) is eligible to participate in a federally approved or \n     funded clinical trial according to the trial protocol with \n     respect to treatment of the illness;\n       (B) that individual's participation in the trial offers \n     meaningful potential for significant clinical benefit for the \n     individual; and\n       (C) either--\n       (i) the referring physician is a participating health care \n     professional and has concluded that the individual's \n     participation in the trial would be appropriate, based upon \n     the individual meeting the conditions described in \n     subparagraph (A); or\n       (ii) the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee provides \n     medical and scientific information establishing that the \n     individual's participation in the trial would be appropriate, \n     based upon the individual meeting the conditions described in \n     subparagraph (A);\n       (3) a child with a life-threatening illness, including \n     cancer, should be allowed to participate in a federally \n     approved or funded clinical trial if that participation meets \n     the requirements of paragraph (2);\n       (4) a child with a rare cancer should be allowed to go to a \n     cancer center capable of providing high quality care for that \n     disease; and\n       (5) a health maintenance organization's decision that an \n     in-network physician without the necessary expertise can \n     provide care for a seriously ill patient, including a woman \n     battling cancer, should be appealable to an independent, \n     impartial body, and that this same right should be available \n     to all Americans in need of access to high quality specialty \n     care.\n\n     SEC. 605. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING FAIR REVIEW PROCESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) A fair, timely, impartial independent external appeals \n     process is essential to any meaningful program of patient \n     protection.\n       (2) The independence and objectivity of the review \n     organization and review process must be ensured.\n       (3) It is incompatible with a fair and independent appeals \n     process to allow a health maintenance organization to select \n     the review organization that is entrusted with providing a \n     neutral and unbiased medical review.\n       (4) The American Arbitration Association and arbitration \n     standards adopted under chapter 44 of title 28, United States \n     Code (28 U.S.C. 651 et seq.) both prohibit, as inherently \n     unfair, the right of one party to a dispute to choose the \n     judge in that dispute.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) every patient who is denied care by a health \n     maintenance organization or other health insurance company \n     should be entitled to a fair, speedy, impartial appeal to a \n     review organization that has not been selected by the health \n     plan;\n       (2) the States should be empowered to maintain and develop \n     the appropriate process for selection of the independent \n     external review entity;\n       (3) a child battling a rare cancer whose health maintenance \n     organization has denied a covered treatment recommended by \n     its physician should be entitled to a fair and impartial \n     external appeal to a review organization that has not been \n     chosen by the organization or plan that has denied the care; \n     and\n       (4) patient protection legislation should not pre-empt \n     existing State laws in States where there already are strong \n     laws in place regarding the selection of independent review \n     organizations.\n\n     SEC. 606. ANNUAL REVIEW.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 24 months after the general \n     effective date referred to in section 501(a)(1), and annually \n     thereafter for each of the succeeding 4 calendar years (or \n     until a repeal is effective under subsection (b)), the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services shall request that the \n     Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences \n     prepare and submit to the appropriate committees of Congress \n     a report concerning the impact of this Act, and the \n     amendments made by this Act, on the number of individuals in \n     the United States with health insurance coverage.\n\n[[Page S7361]]\n\n       (b) Limitation With Respect to Certain Plans.--If the \n     Secretary, in any report submitted under subsection (a), \n     determines that more than 1,000,000 individuals in the United \n     States have lost their health insurance coverage as a result \n     of the enactment of this Act, as compared to the number of \n     individuals with health insurance coverage in the 12-month \n     period preceding the date of enactment of this Act, section \n     402 of this Act shall be repealed effective on the date that \n     is 12 month after the date on which the report is submitted, \n     and the submission of any further reports under subsection \n     (a) shall not be required.\n       (c) Funding.--From funds appropriated to the Department of \n     Health and Human Services for fiscal years 2003 and 2004, the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services shall provide for such \n     funding as the Secretary determines necessary for the conduct \n     of the study of the National Academy of Sciences under this \n     section.\n\n     SEC. 607. DEFINITION OF BORN-ALIVE INFANT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 1 of title 1, United States Code, \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 8. `Person', `human being', `child', and `individual' \n       as including born-alive infant\n\n       ``(a) In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or \n     of any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of the various \n     administrative bureaus and agencies of the United States, the \n     words `person', `human being', `child', and `individual', \n     shall include every infant member of the species homo sapiens \n     who is born alive at any stage of development.\n       ``(b) As used in this section, the term `born alive', with \n     respect to a member of the species homo sapiens, means the \n     complete expulsion or extraction from his or her mother of \n     that member, at any stage of development, who after such \n     expulsion or extraction breathes or has a beating heart, \n     pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of \n     voluntary muscles, regardless of whether the umbilical cord \n     has been cut, and regardless of whether the expulsion or \n     extraction occurs as a result of natural or induced labor, \n     caesarean section, or induced abortion.\n       ``(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affirm, \n     deny, expand, or contract any legal status or legal right \n     applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any \n     point prior to being born alive as defined in this \n     section.''.\n       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the \n     beginning of chapter 1 of title 1, United States Code, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new item:\n\n``8. `Person', `human being', `child', and `individual' as including \n              born-alive infant.''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/09/senate-section/article/S7361-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nBANKRUPTCY ABUSE PREVENTION AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 2001--MOTION \n                               TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. REID.
