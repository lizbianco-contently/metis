Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 9:30 a.m. shall be equally divided between the two managers for \ndebate only. Who yields time?\n\n[[Page S6684]]\n\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I understand there will be about 5 \nminutes allotted each manager now. Is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, very shortly we will be voting on a \ncloture petition with respect to this legislation, S. 2673. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for the cloture motion.\n  I know there are a lot of amendments pending, but we have now been on \nthis legislation a full week. Even with the voting of cloture today, \nthis matter will carry over into next week. There have been a range of \namendments, some that are pending that are germane under cloture to the \nbill. In other words, they have been drawn in a way and the subject \nmatter is focused and limited enough that they remain germane even \nafter cloture.\n  There are a number of amendments that are relevant to the bill but \nnot germane. Once cloture is invoked, they will fall. I know that is a \nmatter of some concern to those who are proposing those amendments, but \nI do not know how we can handle this differently and move along towards \na resolution.\n  In addition to those relevant amendments--and I have sympathy there \nbecause while they may not meet the very narrow definition of \ngermaneness, they do touch the subject matter of the legislation--there \nare also amendments that are not even relevant to the bill that are \nsort of--I was going to say floating around, but it would be more \naccurate to say they are sort of present. They touch matters that have \nnothing to do with this legislation.\n  I am frank to say to my colleagues, I do not see how we can progress \nand move towards a final vote and resolution on this issue without \ninvoking cloture this morning. We tried not to precipitate that early \non, although I know people were then blocked from getting votes, and I \nregret that. I was concerned, as anyone, to get the votes and give \npeople a chance to have their amendments considered. Nevertheless, we \nare now where we are, and I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture.\n  We have to move forward on this legislation. This is important \nlegislation. I think the committee and my colleagues have fashioned \nlegislation which will make a very important contribution toward \naddressing the serious economic challenge now confronting the country \nand this loss of confidence in the workings of our economic system. The \nfact that people cannot have any trust in or reliance on the basic \nfinancial information upon which they make important economic decisions \nis having a major impact on the workings of the economy and carries \nwith it the very real potential of having an even more significant \nimpact.\n  This is serious business, and the potential for an economic downturn, \ntriggered in part by the difficulties we are trying to address in this \nlegislation, I think is not insignificant. So I think it is important \nthat we move forward and pass this legislation. This is but one step \nalong the way, and there are many steps left yet to be done.\n  I am hopeful at some point the administration will come to see the \nnecessity of putting into place a statutory framework to provide for an \nindependent oversight board with respect to the accounting industry, to \naddress the conflict that exists on the part of auditors when they are \nthe auditor of a company and at the same time are providing certain \nconsulting services to the company which carry with them an inherent \nconflict of interest with their responsibilities as an auditor.\n  There are extensive provisions in this bill with respect to corporate \nresponsibility and accountability with respect to corporate disclosure \nand, of course, with respect to the conflict of interest we have seen \nmanifest with respect to stock analysts who are often in the position \nof giving buy recommendations on the stock of a company with which the \nanalyst's company is also having investment banking deals which, of \ncourse, raises the question: Is the recommendation on the stock being \ndone in order to gain the investment banking business? So we try to \nprovide some, as they call them, Chinese walls between those two sides \nof the company in order to reduce the degree of that conflict.\n\n  Furthermore, this has a very significant authorization of additional \nmonies for the SEC in order to be able to meet its responsibilities, \nwhich I think is very important. The President asked the other day in \nhis address for another $100 million. That is not sufficient. We have \nto do better than that so the SEC can do its job.\n  So we can move forward, I urge my colleagues to support the cloture \nmotion which will be before us for a vote at 9:30.\n  I presume I have used my time, and I yield the floor so my colleague, \nthe ranking Republican Member, may use his time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, we need to pass a bill. We are going to \nconference with a House bill that is substantially different from this \nbill. I believe that between the two bills, we can find a virtually \nunanimous vote. I think we can write a bill that will satisfy the \nPresident and both Houses of Congress. I do not think we are making the \nbill better. The amendments that are being offered now are largely \nnongermane. We have gotten into sort of a one-upmanship position, and I \nthink we are harming the markets by convincing people that the cure may \nvery well be worse than the disease.\n  It is very important that we get on with our business and that we \npass this bill. I intend to vote for it today. I do not think it is the \nbill we need in the end, but it gets us to conference where we can get \nthe bill we need in the end. I urge my Republican colleagues to vote \nfor it, not because in the end they are for this version but because \nthey want to do something. We need to bring this debate to a close. We \ndo have some germane amendments. We will be dealing with those, but the \ntime has come to get on about our business. Getting on about our \nbusiness means bringing this debate to a close.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote to end the debate. Let us go to \nconference. Let us write this bill. Let us let it be known with \ncertainty what our policy is going to be. If we do that, it will help \nrestore confidence in the country. So I urge my colleagues to vote for \ncloture and, as we get to the end of the process, for the bill.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I do not know if the manager has any time.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Do I have any time remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The manager has no time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto proceed until 9:30 when cloture is invoked.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, a number of amendments have been pending \nwhere we have been unable to get a vote. These are highly relevant \namendments, including mine which would have given the SEC \nadministrative powers to impose civil fines.\n  The Republican manager said the amendments were not particularly \nrelevant. Well, we had a highly relevant amendment that goes directly \nto the issue of abuses by corporate officers and corporate directors. \nThe current fine structure of the SEC does not reach officers and does \nnot reach directors, except by going to court. They have no \nadministrative authority in the SEC to impose civil fines, the way they \ndo with brokers and the way a lot of other agencies that regulate \nbusiness have authority to do. The SEC does not have the power to \nimpose administrative fines on directors and on officers of \ncorporations. They should have that power administratively.\n  We were blocked in getting a vote, and the amendment which is pending \nis going to fall if cloture is invoked. That is the use of the rules. \nBut let it be clear what the rules were used to do, which was to \nprevent a strengthening amendment for this bill.\n\n  It is a good bill. I compliment the sponsors of this bill. I \ncompliment Senator Sarbanes and his cosponsors that this bill can be \nstrengthened; it should be strengthened. One of the strengthening \namendments was blocked from getting to a vote yesterday and will fall \nif cloture is invoked.\n  We also have a question. What about postcloture? There are 48 germane \nor\n\n[[Page S6685]]\n\narguably germane amendments. The question is whether or not the rules \nare going to be used again to block votes on germane amendments. I will \nobject to that happening. I will do everything I can to make sure \ngermane amendments, including some that I have filed, are considered \npostcloture.\n  I thank the manager for yielding. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the clerk \nwill report the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close the debate on Calendar No. \n     442, S. 2673, the Public Company Accounting Reform and \n     Investor Protection Act of 2002:\n         Jon Corzine, Deborah Stabenow, Paul Wellstone, Ron Wyden, \n           Daniel Akaka, Barbara Boxer, Charles Schumer, Byron \n           Dorgan, Harry Reid, Paul Sarbanes, Daniel Inouye, John \n           Edwards, Barbara Mikulski, Thomas Carper, Jack Reed, \n           Tim Johnson.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, no committee in this Senate works harder \nthan the Appropriations Committee. We have been working for months on \nthe supplemental appropriations bill. We held hearings, months ago now, \non the supplemental appropriations bill, hearings specifically \nconcerning budget requests for homeland security.\n  The administration put its feet in cement and its head in the sand \nand adamantly opposed the committee's request, which was in writing, \nand signed by Mr. Stevens and myself, to have Mr. Ridge come up and \ntestify so that the Appropriations Committee in the Senate, following a \npractice of 135 years of having witnesses appear in open sessions so \nthat the people can hear what they said--the administration did not \nwant that, and the President put a muzzle on his Homeland Security \nDirector and said, no, he will not come.\n  Mr. Stevens and I wrote a joint letter asking for an appointment with \nthe President. We wanted to state our case. The President did not \nanswer that letter. No. Some underling answered the letter.\n  So we had to proceed. We did. We proceeded as best we could. The full \ncommittee had excellent hearings over a period of 5 days, with \ntestimony from firemen, policemen, local health officials, also \ntestimony from seven Cabinet Members and the Director of FEMA.\n  So we proceeded as best we could. We put together a bill we thought \nwas a good bill. Then, however, the President threatened to veto \nit because it had too much money, in his way of looking at it, too much \nmoney for homeland security. So there was the threat to veto the bill.\n\n  Only this week--perhaps it was Monday--the President, in a speech, \nassailed Congress for ``delay'' in getting this appropriations bill \ndowntown, saying the Defense Department is hard up for moneys. So Mr. \nYoung, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Mr. Obey, Mr. \nStevens, and I have been meeting. We met yesterday and we thought we \nhad the whole thing pretty much wrapped up and that we could meet this \nmorning in full committee and vote the conference report out, and send \nit back to both Houses for their judgments.\n  Lo and behold! At 7 o'clock last night, here comes a request from the \nWhite House to hold up further action. They want to send up a different \nbudget.\n  So, who is holding up defense? The President, in a public speech, \nlambasts the Congress for not getting this appropriations bill to him \nsooner. We have been wanting to go with the President and get this bill \non his desk, but he just has not supported the efforts of the \nappropriations members on both sides of the Capitol to move this bill, \nfirst withholding Mr. Ridge, who is the point man for the \nadministration on homeland security, adamantly refusing to let him \ntestify; then threatening to veto the bill. This is a difficult bill. \nThe staffs work into the night around here on this bill; we try to work \nhard to get the bill down to the President. He assails the Congress for \nnot sending the bill to him, saying that if he doesn't have it by a \ncertain hour or day, it is going to affect the national defense, going \nto affect the military with personnel reductions and so on.\n  So we were prepared today to have a conference. I want all \nappropriations members within the sound of my voice to know that the \nmeeting is canceled. Canceled, why? I understand that Mr.\n\n[[Page S6686]]\n\nYoung is going to call me to tell me that it is canceled at the request \nof the Speaker of the House, who often acts at the request of the White \nHouse, I assume.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. I don't mean any disrespect to the Speaker. I am just \nsaying how this is being put off. Yes, I will, just in a moment, if I \nmay.\n  I am upset about it. I am the chairman of this Appropriations \nCommittee. I have never seen the appropriations process so meddled in \nand delayed by the White House. I know that Mr. Young is doing this at \nthe request of the White House. They want to send up a new budget right \nat the last minute, 7 o'clock last night. Mitch Daniels, I understand--\n--\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. I will yield right in the middle of my sentence.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am sorry to do this, Mr. President, but my \ndistinguished friend, our chairman, I think is implying that this was \ndone at the request of the White House. That is not my information. It \nwas a decision of the Speaker because the Office of Management and \nBudget has not delivered to us the information we need to close this \nbill. The Speaker asked, notwithstanding the White House request that \nwe get the bill done today, that we wait until we get the information \nfrom the Office of Management and Budget.\n  If the Senator will let me have one other comment, then I will yield \nback. I apologize for interrupting the distinguished President pro \ntempore, chairman of our committee, but the difficulty is this: We have \nfaced such an enormous demand from the Office of Management and Budget \nto adhere to a line, a top line barrier that the Office of Management \nand Budget is willing to accept, $1.6 billion from the airline bill, \nairline supplemental bill, stabilization bill, that expired.\n\n  We have such a blind mindset down there about top lines that we are \nunwilling to look at reality. The reality is, the Senate and the House \nhave worked, and we are almost closed, and now we are waiting for some \nmore Enron-type offsets, offsets that are meaningless in order to \njustify this top line mentality with which we are dealing.\n  From my point of view, I think we should go see the President. I am \ngoing to ask to see the President. I have been here 34 years, not \nnearly as long as my friend from West Virginia, but I, too, have never \ngone through a period as I have gone through on this supplemental. This \nis not worthy of the constitutional process at all, and it is time we \nhad an understanding of what the role of the Congress is with regard to \nappropriations.\n  Right now we face this demand, and because we wanted to get the bill \nout, we did meet with the Office of Management and Budget Director last \nnight. Our staffs worked late into the night, and we came to an \nagreement about what we would do. But the Office of Management and \nBudget was to submit rescissions to us or at least changes in their \nbudget by 8 a.m. this morning. They are not here.\n  But the Senator from West Virginia is absolutely right, part of it is \na reduction in defense. We fought to increase defense. Some of these \noffsets may make a little sense in this sense; that the supplemental \nwas submitted to us in March and there certainly has been a series of \nmonths pass by that people were not paid to carry out the work that was \ncovered by the supplemental. That would be a legitimate offset, if it \nwere identified properly.\n  We were told last night that there was such a list. When we asked to \nsee it, it didn't appear. When we asked for it to appear here by 8, it \nwas agreed to, to be here by 8. It didn't appear this morning either, \nhardly worthy of people who are working for the President.\n  The only thing on which I cannot agree with my friend from West \nVirginia is that this is the President. The President is ill served by \nwhat is going on, in my opinion. I hope people understand: This is \nblind adherence to a line that was established--a crazy line, in my \nopinion--without regard to the needs of the country at all, and we are \nasked now to get down on our knees and really thank God for this list \nwhen it comes. But I have to tell you, my good friend, I am up to here \nwith this process. People know I have a short fuse anyway. I hope to \ncalm down before I see the President, but I do thank the Senator from \nWest Virginia for yielding to me.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska. He is precisely on point. If I have presumed to err in my \njudgment as to what was going on exactly in the process and have cast \nany reflection on the Speaker of the other body, I apologize for doing \nthat.\n  My colleague is correct: This Office of Management and Budget, as far \nas I am concerned, is just above my ears. Upon what meat doth this our \nlittle Caesar feed? I am talking about Mitch Daniels, the Director of \nOMB. He is always meddling, always meddling in the Congress, in its \nwork and in appropriations. Not only that; he is always lecturing the \nCongress. I have never mentioned his name publicly until now. But I am \nfed up to my ears also.\n  The appropriations process is being mangled. It is being maimed. It \nis being murdered at the hands of someone who is not elected by the \npeople of this country. What bar of judgment does he stand before?\n  I repeat, ``Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed that he is \nbecome so great?''\n  I want to voice my disappointment in the circumstances that have \nbrought about a cancellation of this appropriations conference today. \nIf I have said something amiss here, which Mr. Stevens felt I might \nhave, I certainly apologize for that. But I am just fed up. I am tired. \nI am tired of this mangling of the appropriations process. Here is this \noutfit, blows into town like a tornado and they are going to change the \ntone in Washington. And the tone has been changed. It is to the nth \ndegree worse than what it has ever been before. I wish the President \nwould step in and stop this interruption, this mangling of the \nappropriations process, this meddling by his Office of Management and \nBudget director, and stop that bigmouth down there from constantly \nmeddling in appropriations bills and criticizing the Congress.\n  That man, Mitch Daniels, is not elected by anybody. I hate to say \nthis about a man. I like him personally, but he just goes too far. I am \ntired of it. We have Members who had planned to leave town, who \ncanceled their trips, believing they were going to have this meeting \nthis morning and that we would wrap up this appropriations bill and \nsend it down to the President.\n  I don't want to hear anybody in the administration accusing the \nCongress of delay in passing this bill. It is on their table. Let them \ncome into court with clean hands before they attack the Congress.\n  I am sorry to my colleagues for taking so much of their time. I am \nsorry profusely, I say, to the members of the Appropriations Committee \nwho were here and who made changes in their day's schedule on the \npresumption that we were going to have a conference. I don't know when \nwe will have a meeting. I suppose it will be soon.\n  I hope those Senators who are attempting to hold up the military \nconstruction bill, because of the need for moneys to help their States \nand districts in the case of floods and fires and drought, will desist. \nThat is what a supplemental is for. We have a supplemental now. Let's \ndo something about the drought, the fires, and the floods in this \nsupplemental. It is my desire, as chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, to get all of these appropriations bills passed by the \nbeginning of the new fiscal year. We are going to do that. Mr. Stevens \nand I worked hard on this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I am offering this amendment on behalf \nof myself and Senators Dodd, Dubbin, Levin, Harkin, and Corzine.\n  The Senate is engaged in an important debate about how to improve our \nNation's financial system. Today I am offering an amendment that is \nintended to provide more timely information to average investors. \nAmerica has the most vibrant and dynamic economy in the world. Our \nrobust and resilient capital markets are the foundation of our economy. \nBut the success of those markets depends on the free flow of accurate, \nreliable information.\n  Recent disclosures about the inaccuracy of some companies' financial \nreports have shaken that confidence. I am pleased the Senate has acted \nquickly to take up this important reform legislation. I believe that \nthis bill makes tremendous progress in improving the quality of \ninformation available to the markets. In the interest of further \nimprovement, I am offering an amendment to modernize the method of \ndisclosure required when insiders trade in their own companies' stock.\n  One warning sign that a company may be in trouble is when its \nexecutives are selling large amounts of company stock, as occurred at \nEnron. I have learned, however, that information about insider selling \nis not easily accessible.\n  Under our current system a company's officers are required to file a \ndisclosure form with the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, any \ntime they sell securities of their company. Tens of thousands of these \nforms are filed annually. These are not complicated forms. I have a \ncopy here. It is a simple 2-page form.\n  The Office of Management and Budget estimates that the form should \nnot take more than 30 minutes to fill out. With capital markets as \nsophisticated as they are in the U.S., information must be available \nquickly to be useful. However, insiders currently have up to six weeks \nto file their disclosure forms. And the overwhelming majority of these \nforms--95 percent--are filed on paper, rather than electronically.\n  The Banking Committee has already addressed the issue of timely \ndisclosure. This legislation would require disclosure of sales within 2 \ndays, a vast improvement over the current deadlines. However, this \nlegislation is silent on the issue of modernizing this arcane paper \nfiling system.\n  Right now, there is no way for an investor in Missouri to quickly \nlearn that a company executive is selling off company stock. The only \nways to get the information are to go to a reading room at the SEC in \nWashington, or to write a letter to the SEC. These written requests may \ntake weeks to process. This is unacceptable in the electronic age.\n  My amendment requires that information about insider sales of \npublicly traded companies be filed electronically. The SEC would then \nbe required to make the forms available to the public over the \nInternet. Any company that maintains a corporate Web site would be \nrequired to post these disclosure forms on the Web site. The SEC, \nitself, has acknowledged the value of having these forms filed \nelectronically.\n  I have here a letter from SEC Chairman, Harvey Pitt. He wrote to me \nthat ``expedited disclosure of trading by company insiders is \nimperative.'' In fact, he applauded the legislation I introduced \nearlier this year that requires electronic disclosure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               U.S. Securities and\n\n\n                                          Exchange Commission,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 1, 2002.\n     Hon. Jean Carnahan,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Carnahan: Thank you for your February 14th \n     letter regarding S. 1897, the Fully Informed Investor Act \n     which you recently introduced. I share your concerns about \n     the issues regarding reporting of insiders' securities \n     transactions that your bill addresses. As we announced on \n     February 13th, the Commission will shortly propose rules that \n     would provide accelerated reporting by companies of insider \n     transactions in public company securities. This is an \n     integral part of our effort to supplement the periodic \n     disclosure system with ``current disclosure'' in order to put \n     information investors want and need into their hands more \n     promptly.\n       I also share the view reflected in your bill that expedited \n     electronic disclosure of trading by company insiders is \n     imperative, and I applaud your initiative. As you know, the \n     Securities Exchange Act of 1934, rather than\n\n[[Page S6688]]\n\n     rules adopted by the Commission, sets the deadlines for \n     officers, directors and beneficial owners of ten percent of a \n     class of equity securities of a public company to report \n     their trading in those securities. A legislative solution, \n     therefore, will be necessary to address fully the issue of \n     investors' timely access to information about insiders' \n     securities transactions.\n       While formal Commission comment on legislation is normally \n     reserved for testimony or a response to a request from a \n     committee or subcommittee given jurisdiction over the bill, \n     we would welcome the opportunity to provide you with \n     technical assistance on your bill if you would find that \n     helpful. I have asked Casey Carter, the Director of our \n     Office of Legislative Affairs, to contact your staff to see \n     if you would like our assistance. Please feel free to call me \n     or to have your staff call Ms. Carter at (202) 942-0019 if \n     you have any questions.\n           Yours truly,\n                                                   Harvey L. Pitt.\n\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. This is not a new idea. In fact, more than 2 years \nago, in April 2000, the SEC published a rulemaking for its electronic \ndata system. In that rulemaking, the SEC indicated that it \n``anticipated'' making insiders file disclosure forms electronically. I \napplaud the SEC for recognizing the need to modernize, but I am \nfrustrated by the delay. It has been over 2 years since the SEC made \nthis proposal.\n  An agency that is responsible for monitoring markets where trillions \nof dollars are electronically exchanged ought to be able to develop a \nfairly simple electronic database to make this information available.\n  The Senate now has the opportunity to require the SEC to move \nquickly. I am very pleased that the bill I introduced earlier this year \non this subject was included in the House accounting reform bill. The \nHouse has required that insiders file electronically, within one day of \ntheir transactions. The House has also required that corporations \ndisclose insider sales on their corporate Web sites.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support my amendment. We should not make \ninvestors wait any longer for these basic reforms.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask to be heard on the Carnahan amendment \nvery briefly. Does the Senator mind?\n  Mr. DORGAN. How briefly?\n  Mr. DODD. Two minutes or so.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Connecticut, \nprovided that I am recognized following his presentation.\n  Mr. DODD. I appreciate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Missouri for \nthis very fine amendment. I think it is going to make a strong \ndifference by improving electronic reporting. It doesn't get the kind \nof attention it should.\n  This is a positive and constructive suggestion. I am a cosponsor of \nthe amendment and commend the distinguished Senator from Missouri for \noffering the amendment. It makes the bill stronger. It is something all \nour colleagues will be willing to support. I commend the Senator for \nher work.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4215, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have an amendment numbered 4215 at the \ndesk. I have submitted a modification of that amendment which I believe \nhas been reviewed by both sides. I ask for its immediate consideration \nand I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to laying aside the pending \namendment of the Senator from Missouri?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Is this the amendment that deals with the offshore \ncompanies?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I have no objection to setting aside the pending \namendments in order to consider this amendment. I understand upon the \nconclusion of the consideration of this amendment we will revert to the \nEdwards-Carnahan amendment\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right to object, I believe I have two \namendments that have been cleared by both sides. I would like to offer \nthem immediately after the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. SARBANES. We are hoping to get to the Senator from New York. I \nmake a unanimous consent request that following the disposition of the \namendment of the Senator from North Dakota, we turn to the amendments \nreferred to by the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Provided that no second-degree amendments are in order to \nany of the three amendments.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Furthermore, upon conclusion of the consideration of \nthe Schumer amendments, we return to the regular order, which I take it \nwould be the Edwards-Carnahan amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Senator Schumer has a number \nof amendments on the list. I think we better get numbers of those \namendments before there is an agreement they be next in order.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Let us withdraw the unanimous consent request and make \nit only that Senator Schumer be recognized after the disposition of the \nDorgan amendment and we can address those questions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Reserving the right to object, just to make sure we have \nthis clarified, the unanimous consent request is just to the Dorgan \namendment pending, and we would not object as long as the second-degree \namendment is not in order to his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first of all I will offer an amendment \nthat I believe will be accepted. I understand the process is that those \nwho have amendments that will be accepted will be allowed to offer them \nand those whose amendments are not approved by both sides will not be \nallowed to offer them. In my judgment, this is not the kind of \nprocedure we ought to use when considering this legislation. But I \nunderstand the Senator from Texas indicated he will object to setting \naside or laying aside an amendment for the purpose of offering another \nfirst-degree amendment unless he agrees with the amendment. I will talk \na little bit more about that in a couple of minutes.\n  I had asked unanimous consent my amendment be modified. Was the \nconsent agreed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It was agreed to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Is amendment No. 4215 called up at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is set aside and the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself and \n     Mr. Graham of Florida, proposes an amendment numbered 4215, \n     as modified.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To clarify that the requirement that certain officers certify \n       financial reports applies to domestic and foreign issuers)\n\n       On page 82, after line 24, insert the following:\n       (c) Foreign Reincorporations Have No Effect.--Nothing in \n     this section 302 shall be interpreted or applied in any way \n     to allow any issuer to lessen the legal force of the \n     statement required under this section 302, by an issuer \n     having reincorporated or having engaged in any other \n     transaction that resulted in the transfer of the corporate \n     domicile or offices of the issuer from inside the United \n     States to outside of the United States.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me describe what this amendment is briefly. There was \na Wall Street Journal article on July 8 this week titled: ``Offshore-\nbased Firm's Officials Won't Have to Swear to Results.''\n\n       The Securities and Exchange Commission's new order \n     requiring chief executives and chief financial officers of \n     the nation's biggest companies to swear to the accuracy of \n     their financial results was intended to restore investors' \n     battered confidence. But two of the companies that have \n     promised the biggest concerns don't have to comply.\n       Why? Because Tyco International Ltd. and Global Crossing \n     Ltd. are based in Bermuda, even though they conduct many of \n     their operations and have main office in the United States \n     and are listed on the U.S. stock exchanges.\n       Securities and Exchange Commission spokesmen said large \n     foreign-domiciled companies over which the SEC has \n     jurisdiction,\n\n[[Page S6689]]\n\n     such as and Global Crossing and Tyco, were excluded from the \n     list because the agency wanted to issue the order ``very \n     quickly.'' Therefore it focused only on U.S. companies.\n\n  So the Securities and Exchange Commission says that the chief \nexecutives and chief financial officers of some of the biggest \ncompanies must swear to the accuracy of their financial results. But in \nrecent times, we have had U.S. corporations decide that they want to \nrenounce their American citizenship and they want to become citizens, \nfor example, of Bermuda. That is called a corporate inversion. They \nhave essentially renounced their American citizenship, saying we are \nnow corporate citizens of another country.\n  Guess what? Under the SEC order, they are rewarded for leaving the \nUnited States, in that their chief executives no longer have to certify \nfinancial results. The SEC says: We had to get this done quickly, and \nwe don't expect to change it at this point.\n  Why does a company renounce its U.S. citizenship? They do it because \nthey don't want to pay U.S. taxes. Very simple. If they can become a \ncitizen of another country and renounce their U.S. citizenship, they \ncan save substantial money on their U.S. tax bill.\n  At a time when we are at war with terrorists, is that a patriotic \nthing to do? No, I don't think so. I hope the Senate, and I certainly \nencourage my colleagues to do this, will shut that door tight and stop \nthese corporate inversions. Stop these corporations from creating a \nsham of renouncing their U.S. citizenship in order to avoid paying U.S. \ntaxes.\n  It might be interesting to ask companies such as Tyco: If you get \nyourself in trouble someplace around the world, who are you going to \ncall? The Bermuda navy? The Bermuda army? The Bermuda marines? You want \nthe full protection of the U.S. Government and the U.S. military and \nall the benefits that being a U.S. citizen brings along. But then you \nwant to renounce your citizenship and move to Bermuda, in a technical \nsense, while keeping your offices in the United States and saving big \nmoney on taxes. And then, under the SEC order, you don't even have to \nhave your chief executive officers certify the financial results of the \ncorporation.\n  That is a shame. The SEC should know better. What could they have \nbeen thinking? I have accused them of sleeping, but this is not \nsleeping; this is making really dumb decisions.\n  I have discussed my concern with the staff of the Banking Committee. \nThey believe that their bill implicitly addresses the reincorporation \nproblem. But Senator Graham of Florida and I said we are not satisfied \nwith ``implicitly'' being covered. We want the issue addressed \nexplicitly.\n  Let me also say, the technical people smile when I talk about this, \nbut, frankly, it took a day and a half for us to evaluate whether it \nwas implicitly covered in the bill. So because of that, I think it is \nimportant to have an explicit provision in this bill that says those \ncompanies involved in inversions that renounce their citizenship, they, \ntoo, will be required to certify their results. Their chief executive \nofficers and their CFOs will be required to certify their results.\n  In a moment I will conclude and ask that this amendment be attached \nto the bill. As I do that, I ask for the attention of the Senator from \nMaryland and the manager on the other side to say that I have another \namendment that I will offer. I understand, based on your process, you \ndon't want it offered now. Let me describe it briefly.\n  The other amendment deals with the issue of what is called \ndisgorgement of profits.\n  The top executives of these corporations make bonuses, commissions, \nand a substantial amount of compensation--some of them hundreds of \nmillions of dollars. Then they issue a restatement of earnings and \neverything collapses. But they keep their profits and they keep their \ncommissions and they keep their bonuses.\n  This legislation says you can't do that. When you restate, and just \nprior to restatement you have made all these bonuses, you have to \ndisgorge this money. It is a $2 word, but I think everybody understands \nwhat it means.\n  The thing that is missing in this bill is that disgorgement should be \nrequired in cases of bankruptcy as well. So I have an amendment that \nwill say: Yes, disgorgement in this bill with respect to periods prior \nto restatement, but also disgorgement for the 12 months prior to the \nfiling of bankruptcy by a corporation as well.\n  A fair number of people have had a lot to say about this. Former SEC \nChairman, Richard Breeden, who was the Chairman of the SEC under \nPresident H.W. Bush from 1989 to 1993, said:\n\n       We should consider disgorgement to the company of any net \n     proceeds of stock sales or option exercises within a 6-month \n     or a 1-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing.\n\n  So he feels that way.\n  Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson has also spoken in favor of this \nidea.\n  This bill will be incomplete if it does not include disgorgement in \nthe period prior to bankruptcy. Those making a fortune, getting bonuses \nand commissions of tens of millions, yes hundreds of millions, as their \ncompanies are headed to bankruptcy--that is unfair. We need to do \nsomething about this.\n  I will not ask consent at the moment because I want to get my first \namendment approved, but I will, following some discussions, either this \nmorning or else on Monday, ask consent to set aside the second-degree \namendment so we can consider, in first-degree, this issue. My hope is \nwe would have a 100-to-0 vote on this matter because, failing that, \nthis bill will be incomplete.\n  This bill is a great bill. I have credited Senator Sarbanes and \nothers at length. This is a wonderful piece of legislation that I fully \nsupport. It can be and will be improved by my amendments and by the \namendments of Senator Schumer and others. Let's complete this amendment \nprocess.\n  Let me just say one last thing, if I might.\n  I know it has taken the patience of Job to try to manage this bill on \nthe floor of the Senate. I understand all the difficulties that Senator \nSarbanes and Senator Reid and many others have had these recent days \nbecause I have been here every day when this bill has been on the \nfloor. My aggressiveness in trying to get these amendments considered \nhas nothing at all to do with the wonderful stewardship of the \nchairman. I am very proud of the result he brings to the floor, and I \nbelieve both of my amendments will improve it. I hope I can work with \nhim from now until Monday afternoon to have the bankruptcy amendment \nincluded in this legislation.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for just a moment?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I simply want to say I think the \nsubject matter with which the Senator's other amendment, that he just \nreferred to, deals is a very important subject, and I think his \nobservations are very much on point. Working with the other side, we \nare trying to work through the amendment. We are in the process of \ntrying to do that. Of course, we will be continuing to talk with the \nSenator, and I hope we can resolve it. It would be very helpful. I \nappreciate his kind words.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Senator from Maryland. I ask my amendment be \nconsidered at this point and be voted upon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 4215, as modified.\n  The amendment, (No. 4215), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I move to lay the motion to reconsider on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4295\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent the Carnahan amendment be laid \naside, and I send an amendment to the desk which we have talked about.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator describe the amendment?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Yes. This amendment is the amendment that enhances the \nconflict of interest provisions by prohibiting personal loans by \nissuers to chief officers of the issuer. It has been agreed to by both \nsides.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I ask unanimous consent no second-degree amendment to \nthe Schumer amendment, when it is sent to the desk, be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there objection to laying aside the pending amendment for purposes \nof\n\n[[Page S6690]]\n\nsending up a new amendment? Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nclerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York (Mr. Schumer) proposes an \n     amendment No. 4295.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To enhance conflict of interest provisions by prohibiting \n       personal loans by issuers to chief officers of the issue)\n\n       On page 91, strike line 19 and all that follows through \n     page 93, line 22 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 402. ENHANCED CONFLICT OF INTEREST PROVISIONS.\n\n       (a) Prohibition on Personal Loans to Executives.--Section \n     13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m), as \n     amended by this Act, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(k) Prohibition on Personal Loans to Executives.--\n       ``(1) In General.--It shall be unlawful for any issuer, \n     directly or indirectly, to extend or maintain credit, or \n     arrange for the extension of credit, in the form of personal \n     loan to or for any director or executive officer (or \n     equivalent thereof) of that issuer.\n       ``(2) Limitation.--Paragraph (1) does not preclude any home \n     improvement and manufactured home loans (as that term is \n     defined in Section 5 of the Home Owners Loan Act, consumer \n     credit (as defined in section 103 of the truth in lending \n     act), or any extension of credit under an open end credit \n     plan (as defined in section 103 of the Truth in Lending Act \n     (15 U.S.C. 1602)), that is--\n       ``(A) made in the ordinary course of the consumer credit \n     business of such issuer;\n       ``(B) of a type that is generally made available by such \n     issuer to the public; and\n       ``(C) made by such issue on market terms, or terms that are \n     no more favorable than those offered by the issuer to the \n     general public for such loans.''.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I also ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Feinstein be added as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I am going to be very brief because I \nknow we do not have too much time and we have other business. I thank \nboth the majority and minority managers, Senator Sarbanes and Senator \nGramm, for their work on this amendment. I have also spoken to the \npeople in the White House who were supportive of this amendment. It is \na very simple amendment. It basically says that with certain narrow \nexceptions, CEOs and CFOs of companies will not be able to get loans \nfrom those companies.\n  In his speech before Wall Street yesterday, President Bush forcefully \nstated: ``. . . I challenge compensation committees to put an end to \nall company loans to corporate officers.''\n  I couldn't agree more. It seems like we didn't learn our lessons \nduring the S crisis in the 1980's? These same kinds of transactions \nwere used then to ``cook the books'' and our Nation's economy and \nfinancial institutions paid the price for it. Once again, history \nrepeats itself.\n  My amendment is very simple: it makes it unlawful for any publicly \ntraded company to make loans to its executive officers. Let me give a \nfew examples as to why we should do this.\n  Executives of major corporations, including Enron, WorldCom, and \nAdelphia, collectively received more than $5 billion in company funds \nin the form of personal loans. For example, Bernard Ebbers, CEO of \nWorldCom, borrowed a mind-boggling $408 million from the corporation \nover several years, while receiving a compensation package valued at \nover $10 million annually, all the while the company was facing massive \nlosses. In the case of Adelphia, the Rigas Family received loans and \nother financial benefits totaling a staggering $3.1 billion, while that \ncompany has also reported huge financial losses.\n  The question is: Why can't these super rich corporate executives go \nto the corner bank, the Suntrust's or Bank of America's, like everyone \nelse to take loans?\n  In the case of WorldCom, Ebbers had funded his personal stock market \nactivities by borrowing on margin. When the value of those investments \nplunged, Ebbers had to pay up. How did he do it? He borrowed money from \nhis board of directors to pay for the stock he had bought that was now \nbeing called in.\n  This is just wrong, and it must be stopped.\n  I urge the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4295) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4296\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I have a second amendment that has also been agreed to, \nso I ask, again, the Carnahan amendment be laid aside, and I send the \namendment to the desk and ask for its consideration. I ask unanimous \nconsent Senator Shelby be added as a cosponsor on this amendment on the \nSPEs.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I ask unanimous consent no second-degree amendment be \nin order to the Schumer amendment being sent to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Is there \nobjection to laying aside the pending amendments for the purpose of \nintroducing a new amendment? Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nclerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York (Mr. Schumer), for himself and \n     Mr. Shelby, proposes an amendment numbered 4296.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require a study of the accounting treatment of special \n                           purpose entities)\n\n       On page 91, between lines 18 and 19, insert the following:\n       (c) Study and Report on Special Purpose Entities.--\n       (1) Study required.--The Commission shall, not later than 1 \n     year after the effective date of adoption of off-balance \n     sheet disclosure rules required by section 13(j) of the \n     Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as added by this section, \n     complete a study of filings by issuers and their disclosures \n     to determine--\n       (A) the extent of off-balance sheet transactions, including \n     assets, liabilities, leases, losses, and the use of special \n     purpose entities; and\n       (B) whether generally accepted accounting rules result in \n     financial statements of issuers reflecting the economics of \n     such off-balance sheet transactions to investors in a \n     transparent fashion.\n       (2) Report and recommendations.--Not later than 6 months \n     after the date of completion of the study required by \n     paragraph (1), the Commission shall submit a report to the \n     President, the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs of the Senate, and the Committee on Financial \n     Services of the House of Representatives, setting forth--\n       (A) the amount or an estimate of the amount of off-balance \n     sheet transactions, including assets, liabilities, leases, \n     and losses of, and the use of special purpose entities by, \n     issuers filing periodic reports pursuant to section 13 or 15 \n     of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934;\n       (B) the extent to which special purpose entities are used \n     to facilitate off-balance sheet transactions;\n       (C) whether generally accepted accounting principles or the \n     rules of the Commission result in financial statements of \n     issuers reflecting the economics of such transactions to \n     investors in a transparent fashion;\n       (D) whether generally accepted accounting principles \n     specifically result in the consolidation of special purpose \n     entities sponsored by an issuer in cases in which the issuer \n     has the majority of the risks and rewards of the special \n     purpose entity; and\n       (E) any recommendations of the Commission for improving the \n     transparency and quality of reporting off-balance sheet \n     transactions in the financial statements and disclosures \n     required to be filed by an issuer with the Commission.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I will again be brief. This amendment \nrelates to a second problem that we have seen in the latest crisis that \nwe have faced in our financial markets, and that is the special purpose \nentities. Sometimes special purpose entities have a valid purpose. Many \ncompanies use them for valid purposes.\n  We have seen, particularly most egregiously in the case of Enron, \nthese have been entities that have been used to take losses off the \nbooks, and then shareholders, and everybody else, don't know much about \nthem.\n  Enron, for instance, conducted business through thousands of these \nwith names such as LJM, Cayman LP, and\n\n[[Page S6691]]\n\nRaptor. They become pretty famous and the Enron's former CFO, Andrew \nFastow, contributed hard assets and related debt to Raptor SPE and then \nRaptor would turn around and borrow large sums of money from a bank to \npurchase assets or conduct other business.\n  This is the key. The debts of this SPE, Raptor, never showed up on \nEnron's financial statements.\n  People make money on it. Fastow made $30 million in management fees. \nThese things go way overboard. The way we had proposed originally \nlegislating on this was too complicated, but there are some good ones. \nThere are some with legitimate purposes and many with bad purposes.\n  Congress can't set these accounting standards, nor should we. Rather, \nthat is the SEC and FASB's job.\n  We have asked in this amendment that the SEC do a comprehensive study \nof the SPEs to show where the damage is, point the way to reform, and \nmake recommendations. This amendment does not put Congress in the \nbusiness of setting accounting standards.\n  It does, however, say to thousands of Enron and other employees who \nhave lost pensions that we are stepping up to the plate now to stop \nthese kinds of egregious practices.\n  I add that there are probably many of these SPEs for bad purposes \nfloating around in other companies, and this study cannot come too \nsoon.\n  We have received agreement. I thank Senators Sarbanes and Gramm.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4296) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I thank Senator Sarbanes and his staff \nas well as Senator Gramm and his staff for their work on accepting \nthese two important amendments that I think improves the bill, which is \na very fine bill that I am proud to support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, let me spend a few minutes talking about \nthe underlying legislation, S. 2673.\n  There has been a great deal of debate over the last good number of \ndays on this issue. I am pleased that we were able to get cloture. It \nis time we move on to this issue.\n  The American public, a good many stockholders, a good many pension \nplans, a good many retirement plans are discussing what are we going to \ndo about the meltdown that last occurred in corporate America at the \nexecutive level with some key corporations. It is really, in most \ninstances, a crisis of confidence.\n  There are a lot of well-run corporations across America that are \npublicly held. They have historically observed the prudent rules. Their \nboards have acted responsibly. But there are bad players. There are \nbig, bad players that have had a dramatic impact on the markets. There \nis no question that we have to deal with this straight away.\n  When I look at the whole of this issue, it isn't just in the markets \nwhere there is a crisis of confidence that Americans share: When you \nlook at 9/11, then Enron, then WorldCom, and, of course, all the \nscandals that have occurred, and out in the West with the Ninth Circuit \nsuggesting that the Pledge of Allegiance isn't constitutional, put all \nof that together, and America has to be scratching its head at this \nmoment, asking: Where does all of this take us? Where is that rock of \nstability that we have come to rely on for so long?\n  I suggest that when we are debating this issue, while this is an \nissue that has to be dealt with, and we are now moving appropriately, \nit is one of a combination of factors that is critically important for \nour country to deal with.\n  One issue we have to deal with is the war on terrorism. The DOD \nappropriations ought to be the first bill we deal with on the defense \nside to begin to shore up again this sense of confidence in the \nAmerican structure. Certainly, protecting our soldiers in the post-9/11 \nfighting that has gone on in Afghanistan is appropriate, and now, as we \nsearch out terrorism around the world, that is critical.\n  The next step I would suggest is the confirming of judges. It is \nimportant that we deal with judges. For the judicial system of this \ncountry to remain strong, vacancies need to be filled. People should \nreceive their day in court in a timely fashion. That has been one of \nthe hallmarks and the strengths of this country throughout its history, \nand it ought to be today.\n  Clearly, I hope we appoint judges who will not act as the ones in the \nNinth Circuit who suggested that the Pledge of Allegiance is \nunconstitutional. I think President Bush has gone a long way in \nnominating good judges to the Senate.\n  Yet, the politics here in the Senate today is obvious: Withhold as \nlong as you can. Withhold as long as you can.\n  The President spoke the other day on Wall Street relating to \ncorporate accounting. The U.S. Senate is speaking today, as they \nshould.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a commentary by Lawrence Kudlow be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, July 11, 2002]\n\n                A Class Above the Corruption and Critics\n\n                          (By Lawrence Kudlow)\n\n       In front of a New York audience on Tuesday, President Bush \n     unveiled a revised plan to counter corporate wrongdoing and \n     accounting fraud, saying, ``There can be no capitalism \n     without conscience, no wealth without character.'' Adam \n     Smith, the father of free-market economics, couldn't have \n     said it better.\n       Smith always argued that smooth-functioning markets require \n     ethical behavior at their center. From Day One of his \n     presidency, Mr. Bush has applied this rule even more broadly, \n     emphasizing the need for ethical clarity and moral certitude \n     in all areas of American life. He has successfully applied \n     the rule of ethics to the war on terror, and now he is \n     transferring the very same principle to root out corporate \n     corruption.\n       From the election campaign to today, poll after poll shows \n     that the public believes Mr. Bush is a leader with strong \n     character and unshakable moral principles. Following the \n     blowups of WorldCom, Enron and Tyco--and many other rotten \n     apples--Mr. Bush's honest outrage has been heartfelt, and not \n     political.\n       It has also shone above the political carping of Tom \n     Daschle, Al Gore, Richard Gephardt and other national \n     Democrats who would locate the source of the contagious virus \n     of accounting fraud and corporate corruption within the Bush \n     administration. Theirs is a political, reckless, and silly \n     approach to a serious situation. The bad-business bug gained \n     strength and spread well before George W. Bush became \n     president. And today it is a grave problem that requires \n     sober solutions.\n       Serious Democrats, such as Senate Banking Committee head \n     Paul Sarbanes and Senate Investigations Subcommittee Chairman \n     Carl Levin, have taken a completely different tack from the \n     business-as-usual partisan politics of the Daschle gang.\n       Mr. Sarbanes has crafted a significant proposal to set up \n     an independent accounting-standards board--one that will end \n     conflict of interests between the auditing and consulting \n     functions, properly score stock options, create new pressure \n     for independent boards of directors, and legislate tough \n     legal sanctions on executives, bankers, auditors, accountants \n     and others who violate the new standards.\n       The accounting system desperately needs a fix; it is even \n     more incoherent than the dreaded tax code. A new accounting-\n     standards board should come under the aegis of the Securities \n     and Exchange Commission. Along with proposals from the New \n     York Stock Exchange to create truly independent boards of \n     directors, this action will promote honest accounting and \n     shareholder-based corporate governance.\n       Meanwhile, Mr. Levin has just as seriously proposed giving \n     the SEC, the federal government's principal accounting \n     overseer, the right to levy tough fines on corporate \n     evildoers without having to go to court first.\n       Suburban liberals like Sens. Sarbanes and Levin, its seems, \n     have suddenly become conservative lawmakers who will ``move \n     corporate accounting out of the shadows,'' as Mr. Bush \n     rightly put it, and protect the basic workings of our wealth-\n     creating capitalist system.\n       President Bush, in tune with these focused Democrats, has \n     proposed a doubling of the maximum prison term for mail- and \n     wire-fraud statutes from five to 10 years. This severe jail-\n     time penalty will greatly concentrate the executive mind. And \n     so will Mr. Bush's proposal that fraudulently earned bonuses \n     and compensation must be returned;\n\n[[Page S6692]]\n\n     and so will his request that corporate officers and directors \n     who engage in serious misconduct be barred from again sitting \n     in corporate-leadership positions. More, if the Bush \n     corporate doctrine moves through Congress, top executives \n     will now have to certify their financial statements with \n     their own signatures. False reporting could lead to jail.\n       It seems that our more serious men in Washington want to \n     bolster the rue of law by strengthening the incentive to \n     choose right from wrong.\n       Incentives matter. If you tax something more you get less \n     of it. If you tax something less you get more of it. A 10-\n     year jail term for rotten corporate apples--or their \n     accountants--is a huge legal tax on wrongful actions.\n       Of course, standing behind higher ethical standards in \n     business is the great American investor class. Covering more \n     than 50 percent of American households and more than 80 \n     million people, this group is positively changing financial \n     practices and the political culture. These shareholders have \n     lost enormous wealth, in part from dishonest accounting and \n     egocentric corporate misdeeds. And they're furious.\n       Financial markets have been democratized in the past 15 \n     years with the rise of this investor class. They have already \n     voted to depress the stock market as a signal of their \n     indignation, and they're now prepared to vote this November \n     against the silly politicians who fail to realize the \n     enormity of the current problem. Consider this: Slightly more \n     than 60 percent of the investor class voted in the last \n     election. This may be the most powerful lobby in America.\n       In no uncertain terms, this new political movement is \n     forcing Washington to renew the rule of law, strengthen \n     accounting and financial standards across the board, and \n     restore a proper incentive system that will return Adam \n     Smith's ethical epicenter to the greatest wealth-creating \n     machine in all of history. The days of egocentric and corrupt \n     Soviet-style corporation have come to an end. In the stock \n     market, moral amnesia is dead.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I see Chairman Sarbanes on the floor. It \nis not often that Lawrence Kudlow praises the chairman, but he did the \nother day in an op-ed and commentary that he often writes. He talked \nabout the Sarbanes bill and said:\n\n       Serious Democrats, such as the Senate Banking Committee \n     head Paul Sarbanes and Senate Investigations Subcommittee \n     Chairman Carl Levin, have taken a completely different tact \n     from the business as usual--\n\n  I will not repeat the remainder of it. But that ought to be a part of \nthe Record because I think it reflects the spectrum of the thinking on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate at this moment. Whether you are \nconservative, moderate, or liberal, we know that we have to regain the \nconfidence of the American investing public and the world investing \npublic, and for that matter, the market systems of our country and in \ncorporate America.\n  As long and as loud as many of us speak about the good corporations \nout there and how well run they are, the moment another Enron occurs or \nsomeone else speaks out about misdealings, that confidence is once \nagain dashed.\n  This legislation moves to create a bright line between, good and bad \naccounting by separating auditing and consulting services for \naccountants in public corporations. It requires disclosure of off-\nbalance sheet transactions and other obligations that might affect the \ncorporate financial condition, and it establishes independent auditing \nboards to oversee corporate accounting.\n  All of those are very critical in creating bright lines of clarity, \nunderstanding, confidence, and stronger enforcement of criminal \nbehavior.\n  Someone in my State said the other day: You don't have to strengthen \nthe accounting procedure, Craig. Put the bums in jail. Those are \ncriminal acts. When you knowingly are distorting the financial strength \nof a company which affects its stock, destroys retirement funds, \nemployee's stock options, and all of that, it is, in fact, a criminal \nact.\n  Our President has said it. Others have spoken on the floor. But there \nis a line we have to draw. It is not one of grandstanding for political \npurposes but doing the right thing, to set in place good public policy \nthat directs the free market system in the appropriate fashion. Do we \nwant to make it so restrictive that decisionmaking in the board room \nmeans always looking over their shoulder to see that they have done it \nexactly right against a Federal law when the marketplace is a dynamic \nplace and laws are static?\n  We know there have to be some static lines attached. There is no \ndoubt about it. Those have to be clear. At the same time, we cannot be \nso restrictive that we blight the market and send investments outside \nthe United States to the rest of the world.\n  The Wall Street Journal wrote yesterday that everything you are \nhearing now from Washington is aimed at winning the November elections \nand not at calming financial markets. I hope this bill is all about \ncalming financial markets. And I believe the majority of this bill does \nhave that goal. Some of rhetoric may not reflect it. But I truly \nbelieve the chairman and the ranking member are working in the \ndirection of building a substantive bill that will go to conference, \nthat works out our differences between the House and that goes to the \nPresident's desk.\n  I hope the Wall Street Journal is wrong. I hope we refrain from \nmaking corporate accountability simply another political exercise. It \nought not be. It has not been. It should never be.\n  In Idaho they say: ``You can't hang the same man twice.'' ``You can't \nhang the same person twice.''\n  So let's make the laws clear, easily defined, not arbitrary, not like \nour tax laws today where even the best consultants cannot give good \nadvice.\n  What we are working with, I hope, is clean and clear and appropriate. \nThere are more than 16,000 corporations under the jurisdiction of the \nSEC. Of those, no more than a handful have been accused of criminal \nwrongdoing. In the end--when all the dust settles, the market \nstabilizes, and investors begin again to regain confidence, and the \nCongress has acted--no more than a handful of corporations will have \nbeen the bad actors.\n  So I hope and I trust we can finalize what we are doing here today, \nand Monday possibly. It is important. The bottom line is very simple: \nCongress needs to act, and act now, and reaffirm the confidence the \nAmerican people have in our public institutions.\n  I just came from a Republican bicameral meeting between the House and \nthe Senate Republican leaders. They said: Get us the bill immediately. \nAssign conferees. Let's go to work. Let's get this out before the \nAugust recess.\n  Let's send a message to the American and the world investor that we \nhave acted timely, that we have acted responsibly. The President has \nlaid down his marker. The House has laid down their marker. It is now \ntime for us to do the same. And in doing so, and in moving with \nexpeditious action--not haste, not in an irresponsible way--I think we \ncan turn to the American people and say: We have put in place the right \nsafeguards, the right protections, the right firewalls. Study the \npapers, study the financials, and begin, once again, to reinvest in the \nAmerican marketplace because it will be the right place to put your \nmoney.\n  Madam President, I yield floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I want to pick up on what the Senator \nfrom Idaho just said, which is, we were just meeting on the House side \namong the leadership. One of the messages that was very clear was, when \nthis bill passes, the House is very eager to appoint conferees and to \nmove forward to get a bill out as quickly and as responsibly as \npossible, to send all the right messages to the investing public and to \nWall Street that Congress has seen the problem and that we are ready, \nwilling, and able to act, and act in an expeditious way.\n  I think it is important for us to act. I agree with that sentiment. \nThe House, obviously, acted months ago in dealing with this problem. We \nhave taken a little bit longer, which we have a tendency to do in the \nSenate--take a little longer to get things done. But we are now moving \nforward, and we should not delay in getting to conference. We should \nnot delay in appointing conferees in the Senate. And we should have a \nprocess by which we engage in these meetings earnestly and come up with \na product, if possible, by the August recess.\n  It is little difficult. The House is going to be out a week before \nthe Senate. So it is a pretty big task ahead of us, but we should go \nabout it in earnest, and we should do our best to move this forward and \nsend the signals that the Congress has moved as expeditiously as \npossible to meet the concerns of the investing public about the markets \nand the reliability of the numbers that corporations are sending out to \nthe investing public.\n\n[[Page S6693]]\n\n  I have to say, as one of the four members of the committee who voted \nagainst this bill in the committee, I have some concerns about the \nunderlying bill that came out of committee. I have some concerns about \nparticularly the impact on some of the small companies that will be \ngoverned by this legislation.\n  A lot has been made that this is a piece of legislation that just \ndeals with publicly traded companies, and so we are talking about the \nbig companies. As any of you who have watched the market for any length \nof time know, there are a lot of small companies that go into the \nequity markets and are publicly traded, particularly a lot of \ntechnology companies.\n  A lot of the economic growth engines of our economy are small \npublicly traded companies. One of the concerns I have is this bill may \nbe appropriate for large multinational corporations--such as General \nMotors or IBM; you can go down the list; Xerox, whatever--but it may \nnot be particularly an appropriate vehicle of regulation for small-cap \nstocks.\n  As you know, there are small-capital stocks, mutual funds, small-cap \nfunds. To apply the same rigorous accounting standards and rules and \nregulations that very well may be appropriate for these large companies \nto these smaller companies could have a very significant negative \neffect on economic growth in our country.\n  To put these kinds of rules and regulations in place for these small \ncompanies is going to be very expensive, very onerous, and make it very \ndifficult for them to conduct business. And remember, folks, who is \nresponsible for economic growth in America, job creation in America. \nLet me underscore this. We have job claims up again just last week. The \neconomic engine for job creation is smaller businesses. A lot of them \nare these small publicly traded companies.\n  It is a very grave concern to me that, yes, we look at these \ncompanies we are talking about here. These are big companies that have \ndone a lot of things that, obviously, they should not have done, and \nwith big accounting firms. We are not hearing about scandal in these \nsmaller publicly traded companies that use small accounting firms in \nmost cases. To apply these rules to these smaller companies is really \nproblematic and has a negative effect on our economy.\n\n  The last thing I want to see us do--yes, we want to strengthen \nconfidence in the capital markets. Yes, we want to deal with the \nproblems of fraud, and we want to hold people who commit fraud more \naccountable, and toughen punishments, which is what we have done on the \nfloor. Those are very important things to do. But we should not do that \nat the expense of jobs and economic growth in our economy.\n  I understand there is a provision in the bill that allows smaller--\nany company, I guess, to seek a waiver as to some of the provisions of \nthis act. I know a lot of small businesses, and most of them do not \nhave a lot of money to hire lobbyists and lawyers and other people to \ncome here to Washington, DC, or to New York and plead their case that \nthey should somehow be preempted from the provisions of this act.\n  You are talking about 16,000 publicly traded companies, most of \nwhich--well over 75 percent--are relatively small in size. Imagine the \nburden of the regulators having to deal with petition after petition \nafter petition.\n  Senator Gramm has an amendment, which I presume he will offer on \nMonday. I am hopeful that the Senate will seriously consider giving the \nregulatory body some flexibility in providing blanket waivers to \nclasses of companies, or based on some sort of rational scheme of \ndetermination of size and scope of a company, that we give a little \nflexibility to the regulators not to sort of throw all the babies in \nthis one big basket, and understand that there are real significant \nconsequences to jobs and future growth of this economy if we did that.\n  So I know that is an issue on which we are going to have a discussion \nnext week. But, to me, it is a very significant issue, one where you \ncan be for tougher regulation, you can be for increased accountability, \nyou can be for tougher penalties--all those things, setting up this \ngoverning board, having standards in place--you can be for all these \nthings in the bill, but you have to understand that General Motors and \nABC Tech Company in Scranton, PA, are fundamentally different entities \nand should not be treated the same way.\n  It really is important for us to have some sort of provision for the \nregulatory body to exempt some of these smaller entities, where some of \nthese regulations do not really apply or misapply, from this scheme of \nregulation that is in this bill.\n  So with that, it looks as if we have another Member who might be \ninterested in offering an amendment or giving a speech.\n  I am happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, later I want to address a couple of \npoints made by the Senator from Pennsylvania, but the Senator from \nDelaware is in the Chamber and wishes to speak. So I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I know the Senator from Maryland is \ngetting tired of receiving all these bouquets, but he deserves them. \nSenator Enzi is not on the floor, but he deserves one or two as well, \nalong with others of our colleagues, not just on the Banking Committee \nbut other Members as recently as this morning who offered amendments to \nthis legislation which improve it materially, especially the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Missouri, Mrs. Carnahan. It is all well and \ngood that we say to those who are senior officials within companies, if \nyou have a stock transaction, you have to report it. Give them the \npaperwork, they report it, and it goes somewhere where few people ever \nhave a chance to see it or be aware of it. It is quite another thing to \nlist that transaction, do it electronically so anyone who has access to \nthe Internet can find out about it. Senator Carnahan's amendment \nincludes this electronic disclosure, and that is a very good \nimprovement to the legislation.\n  I like what the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, has offered \ntoday, with respect to the process where we have companies normally \nregistered and incorporated here in a State in America who somehow slip \noff to Bermuda and incorporate. We actually provide an incentive; if we \ndon't adopt the Dorgan amendment, we provide an incentive for that kind \nof behavior. Not only does that have an adverse effect on States such \nas New York or Delaware or Maryland or Pennsylvania, it also has an \nadverse effect on shareholders because the heads of companies that are \nregistered or incorporated in a place such as Bermuda would otherwise \nnot have to sign off and vouch for the financial statements they are \nproviding.\n  Even as recently as this morning, a good bill has gotten better.\n  I appreciate the amendment offered earlier by Senator Lott on behalf \nof the President and the addition of a number of provisions in the bill \nthat the administration supports, and, frankly, I think we all should.\n  I came across an interesting column this week. I didn't know if I \nwould read it, but given that the Senator from New York is presiding, I \nhave to at least read the first paragraph. This is a column by a fellow \nwho writes in the LA Times and is syndicated across the country, Ronald \nBrownstein. I will read a paragraph and perhaps ask unanimous consent \nthat the entire column be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Bush Needs to Drop the Velvet Glove Approach\n\n                         (By Ronald Brownstein)\n\n       It's easy to imagine the frenzy that would be engulfing \n     Washington if it was President Clinton now revising his \n     explanation of a controversial 12-year-old stock deal.\n       Bush Limbaugh would be roaring in outrage. Robert H. Bork \n     would be decrying the loss of moral authority in the Oval \n     Office. Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., would be demanding a \n     special prosecutor. Congressional committees would be \n     subpoenaing the president's old business partners.\n       President Bush probably will be spared all that, even after \n     suddenly altering his explanation for why he was eight months \n     late in reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission \n     his 1990 sale of stock in Harken Energy Corp., a company on \n     whose board he sat, shortly before it announced large losses. \n     (For years he blamed it on the SEC; now he's fingering \n     Harken's lawyers.)\n\n[[Page S6694]]\n\n       After the fanatical ethics wars of the Clinton years, few \n     in Washington have much stomach for a full-scale \n     confrontation--though the Washington Post raised eyebrows by \n     revealing Bush's former personal attorney was the SEC general \n     counsel at the time commission cleared him of wrongdoing in \n     the stock sale. The attorney, James Doty, says he reused \n     himself.\n       The demands of the war against terrorism also will \n     discourage a political firefight over the sale. But even so, \n     the disclosures were still creating awkward moments for Bush \n     as he prepared to call for greater corporate responsibility.\n       Actually, the focus on Bush's behavior 12 years ago may \n     frame the wrong debate. It's likely that the dominant \n     argument in Washington will be over whether it's credible for \n     Bush to demand better corporate behavior while facing these \n     personal questions. The more relevant issue is whether it's \n     credible for Bush to threaten a crackdown now after his \n     administration spent its frist 18 months promising business \n     kinder and gentler enforcement of the range of federal laws \n     against corporate misconduct--from the environment to the \n     stock markets to the workplace.\n       In other words, can Bush plausibly shake the iron fist \n     after stroking the Fortune 500 for so long with a velvet \n     glove?\n\n\n                           business as usual\n\n       For all the nouvelle elements of Bush's thinking on social \n     issues such as education or home ownership, he's always been \n     a conventional conservative on government oversight of \n     business. As governor of Texas, presidential candidate and \n     president, Bush has focused more on intrusive government than \n     irresponsible corporations.\n       His consistent message has been that, in pursuing its goals \n     and enforcing its laws, government should be more cooperative \n     and less coercive. During the 2000 campaign, he crystallized \n     his view on government's relationship with business when he \n     insisted: ``I do not believe you can sue you way or regulate \n     your way to clean air and clean water.''\n       Bush has put flesh on that philosophy by staffing many \n     federal agencies with alumni of the industries they now \n     regulate. The Interior Department is crowded with former \n     lobbyists for the coal and oil industries. A former timber \n     lobbyist is watching the national forests Harvey L. Pitt, the \n     SEC chairman, came from the accounting industry; Bush already \n     has appointed another accounting industry alum to the five-\n     member commission and nominated yet a third. (That means Bush \n     is seeking to construct an SEC, for the first time, with a \n     majority of commissioners tied to accounting.)\n       To monitor safety in the workplace, Bush found an executive \n     from the chemical industry. To monitor safety in the mines, \n     he appointed an executive from the mining industry. The list \n     goes on.\n       In chorus, Bush's appointees have sung the same tune. At \n     her confirmation hearing last year, Environmental Protection \n     Agency Administrator Christie Whitman promised more \n     negotiation and less litigation against recalcitrant \n     companies. ``Instilling fear does not solve problems,'' she \n     insisted.\n       Over at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, \n     director John Henshaw as late as last month told a business \n     audience: ``Hopefully we can put the days of OSHA as an \n     adversary behind us.''\n       And before Enron and WorldCom and Martha Stewart forced the \n     SEC chair to try to morph into Harvey Pitt-bull, he was \n     sending the same message, telling the accounting industry \n     last fall that he viewed them as the agency's ``partner'' and \n     pledging ``a new era of respect and cooperation'' after the \n     confrontations of the Clinton years.\n       Partnership with industry has its place. But enforcing \n     federal law to police the market place isn't it. No cop \n     anywhere would agree with Whitman; they instead would argue \n     that the best way to discourage drug dealing or street crime \n     is to instill fear--of relentless enforcement. The same is \n     true in the boardroom. Polluters or stock swindlers are more \n     likely to stop because they fear being caught than because \n     Washington asks them nicely.\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Here is the first paragraph:\n\n       It's easy to imagine the frenzy that would be engulfing \n     Washington if it was President Clinton now revising his \n     explanation of a controversial 12-year-old stock deal. Rush \n     Limbaugh would be reacting in outrage. Robert Bork would be \n     decrying the loss of moral authority in the Oval Office. [One \n     of our Senators] would be demanding a special prosecutor. \n     Congressional committees would be subpoenaing the president's \n     old business partners.\n\n  This is a whole lot more important than trying to find political \nadvantage in a particularly difficult debate and a difficult time in \nthis economic recovery. This is about the economy.\n  As a nation, we are trying to come out of a recession. There is a \nfair amount of financial data which suggests we are heading in the \nright direction. The number of people being laid off is slowing. \nManufacturing activity is increasing. Even economic activity among some \nof the most hard-hit sectors of the economy, technology sectors, is \nshowing signs of life. I am encouraged by that.\n  If you look at the stock exchange for much of the last several weeks \nand months, it does not really reflect the returning, emerging vibrancy \nin the rest of the economy. That is not a good thing.\n  One of the reasons why it is so important for us to pass this \nlegislation is to send a clear signal to investors not just around the \ncountry, but around the world that the United States is a good place in \nwhich to invest. Our trade deficit last year was about $300 billion. \nThis year it is going to be even more than $300 billion.\n  We are starting to see the value of American currency, the dollar, \nwhich was robust and strong for the last several years, deteriorate. \nThe worst thing that could happen for us, at a time when we need to \nattract foreign investments, would be to send a message that the United \nStates is not a good or safe place in which to invest. When we are \nlooking to much of the rest of the world to help finance a trade \ndeficit of over $300 billion, it is important that we send a strong \nmessage throughout the world that the U.S. remains the best place in \nwhich to invest.\n  There are a number of provisions. I will not go through this bill \nprovision by provision. I want to talk about some of the groups that \nhave the greatest interest, the most at stake, what our obligation is \nto them, and how this legislation seeks to make sure that we not only \nrecognize that obligation but that we act on it.\n  Shareholders of companies, publicly traded companies, should have \nconfidence. They should have confidence not only in the CEOs and top \nofficials, but they should have confidence in the board of directors \nwhose job it is to represent the interest of the shareholders and to \nknow that that board is indeed independent. Shareholders should have \nconfidence in the audit committees of the board. Investors should know \nthat the audit committees of the board are comprised of independent-\nminded board members, knowledgeable board members who will act, not as \na lap dog, but as a watchdog every day as they serve on the audit \ncommittee.\n  Shareholders should have confidence that there are rigorous auditing \nstandards that exist in this country and not that there are rigorous \nauditing standards that are on a piece of paper somewhere, but there is \na strong, independent, knowledgeable entity that is going to make sure \nthat those auditing standards are enforced.\n\n  How about the auditors of publicly traded companies? We should take \naway from them the temptation to look the other way or give the benefit \nof the doubt to a company that they are auditing because of the \ntemptation from some other part of the auditing company which deals \nwith consulting services; in many cases, these are lucrative services. \nWe want to make sure the folks doing the audits of publicly traded \ncompanies are interested in doing a good job because that is their \nresponsibility. Auditors should not be interested in cutting corners, \nlooking the other way because doing so might enable their accounting \ncompany to attract and to retain lucrative consulting services.\n  This bill goes a long way--some would say too far--toward curtailing \nthat activity. To me, it strikes the right balance.\n  Most of us know of someone who used to work for one of the big eight, \nthen big five, now the big four accounting firms who actually went to \nwork for one of the companies that they audited. I do. I suspect all of \nus could think of someone who has made that transition in their lives. \nThere is nothing wrong with that. However, the revolving door can be \nmore troublesome when the person moves from the auditing company one \nday, the company responsible for doing the audit, and the next day, the \nnext week, the next month ends up as a senior official of the company \nthat last week, last month they were auditing.\n  This measure doesn't completely stop that revolving door, but it \nslows it down.\n  Another area that this bill tries to address is the question: How \noften is it appropriate to have a fresh set of eyes in charge of those \nindependent auditors doing that independent audit of a publicly traded \ncompany? Under current standards every 7 years we say that the lead \npartner of an audit should be changed. This measure takes it down to 5 \nyears. Not everyone agrees with\n\n[[Page S6695]]\n\nthat. Some would like to have a change in auditing companies, requiring \nauditing companies to rotate every 5 or 7 years. I don't think that is \na good idea. I do believe the approach we take in this measure, moving \nfrom 7 to 5 years the period of time after which the lead auditor, the \nlead partner has to be changed, is sound.\n  How about investors? I talked about shareholders, about the auditors \nthemselves. How about investors? The investors in this country and \nother countries need to be comforted by the knowledge that when they \nhear an analyst on television or read of an analyst's recommendation of \na particular stock or stocks, when an analyst says buy, they mean buy. \nWhen an analyst says sell, they mean sell. When an analyst says hold, \nthey mean hold.\n  Investors have the right to know that the analysts whose advice they \nare following or attempting to follow are not being pressured to color \ntheir recommendations of a buy, sell, or hold by what is happening on \nthe investment banking side of the business, and to know that the \nanalyst's compensation is going to be derived more from how well the \nanalyst does his job, providing good analysis and investment advice, \nand not about how much new business that analyst can help bring to the \ninvestment banking side of their company.\n  How about the CEOs and senior management? When they break the law, \nthey should be fully prosecuted under the law, and if what they have \ndone is an offense for which they can be imprisoned, they ought to be. \nOur job in the Congress is to pass laws and to say what the crime or \npenalty should be when people violate those laws.\n  It is the job of the Justice Department to fully prosecute--with the \nhelp of the SEC and the other watchdog agencies--people who violate the \nlaws. Senator Leahy, on behalf of a number of Senators, earlier this \nweek--yesterday, I believe--offered legislation that provides a new law \nthat says not only can we prosecute some of the corporate wrongdoers--I \nam tempted to call them criminals, but I won't--who violate the trust, \nand to not only say you have to go after them under the mail and fraud \nprovisions of the criminal code, but to broaden that--which is \nsometimes difficult to do--and make the prosecutions more easily done \nand with very tough penalties under another part of the code.\n  CEOs should not be allowed to profit from financial misinformation or \nfrom manipulation of their books. I commend the President and those who \nhave worked on this legislation to say, to the extent that this does \nhappen--a CEO or senior official benefits financially from tampering or \ncooking the books--they would be compelled to give that money back.\n  I mentioned earlier the legislation offered by Senator Carnahan of \nMissouri which would actually make sure there is a disclosure of sale \nwhen a CEO or senior official sells their stock; that the transaction \nwould not only have to be reported to the SEC, but disclosed \nelectronically.\n  Another provision in the bill that I think is especially good and \ntimely, given what has gone on at WorldCom, where apparently a senior \nofficial of that company received a $360 million loan from the \ncompany--a loan which I don't believe the shareholders ever knew \nabout--at least when they found out about it, it was too late for a lot \nof them. That kind of information should be fully disclosed promptly \nand through a medium that allows those who have some need to know--\ninvestors and shareholders--to have that information in a timely way.\n  Finally, a word about the employees who work for some of these \ncompanies that have gone through, or are going through, a meltdown. \nThey need, I think, recourse when they are urged, on the one hand, by \nsenior officials to buy company stock for their 401(k) investment plans \nat the very time when senior officials are bailing out of the company \nstock. There should be some kind of recourse for employees when that \nhappens. In the belief of what is good for the goose is good for the \ngander, employees should never again face the situation that Enron \nemployees faced where, during a lockdown period of time, employees \ncould not sell their stock while senior officials were able to bail out \nand sell their stock. What is good for the goose is good for the \ngander. To the extent that employees in a lockdown period are not able \nto sell their company stock in their 401(k) plan, the senior officials \nof the company should not be able to enter into transactions involving \ntheir stock either.\n  There is one thing I don't believe we address in this bill; the \nothers I mentioned, we do. One area we do not address--and I suspect it \ncomes later--and a member of the staff will tell me if I am mistaken. \nOne of the problems we have with 401(k)s for the employees, the \ninvestors, is that they don't get very good advice. The companies don't \nwant to be held liable if they provide bad advice when all is said and \ndone. And when we move on to other issues, I hope we will have agreed \non a way to better ensure that the employees who are not getting very \ngood advice do get that good advice.\n\n  I worry about the concentration of assets and investments. I know \nsome people believe there should be a cap and that they should not be \nable to invest any more than half or a quarter in company stock for \nyour 401(k). If I am an employee and I am buying company stock, maybe I \nshould have to sign a form that is an acknowledgment that I am about to \ndo something very stupid--something similar to what the employees did \nat Enron, where they put all their eggs in one basket--and acknowledge \nthat is not a bright thing to do, and acknowledge that I am doing that \nunwise thing myself. Maybe that is needed here. In addition to that \nkind of disclosure, I think we do need to address the need for better \nadvice for employees.\n  I will go back to where I started; that is to say, a lot is riding on \nthis legislation--a whole lot more than we would have guessed 6 months \nago. Six months ago, as we saw Enron melt down and the disclosures come \nforward, we thought it was one company that was poorly run, maybe \nfraudulently run. A lot of people were hurt who worked at that company. \nA lot of people who worked for the auditor, the accounting firm, Arthur \nAndersen, have lost their jobs and were, frankly, fully innocent, but \nthey have been harmed. Six months ago, there was a full sense of \noutrage at Enron and the people who led it to its fall.\n  We know now that what happened at Enron may not be precisely the same \nas other companies, but it is symptomatic of the behavior in other \ncompanies, where the people who run those companies do not meet their \nobligations to the shareholders, to the employees, and where greed has \ncorrupted too many people. While it is difficult for us to pass a law \noutlawing greed, we can try to outlaw fraud. But it is tough to do \nthat; I acknowledge that.\n  With the developments within a whole host of other companies--\ndisclosures of financial mismanagement and misstatements, \nmisrepresentation of performance of other companies in recent months--\nthe importance of what we are doing this week and next has grown. We \nneed to get this economy moving in the right direction. I believe that, \nunderneath, a lot of the fundamentals are pretty sound. If you look at \ngrowth, and productivity, and the manufacturing activity to which I \nalluded earlier, there is some good news. The troubling news is what is \ngoing on in the stock market, as investors are skittish, and that is \nunderstandable.\n  We can begin to restore, in a very meaningful and tangible way, the \nconfidence of those investors in America and in American companies, and \nwe ought to do that.\n  The last word I will say is this. I commend Chairman Sarbanes. He is \nnot presently on the floor. I also commend the committee staff and \npersonal staffs for the kinds of hearings that have been held this year \nwhich have led us to this day. Chairman Sarbanes is not the sort of \nperson who is interested in rushing out and being on television every \nnight. He is not interested so much in seeing his name or picture in \nthe newspaper. He is interested in getting at the truth. I think the \nhearings that were held over many months have led us to finding the \ntruth and, maybe just as important, to finding the right course for us \nto take as a nation, to be able to right some of the wrongs that have \nbeen done and to reduce the likelihood that further wrongs will occur \nin the future.\n  I know some have been impatient for us to get to this day and to take \nup\n\n[[Page S6696]]\n\nthis legislation, pass it, and to send it to the President. I think it \nhas been worth the wait. I acknowledge that not everything that needs \nto be done ought to be done by the Congress. The stock exchanges have \nmade a number of excellent changes, and they are to be commended. Many \ncompanies and many corporate boards, that have sort of been tarred with \nthe same brush, and senior officials and CEOs who are doing a good job \nin acting and behaving in a most important way, have been tarred and \nfeathered with the same brush.\n  A lot of companies have said, themselves, they have taken a look in \nthe mirror--boards of directors, audit committees, and others--and \nsaid: We can do better. And they have adopted reforms. Shareholders--\nmarket forces--have come to bear on companies, their boards of \ndirectors, as they should, and that is helpful as well.\n  In the end, there are some things the Congress can do and ought to \ndo, maybe not all of them, but a lot of them are included in this \nlegislation before us. I am proud to have participated as a member of \nthe Banking Committee in its development and proud to be a witness to \nthe work that is going on in this Chamber to make a good bill even \nbetter. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, in a moment I am going to ask unanimous \nconsent that the pending amendment be set aside and that I be allowed \nto call up amendment No. 4283. This amendment relates to stock options. \nThe amendment is one line. It says that the standard-setting body for \naccounting principles that is set up in this bill shall review the \naccounting treatment of employee stock options--just review it--and \nshall within a year of enactment of this act adopt an appropriate \ngenerally accepted accounting principle for the treatment of employee \nstock options. They shall review it within a year and adopt an \nappropriate standard.\n  There has been a huge amount of debate about stock options. Recently \nthe Republican Senate staff of the Joint Economic Committee issued a \nreport about ``Understanding the Stock Option Debate.'' In that report, \nit concluded that, ``Basic principles of financial accounting imply \nthat stock option awards should be treated as a cost in corporate \nfinancial statements, and this cost should be recognized at the time of \ngrant.''\n  We have a Republican Senate staff report which, after reviewing all \nof the pros and cons, concludes that stock option awards should be \ntreated as costs in financial statements. It is a very strong document. \nIt is an analysis that I recommend to people to read.\n  Our amendment, however, does not do that. Our amendment, which is an \namendment I am offering on behalf of myself, Senator McCain, and \nSenator Corzine, simply says that the board we are funding in this bill \nshould review the accounting treatment of employee stock options and \nadopt an appropriate standard.\n  How anybody can be opposed to the proper accounting board doing a \nreview and coming up with an appropriate standard is something beyond \nmy understanding. I can understand the arguments, the pros and the \ncons. I have been through them for 10 years. I have argued that we \nought to treat stock options like any other form of compensation, and I \nbelieve we should. But I do not set accounting standards. That is not \nmy job. That is the job of this newly independent board to set \naccounting standards, and we should urge them to take a look at this. \nThis is where this matter should be referred and at a minimum, Madam \nPresident, I ought to be allowed to get a vote on this amendment.\n\n  This is a germane amendment. We are in a postcloture situation, and I \ndo not know of a time--there may be; I have not been around here as \nlong as some--but I do not know of a time when a germane amendment \npostcloture has not been permitted to go to a vote.\n  Apparently, that is what is going to happen, from what I hear. I hope \nit is not true, and I do not want to be unfair to my good friend from \nPennsylvania. He may not object. But I think it is a misuse of our \nrules now I am going to get to a process issue--to not permit a germane \namendment postcloture to be voted on. And this amendment is germane.\n  On the stock option issue, we have everyone from Alan Greenspan to \neconomists. Let me read the list of some of the people who support a \nchange in stock option accounting: Alan Greenspan; Paul Volcker; Arthur \nLevitt; Warren Buffett; TIAA-CREF, one of the largest pension funds in \nthe United States for teachers; several economists; Paul O'Neill; \nStandard & Poors; Council for Institutional Investors; Citizens for Tax \nJustice; Consumer Federation of America; Consumers Union; AFL-CIO; on \nand on. They believe that stock options are a form of compensation, \nthey have value, and they should be part of the expenses on the books \nof a corporation just as they are taken as a tax deduction at this \npoint.\n  One of the driving factors in the corporate abuses that we have seen \nare the huge gobs of stock options which have been handed out to \nexecutives. Then executives push accounting principles beyond any \ncomprehension to raise the value of the stock and then exercise their \noptions and sell the stock. We have seen this situation repeated in \ncorporation after corporation, and I believe we ought to try to put an \nend to it, but that is not what this amendment does. This amendment \nsimply says: We are creating a newly independent board. This \nindependent board should decide on what the appropriate standard is. \nThat is why we are providing independent funding for it.\n  I want to read a part of a Washington Post editorial of April 18, \n2002:\n\n       Alan Greenspan, perhaps the nation's most revered \n     economist, thinks employee stock options should be counted, \n     like salaries, as a company expense. Warren Buffett, perhaps \n     the nation's foremost investor, has long argued the same \n     line.\n\n  Skipping down:\n\n       The London-based International Accounting Standards Board \n     recently recommended the same approach. In short, a rather \n     unshort list of experts endorses the common-sense idea that, \n     whether you get paid in cash or company cars or options, the \n     expense should be recorded. . . .\n  Why does this matter? Because the current rules--which allow \ncompanies to grant executives and other employees millions of dollars \nin stock options without recording a dime of expenses--make a mockery \nof corporate accounts. Companies that grant stock options lavishly can \nbe reporting large profits when the truth is that they are taking a \nlarge loss. In 2000, for example, Yahoo reported a profit of $71 \nmillion, but the real number after adjusting for the cost of employee \nstock options was a loss of $1.3 billion. Cisco reported $4.6 billion \nin profits; the real number was a $2.7 billion loss. By reporting make-\nbelieve profits, companies may have conned investors into bidding up \ntheir stock prices. This is one cause of the Internet bubble.\n\n  Then this editorial goes on:\n\n       But nobody wants to ban this form of compensation; the goal \n     is merely to have it counted as an expense.\n\n  Madam President, that is what most of the accounting profession, \neconomists, and business people, other than those executives who are \ntaking such huge amounts of stock options, want to do. This is what the \nAccounting Standards Board wanted to do in 1993, but then were beaten \ndown so badly that they had to come up with an alternative instead \ncalled disclosure.\n  Even when the accounting board decided to do that--which was not an \nindependent accounting board because it did not have an independent \nsource of financing, unlike this accounting board will have after we \nenact this bill--and now to read their report of 1994. The board issued \nan exposure draft called, ``Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,'' \nand they decided that stock option values should be expensed. Then they \nsaid the draft was extraordinarily controversial, and the board not \nonly expects but actively encourages debate on issues. Then they \npointed out in the FASB document that the controversy escalated \nthroughout the exposure process.\n  Then in paragraph 60 of their findings, the FASB board said the \nfollowing, that ``the debate on accounting for stock-based compensation \nunfortunately became so divisive that it threatened the board's future \nworking relationship with some of its constituents. The nature of the \ndebate threatened the future of accounting standards-setting in the \nprivate sector.''\n\n[[Page S6697]]\n\n  This is an extraordinary document and everybody should read it so \npeople understand the kind of pressure that not only that board was \nunder--hopefully, the newly independently funded board will not be \nunder--but the kind of pressure which exists in this Congress. We have, \nin essence, a new board, because it has an independent source of \nfunding. We ought to let that board reach an independent conclusion on \none of the most controversial, contentious issues we have before us.\n  This is a tremendous bill we are voting on. But it can be \nstrengthened. It is not a perfect bill, and from the point of view of \npure fairness and deliberation, this Senate should be allowed to vote \non a germane amendment postcloture.\n  I will read one additional paragraph from the FASB document report to \nset out the extent of the pressure which exists in this area and why it \nis so important there be a review of this whole matter by an \nindependent board.\n  In December 1994, the board said it decided that ``the extent of \nimprovement in financial reporting that was envisioned when this \nproject was added to its technical agenda was not attainable.''\n  Why was it not attainable, the FASB said? Because the ``deliberate, \nlogical consideration of issues that usually leads to improvement in \nfinancial reporting was no longer present.'' These are incredible \nwords. This is from the board that is supposed to set accounting \nstandards in this country. They wrote in their report that when their \nproposal to expense stock operations was issued, it was not attainable \nbecause the ``deliberate, logical consideration of issues that usually \nleads to the improvement in financial reporting was no longer \npresent.''\n  Why was it no longer present? Because the debate had become so \ndivisive, in their words, that it threatened the board's future working \nrelationship with some of its constituents.\n  The nature of the debate, they wrote, threatened the future of \naccounting standards-setting in the private sector.\n  Finally, the board, beaten down, threatened with extinction, said \nthis: ``The board chose a disclosure-based solution for stock-based \nemployee compensation to bring closure to a divisive debate on this \nissue, not because it believes the solution is the best way to improve \nfinancial accounting and reporting.''\n  That was in 1994. We have seen what has happened in terms of stock \noption abuses because this board, if it had proceeded in the way it \nthought best, would have gone out of existence.\n  This bill creates a newly independent board, a board that has an \nindependent source of revenue. This bill, it seems to me, is not \ncomplete, is not strong, unless we now say to this country that the \nnewly independent board should review this accounting standard and \nreach an appropriate conclusion.\n  This amendment, which is cosponsored by Senators McCain and Corzine, \ndoes not say what that conclusion is. It does not, unlike the McCain \namendment which was not allowed a vote yesterday, conclude that stock \noptions should be expensed. It does say we have an independently funded \nboard which should review this matter and reach the appropriate \nconclusion.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. REID. I am just curious. I am not sure I should get involved at \nthis stage because the Senator knows the subject so well, but this \nboard that is set up in this proposed law, they would not have \nauthority to do that on their own?\n  Mr. LEVIN. They would.\n  Mr. REID. Why do we need your amendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Because this Congress has been on record as saying what \nthe accounting standard should be. In the early 1990s we took a \nposition. This neutralizes that position. This says, the accounting \nboard is the right place. The Senate is on record by a vote of 88 to 9 \nas saying there should not be the expensing of stock options. What this \namendment says is that the board should decide. It should review this \nmatter. It takes a neutral position, thereby clearing the record as to \nwhat the position of this Senate is.\n  As of now, all we have on record is that stock options should not be \nexpensed. What this amendment would say is, you should review this and \nreach an appropriate standard.\n  Mr. REID. My question to the Senator was, If we did not have the \nSenator's amendment, would the board not have that authority anyway?\n  Mr. LEVIN. They could do it, but all that there would be on the \nrecord would be our last statement saying they should not expense. That \nsame kind of pressure we put on them would still be on the record, and \nI think that should not be the last statement this Senate should make \non this subject.\n  The last statement we ought to make on this subject is that the \naccounting board is the appropriate place to make that decision, not \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. REID. I still ask my friend for the third time, if we have no \nLevin amendment, it would seem to me this newly created board would \nstill have authority to do what the Senator is talking about.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Under the cloud we created in 1994. I would refer my \nfriend to the debate in this body back on May 3, 1994, where the Senate \nreached a conclusion that it is the sense of the Senate, that was \napproved by, again, a vote of 88 to 9 or something like that, that the \nFinancial Accounting Standards Board should not change the current \ngenerally accepted accounting treatment of stock options.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I asked the Senator to yield because I do want to \nunderscore that the legislation that is before us takes a major step in \ntrying to guarantee the independence of the Financial Accounting \nStandards Board in terms of how it provides for its funding, and that \nis a dramatic improvement of the situation because heretofore the \nstandard board had to seek voluntary funding. So the standards board \nended up going to the people for whom it was establishing the standards \nin order to get money to fund its operations. Well, when it came to the \ncrunch--and this issue was one such crunch as far as the Financial \nAccounting Standards Board was concerned--the people from whom they \nwere voluntarily getting the money said we are not going to give you \nany money. You are not going to be able to carry out your activities.\n  So we moved in this legislation because one of the things we require \nis that the issuers pay a mandatory fee. If you are an issuer, you are \nregistered with the SEC and you have to pay a fee. That goes into a \nfund and that fund pays for the budget of the Public Accounting \nOversight Board and the budget of the Financial Accounting Standards \nBoard, so they are assured a revenue source.\n  I urge people to stop and think about that because it is a very \nimportant step to ensuring the independence of both boards. But here we \nare talking about the Financial Accounting Standards Board, and the \ndramatic change from its previous situation.\n\n  So it really will have, at least on the budget side, the independence \nto go ahead and make these decisions as they choose to call them. The \nissue that becomes involved in all of this otherwise is the question, \nShould the Congress of the United States be itself actually \nestablishing accounting standards? Of course, as the Senator indicated, \nwhen an opinion was voiced on that a few years ago, it went in one \ndirection. And now people want the Congress to come along and express \nan opinion in another direction. I have some sympathy. Obviously, we \nhave seen things happen. Most people might have sympathy.\n  But we come back to the basic question, whether the Congress should \nbe doing this. We set up this accounting standards board so it could \nmake independent judgments. Unfortunately, there is no question about \nthe fact that previously the standards board was subjected to \ntremendous pressure which affected its ability to make an independent \njudgment. It got tremendous pressure from industry groups, pressure \nfrom Congress reflecting the pressure of industry groups, and of course \nthis exposure on its budget.\n  We have tried in the legislation to address this very basic question \nof making sure this board has its independence. That does not reach to \nthe specific issue the Senate is now addressing, but I wanted that on \nthe record. It is important that be understood.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to speak \nusing my own time for up to 2 minutes.\n\n[[Page S6698]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will conclude, but I need to reclaim the floor because \napparently all time otherwise is counted against my allotted time \npostcloture.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending amendment be set \naside and that I be allowed to call up the amendment I filed at the \ndesk relative to this subject which I understand has been ruled \ngermane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Reserving the right to object, I want to make a couple \nof points.\n  No. 1, the Senator from Michigan suggested that all amendments that \nare germane postcloture should be allowed to be offered. I wish that \nwere the case. I wish we had the opportunity to do that in all \nsituations, but that has not been the case in this Senate, or has not \nbeen necessarily the history of the Senate. There have been many \ninstances where germane amendments have not been allowed to be offered \npostcloture.\n  No. 2, I make a point and reiterate the point that the chairman of \nthe committee has made. The Senator from Michigan has made the point \nthat FASB has been compromised because it wanted to do things and it \nfelt constrained by the constituency which funds it. We have set up an \nindependent funding source for FASB now, and I think that would allow a \nlot more independence to be able to deal with these accounting issues, \nsuch as the way we treat stock options, in a way that allows an \nindependent judgment.\n  Finally, while we do have a sense of the Senate that is 8 years old \non this issue, the Congress has never directed FASB to study an issue \nof accounting. This is precedent setting. There is nothing in this bill \nthat directs FASB to do anything. It is an independent board. It sets \nup the accounting standards. I think there is no question that it will \nin all likelihood review this issue.\n  For the Congress to begun to weigh in--even 8 years ago, we did not \ndirect FASB to do this; we simply expressed our opinion. To direct FASB \nto do something would be a very bad precedent to set.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I see no reason that a vote should not be \npermitted on this amendment. That is what this objection leads to. I \nurge we come back on Monday, or whenever we do come back, and I will \nmake this motion again because this is a critical issue, that is not \naddressed in this bill, which is a big part of the lack of credibility \nwe have right now in our markets. It needs to be addressed in some way. \nThis is a neutral way to do it.\n  The arguments given by our friend from Pennsylvania are reasons to \nvote no on an amendment. They are not reasons to prevent an amendment \nfrom being called up and being offered.\n  I will say again, I don't know where an amendment that is ready to be \noffered is not permitted to be offered because postcloture one side of \nthe aisle has decided it is going to leave a first-and second-degree \namendment standing out there without a vote in order to prevent other \ngermane amendments from being voted on. I don't think that has ever \nhappened. Obviously, we have reached the end of the 30 hours at times \nand there are still germane amendments that are pending. But this is \nnot that situation.\n  There is no further debate on the Carnahan amendment that I know of. \nWhy not vote on the Carnahan amendment? There is no further debate--or \nif there is, let the debate take place so that other people can offer \ntheir germane amendments. That is being precluded here. I believe it is \na misuse of postcloture rules to do that.\n  That being the situation, I will be offering a unanimous consent at \nthis time that my amendment be made in order at 2 p.m. on Monday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I object.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair, and I will make a unanimous consent \nrequest again on Monday that we be allowed to offer germane amendments \nin the time that remains on Monday and that we not be precluded by a \nblocking action which, it seems to me, is a distortion and a misuse of \nthe postcloture rules which are intended to allow 30 hours to consider \ngermane amendments. If that 30 hours is being used up and either being \nsworn off or not used, it seems to me that then precludes consideration \nof highly relevant--indeed, germane--amendments which are important to \nstrengthening this bill.\n  I thank the sponsors of this bill. It is a strong bill. There is no \nreason we should not be able to vote on a way to make it stronger.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate the chance to speak about the \nPublic Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act. I would \nlike to strengthen section 302 of this legislation which is entitled, \n``Corporate Responsibility For Financial Reports.''\n  I have discussed several ideas with Senator Sarbanes and greatly \nappreciate his leadership on this legislation. He has been tireless in \nhis efforts to strengthen corporate accountability and protect the \nAmerican investing public.\n  My first area of concern involves companies that have chosen to move \ntheir headquarters overseas. This legislation requires that CEOs and \nCFOs sign a statement saying that the financial documents they have \nfiled are fair and accurate. This is consistent with an order just \nissued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, that requires \nCEOs and CFOs to attest to the accuracy of their company's most recent \nfinancial statement.\n  But there is a glaring omission to this recent SEC order. Only \ncompanies that are U.S.-based would be required to send in these signed \ndocuments. If a company once based in the U.S. has fled our shores and \ngone overseas for tax reasons, they now just received a reward for \nleaving our Nation. Those CEOs and CFOs would not have to sign \nfinancial documents and attest to their accuracy.\n  The SEC has also overlooked the accuracy of future financial \ndocuments by non-U.S.-based companies. Under a proposed rule, that is \nin the ``open comment period,'' foreign based companies are again \nenjoying a lesser standard of accountability. This is wrong, and unfair \nto American companies.\n  In the proposed rule, the SEC does invite comments on how to cover \noverseas-based companies. However, this could be a case of ``too little \ntoo late.'' If companies are being publically traded in the United \nStates, regardless of where their headquarters are located, they ought \nto be required to meet the same level of accountability that we are \nestablishing for everyone else in this legislation.\n  Let's not give U.S.-based companies one more reason to leave our \nNation and incorporate someplace else. We need to hold all companies in \nour markets to the same high standard--there should be no reward of a \nlower standard if your company leaves the U.S. for a new overseas \nheadquarters.\n  My staff placed a call to the SEC to uncover the reason why foreign \nbased companies were excluded from their recent order. To the credit of \nthe SEC, they wanted to act quickly. They thought that the quickest way \nto promulgate this order was to cover only U.S. based companies. \nHowever, in doing this quickly, they ended up sending the wrong \nmessage. U.S. based CEOs and CFOs are ``on the hook'' in signed \nstatements. Foreign-based CEOs and CFOs, simply put, are not.\n  Senator Dorgan and I want to change this. We want it to be clear in \nthe statute that no matter where your company is based, you must comply \nwith this obligation. Senator Dorgan has filed an amendment to correct \nthis, amendment No. 4125.\n  I appreciate the consideration that the floor managers, Senator \nSarbanes and Senator Gramm, have given our amendment and I encourage \nall my colleagues to support us in this effort. I look forward to \nseeing it in the final legislation.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \ntake swift and decisive action to stem the tide of corporate greed that \nis eroding the integrity of America's capital markets. I am a strong \nbeliever in the free\n\n[[Page S6699]]\n\nenterprise system, and I am proud of America's leadership in creating \ntremendous economic opportunity for all investors, big or small, \ndomestic or foreign. However, it is time that Congress curb the \nappalling corporate excesses and misinformation that have hurt \ninvestors, employees and taxpayers. Passage of the Public Company \nAccounting Reform and Investor Protection Act is a critical step in \naddressing these concerns.\n  It is tempting to blame the problems corporate America is facing on \njust a few bad actors. For the most part, America's business men and \nwomen are industrious, innovative, and honest people who work hard to \nbuild our economy and provide jobs for our communities. However, we \nsimply cannot ignore the shocking number and size of failed or failing \ncompanies, the marked increase in earnings restatements, and the \nprofound toll this has taken on hard-working Americans. In fact, state \npension funds have plummeted more than $1 billion from the WorldCom \nrestatement and billions more from other companies involved in the \nscandals.\n  In light of these inexcusable revelations, it is hard to believe that \nthese problems are just isolated instances. Almost daily discoveries of \naccounting irregularities at some of America's largest and most highly \nrespected companies, such as Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, and Xerox, to name \njust a few, clearly demonstrate the need for systemic accounting and \ncorporate governance reform. Just recently, in fact, the Wall Street \nJournal reported that the drug company Merck may have understated \nrevenue by over $12 billion.\n  We must address systemic problems that are undermining the efficiency \nand transparency of our free market system, and which are eroding the \nfaith of everyday Americans in the fundamental fairness of American \nbusiness practices. We must clean up the current corporate culture that \nrewards misleading financial reporting and lax or corrupt corporate \ngovernance. We need strong legislation that will end the conflicts of \ninterest and lack of disclosure that have misled investors and shaken \ntheir faith in America's financial markets. And we need to ensure that \nthe SEC has the tools and money it needs to become a strong and \nformidable enforcer of securities laws. A kinder and gentler SEC serves \nonly those corporate executives who have something to hide.\n  The Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act \naddresses these problems in a way that limits regulatory burden but \nprovides affirmative measures to restore the integrity of our free \nmarket system. I support the bill's creation of a strong Public Company \nAccounting Oversight Board and restrictions on non-audit services \naccounting firms can provide to public company audit clients. Further, \nthe bill imposes tough new corporate responsibility standards and \nimplements controls over stock analyst conflicts of interest. Also, the \nbill requires public companies to quickly and accurately disclose \nfinancial information, so that high-level executives don't have a head \nstart over small investors in bailing out when a company is in trouble. \nFinally, the bill ensures that the SEC has the resources to accomplish \nits mission of regulating the securities markets.\n  On this last point, I was disappointed that President Bush's budget \ndid not include money that the Banking Committee authorized last year \nthat would have strengthened the SEC. The SEC has long been hobbled by \nits inability to compete for top-notch employees because of a pay scale \nthat was out of line with other financial regulators. Late last year, \nCongress passed, and the President signed, H.R. 1088, which provided \npay parity for SEC employees. Unfortunately, the President's budget did \nnot allocate additional funds, making it difficult if not impossible \nfor the SEC to carry out its enforcement mission. I am pleased that \nPresident Bush is now calling for additional funding for the SEC, which \nshould be better able to police public companies with adequate \nresources.\n  Without the threat of real consequences, however, dishonest corporate \nexecutives have little to fear from being caught with their hands in \nthe cookie jar. For this reason, Congress must implement a plan to hold \nirresponsible corporate executives responsible for their actions. We \nmust not allow these criminals to hide behind the corporate veil, while \nstealing millions of dollars from hard-working Americans. In that vein, \nI support provisions contained in the Corporate and Criminal Fraud \nAccountability Act, sponsored by Senator Leahy. The bill would provide \nstronger criminal penalties for corporate managers who defraud \ninvestors of publicly traded securities, criminal prosecution of \npersons who alter or destroy documents related to investigations, and \nprotection for corporate whistleblowers against retaliation by their \nemployers, among other provisions designed to protect investors from \ncorporate greed.\n  Finally, I believe that we should take a strong stance against \nanother form of corporate greed: corporations that profit from American \nconsumers, yet intentionally dodge U.S. taxes by moving their \nheadquarters abroad. It is outrageous that these so-called ``American'' \ncompanies take advantage of the benefits of operating in this country \nand yet shirk even the most basic responsibilities of corporate \ncitizenship. That's why I strongly support the Tax Shelter Transparency \nAct, sponsored by Senator Baucus, which would close the loopholes that \nallow corporate executives to use evasive accounting tactics to enrich \nthemselves on the backs of American taxpayers.\n  Before I close, I would like to thank Chairman Sarbanes for his \nleadership on this important issue. I also want to thank the Chairman \nas well as the Banking Committee staff for conducting a series of ten \ninclusive and comprehensive hearings on the issues addressed in his \nbill. The content of those hearings provided a conceptual foundation \nfor our subsequent discussions of Senator Sarbanes' bill and a previous \nbill proposed by Senators Dodd and Corzine. In addition, our work has \nbeen enhanced by the fine contributions of Senator Enzi, who is the \nSenate's only Certified Public Accountant. The deliberative process \nused to develop this legislation has led to an appropriate, thoughtful, \nbipartisan bill that makes great strides in addressing the problems in \nour financial markets and restoring investor confidence.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to voice my strong support \nfor S. 2673, the Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor \nProtection Act. This legislation will bring accountability to our \ncorporate boardrooms and end the accounting abuses that threaten to \nundermine the free enterprise system.\n  The hallmark of our economic system is free, fair, and open \ncompetition. The system rewards innovation, efficiently, and hard work. \nIt allows individuals to take an idea, a dream, or an invention; build \na business around it; and turn it into a livelihood. Some of our \ngreatest corporations today started with just one idea.\n  The recent revelations from Wall Street have thrown much of this in \ndoubt. For the Enrons, and WorldComs of the world, success was based on \nhiding losses, misstating earnings, destroying documents, and getting \ncozy with their so-called ``independent'' auditors and the stock \nanalysis who are supposed to give the stock buying public objective \ninformation. Instead of winning through open competition, these \ncompanies and others won through accounting sleight-of-hand.\n  The price of this deception has been too high. While much has been \nmade in the media about how far the Dow, the NASDAQ, and the S & P 500 \nhave fallen on Wall Street, the real pain is being felt on Main \nStreet--in retirement plans, pensions, and the investment portfolios of \nhard working people in our country. The pain is being felt by the very \nwealthy and people with modest means. Fortunately no Louisiana-based \ncorporation has been caught up in this mess and hopefully that will \nremain the case, but many Louisiana investors were not so lucky.\n  Many have said that all of these problems have been caused by a few \nbad apples. But when we hear about corporations hiding losses, creating \noff-book partnerships, insider trading, and inside loans to corporate \nofficers, it means that something may be wrong with the whole tree: the \ntree is rotten because of loopholes in regulations and limited \noversight.\n  My State of Louisiana is home to a large number of small businesses--\n94,000 of the employer businesses in my state employ fewer than 500 \npeople--\n\n[[Page S6700]]\n\nand they employ about 54 percent of the state's workforce. This does \nnot include the estimated 135,000 self-employed people in my state. I \nfind myself wondering what small business owners think of all of the \nnews reports about these big, sophisticated corporations and their \ncrooked accounting?\n  Small business owners work hard to keep clean books. They do not have \na team of creative accountants that turn losses into gains. The small \nbusiness does not create sham, off-book partnerships to hide losses. I \nhave never heard of a small business being forced to restate its \nearnings. Small business grow by playing by the rules. Many small \nbusiness owners dream of taking the honest approach to turning their \nideas and dreams into big businesses. How disheartening must it be for \nthem to see that in the world of big corporate business the way to get \nahead is by cheating.\n  The bill before us today will help restore faith in the free market. \nIt creates a strong oversight board that will set auditing standards \nfor public companies backed up with the power to investigate abuses. It \ngets rid of the inherent conflict of interest faced by accounting firms \nthat provide management consulting services to their auditing clients. \nHere on the floor we have added tough criminal penalties to this bill \nand given greater protections to whistles blowers. The whistle blower \nprotections are an especially needed reform. We want the honest people \nin business to know that there is still a place for them.\n  We must take this opportunity to restore confidence in the free \nmarket. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation and I \nwant to commend the chairman of the Committee, Mr. Sarbanes, for \nbringing this legislation to the floor.\n\n\n                            Vote Explanation\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, due to a longstanding commitment I \nwas necessarily absent for the vote on cloture on the Public Company \nAccounting Reform and Investor Protection Act of 2002 (S. 2673). \nAlthough my vote would not have affected the outcome, had I been \npresent, I would have voted for cloture on the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/12/senate-section/article/S6700-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ANDEAN TRADE ACT\n\n  Mr. REID.

Reserving the right to object--and I will not object--\nthis is a very important piece of legislation for the continent of \nAfrica and has to do with AIDS relief, tuberculosis, and other \ninfectious diseases. There is a provision in this legislation that \nSenator Biden and I have offered on debt relief for Third World \ncountries. This is a vitally important piece of legislation that \ndovetails very well with the President's initiative in trying to stem \nthe scourge of AIDS in Africa and provide some hope for some of these \nheavily debt ridden countries.\n  I am very pleased we were able to do this in wrap-up today. I will \nnot object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4297) was agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4298) was agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 2069), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am very pleased that we have just \npassed a bill that will give the President and his team the tools they \nwill need to back up their words about fighting the scourge of HIV and \nAIDS with action.\n  The omnibus HIV, AIDS, TB, and malaria authorization bill vastly \nincreases our focus on treatment, giving hope to the millions of people \nalready infected with this virus. It intensifies our ongoing prevention \nefforts. And it makes a new commitment to training local health care \nworkers so that underdeveloped nations can create modern health \ninfrastructures.\n  The bill also authorizes nearly $5 billion over 2 years so that this \ncommitment is matched with the resources to get it done. But unless we \nwork in a bipartisan fashion to see that money appropriated, this bill \noffers little more\n\n[[Page S6701]]\n\nthan false hope. I want to commend Senators Kennedy, Kerry, Biden, \nHelms, Frist, and Gregg for their leadership on this vital effort. And \nI want to ask the House of Representatives to match the commitment the \nSenate has shown.\n  More than 20 million people have already died from HIV/AIDS. Last \nyear, 5 million people contracted the virus, more than half of these \nnew infections in young people. The UN estimates that 65 million more \npeople could die by 2020. These numbers are so horrible as to seem \nunreal. But they are real, and we must act. Nothing we can do here is \nthe solution--but today the Senate is taking a step, and a meaningful \none.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all I thank our majority leader \nfor his leadership in the development of this legislation, which is \ntrue bipartisan legislation. It is the United States Leadership on HIV/\nAIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act to deal with the AIDS pandemic that \nis most evident in the continent of Africa, and also expanding it \nthrough India, central Asia, China, and so many parts of the Third \nWorld.\n  I am grateful to him for his persistence in making sure that this \nlegislation would pass just a few moments ago. I thank him and I thank \nthe cooperation of our Republican leader as well, making sure the \nSenate would go on record, as it did a few moments ago, in favor of \nthis extremely important legislation.\n  At the outset I want to acknowledge the very strong leadership of my \nfriends and colleagues in this body who have been very much involved in \nshaping and helping develop this legislation: Senator Kerry, my \ncolleague from Massachusetts, who had introduced very similar \nlegislation with members of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senators \nBiden, Boxer, Daschle, DeWine, Dodd, Durbin, Feingold, Frist, Hagel, \nHelms, Leahy, Lugar, Santorum, Sarbanes, Smith of Oregon, and \nWellstone. This is truly not only bipartisan, but it is also a real \nreflection from all different philosophies, of the recognition that the \nUnited States has an important opportunity--in many respects, a \nresponsibility--to take action.\n  I am grateful to all those Members for their support of our \nlegislation. I also thank a number of our colleagues, Senators Edwards, \nFeinstein, Frist, Harkin, Jeffords, Mikulski, Murray, and Reed, who are \nstrong supporters of this program.\n  We, in America, know the pain and the loss that this disease cruelly \ninflicts. Millions of our fellow citizens--men, women, and children--\nare infected with HIV/AIDS, and far too many have lost their lives.\n\n  While we still seek a cure to AIDS, we have learned to help those \ninfected by the virus to lead long and productive lives through the \nmiracle of prescription drugs. But this disease knows no boundaries. It \ntravels across borders to infect innocent people in every continent \nacross the globe. We have an obligation to continue the fight against \nthis disease at home. But we should also share what we have learned to \nhelp those in other countries in this life-and-death battle. And we \nmust do all we can to provide new resources to help those who cannot \nafford today's therapies. We must carry the fight against AIDS to every \ncorner of the globe, and the legislation passed this afternoon is a \nstep in that direction.\n  The United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and \nMalaria Act of 2002 provides new legal authority and funding to our \nnation's strongest health care agencies to join the global battle \nagainst AIDS. It promotes models of community-based care that reach the \nreal people affected by this disease; better access to the research and \ntherapies needed to prevent transmission of this deadly disease; and \nmost importantly, funds research and treatment models to prevent \ntransmission of HIV/AIDS from mothers to their infants including the \nfamily support service necessary to stem the orphan crisis.\n  Governments can make the difference in battling this epidemic. When \ngovernments in poor countries have been provided resources to fight the \nspread of AIDS, infection rates have dropped 80 percent. With this \nlegislation, the United States will do its part to support countries to \nturn the corner on AIDS on their own.\n  I am pleased that the administration increased funding for the fight \nagainst the global AIDS epidemic, and together with this legislation, \nwe can truly lead the international community in the fight against the \ngreatest public health threat of our times.\n  I have a summary of the legislation that I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record. I think it will help people better \nunderstand the aspects of the legislation that can really not only make \nan immediate lifesaving difference to millions of our fellow human \nbeings in Africa but to those other Third World countries as well.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSummary of the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, \n                        and Malaria Act of 2002\n\n       The bill strikes all after the enacting clause of the \n     House-passed HIV/AIDS bill (HR. 2069) and inserts S. 2525 \n     (Kerry) and S. 2649 (Kennedy). Both bills have broad bi-\n     partisan support.\n       S. 2525 (Kerry) was co-sponsored by Senators Biden, Boxer, \n     Daschle, DeWine, Dodd, Durbin, Feingold, Frist, Hagel, Helms, \n     Leahy, Lugar, Santorum, Sarbanes, Smith (OR), and Wellstone. \n     S. 2649 (Kennedy) was co-sponsored by Senators Bingaman, \n     Clinton, Corzine, Daschle, DeWine, Dodd, Durbin, Edwards, \n     Feinstein, Frist, Harkin, Jeffords, Mikulski, Murray, Reed, \n     Santorum, and Sarbanes.\n       The S. 2525 portion of the bill would:\n       Mandate a comprehensive, integrated 5-year U.S. government \n     strategy for promoting goals and objectives of the June 2001 \n     UN General Assembly Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS;\n       Require the U.S. Agency for International Development \n     (USAID) to develop an ``empowerment of women'' plan, \n     including provision of currently available technologies to \n     prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS;\n       Create a new HIV/AIDS Response Coordinator in the \n     Department of State;\n       Create a new Health Care Provider Service and Training \n     Program enabling American health care professionals to \n     provide basic health care services and on-the-ground training \n     to African and other countries severely affected by HIV/AIDS, \n     tuberculosis and malaria; and\n       Require a comprehensive report on U.S. efforts to increase \n     access to treatment for people living with HIV/AIDS.\n       The bill would authorize more than $4.5 billion over two \n     years for U.S. efforts to fight global HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis \n     and malaria. Of this, $2.152 billion would be authorized in \n     FY 2003, including $1 billion for the Global Fund to Fight \n     HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and $2.521 billion \n     would be authorized in FY 2004, including $1.2 billion for \n     the global Fund.\n       The bill would require a new 5-year strategy to meet or \n     exceed the maternal-to-child transmission (MTCT) goals in the \n     UN Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS; create a new \n     Assistance to Children Program to provide care and treatment \n     to parents and/or care givers infected with HIV; and mandate \n     a comprehensive report on U.S. government MTCT and MTCT plus \n     programs.\n       The bill would authorize expansion of the Enhanced Heavily \n     Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative to achieve debt \n     reduction for health programs; expand the Department of \n     Defense's HIV/AIDS Prevention Education Program to include \n     countries beyond Africa and international peacekeepers; and \n     set forth an HIV/AIDS Code of Conduct for U.S. Businesses \n     Abroad.\n       Funding levels for this portion of the bill are summarized \n     in the attached chart.\n       The S. 2649 portion of the bill would: authorize $400 \n     million (in 2003) for the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention (CDC) and Health Resources Services Administration \n     (HRSA) to work in collaboration with USAID to carry out care, \n     treatment, and capacity building for HIV/AIDS, malaria, and \n     tuberculosis in countries with, or at-risk for severe HIV/\n     AIDS epidemics.\n       The bill would authorize $50 million (in both 2003 and \n     2004) for grants for clinical education and training in the \n     delivery of HIV/AIDS care and treatment services; authorize \n     $45 million (in 2003) and $30 million (in 2004), out of \n     amounts authorized under Prevention and Treatment, for \n     public-private partnerships to prevent mother-to-child \n     transmission; provide for inter-agency coordination of global \n     HIV/AIDS initiatives under the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services (HHS); direct the HHS Secretary to write a strategic \n     plan to carry out and support microbicide research, develop \n     research teams through contacts with private and public \n     entities, and report to Congress on this initiative; and \n     authorize $10 million (in 2003) for the Department of Labor \n     for work-based prevention and education programs that protect \n     against discrimination, promote on-site wellness, and \n     strengthen collaboration among governmental, business, and \n     labor leaders.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this week marks the first anniversary of \nthe reorganization of the Senate Judiciary Committee following the \nchange in majority last year. This past year has been a busy one for \nour committee .\n  Just this week the Senate adopted as an amendment to the accounting \nreform and investor protection bill the text of S. 2010, the Corporate \nand Criminal Fraud Accountability Act. That is a bill we reported in \nMay after committee action in February and April. The Senate also acted \non important amendments offered by Senator Biden, Senator Hatch, and \nSenator Edwards to that bill and many members of this committee have \nmade important contributions to improve these measures over the last \nseveral months.\n  In the days and months following the terrorist attacks on September \n11, members of this committee led the Senate in its responses leading \nto enactment of the USA PATRIOT Act, the Enhanced Border Security and \nVisa Entry Reform Act, the Terrorist Bombings Convention Implementation \nAct, and the Mychal Judge Police and Fire Chaplains Public Safety \nOfficers' Benefit Act. The committee also reported a number of \nresolutions to honor the victims of those attacks with the Public \nSafety Medal of Valor and the Law Enforcement Tribute Act, S. 2431. We \ncontinue to work on important matters for victims of terrorism.\n  We have reported a number of other law enforcement related measures \nincluding the Drug Abuse Education, Prevention and Treatment Act, S. \n304; the Federal Judiciary Protection Act, S. 1099; the National Child \nProtection Improvement Act, S. 1868; the Safe Explosives Act, S. 1956; \nthe National Cyber Security Defense Team Authorization Act, S. 1989; a \nbill clarifying the definition of ``vehicle,'' S. 2621; and an annual \nauthorization for the Department of Justice, S. 1319 and its House \ncounterpart H.R. 2215. The committee reported the Local Law Enforcement \nEnhancement Act, S. 625, which is an important hate crimes bill; and \nthe COPS Reauthorization Act, S. 924, which extends the highly \nsuccessful COPS Program. We have also reported legislation on identity \ntheft, such as the Social Security Number Misuse Prevention Act, S. \n848, and the Restore Your Identity Act, S. 1742.\n  In addition, we have reported a number of measures to improve \ncompetitive business conditions and protect consumers, such as the Drug \nCompetition Act, S. 754; the Motor Vehicle Franchise Contract \nArbitration Fairness Act, S. 1140; and the Product Packaging Protection \nAct, S. 1233. We have acted on important intellectual property \nlegislation, such as the Madrid Protocol Implementation Act, S. 407; \nthe TEACH Act, S. 487; and the Patent and Trademark Office \nAuthorization Act, S. 1754, as well as related House measures H.R. 1866 \nand H.R. 1886.\n  We have reported and worked on a number of immigration matters, \nincluding the Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act, S. 864; the Child \nStatus Protection Act, S. 672, and its House counterpart, H.R. 1209; a \nbill for children of Vietnamese refugees, H.R. 1840; bills to provide \nwork authorization for spouses, H.R. 2277 and H.R. 2278; and others.\n  Among our most important work has been our aggressive oversight \nefforts involving the Department of Justice, the FBI, the INS, and the \nCivil Rights Division. Our oversight efforts have already led to the \ncommittee's reporting a bipartisan FBI Reform Act, S. 1974, which is \nawaiting Senate action.\n  This week the committee finally began its consideration of a most \nimportant legislative initiative we began years ago, the Innocence \nProtection Act, S. 486.\n  All in all, in our first year we reported 80 legislative matters and \nover 250 Presidential nominations to the Senate. We have held more than \n100 hearings during our first tumultuous year.\n  We have had a record year in considering this President's nominees. \nPartisans have perpetuated an untrue and unfortunate myth that the \nDemocratic-led Senate and Judiciary Committee have blocked the \nPresident's nominees. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  The Democratic-led Judiciary Committee has had a recordbreaking year \nfairly and promptly considering President Bush's nominees. In addition \nto the dozens of high-ranking Justice Department officials for whom we \nheld hearings, and our work in connection with more than 180 executive \nbranch nominees the committee reported, we have had a record year with \nrespect to judicial nominees.\n  In this, our first year, we held hearings for 78 of the President's \nnominees. That is more hearings for this President's district and \ncircuit court nominees than ever held in any of the 6\\1/2\\ years that \npreceded the change in majority last summer.\n  In particular, we held more hearings for more of President Bush's \ncircuit court nominees, 16, than in any of the 6\\1/2\\ years in which \nthe Republicans controlled the committee before the change in majority \nlast summer. For that matter, we held twice as many hearings for court \nof appeals nominees than were held in the first year of the Reagan \nadministration when the Senate was controlled by Republicans and five \ntimes more than in the first year of the Clinton administration when \nthe Senate was controlled by Democrats. Those are the facts.\n  Under Democratic leadership, this Committee in its first year also \nvoted on more judicial nominees, 74, than in any of the 6\\1/2\\ years of \nRepublican control that preceded the change in majority. We voted on \nalmost twice as many circuit court nominees, 15, than the Republican \nmajority averaged in the years they were in control. In fact, this last \nyear we voted on more nominees than were voted on in 1999 and 2000 \ncombined and on more circuit court nominees than the Republicans \nallowed during 1996 and 1997 combined. And the committee voted on an \nadditional court of appeals nominee yesterday.\n  We have achieved what we said we would by treating President Bush's \nnominees more fairly and more expeditiously than President Clinton's \nnominees were treated by Republicans. By many measures the Senate \nJudiciary Committee has achieved almost twice as much this last year as \nRepublicans averaged during their years in control.\n  The Senate has confirmed more circuit and district court judges, 57, \nthan were confirmed during 2000, 1999, 1997, 1996, and 1995, 5 of the \nprior 6 years of Republican control of the Senate. Republicans averaged \n38 confirmations a year. By contrast the Democratic Senate achieved 57 \njudicial confirmations in our first 10 months, before the \nAdministration's obstructionism stalled Senate floor actions on \nnominations for more than 2 months. There are another 17 judicial \nnominees on the Senate Executive Calendar. The delay in the votes on \nthese nominees has been due to the delay in the administration's \nfulfilling its responsibility to work with the Senate in the naming of \nmembers of bipartisan boards and commissions.\n\n[[Page S6703]]\n\n  I congratulate the majority leader for overcoming this impediment and \nfor his patience and determination in achieving some movement on these \nmatters. I understand that he hopes to be able to resume voting on \njudicial nominations as soon as next Monday. Had the administration not \ncaused this delay, I am confident that the Senate would have confirmed \nmore than 70 judicial nominations before the end of this week and far \noutdistanced any Republican total for any preceding year. Nonetheless, \nwe were able to overcome the other obstacles created by the \nadministration and proceed to confirm 57 circuit and district court \nnominees in our first 10 months in the majority, a record outpacing any \nRepublican total in any 10-month period in which they held the \nmajority.\n  We have also addressed longstanding vacancies on circuit courts \ncaused by Republican obstruction of President Clinton's judicial \nnominees. We held the first hearing for a Fifth Circuit nominee in 7 \nyears, the first hearings for Sixth Circuit nominees in almost 5 years, \nthe first hearing for a Tenth Circuit nominee in 6 years, and the first \nhearings for Fourth Circuit nominees in 3 years.\n  We have reformed the process for considering judicial nominees. For \nexample, we have ended the practice of anonymous holds that plagued the \nperiod of Republican control, when any Republican Senator could hold \nany nominee from his home State, his own circuit or any part of the \ncountry for any reason, or no reason, without any acknowledgment or \naccountability. We have returned to the Democratic tradition of holding \nregular hearings, every few weeks, rather than going for months without \na single hearing.\n  It would certainly have been easier and less work to retaliate for \nthe unfair treatment of the last President's judicial nominees. We did \nnot. We have been, and will continue to be, more fair than the \nRepublican majority was to President Clinton's judicial nominees. More \nthan 50 of Clinton's nominees never got a vote; many languished for \nmonths and years before they were returned without a hearing. Others \nwaited years--not just a year, but up to more than 4 years to be \nconfirmed. Some never were accorded a hearing, some were finally \nconfirmed after years of delay.\n  Those who now seek to pretend that the Democratic majority in the \nSenate caused a vacancy crisis in the Federal courts are ignoring the \nfacts. Under Republicans, court vacancies rose from 63 in January 1995 \nto 110 in July 2001, when the committee reorganized. During Republican \ncontrol before the reorganization of the committee, vacancies on the \ncourts of appeals more than doubled, increasing from 16 to 33. That is \nwhat we inherited. But in 1 year of Democratic control, and despite 45 \nadditional vacancies caused largely by the retirements of many past \nRepublican appointees, we have reduced the number of district and \ncircuit court vacancies.\n  Vacancies continue to exist on the court of appeals, in particular, \nbecause a Republican Senate majority was not willing to hold hearings \nor vote on more than half--56 percent--of President Clinton's circuit \nnominees in 1999 and 2000, and was not willing to confirm a single \ncircuit judge during the entire 1996 session. Republicans caused the \ncircuit vacancy crisis, and it has taken a tremendous effort to \nevaluate and have hearings for 16 circuit court nominees in less than a \nyear.\n  We are hard at work evaluating the records of the few remaining \nnominees who have not yet had hearings. While we have moved as quickly \nas possible to evaluate all of the nominees, the Senate is not, and \nshould not be, a rubber stamp. If this President is successful in \nfilling all of the vacancies he inherited due to Republican obstruction \nas well as the new vacancies that have arisen on the circuits, \nRepublican appointees will constitute the majority, and often a two-\nthirds majority, on 11 of the 13 appellate courts below the Supreme \nCourt. Such a takeover would affect the next 20 years of judicial \ndecisions coming from the courts of appeal.\n  The President and his advisers know this and, aside from the few \nrelatively moderate nominees we have been able to confirm quickly, they \nhave also chosen a number of people with records of judicial activism \nor out-of-mainstream ideology, including several young men in their \nthirties and early forties, for many of these lifetime appointments to \nthe federal bench. What the President and his advisers acknowledge they \nare doing is nominating ideologically conservative judicial nominees to \nstack the fifth, sixth, and DC Circuits with judicial activists of \ntheir choice. That is part two of the Republican strategy.\n  In part one, several Republicans in the Senate prevented many of \nthese vacancies from being filled in the first place, so that whatever \nbalance there might be, or might have been, on those courts is missing. \nThey kept off well qualified moderate nominees, not chosen because of \nany litmus test or ideology. They did so to provide a Republican \nPresident with the opportunity to load the bench, especially the \nappellate court bench, with right wingers.\n  Advice and consent does not mean giving the President carte blanche \nto pack the courts. The ingenious system of checks and balances in our \nConstitution does not give the power to make lifetime appointments to \none person alone, to remake the courts along narrow ideological lines, \nto pack the courts with judges whose views are outside of the \nmainstream, and whose decisions would further divide our Nation.\n  We have worked hard to balance these competing concerns over the past \nyear: how to address the vacancy crisis we inherited, while also not \nbeing a rubberstamp and abdicating our responsibilities to provide a \ndemocratic check on the President's choices for lifetime appointment to \nthe Federal courts. These are the only lifetime appointments in our \nsystem of government, and they matter a great deal to our future.\n  In 1801, when Thomas Jefferson, the first President who was not a \nmember of the Federalist Party was elected, he faced a similar \nsituation. The Federalists in Congress had passed, and the lame duck \nPresident Adams had signed, a bill creating a number of new seats on \nthe Federal courts. President Adams then appointed a number of \nFederalists who have been called ``midnight judges.'' One of the first \nthings President Jefferson did was to get that law repealed and to \nrefuse to sign the appointment papers of some of those judges. That is \npart of the story of the famous Supreme Court case, Marbury v. Madison.\n  Thus, it took only 12 years of our new Nation for an effort to pack \nthe courts to occur. It took the first transition in political parties \nfor one to give in to the temptation to try to stack the deck and \naffect the outcome of cases through the appointment of judges.\n  The best-known attempt to pack the courts occurred during the \nadministration of President Franklin Roosevelt. President Roosevelt's \nattempt to pack the Supreme Court with justices of his choosing, to get \nmore votes on the side of cases he wanted to win, was rejected by \nCongress and the American people.\n  If one thoroughly examines the types of nominees this President is \nsending us, one might conclude that we are facing another attempt to \npack the courts. The Senate Judiciary Committee is working very hard to \nanalyze all of President Bush's judicial nominees fairly, one by one. \nIn our first year, we have already had 21 hearings on 78 judicial \nnominees, including 16 circuit court nominees. We are planning another \nhearing for next week.\n  In the meantime, Republicans have been unfairly critical that not \nevery nominee has yet had a hearing or been confirmed. Some have \nasserted that there is some sort of ``honeymoon'' period for Presidents \nin getting confirmation of their first choices for the courts. Of \ncourse, the Constitution provides for no such abdication of \nresponsibility for a President's first few lifetime appointees or his \nlast. To support this extra-constitutional theory, Republicans assert \nthat the last three Presidents had a 100-percent confirmation rate of \ntheir first several circuit court nominees. When they say this, they \nconveniently leave a few details out. First, it took previous Senates \nmore than a year to confirm 11 circuit court nominees of past \nPresidents. We have only had a year and the Senate has already \nconfirmed nine of this President's circuit court nominees and five more \nare awaiting a vote by the full Senate.\n  President George W. Bush has said previously that he would choose \njudges\n\n[[Page S6704]]\n\nin the mold of two ideologically conservative activists, Justice Scalia \nand Justice Thomas. No judicial nominees should be rubber-stamped by \nthe Senate, not even a President's first few choices. All nominees for \nthese lifetime positions merit careful review by the Senate. When a \nPresident is using ideological criterion to select nominees, it is fair \nfor the Senate to consider it as well. Federalist Society credentials \nare not a substitute for fairness, moderation or judicial temperament. \nWhen a President is intent on packing the courts and stacking the deck \non outcomes, consideration of balance and how ideological and activist \nnominees will affect a court are valid considerations for Senators \nentrusted by the Constitution to evaluate these lifetime appointees.\n  The high dudgeon expressed by Republicans about the order in which we \nhave been considering this President's circuit court nominees is \nespecially unwarranted in light of the objectively unfair way they \ntreated President Clinton's circuit court nominees. Some of the \nvacancies we inherited date back to 1990, 1994 and 1996.\n  Partisans conveniently ignore the Republicans' terrible record of \nobstruction when they complain that a few of President Bush's nominees \nhave not yet had a hearing. Those nominees chosen without consultation \nwith both parties in the Senate and, in particular, those who do not \nhave home-State Senator support do not get hearings, according to \nlongstanding Senate tradition. Republicans have tried to measure our \nachievements by standards they never met but surely even they are not \nnow suggesting overriding the longstanding Senate tradition of consent \nor blue slips from both home-State Senators on which they themselves \ninsisted. Republicans averaged only seven confirmations a year for \nPresident Clinton's circuit court nominees. We confirmed nine in our \nfirst 10 months.\n  I have tried to work with the White House on judicial nominations. I \nhave gone out of my way to encourage them to work in a bipartisan way \nwith the Senate, like past Presidents, but in all too many instances \nthey have chosen to bypass bipartisanship. I have encouraged them to \ninclude the ABA in the process earlier, like past Presidents, but they \nhave refused to do so even though their decision adds to the length of \ntime nominations must be pending before the Senate before they can be \nconsidered.\n  This past January, I again called on the President to stop playing \npolitics with judicial nominations and act in a bipartisan manner. Just \nlast month I sent a detailed letter to the President on these issues. \nMy efforts to help the White House improve the judicial nominations \nprocess have been rejected. My most recent effort met with a \nperfunctory acknowledgment or receipt, which I will ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record at the end of my remarks. \nUnfortunately, this letter is about the most constructive response that \nI have received from the White House to my many efforts to improve the \nprocess and speed up the filling of judicial vacancies with qualified, \nfair-minded judges.\n  Republican statements on judicial nominees regularly rely on \nsuperficially appealing but misleading statistics to gloss over the \ntypes of nominees they are choosing for our Federal courts. For \nexample, they complain that Presidents Reagan, Bush and Clinton got 97, \n95 and 97 percent, respectively, of their first 100 judicial \nnominations confirmed. What they conveniently fail to mention is that \nit took 2 full years for President Reagan to have 89 of his judicial \nnominees confirmed, and well into year 3 to reach the 100 mark. \nSimilarly, the first President Bush had only 71 judicial nominees \nconfirmed after 2 full years, and it took well into year 3 to reach 100 \nconfirmations.\n  We are moving quickly, but responsibly, to fill judicial vacancies \nwith qualified nominees we hope will not be activists. In our first \nyear we confirmed 57 judges and reported 74 judicial nominees. \nPartisans ignore these facts. The facts are that we are reporting \nPresident Bush's nominees at a faster pace than the nominees of prior \nPresidents, including those who worked closely with a Senate majority \nof the same political party. We have accomplished all this during a \nperiod of tremendous tumult and crisis.\n  The Judiciary Committee noticed the first hearing on judicial \nnominations within 10 minutes of the reorganization of the Senate, and \nheld that hearing on the day after the committee was assigned new \nmembers. Yesterday was the 1-year anniversary of that first hearing for \nJudge Roger Gregory, who was initially nominated by President Clinton, \nbut like so many other judicial candidates, including other African-\nAmerican nominees to the Fourth Circuit, his nomination languished \nwithout a hearing by the Republican-controlled Senate. Because of this \nhistory of inaction on such nominees to that court, President Clinton \nmade a recess appointment to make Roger Gregory the first African-\nAmerican judge in history to sit on the Fourth Circuit, and he sent his \nnomination for a permanent position on that court back to the Senate at \nthe beginning of the 107th Congress. Unfortunately, President Bush \nwithdrew Judge Gregory's nomination in March of 2001, but he finally \nsent it back to us later that year. When the Senate Judiciary Committee \nheld the hearing on the nomination of Judge Roger Gregory to the Fourth \nCircuit last year, it was the first hearing on a Fourth Circuit nominee \nin 3 years, although five nominees to that court during that period \nwere never given hearings by Republicans.\n  Subsequent to that hearing, we held unprecedented hearings during the \nAugust recess last year and proceeded with a hearing 2 days after the 9 \n11 attacks and shortly after the anthrax attack. We will hold our 22nd \nhearing for judicial nominees next week. We are doing our best to \naddress the vacancy crisis we inherited.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee and the Democratic-led Senate has a \nrecord of achievement and of fairness to be proud of on this \nanniversary. I thank the Members who have worked cooperatively with me \nto make progress in so many areas over the last year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter previously \nreferred to be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                        Washington, June 27, 2002.\n     Hon.

Mr President, I rise today to recognize 65 fallen \nservicemen from Alexandria, VA, who paid the ultimate sacrifice with \ntheir life while defending freedom in the Vietnam war.\n  No mere words can express the depth of gratitude this country owes to \nthe families of our fallen service members for the loss of their sons, \ndaughters, brothers, sisters, husbands, or wives. By touching their \nnames etched in granite and marble on monuments and statues in \ncountries around the world, we who are living and those who come after \nus have the ability to connect with these fallen heroes. We must never \ntake the sacrifices of past generations of Americans for granted, for \neach new generation is called upon to defend representative democracy's \nfirst axiom: that ``freedom is not free.''\n  On July 6, 2002, the city of Alexandria dedicated a beautiful \nmemorial plaza to pay tribute to the 65 fallen American heroes from \nAlexandria who were killed in action or who remain missing in action in \nsoutheast Asia from the Vietnam war. Toby Mendez, a brilliant\n\n[[Page S6705]]\n\nyoung sculptor, has created a work that will allow us to touch the \nnames of the brave men whose sacrifice will be memorialized for all \ntime.\n  A statue of U.S. Army Cpt. Humbert Roque ``Rocky'' Versace is the \ncenterpiece of the plaza. On July 8, 2002, I had the distinct honor of \nbeing present at the White House for the posthumous awarding of the \nMedal of Honor by President George W. Bush for Rocky's conspicuous \ngallantry at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty \nwhile a captive of the Viet Cong from October 29, 1965, until he was \nexecuted on or about September 26, 1965. His captors took his life \nafter they had given up trying to break Rocky's indomitable will to \nresist interrogation and indoctrination, his unshakable faith in God, \nand his steadfast trust in his country and his fellow prisoners.\n  Captain Versace was a 1959 graduate of the U.S. Military Academy and \nlived his life by the West Point ideals of Duty, Honor, and Country. \nHis fellow prisoner, U.S. Army 1 Lt James Nicholas ``Nick'' Rowe \nrecalled that Rocky told his captors that ``as long as he was true to \nGod and true to himself, what was waiting for him after this life was \nfar better than anything that could happen now. So he told his captors \nthat they might as well kill him then and there if the price of his \nlife was getting more from him than name, rank, and serial number.''\n  Captain Versace's statue shows him holding hands with two Vietnamese \nchildren, who had been orphaned by Viet Cong terror against their \nparents. Rocky did many good works on his own to improve the lives of \nthe many orphans he came in contact with. In fact, he planned on \nentering the Maryknoll priesthood after his tour of duty ended in \nVietnam. It was Rocky's desire to return to Vietnam after ordination to \nbe a missionary priest to work among the villagers and help educate \ntheir children so they could achieve a better life for themselves, free \nof Communist domination.\n  The remains of Captain Versace and three other men from Alexandria \nlie in unmarked graves in southeast Asia, known only to God. They are: \nU.S. Army SSG Douglas Randolph Blodgett; U.S. Air Force Maj Joseph \nEdwin Davies; and U.S. Air Force Maj Morgan Jefferson Donahue.\n  Additionally, two other servicemen drowned, and their bodies did not \nresurface: U.S. Army 1 Lt Leland S. McCants III, who drowned on his \nfirst day in Vietnam while trying to save another soldier; and U.S. \nNavy Seaman Apprentice John Anthony Winkler, who was swept off of the \ndeck of the Navy aircraft carrier USS Bon Homme Richard and was lost at \nsea. The waters, jungles, and mountains of southeast Asia may never \nreveal these missing men's remains, but the U.S. Government is \ncommitted to continue to search for all those of our missing in action \npersonnel, those brave souls who, in the words of General of the Army \nDouglas MacArthur gave up their ``youth and strength, . . . love and \nloyalty . . . all that mortality can give.''\n\n  Each of the 65 names engrave on the limestone benches in Alexandria \nhas a story to tell of honor and courage. Two outstanding examples of \nthe dedication and service of this fine group of men are Robert William \nCupp and Herman Leroy Judy, Jr.\n  U.S. Army Cpl., Robert William Cupp served proudly with Company D, 2d \nBattalion, 1st Infantry Brigade of the Americal Division. He was killed \nin action in South Vietnam on June 6, 1968, by an enemy booby trap. \nCorporal Cupp was laid to rest in his family's plot at Mount Comfort \nCemetery on June 17, 1968, his 21st birthday.\n  U.S. Cpl., Herman Leroy Judy, Jr. served proudly with Company B, 2nd \nBattalion, 505th Infantry, 82nd Airborne Division. He was killed in \naction in South Vietnam on May 29, 1969, a day before his first wedding \nanniversary. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.\n  Both of these brave men received the Combat Infantryman's Badge, \nBronze Star Medal, and Purple Heart Medal for their heroism in combat.\n  Plato, that wise philosopher of ancient times, observed that ``only \nthe dead have known the end of war.'' So it is today with the never-\nending struggle between freedom and evil. All those brave men and women \nwho proudly wear the uniform of our armed services, and who willingly \nrisk their lives to achieve battlefield victories over our enemies, \ndeserve our Nation's eternal gratitude.\n  Mr. President, it is my great honor to enter into the Congressional \nRecord the names of the 65 men from Alexandria who were killed in \naction or remain missing in action in southeast Asia during the Vietnam \nwar, and who were memorialized on July 6, 2002.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n Names and Dates of Casualty for 65 Men Killed in Action or Missing in \n              Action, Entering Service From Alexandria, VA\n\n              (Dates are from thevirtualwall.org website.)\n\n       Lewis L.

Mr. President, I rise to recognize the Tres Rios \nHigh School Rodeo Association, which will soon host the 2002 National \nHigh School Finals Rodeo in Farmington, NM. The association, formed in \ncooperation with San Juan County and the cities of Farmington, Aztec, \nand Bloomfield, is rolling out the welcome mat for all to visit the \nbeautiful Four Corners area of New Mexico for the July 22-28 \ncompetition.\n  I join in welcoming the thousands of student athletes and spectators \nwho will descend on Farmington to celebrate the athleticism associated \nwith the rodeo competitions. Farmington, a burgeoning city that has \nalready proven itself as an excellent host for sporting events with the \nannual Connie Mack World Series tournament, will be a wonderful setting \nfor this rodeo. The Tres Rios High School Rodeo Association knows it is \nin a national spotlight for showcasing a richly blessed, multi-cultural \nregion that has been cherished since the dawn of the ancient Anasazi \nand Navajo cultures.\n  Just last month, I had the pleasure of meeting with students from San \nJuan\n\n[[Page S6706]]\n\nCounty who briefed me on their work to host this national competition. \nTheir enthusiasm and excitement was contagious, and I share in their \nanticipation for hosting the rodeo in northwest New Mexico. This is a \ngreat opportunity for the youth in the area to showcase their talents, \nand an excellent chance to boost the Four Corners area economy.\n  This year's competition is a continuation of a tradition begun in \n1949 in Halletsville, TX, with the first National Championship Rodeo. \nThat contest laid the foundation for what became the National \nChampionship High School Rodeo Association. New Mexico was one of the \nfirst five charter members. Subsequently, in 1961, this association was \nincorporated into the National High School Rodeo Association and \nincluded 20 states. Today, they have grown to include 39 States and two \nforeign countries.\n  Every year, the National High School Rodeo Association holds a \nNational High School Finals Rodeo. New Mexico has been the proud host \nof three previous finals, and is proudly hosting the 2002 and 2003 \ncompetitions at the San Juan County Fairgrounds.\n  The National High School Rodeo Association serves to challenge high \nschool students to keep alive a rich tradition of Western life through \nrodeo competitions. By providing a competitive environment, \nparticipants learn the spirit of sportsmanship and grow as individuals. \nIn addition, participation in the association promotes student \nachievement and provides opportunities for college scholarships and \nfurther professional development. I believe their efforts at furthering \nstudent education bodes well for the association, and I applaud them \nfor impacting young lives in such a positive manner.\n  Being selected as a host site is an honor, and I commend the Tres \nRios High School Rodeo Association, San Juan County, the cities of \nFarmington, Aztec and Bloomfield, and everyone associated with the \nevent for their efforts to prepare for the National High School Finals \nRodeo. I wish all participants in the rodeo the best of luck.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/12/senate-section/article/S6706-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO JOE FORD\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, for the last several months the \nAmerican people have been subjected to a string of stunning revelations \nfrom some of our largest public companies. Accounting irregularities, \nshady business practices, and exorbitant executive compensation \npackages are apparently standard operating practice in some of our \ncorporate boardrooms. As a result, thousands of families have lost \ntheir jobs and their savings, and investor confidence in our system of \nfree enterprise has been severely shaken.\n  I would like to take a few minutes today to pay tribute to an \nArkansas businessman who represents a vastly different picture of the \nAmerican business leader Joe Ford of ALLTEL Corporation, who retired \nfrom his position as CEO this year.\n  A native of Conway, AR, Joe graduated from the University of Arkansas \nin 1959 before joining Little Rock's Allied Telephone Company. He \nadvanced through several management positions and was named vice-\npresident in 1963. By 1977, he was named president of Allied, a \nposition he held until 1983 when his company merged with the Mid-\nContinent Telephone Corporation of Hudson, OH, to form ALLTEL. This \nmerger, along with the 1990 purchase of Systematics, Inc., in Little \nRock, laid the foundation for the telecommunications leader that ALLTEL \nhas since become. Joe Ford was named ALLTEL president and CEO in 1987. \nHe became chairman and CEO in 1991.\n  In a competitive and rapidly changing environment, Joe steered ALLTEL \nthrough a number of changes, including the deregulation of the \ntelephone industry. He also led ALLTEL into a number of new, growing \nmarkets most notably wireless communications.\n  When ALLTEL turned on its cellular service in 1986, they had only 310 \ncustomers. Ford and many of his colleagues were unsure as to whether \nthe new technology would catch on. But as we know now, the wireless \nindustry exploded, and ALLTEL expanded across the southeastern United \nStates. Today, ALLTEL covers portions of 23 States, serving six million \nwireless customers. Today, the company has expanded even further into \ninformation services, financial services, and mortgage processing.\n  When Joe Ford joined Allied Telephone in 1959, the company had 65 \nemployees and 5,000 telephone customers. Today, ALLTEL is my State's \nlargest high-tech company, with 4,100 employees working at the main \ncampus in Little Rock. ALLTEL is also the sixth largest wireline and \nwireless company in the world, a Fortune 500 company with 26,000 \nemployees worldwide serving 8 million communications customers. Many \nhave contributed to ALLTEL's success in the American marketplace, but \nclearly it has been Joe Ford's vision and leadership that has brought \nthe company to this level.\n  I will also pause to note that, throughout his career, Joe Ford has \nbeen the very embodiment of the engaged corporate citizen. In 1966, \nwhile serving as a vice-president for Allied Telephone, Joe ran for a \nseat in the Arkansas Senate. He served in this body from 1967 to 1982, \na term spanning the administrations of five governors. A longtime \nadvocate for public education, Joe chaired the Senate Education \nCommittee, where he worked to improve our state's educational system \nand helped to create the kindergarten program in Arkansas public \nschools. He has also been involved with numerous civic organizations.\n  Joe Ford once offered the following words of advice to his son: ``In \nall that you do in life, seek to make life better for others, work hard \nand honestly, be a man of strong character, humble in times of \ngreatness, and try to leave things a little better than they were left \nto you.'' His record certainly indicates that he has lived by these \nwords himself. On the occasion of Joe's retirement, I'm proud to pay \ntribute to an Arkansan whose every move has represented the ideals of \nthe American business world: trust, responsibility, hard work, and the \ngreater public good. I hope that all of our business leaders will \nfollow Joe's example in adhering to these ideals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/12/senate-section/article/S6706-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak \nabout hate crimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in \nMarch of last year. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in November \n1998 in Providence, MA. A gay man was assaulted outside a bar. The \nassailants, David E. Sheldon, 19, and Taylor Grenier, 18, who used \nantigay slurs during the attack, were charged with a hate crime in the \nincident.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/12/senate-section/article/S6706-3", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6706-S6707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DO THE WRITE THING CHALLENGE 2002\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Do the Write Thing Challenge, \nsponsored by the National Campaign to Stop Violence, is a national \nwriting contest in which students express their concerns about subjects \nsuch as domestic violence, easy access to guns, and gang activity. DtWT \ncurrently operates in 14 cities, including Detroit, MI. In 2002, more \nthan 75,000 students from more than 550 schools participated in the \nDtWT program. This week 38 Do the Write Thing national finalists came \nto Washington, DC, to talk to lawmakers about the impact of and \nsolutions to the epidemic of youth violence in our Nation.\n  The national student finalists, along with their teachers and family \nmembers, also attended a ceremony at the Library of Congress on Monday. \nRepresentatives of the Secretary of Education and the Library of \nCongress placed the students' writings in the Library of Congress. The \nwritings, ranging from poems to essays to stories, describe the impact \nof youth violence on the lives of children. Two students from Michigan, \nChastity Stewart and Justin Mozader, were honored by the National \nCampaign to Stop Violence for their writings on youth violence.\n\n[[Page S6707]]\n\nJustin's poem offers excellent advice on dealing with feelings of anger \nand aggression.\n\n     What can I do about the problem at hand?\n     It can't be solved by one man\n     To begin, I must look inside myself\n     And put my violence on the shelf\n\n  One of the top priorities of the Do the Write Thing Challenge is to \naddress youth violence by drawing attention to the problem of easy \naccess to guns. This is a laudable and important goal. One step the \nSenate can take to prevent easy access to guns is to pass the \nChildren's Access Prevention Act, which Senator Durbin introduced. \nUnder this bill, adults who fail to lock up a loaded firearm or an \nunloaded firearm with ammunition would be held criminally liable if a \nchild uses the weapon to kill or injure him or herself or another \nperson. The bill also increases the penalties for selling a gun to a \njuvenile and creates a gun safety education program that includes \nparent-teacher organizations, local law enforcement, and community \norganizations. This bill is similar to a bill President Bush signed \ninto law during his tenure as the Governor of Texas. I support this \nbill and hope the Senate will act on it during this Congress.\n  In addition to preventing our youth from having unsupervised access \nto deadly weapons, we should encourage schools to conduct violence \nprevention programs. We need to provide funding to allow schools to \npartner with local law enforcement in crime prevention, creative onsite \nschool violence prevention programs, and alcohol and drug counseling.\n  I know my colleagues will want to join me in congratulating Chastity \nand Justin for their writings and efforts to combat youth violence, and \nI urge my colleagues to join me in pushing for the passage of sensible \ngun safety legislation like Senator Durbin's bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/12/senate-section/article/S6707-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CEDAR GROVE'S 100TH YEAR OF INCORPORATION\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \na historical milestone in my State of West Virginia. July 13, 2002, \nmarks the 100th year of incorporation for the town of Cedar Grove--\nmaking it the oldest town in Kanawha County. I take this opportunity to \ncongratulate Cedar Grove on its centennial.\n  Cedar Grove is a small community nestled along the upper Kanawha \nValley. Although only in existence for 100 years, the history of the \ntown's site is much longer. The first settlement in the Kanawha Valley \nwas on the site of what is now Cedar Grove. Walter Kelly first settled \nthe area, then known as Kelly's Fort, in 1744. This was one of the \nfirst settlements started after the English bought what is now West \nVirginia from the Iroquois Indians. This site was also hotly contested \nland during the Civil War, when control of the Kanawha Valley went back \nand forth between the North and the South.\n  From being the oldest settlement in the area to the oldest town, \nCedar Grove has stood the test of time and remains strong to this day. \nIt has been a historical keystone to the Kanawha Valley, and has \ngreatly contributed to the richness of West Virginia culture and \nhistory.\n  On behalf of all citizens from the Mountain State, I would like to \nonce again commend Cedar Grove on its 100th birthday and ask that my \ndistinguished colleagues join with me in recognizing its rich \nhistory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/12/senate-section/article/S6707-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA'S FISCAL YEAR 2003 BUDGET REQUEST ACT--PM 102\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to my constitutional authority and consistent with sections \n202(c) and (e) of The District of Columbia Financial Management and \nResponsibility Assistance Act of 1995 and section 446 of The District \nof Columbia Self-Governmental Reorganization Act as amended in 1989, I \nam transmitting the District of Columbia's Fiscal Year 2003 Budget \nRequest Act.\n  The proposed FY 2003 Budget Request Act reflects the major \nprogrammatic objectives of the Mayor and the Council of the District of \nColumbia.

A bill to treat certain motor dealer transitional assistance \nas an involuntary conversion, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nimportant to thousands of independent small businesses across the \ncountry. The legislation I am introducing is a modest tax proposal \ndesigned to aid the Nation's 2,801 Oldsmobile franchised automobile \ndealers who are currently in the process of ending that relationship \nwith General Motors, GM, due to GM's decision to eliminate the \nOldsmobile product line. This legislation is similar to legislation \nthat has been introduced in the House with bipartisan majority of the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee.\n  As many of my colleagues know, GM notified their 2,801 Oldsmobile \ndealers in the United States on December 12, 2000 that they were \nphasing out the 100 year-old Oldsmobile brand and its complete line-up \nof vehicles. The announcement came with little warning to Oldsmobile \ndealers. In fact, many of the dealers had recently signed a new \nagreement with GM on November 1, 2000, with most dealers receiving a \nfive-year term.\n  As a consequence of its actions, GM is in the process of compensating \nOldsmobile dealers to assist in the phase-out of their Oldsmobile \ndealerships. These dealers will be required, out of financial \nnecessity, to reinvest the payment from GM into other dealership \nopportunities. In many cases, these dealers may face a significant \nfinancial burden in connection with their efforts to continue in the \nautomobile retail business.\n  The legislation I am introducing today seeks to lessen that burden by \ntreating GM's financial assistance payments, made in connection with \nGM's unilateral decision to phase-out the Oldsmobile product line, as \nan involuntary conversion under an existing section of the Internal \nRevenue Code. Thus, the effect of the legislation is to allow the \nOldsmobile dealer to defer tax consequences on GM's payments, provided \nthat the proceeds are reinvested in other dealership properties in the \ntime period specified in the Code.\n  Small and family-owned businesses, such as automobile dealerships, \nform the economic backbone of local communities across our country, \nparticularly in rural states like my home state of New Mexico. Allowing \nOldsmobile dealers to reinvest the entire payment received from GM into \nreplacement dealership property gives these dealers an opportunity to \ncontinue family-owned businesses and greatly benefits local economies \nthroughout New Mexico and the Nation. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on advancing this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2726\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. MOTOR VEHICLE DEALER TRANSITIONAL ASSISTANCE \n                   TREATED AS AN INVOLUNTARY CONVERSION.\n\n       (a) In General.--For purposes of subtitle A of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986, in the case of a taxpayer who was a \n     party to a motor vehicle sales and service agreement with a \n     motor vehicle manufacturer who announced in December 2000 \n     that it would phase-out the motor vehicle brand to which such \n     agreement relates--\n       (1) amounts received by such taxpayer from such \n     manufacturer on account of the termination of such agreement \n     shall be treated as received in an involuntary conversion to \n     which section 1033 of such Code applies, and\n       (2) the period described in section 1033(a)(2)(B) of such \n     Code shall begin on December 12, 2000.\n       (b) Character of Converted Property.--In applying section \n     1033 of such Code for purposes of this section, the property \n     involuntarily converted shall be treated as being property \n     used in the trade or business of a motor vehicle retail sales \n     and service dealership.\n       (c) Effective Date.--This section shall apply to amounts \n     received after December 12, 2000, in taxable years ending \n     after such date.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 2727. A bill to provide for the protection of paleontological \nresources on Federal lands, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nPaleontological Resources Preservation Act to protect and preserve the \nNation's important fossil record for the benefit of our citizens. \nVertebrate fossils are rare and valuable natural resources that are \nthreatened by a growing commercial market which is being supplied, in \npart, by the illegal collection of fossil specimens. This Act \nestablishes a comprehensive national policy for preserving and managing \npaleontological resources found on Federal lands. It provides \nuniformity to the patchwork of statutes and regulations that currently \nexist, and it ensures that the\n\n[[Page S6709]]\n\npublic will have educational and scientific access to this part of \ntheir geological and biological past.\n  I would like to emphasize that this bill in no way affects \narchaeological or cultural resources under the Archaeological Resources \nProtection Act of 1979 or the Native American Graves Protection and \nRehabilitation Act. They are exempted. This bill covers paleontological \nremains, fossils on Federal lands only.\n  Fossils are the remains, imprints and traces of once-living organisms \npreserved in the earth's crust. Fossils of vertebrates are the remains \nof animals with a backbone or spinal column, such as dinosaur bones, \nsabertooth tiger teeth, or imprints of bear paws and mammoth tusks. The \nfossil record is our only evidence that life existed on earth 3.5 \nbillion years ago. Fossils show us that dinosaurs evolved about 220 \nmillion years ago, and that four-legged creatures first walked on land \nabout 350 million years ago. Fossils tell us how the physical earth has \nchanged over time, how the climate has warmed and cooled, and how the \nmountains have been lifted up from the ocean depths. Fossils can also \nexplain how living things have responded to changing conditions, such \nas why mass extinctions of species have occurred at certain times in \nour planet's history.\n  In 1999, Congress requested that the Secretary of the Interior review \nand report on the Federal policy concerning paleontological resources \non Federal lands. In its request, Congress noted that no unified \nFederal policy exists regarding the treatment of fossils by Federal \nland management agencies, and our concern was that the lack of \nappropriate standards would lead to the deterioration or loss of \nfossils, which are valuable scientific resources.\n  In response, seven Federal agencies and the Smithsonian Institution \nreleased a report in May 2000 entitled, ``Assessment of Fossil \nManagement on Federal and Indian Lands.'' The report presented seven \ngoverning principles for the management of fossils on Federal lands. \nThese principles are that fossils on Federal lands are rare and a part \nof America's heritage; that effective stewardship requires accurate \ninformation and inventories; that penalties for fossil theft should be \nstrengthened; and that Federal fossil collections should be preserved \nand available for research and public education.\n  The Paleontological Resources Preservation Act embodies these \nprinciples, and provides the paleontological equivalent of protections \nfound in the Archeological Resources Preservation Act. The bill finds \nthat fossil resources on Federal lands are an irreplaceable part of the \nheritage of the United States. It affirms that reasonable access to \nfossil resources should be provided for scientific, educational, and \nrecreational purposes. The bill acknowledges the value of amateur \ncollecting, but protects vertebrate fossils under a system of permits.\n  You might wonder why such a bill is needed. Who would want to take \nthese fossils, and what would a person do with them? Let me give you an \nexample. On September 24, 2000, four individuals at Badlands National \nPark in South Dakota collected 1,700 fossil specimens that represented \na variety of different types of animals. This area was scheduled for a \nscientific survey in July 2002, but because these four individuals \nremoved the fossils from their context, scientists could no longer \nascertain the position of the fossils in the layers of rock, and the \nscientific and educational value of the fossils was destroyed. So what \nhappened to these individuals? To be honest, not much. Each one of the \nfour was fined between $250 and $1,000 for the theft of 1,700 pieces of \nour paleontological history.\n\n  You might think the fines were a lot of money until you realize how \nmuch fossils are worth. Trade in fossils is big business. With the \npopularity of paleontology programs on the Discovery Channel and movies \nlike Jurassic Park, people are starting their own collections at home, \nand corporations are buying fossils as investments, similar to the \npurchase of works of art. For example, the complete skeleton of a T-Rex \nwas recently sold for $8.6 million at auction to the Field Museum of \nChicago.\n  Paleontological resources can be sold on the market for a hefty \nprice, and they are being stolen from public lands without regard to \nscience and education. Even worse is the fact that the people who steal \nfossils aren't being held responsible for their actions and there is no \nincentive to stop the theft in the future. Less than one percent of \norganisms become fossils, and they are the key to understanding \nevolutionary patterns and processes. We need to protect these resources \nbefore it's too late.\n  The protections I offer in this Act are not new. Federal land \nmanagement agencies have individual regulations prohibiting theft of \ngovernment property. However, the reality is that U.S. Attorneys are \nreluctant to prosecute cases involving fossil theft because they are \ndifficult. We in Congress have not provided a clear statute stating the \nvalue of paleontological resources to our nation, as we did for \narcheological resources. Fossils are too valuable to be left within the \ngeneral theft provisions that are impossible to defend in court, and \nthey are too valuable to the education of our children to not ensure \npublic access. We need to work together to make sure that we in \nCongress fulfill our responsibility as stewards of public lands, and as \nprotectors of our nation's natural resources.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2727\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Paleontological Resources \n     Preservation Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Paleontological resources are nonrenewable. Such \n     resources on Federal lands are an accessible and \n     irreplaceable part of the heritage of the United States and \n     offer significant educational opportunities to all citizens.\n       (2) Existing Federal laws, statutes, and other provisions \n     that manage paleontological resources are not articulated in \n     a unified national policy for Federal land management \n     agencies and the public. Such a policy is needed to improve \n     scientific understanding, to promote responsible stewardship, \n     and to facilitate the enhancement of responsible \n     paleontological collecting activities on Federal lands.\n       (3) Consistent with the statutory provisions applicable to \n     each Federal land management system, reasonable access to \n     paleontological resources on Federal lands should be provided \n     for scientific, educational, and recreational purposes.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to establish a comprehensive \n     national policy for preserving and managing paleontological \n     resources on Federal lands.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Any acquisition \n     shall be subject to any limitations contained in the organic \n     legislation for such Federal lands.\n       (2) To provide educational materials to the public about \n     palenotological resources and sites.\n       (3) To provide for the payment of Rewards as provided in \n     section 11.\n\n     SEC. 11. REWARDS FORFEITURE.\n\n       (a) Rewards.--The Secretary may pay from penalties \n     collected under section 9 or 10 of this Act an amount equal \n     to the lesser of one-half of the penalty or $500, to any \n     person who furnishes information which leads to the finding \n     of a civil violation, or the conviction of criminal \n     violation, with respect to which the penalty was paid. If \n     several persons provided the information, the amount shall be \n     divided among the persons. No officer or employee of \n     the United States or of any State or local government who \n     furnishes information or renders service in the \n     performance of his official duties shall be eligible for \n     payment under this subsection.\n       (b) Forfeiture.--All paleontological resources with respect \n     to which a violation under section 9 or 10 occurred and which \n     are in the possession of any person, and all vehicles and \n     equipment of any person that were used in connection with the \n     violation, may be subject to forfeiture to the United States \n     upon--\n       (1) the person's conviction of the violation under section \n     9;\n       (2) assessment of a civil penalty against any person under \n     section 10 with respect to the violation; or\n       (3) a determination by any court that the paleontological \n     resources, vehicles, or equipment were involved in the \n     violation.\n\n     SEC. 12.

Res. 303\n\n       Whereas, in 1755, British troops expelled 6,000 Acadians \n     from their home in Acadie, an area that is part of modern-day \n     Nova Scotia, Canada, and many of these Acadians relocated to \n     the American colonies;\n       Whereas this expulsion, known as the Grand Derangement, \n     resulted in the dispersal of the Acadians and the spread of \n     their French-Canadian culture throughout the American \n     colonies;\n       Whereas, as a result of the Treaty of Paris in 1763, many \n     Acadians migrated to Louisiana;\n       Whereas the unique Acadian culture had a strong influence \n     on life in the American colonies;\n       Whereas, the 1990 census found that there were just under \n     700,000 people of Acadian ancestry in the United States, and \n     the uniquely Acadian culture and traditions of this group \n     continue to influence culture in the United States;\n       Whereas the 250th anniversary of the arrival of the first \n     Acadians in the United States occurs in 2005; and\n       Whereas a postage stamp would be an appropriate \n     commemoration of this anniversary, would increase public \n     awareness of the history of American prerevolutionary \n     immigration, and would benefit the American public by giving \n     recognition to a distinct and truly American subculture: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Citizens' Stamp \n     Advisory Committee should recommend to the Postmaster General \n     that a commemorative postage stamp be issued in 2005 to \n     celebrate the 250th anniversary of the arrival of the first \n     Acadians in the American colonies in 1755.\n\n     SEC. 2.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) During the last 20 years, HIV/AIDS has assumed pandemic \n     proportions, spreading from the most severely affected \n     region, sub-Saharan Africa, to all corners of the world, and \n     leaving an unprecedented path of death and devastation.\n       (2) According to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/\n     AIDS (UNAIDS), more than 60,000,000 people worldwide have \n     been infected with HIV since the epidemic began; more than \n     22,000,000 of these have lost their lives to the disease; and \n     more than 13,000,000 children have been orphaned by the \n     disease. HIV/AIDS is the fourth-highest cause of death in the \n     world.\n       (3) At the end of 2001, an estimated 40,000,000 people were \n     infected with HIV or living with AIDS. Of these, more than \n     2,700,000 were children under the age of fifteen and more \n     than 17,600,000 were women. Women are four times more \n     vulnerable to infection than are men and are becoming \n     infected at increasingly high rates because in many societies \n     women lack control over sexual encounters and cannot insist \n     on the use of protective measures. Women and children who are \n     refugees or are internally displaced persons are especially \n     vulnerable to sexual violence, thereby increasing the \n     possibility of HIV infection.\n       (4) As the leading cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa, \n     AIDS has killed more than 17,000,000 people (more than 3 \n     times the number of AIDS deaths in the rest of the world) and \n     will claim the lives of one-quarter of the population, mostly \n     adults, in the next decade.\n\n[[Page S6717]]\n\n       (5) An estimated 1,800,000 people in Latin America and the \n     Caribbean and another 7,100,000 people in Asia and the \n     Pacific region are infected with HIV or living with AIDS. \n     Infection rates are rising alarmingly in Eastern Europe \n     (especially in the Russian Federation), Central Asia, and \n     China.\n       (6) HIV/AIDS threatens personal security by affecting the \n     health, lifespan, and productive capacity of the individual \n     and the social cohesion and economic well-being of the \n     family.\n       (7) HIV/AIDS undermines the economic security of a country \n     and individual businesses in that country by weakening the \n     productivity and longevity of the labor force across a broad \n     array of economic sectors and by reducing the potential for \n     economic growth over the long term.\n       (8) HIV/AIDS destabilizes communities by striking at the \n     most mobile and educated members of society, many of whom are \n     responsible for security at the local level and governance at \n     the national and subnational levels as well as many teachers, \n     health care personnel, and other community workers vital to \n     community development and the effort to combat HIV/AIDS. In \n     some countries the overwhelming challenges of the HIV/AIDS \n     epidemic are accelerating the outward migration of critically \n     important health care professionals.\n       (9) HIV/AIDS weakens the defenses of countries severely \n     affected by the HIV/AIDS crisis through high infection rates \n     among members of their military forces. According to UNAIDS, \n     in sub-Saharan Africa, many military forces have infection \n     rates as much as five times that of the civilian population.\n       (10) HIV/AIDS poses a serious security issue for the \n     international community by--\n       (A) increasing the potential for political instability and \n     economic devastation, particularly in those countries and \n     regions most severely affected by the disease; and\n       (B) decreasing the capacity to resolve conflicts through \n     the introduction of peacekeeping forces because the \n     environments into which these forces are introduced pose a \n     high risk for the spread of HIV/AIDS.\n       (11) The devastation wrought by the HIV/AIDS pandemic is \n     compounded by the prevalence of tuberculosis and malaria, \n     particularly in developing countries where the poorest and \n     most vulnerable members of society, including women, \n     children, and those living with HIV/AIDS, become infected. \n     According to the World Health Organization (WHO), HIV/AIDS, \n     tuberculosis, and malaria accounted for more than 5,700,000 \n     deaths in 2001 and caused debilitating illnesses in millions \n     more.\n       (12) Tuberculosis is the cause of death for one out of \n     every three people with AIDS worldwide and is a highly \n     communicable disease. HIV infection is the leading threat to \n     tuberculosis control. Because HIV infection so severely \n     weakens the immune system, individuals with HIV and latent \n     tuberculosis infection have a 100 times greater risk of \n     developing active tuberculosis diseases thereby increasing \n     the risk of spreading tuberculosis to others. Tuberculosis, \n     in turn, accelerates the onset of AIDS in individuals \n     infected with HIV.\n       (13) Malaria, the most deadly of all tropical parasitic \n     diseases, has been undergoing a dramatic resurgence in recent \n     years due to increasing resistance of the malaria parasite to \n     inexpensive and effective drugs. At the same time, increasing \n     resistance of mosquitoes to standard insecticides makes \n     control of transmission difficult to achieve. The World \n     Health Organization estimates that between 300,000,000 and \n     500,000,000 new cases of malaria occur each year, and annual \n     deaths from the disease number between 2,000,000 and \n     3,000,000. Persons infected with HIV are particularly \n     vulnerable to the malaria parasite. The spread of HIV \n     infection contributes to the difficulties of controlling \n     resurgence of the drug resistant malaria parasite.\n       (14) Although HIV/AIDS is first and foremost a health \n     problem, successful strategies to stem the spread of the \n     pandemic will require not only medical interventions, the \n     strengthening of health care delivery systems and \n     infrastructure and determined national leadership and \n     increased budgetary allocations for the health sector in \n     countries affected by the epidemic but also measures to \n     address the social and behavioral causes of the problem and \n     its impact on families, communities, and societal sectors.\n       (15) Basic interventions to prevent new HIV infections and \n     to bring care and treatment to people living with AIDS, such \n     as voluntary counseling and testing and mother-to-child \n     transmission programs, are achieving meaningful results and \n     are cost-effective. The challenge is to expand these \n     interventions from a pilot program basis to a national basis \n     in a coherent and sustainable manner.\n       (16) The magnitude and scope of the HIV/AIDS crisis demands \n     a comprehensive, long-term, international response focused \n     upon addressing the causes, reducing the spread, and \n     ameliorating the consequences of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, \n     including--\n       (A) prevention and education, care and treatment, basic and \n     applied research, and training of health care workers, \n     particularly at the community and provincial levels, and \n     other community workers and leaders needed to cope with the \n     range of consequences of the HIV/AIDS crisis;\n       (B) development of health care infrastructure and delivery \n     systems through cooperative and coordinated public efforts \n     and public and private partnerships;\n       (C) development and implementation of national and \n     community-based multisector strategies that address the \n     impact of HIV/AIDS on the individual, family, community, and \n     nation and increase the participation of at-risk populations \n     in programs designed to encourage behavioral and social \n     change and reduce the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS; and\n       (D) coordination of efforts between international \n     organizations such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \n     Tuberculosis and Malaria, the Joint United Nations Programme \n     on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the World Health Organization (WHO), \n     national governments, and private sector organizations.\n       (17) The United States has the capacity to lead and enhance \n     the effectiveness of the international community's response \n     by--\n       (A) providing substantial financial resources, technical \n     expertise, and training, particularly of health care \n     personnel and community workers and leaders;\n       (B) promoting vaccine and microbicide research and the \n     development of new treatment protocols in the public and \n     commercial pharmaceutical research sectors;\n       (C) encouraging governments and community-based \n     organizations to adopt policies that treat HIV/AIDS as a \n     multisectoral problem affecting not only health but other \n     areas such as education, the economy, the family and society, \n     and assisting them to develop and implement programs \n     corresponding to these needs; and\n       (D) encouraging active involvement of the private sector, \n     including businesses, pharmaceutical and biotechnology \n     companies, the medical and scientific communities, charitable \n     foundations, private and voluntary organizations and \n     nongovernmental organizations, faith-based organizations, \n     community-based organizations, and other nonprofit entities.\n\n     SEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Approximately 2,000 children around the world are \n     infected each day with HIV through mother-to-child \n     transmission. Transmission can occur during pregnancy, labor, \n     and delivery or through breast feeding. Over ninety percent \n     of these cases are in developing nations with little or no \n     access to public health facilities.\n       (2) Mother-to-child transmission is largely preventable \n     with the proper application of pharmaceuticals, therapies, \n     and other public health interventions.\n       (3) The drug nevirapine, reduces mother-to-child \n     transmission by nearly 50 percent. Universal availability of \n     this drug could prevent up to 400,000 infections per year and \n     dramatically reduce the number of AIDS-related deaths.\n       (4) At the United Nations Special Session on HIV/AIDS in \n     June 2001, the United States committed to the specific goals \n     with respect to the prevention of mother-to-child \n     transmission, including the goals of reducing the proportion \n     of infants infected with HIV by 20 percent by the year 2005 \n     and by 50 percent by the year 2010, as specified in the \n     Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS adopted by the United \n     Nations General Assembly at the Special Session.\n       (5) Several United States Government agencies including the \n     United States Agency for International Development and the \n     Centers for Disease Control are already supporting programs \n     to prevent mother-to-child transmission in resource-poor \n     nations and have the capacity to expand these programs \n     rapidly by working closely with foreign governments and \n     nongovernmental organizations.\n       (6) Efforts to prevent mother-to-child transmission can \n     provide the basis for a broader response that includes care \n     and treatment of mothers, fathers, and other family members \n     that are infected with HIV or living with AIDS.\n       (7) HIV/AIDS has devastated the lives of countless children \n     and families across the globe. Since the epidemic began, an \n     estimated 13,200,000 children under the age of 15 have been \n     orphaned by AIDS, that is they have lost their mother or both \n     parents to the disease. The Joint United Nations Program on \n     HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimates that this number will double by \n     the year 2010.\n       (8) HIV/AIDS also targets young people between the ages of \n     15 to 24, many of whom carry the burden of caring for family \n     members living with HIV/AIDS. An estimated 10,300,000 young \n     people are now living with HIV/AIDS. One-half of all new \n     infections are occurring among this age group.\n\n     SEC. 412. POLICY AND REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Policy.--The United States Government's response to the \n     global HIV/AIDS pandemic should place high priority on the \n     prevention of mother-to-child transmission, the care and \n     treatment of family members and caregivers, and the care of \n     children orphaned by AIDS. To the maximum extent possible, \n     the United States Government should seek to leverage its \n     funds by seeking matching contributions from the private \n     sector, other national governments, and international \n     organizations.\n       (b) Requirements.--The 5-year United States Government \n     strategy required by section 101 of this Act shall--\n       (1) provide for meeting or exceeding the goal set by the \n     United Nations General Assembly Declaration of Commitment on \n     HIV/AIDS to reduce the rate of mother-to-child transmission \n     of HIV by 20 percent by 2005 and by 50 percent by 2010;\n       (2) include programs to make available testing and \n     treatment to HIV-positive women and their family members, \n     including drug treatment and therapies to prevent mother-to-\n     child transmission; and\n       (3) expand programs designed to care for children orphaned \n     by AIDS.\n\n     SEC. 413.
