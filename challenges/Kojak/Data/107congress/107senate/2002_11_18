Mr. President, the Senate, for all of the notice it gets \nin the national press, is nonetheless still a family of sorts. We are \n100 men and women who come to this fashion of public service from \ndifferent points on the compass, from all across the country, and from \ndifferent backgrounds--Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and \nliberals. We work together a great part of the year in this Chamber, \nand we spend a lot of time in our respective States. We have become \nfriends. Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, \nnonetheless, are close personal friends in many cases.\n  We are going to be saying good-bye to a number of Senators this year. \nI wish to, before we complete our work this week, say a word about a \nnumber of those who will be leaving. I actually threatened last week, I \nsay to the Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, for example, to say a word \nabout him. I will do that today in a moment.\n  I will start with Senator Jean Carnahan, if I may. I went to Missouri \nto campaign with Jean Carnahan. She was here a relatively short time \nbecause she filled a seat that was then filled by a special election in \nthe State of Missouri. But I believe the first moment I met Jean was at \nthe organizing session. She had suffered a great tragedy. The State of \nMissouri had suffered a great tragedy. The incumbent Governor of the \nState of Missouri had died in a plane crash. The Governor, his son, and \nothers perished in that crash relatively close to the election. His \nname remained on the ballot. The folks from the State of Missouri, \nnonetheless, voted for his name on the ballot, and the Governor \nappointed Jean Carnahan, his widow, to come to the Senate.\n  Jean stood up at the organizing session--and I am sure she would not \nmind if I indicated this publicly because she did it in an organizing \nsession--and she said to members of our caucus and to the new Members \ncoming into the Senate:\n\n       You come here because of your win. I have arrived here \n     because of my loss.\n\n  She, of course, was speaking about the tragedy that had occurred in \nthe State of Missouri, her having lost a husband, then a candidate for \nthe Senate, and her son in that plane crash.\n  I watched Jean Carnahan as she worked in the Senate. She did a \nremarkable job. She is someone with great courage. She is someone who \nhas the capability to stand up in a very significant way and explain \nquickly what it is she has a passion about in public policy.\n  I deeply admire Jean Carnahan, not only for aspiring to carry out \nthat mission of public service that was begun by her husband, the \nGovernor of Missouri, but also because she played a significant role \nand contributed in a significant way in the Senate.\n  We all will miss Jean Carnahan as she moves on to other challenges \nand other opportunities.\n  My colleague, Max Cleland from Georgia, will not be with us in the \nnext session. He will be leaving at the end of this session as well. \nMax Cleland is one of those heroes of mine. Max Cleland is a brave, \nremarkable American. He left three of his limbs on a battlefield \nfighting for this country. He is a person of great personal courage.\n  I say to anyone who has not yet done so, read his book, ``Going to \nthe Max.'' It is a story of great inspiration. Max Cleland has been a \nterrific legislator, a great representative of the State of Georgia in \nthe Senate. More than that, he has been an inspiration to virtually all \nAmerica.\n  Our country owes him a great debt of gratitude for his service. Our \ncolleagues owe him a great debt of gratitude for his companionship and \nservice in the Senate.\n  We also will not be joined next year by Senator Torricelli who \nindicated his decision not to seek reelection. Let me say about Bob \nTorricelli, I served with him in the U.S. House of Representatives. He \nis a passionate fighter, articulate, strong, assertive for the issues \nin which he believes and for the issues he feels are important to his \nhome State of New Jersey and for our country.\n  On the Republican side, I came here not knowing Jesse Helms. I only \nknew of him by reputation. His reputation was he was a hard-edged, \ntough guy who asked no quarter, gave no quarter, and never stopped \nfighting for the issues about which he cared. He planted himself \nsometimes far off the political spectrum and said: Here is where I \nstand. That was my impression of him as I came to the Senate.\n  What I discovered in the Senate is he is quite a remarkable \ngentleman, and I use the term ``gentleman'' in every respect. He is one \nof the most courteous, kind people with whom I have had the opportunity \nto serve. I have on occasion gone over and sat with him in the Chamber \nof the Senate and talked about the house he will retire to and the \nfront porch on which he will spend some time.\n  While we might disagree on some issues very strongly, he is a \nlegislator who contributed substantially to the public debate in this \ncountry and often with great courage on his part. I certainly thank him \nfor his service to our country.\n\n[[Page S11233]]\n\n  Senator Strom Thurmond will be leaving the Senate. If you know his \npersonal story, you just are almost out of breath when you understand \nwhat he has done over his lifetime. He not only has served with great \ndistinction in public service in many venues--as a judge in his home \nState, in the Senate, running for President, and so many other \npositions--he also volunteered for service during wartime at age 42 \nand volunteered to climb into a glider to crash land at night behind \nenemy lines.\n\n  This is a man of great personal courage and a man who served this \ncountry with great distinction in many ways. I have had the opportunity \nover the years I have been in the Senate to serve with him as well and \nvisit with him about his public service. I deeply admire what Senator \nStrom Thurmond has given to this country, and we wish him well.\n  Senator Murkowski is someone with whom I have worked on the Energy \nCommittee, both as a chairman of the Energy Committee and ranking \nmember. He is now off to become Governor of the State of Alaska. He is \nsomeone with great passion for his State. Almost every amendment coming \nfrom Senator Murkowski has something to do with Alaska.\n  I have enjoyed the opportunity to get to know Senator Murkowski. He \nis a man of good humor, but also someone who feels very strongly and \npassionately about issues.\n  Senator Hutchinson I have not known quite as well, but Senator \nHutchinson and his brother Asa, who served in the House of \nRepresentatives while Tim served in the Senate--their family, \nobviously, has a great passion for public service. I have enjoyed the \nopportunity to know him, although not quite as well as others.\n  Senator Smith from New Hampshire is one with whom I had the \nopportunity to serve on the Ethics Committee. I have grown very fond of \nBob Smith. He is a big, tall man with a great passion to serve his \nState and country. One of the qualities I discovered about him on \nissues that are very important, such as the issues we confronted on the \nEthics Committee, is there was not a partisan bone in his body. But Bob \nSmith was about fairness and doing things the right way.\n  I have become a friend of Bob Smith's. I like him a great deal. I \nwish him very well as he moves on from the Senate.\n  Finally, Senator Gramm from Texas. I mentioned the other day he is \nsomeone who, if you are going to be in a big fight--a really big \nfight--you want with you. He not only is smart and shrewd, but he does \nnot ever quit, no matter what the time is on the clock.\n  While we have had our differences from time to time with regard to \npublic policy, I have never had a difference with him on personal \nissues. He is someone I deeply admire. His service to our country \nthrough the Senate and the House is substantial. In fact, early on in \nour career, I sat next to him on the Veterans Affairs Committee in the \nU.S. House. That is when he was a Democrat, as a matter of fact. That \nis eons ago.\n  Senator Gramm is one of those people who makes a significant \ncontribution in this Chamber because he is determined to make that \ncontribution and he knows the rules, he is shrewd, and he is tough. If \nyou are in a fight, you want someone like Senator Gramm with you in a \nfight.\n  Mr. President, having said all that about those who are leaving, let \nme say again the reason I came today to speak is because I care very \ndeeply about this institution. I still pinch myself every day after 10 \nyears serving in the Senate. When I drive to this Capitol Building, I \npinch myself that a man from a town of 400 people and a high school \nclass of 9 had the opportunity to be elected to the Senate.\n  This is an extraordinary honor. This body of 100 men and women who \ncome with different passions and different visions for our country \noffer America the patchwork quilt of what America is about in its \ndeliberations and the development of ideas and the approaches by which \nwe try to move America forward.\n  I know from time to time, as do all of my colleagues, I leave this \nChamber perhaps despondent about what happened that day, despondent \nthat we did not get something done which I thought we should have done, \nor despondent that we did something I thought we should not have done. \nBut over a long time, I remain enormously proud of the opportunities to \nserve in the Senate.\n  It is a remarkable, unusual, distinct privilege to serve in the \nSenate. This institution is still the greatest deliberative body in the \nworld, and my colleague, Senator Byrd, the Presiding Officer, the \nPresident pro tempore, reminds us always of the place in history this \nSenate occupies.\n  I wish to say to all of those who are leaving this institution: It \nhas been a great privilege to serve with each and every single one of \nthem. Their presence has contributed to this institution in a very \nsignificant way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                               PHIL GRAMM\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my good \nfriend and distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from Texas, \nSenator Phil Gramm. Senator Gramm was first elected to public office in \n1978. He served in the U.S. House of Representatives as a Democrat for \n4 years. After becoming disenchanted with the Democratic party, he \nresigned his seat in January of 1983 and ran again in a special \nelection as a Republican. He won back his seat and earned a new found \nrespect for the honorable way in which he changed parties. In 1984, \nSenator Gramm was elected to the United States Senate.\n  An economist by training, Senator Gramm has spent his entire public \ncareer fighting for the principles of freedom, particularly economic \nfreedom, individual choice and limited government. We all know well of \nhis ``Dickey Flatt'' test. Dickey Flatt is a small businessman in Texas \nwho has served as Senator Gramm's bell-weather on the Federal \nGovernment's tax and regulatory policies. It is for the Dickey Flatts \nof this country that Senator Gramm has fought to cut Federal tax rates, \nrepeal the death tax and reduce the government's regulatory burden on \nsmall businesses. We also have heard often of Senator Gramm's \n``momma.'' It is for her and the other senior citizens of our country \nthat Senator Gramm has worked hard to strengthen and modernize the \nMedicare and Social Security programs. Perhaps Senator Gramm's most \nimportant legislative accomplishments are the 1981 ``Gramm-Latta'' tax \ncut, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced budget bill and the Gramm-\nLeach-Bliley Financial Services Act.\n  Equally as important as the legislation he has supported is the \nlegislation that Senator Gramm has chosen to fight over the years. If a \nbill did not pass the Dickey Flatt test, you could be assured that \nSenator Gramm would oppose it. He is probably most famous for \nsuccessfully leading the opposition in 1994 to then-President Clinton's \nproposal for a Federal takeover of the Nation's health care system.\n  I have had the privilege of serving with the Senator from Texas on \nthe Senate Finance Committee for the past 4 years. I have learned much \nfrom him and enjoyed listening to him debate the important issues \nbefore the Committee. Senator Gramm has a plain-spoken, common sense \nway of explaining issues that will be sorely missed in this body.\n  Senator Gramm has served his State of Texas and this country with \ngreat distinction. He is a skilled debater and legislator, who has held \ntrue to his conservative principles over the years. I feel privileged \nto have had the opportunity to work with him during my tenure in the \nSenate, and to call him my friend. I wish him and his lovely wife Wendy \nthe best in their future endeavors.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to my friend and \ncolleague Phil Gramm, who retires from the Senate, but will not soon \nfade from the memories of all those who worked with him in this body. \nVery simply, Senator Gramm is a straight shooter, a man who has a \nstrong grasp of the issues, and who never fails to speak his mind. \nWhile we disagreed a good deal on the issues, I have always had the \nutmost respect for Senator Gramm's opinion, and for the way that he has \nconducted himself throughout his service in the Senate.\n  There have also been many times when we have seen eye to eye, and \nwhen we have it has been a pleasure to\n\n[[Page S11234]]\n\nwork with the Senator from Texas. Together we have fought to reform our \nbudget process and cut wasteful spending. Now as my colleagues know, \ncutting spending or reforming the way that the government spends \nFederal tax dollars is never easy. But Senator Gramm and I share the \nbelief that only by reforming our budget process will we ensure the \nkind of fiscal discipline in Congress that the American people deserve.\n  While we were never able to bring our budget process reform bill to \nintroduction, we stood shoulder-to-shoulder on many votes to cut pork-\nbarrel spending and apply fiscal discipline. I thank Senator Gramm for \nhis tremendous leadership on these critical issues, and I wish him all \nthe best as he ends his distinguished career in the U.S. Senate.\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR JESSE HELMS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, with the end of the 107th Congress, we \nwish the best to Senator Jesse Helms, who retires after serving five \nterms here in the U.S. Senate. Senator Helms will be long remembered, \nby his colleagues and by history, for his legendary service to the \npeople of North Carolina.\n  From the day I arrived in the Senate, and throughout our service \ntogether on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms has \nbeen unfailingly cordial to me, and that is something I have always \ngreatly appreciated. While Senator Helms and I more often than not \ndisagreed on the issues of the day, I appreciated the chance to work \nwith him on issues where we were able to find common ground. Together \nwe fought against unnecessary fast-track procedures that bind \nCongress's hands on trade legislation. I also joined with Senator Helms \nto try to ensure that the export laws took national security \nsufficiently into account, rather than merely bend to the largest \nbusiness interests. Finally, I have been proud to work with Senator \nHelms to call attention to human rights abuses in China.\n  So as he leaves the Senate, I thank Senator Helms for the chance to \nwork together on these important issues. I join my colleagues in paying \ntribute to him, and in wishing him all the best for his retirement.\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR FRED THOMPSON\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I would like to pay tribute to \nFred Thompson, a colleague and friend who has left a lasting legacy \nhere in the Senate. Senator Thompson has served the people of Tennessee \nwell, standing on principle time and time again. He has been a champion \nof campaign finance reform since he first came to the Senate in 1994. \nHe was among the original co-sponsors of the first McCain-Feingold \nlegislation, and he has been an invaluable ally ever since.\n  I am deeply grateful to him for his longstanding and steadfast \nsupport for reform. Fred Thompson was a central part of our effort, \nfrom the first days, when gaining the support of such a fair-minded and \nwell-respected member gave a tremendous boost to our efforts, through \nto some of our most critical moments, as when he skillfully negotiated \nan agreement on hard money limits that the vast majority of this body \ncould support. Without that agreement, we simply could not have moved \nthe McCain-Feingold bill through the Senate. I also want to pay special \ntribute to Senator Thompson for the work he did investigating the 1996 \ncampaign finance scandals. Senator Thompson cut his political teeth on \nanother great scandal in our Nation's history, but his work in 1997 \nshowed the nation that the campaign finance is truly a bipartisan \nproblem with a bipartisan solution. I will greatly miss his leadership \non these issues.\n  I also joined with Senator Thompson to try to ensure that the export \nlaws took national security sufficiently into account, rather than \nmerely bend to the largest business interests. And finally, I want to \nthank Fred Thompson for his leadership on States' rights. Senator \nThompson has consistently spoken out against Federal mandates that \nhinder, rather than help, States and localities as they work to serve \nAmerica's communities.\n  These are just a few of the many reasons that Fred Thompson's \npresence in this body will be missed. He has been a true champion on \nmany important issues, and a champion for the people of his state. I \nthank him for his leadership and his friendship, and I wish him all the \nbest as he ends this chapter of his career.\n\n\n                             tim hutchinson\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the election campaign in Arkansas this \nyear which involved Tim Hutchinson and Mark Pryor put me in an awkward \nposition. Former Senator David Pryor was one of my best friends when he \nwas in the Senate.\n  Tim Hutchinson has been a hard working, successful Senator who \ndeserved to be reelected. The voters of Arkansas made their decision \nand Tim Hutchinson was not reelected.\n  During his 6 years in the Senate, Tim was a forceful, articulate, and \neffective spokesman for the interests of his State. I observed him at \nclose range, as a fellow member of the Agriculture Committee, speak out \nfor the farmers of his State. He made sure the best programs possible \nwere included in the farm bill last year for the rice, cotton, and \nsoybean producers of his State.\n  He gave particular attention to the interests of the aquaculture \nindustry and the unfair efforts of the Vietnamese basa fish exporters \nto undermine years of catfish promotion efforts and market development \nsuccess.\n  In every instance when Tim Hutchinson argued for the interest of the \ncitizens of his State, he did so with conviction and a seriousness of \npurpose that was very impressive to me.\n  Another example which I recall that made me sit up and take notice \nwas in a nationally televised debate of the William Buckley show which \nwas broadcast from the law school at the University of Mississippi. The \nsubject was the United States-China relationship. The panel included \nHenry Kissinger, Jim Barksdale, my colleague Trent Lott, and the new \nSenator from Arkansas, Tim Hutchinson.\n  I was surprised that the young Arkansas Senator not only held his own \nduring this program, but he was the star. He made compelling arguments \nfor his points of view; he knew the facts; and he expressed them in an \narticulate and persuasive manner.\n  Tim Hutchinson has been a very fine Senator for the State of \nArkansas. He has upheld the finest traditions of this body, and we will \nmiss him.\n  I wish him much success in the years ahead.\n\n\n                              Max Cleland\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my dear \nfriend and departing colleague Senator Max Cleland.\n  Thomas Jefferson once said that ``a nation that rests on the will of \nthe people must also depend on individuals to support its institutions \nif it is to flourish. Persons qualified for public office should feel \nan obligation to make that contribution.''\n  Max Cleland heard that centuries old call to duty and answered with a \nlifetime of service.\n  Senator Cleland's dedication to his country stretches from the \nbattlefields of Vietnam to the floor of this Senate. And the families \nof Georgia, and our entire Nation, are better for his leadership.\n  Senator Cleland nearly lost his life serving his country in Vietnam. \nHe returned home with injuries so grave that he spent a year and a half \nin various Veterans Administration Hospitals recovering.\n  But Senator Cleland then battled and beat a depression so deep that \nit would have broken the spirit of many others and embarked on a \nremarkable 30-year career of public service.\n  He began by speaking out for better treatment for veterans, a cause \nhe would champion throughout his career.\n  Then at the age of 28, he was elected to become Georgia's youngest \nState Senator.\n  In 1977, Senator Cleland was appointed head of the Veterans \nAdministration by President Carter, mailing him the youngest \nAdministrator in the agency's history.\n  In 1982, Georgia voters elected him Secretary of State, again, the \nyoungest ever.\n  And in 1996, Senator Cleland was elected to the United States Senate \nwhere he became a champion on issues like veteran affairs, health care \nand protecting our Nation's parks and natural treasures.\n  I think Jefferson would be proud to see that our Nation still \nproduces such leaders as Senator Cleland whose entire life embodies the \nspirit of patriotism, civic duty and self-sacrifice that\n\n[[Page S11235]]\n\nhas shaped our Nation since its very founding.\n  I hope Senator Cleland will continue to speak out on the issues he \ncares about so deeply because his voice is still needed.\n\n\n                             jean carnahan\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to express my admiration and respect for my \ndeparting colleague, Senator Jean Carnahan.\n  Senator Carnahan and I entered the Senate in the same freshman class \nand we served together on the Special Committee on Aging.\n  I quickly came to appreciate Senator Carnahan's hard work on behalf \nof the people of Missouri and our Nation.\n  Senator Carnahan was a leader in the fight to make prescription drugs \nmore affordable.\n  Senator Carnahan authored the ``Classroom Quality'' provision of the \n``Leave No Child Behind Act'', which will give our local schools the \nability to offer qualified teaching specialists to all students who \nneed them.\n  Senator Carnahan worked to save thousands of airline jobs in Missouri \nand across the Nation also provide relief for those workers who lost \ntheir jobs in the wake of the travel slowdown after 9-11.\n  Senator Carnahan was one of the first legislators to go to \nAfghanistan to see for herself that our troops had all they needed in \nthe fight against terrorism.\n  And Senator Carnahan fought tirelessly to make sure Social Security \nand Medicare remain strong for our present seniors and the generations \nto come.\n  While her tenure was brief, her legacy will be long.\n  But, beyond admiring her skills as a legislator, I came to appreciate \nSenator Carnahan's sincere warmth, quiet humor and inner strength.\n  We are all too keenly aware that Senator Carnahan came to the Senate \nin the wake of the tragic plane crash that killed her husband, Governor \nMel Carnahan, and her oldest son Randy.\n  But Senator Carnahan turned the grief over her family's loss into a \nlegacy of gains for families in Missouri and our Nation.\n  Senator Carnahan was truly a fitting heir to the Senate seat once \nheld by Harry Truman and I hope she will continue to speak out on the \nissues she cared about so deeply.\n  Her voice will still be needed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of paying tribute to \nour colleagues who are leaving the Senate. There are some 10 of our \ncolleagues who are leaving under various circumstances. I would like to \nspeak about them and to express my deep appreciation for their \nfriendship, for the years we have worked together, or opposed each \nother, as the case may be, on various matters that have come before \nthis body.\n  Mr. President, of course, we all have great affection for Senator \nThurmond, who has served here for 54 years and is on the brink of \ncelebrating his 100th birthday--a remarkable achievement in and of \nitself. As someone once said, if they had known they would have lived \nthat long, they would have taken better care of themselves. And Strom \nThurmond took very good care of himself over the years.\n  Senator Max Cleland, a remarkable person, has served here for only 6 \nyears, representing the State of Georgia. He has done a remarkable job \nduring his years here. But he has had a distinguished record, of \ncourse, that has accumulated prior to his arrival in the Senate.\n  Senator Jesse Helms, with whom I have served on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee for my entire service, my 22 years in the Senate. He has \nserved for 30 years here. We have been the best of colleagues serving \ntogether.\n  Senator Bob Torricelli of New Jersey; Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, \nwith whom I have served on the Banking Committee; Senator Jean \nCarnahan, who has had a brief service here but has done a wonderful job \nrepresenting the State of Missouri; Senator Frank Murkowski, with whom \nI was elected to the Senate 22 years ago; Senator Fred Thompson from \nthe State of Tennessee; Senator Bob Smith; Senator Tim Hutchinson--\nthese are the 10 Members who are leaving.\n\n\n                             Strom Thurmond\n\n  Mr. President, regarding Senator Thurmond, I spoke back a number of \nweeks ago about Senator Thurmond in our wonderful tribute to him. He is \ntruly an institution within this institution.\n  I have known Senator Thurmond since I was very young. My father and \nhe served together here for 12 years. I have served with him for 22 \nyears. So for 34 years Senator Thurmond has had to serve with a Dodd in \nthe U.S. Senate of his 54 years.\n  I know of no one who has had as varied and as distinguished a career \nin public service. When you think of his contribution as an educator, \nas a Governor, as a combat war veteran--and not young at the time of D-\nDay, I might add, but nonetheless showed great heroism--and serving, as \nI mentioned, as a Governor of his State, and, of course, in the Senate \nfor so many years, and as a judge--truly a remarkable individual--and \nelected to the Senate under various banners over the years--as a \nDemocrat, as a Dixiecrat, as a Republican, as a write-in candidate--\ntruly a remarkable achievement.\n  I've heard it suggested that they might have to rename the State of \nSouth Carolina; there have been so many monuments to his public \nservice. There are schools, roads, bridges, parks all through the State \nof South Carolina that bear the name of Strom Thurmond. That is \nbecause, of course, he is held with such incredible affection by the \npeople of that State.\n  We have had our differences on substantive matters, but he has always \nbeen a tremendous gentleman and a wonderful friend. He is a good friend \nto my family as well. I wanted to take a couple minutes to say thank \nyou to a remarkable individual, a remarkable American. I know that he \nhas great affection for this institution and its Members. I wish him \nthe very best of health and, I want him to know we will all miss him \nvery much.\n\n\n                              Max Cleland\n\n  I also want to pay tribute to our colleague from Georgia, Max \nCleland. I know very few people who have as many heroic qualities as \nMax Cleland does. It is not by pure circumstance that I mention Strom \nThurmond and Max Cleland next to each other. I mentioned the fact that \nStrom Thurmond served his country with great distinction in military \nservice during World War II. Max Cleland, of course, served his Nation \nwith great distinction during the Vietnam conflict and, of course, paid \na terrible price for that service. Just a month shy of completing his \ntour of duty, he suffered the terrible loss of both legs and an arm.\n  Yet despite those physical injuries, and the obstacles they \npresented, Max Cleland has made a remarkable contribution to this \ninstitution, to the people of his home state of Georgia. Max Cleland is \ntruly an American hero, not just because he wore the uniform of the \nUnited States and served in combat and suffered a terrible loss. He is \nan American hero because of his willingness and desire to serve the \npeople of his country in a continuing fashion beyond that of a military \nuniform. He has done so in the State of Georgia, holding office there \nas well as here in the Senate. I don't know of anyone who is held in \nsuch a high regard and with such respect by all of us as Max Cleland.\n  One of Senator Cleland's favorite poets, William Butler Yeats, once \nwrote: ``Too long a sacrifice can make a stone of the heart.''\n  In the case of Max Cleland, his enormous sacrifice to his country \nonly emboldened his golden nature, and increased his desire to dedicate \nhimself to improving the lives of others.\n  I will miss him very much. When the 108th Congress convenes, it just \nwon't seem quite right that Max Cleland is not among us--he has a \nwonderful sense of humor, a great sense of history, a great love of his \ncountry. I deeply regret the people of Georgia didn't see fit to send \nhim back to serve with us. I don't know his successor. I am sure he is \na fine person. I am sure he won't mind if I say I am going to miss Max \nvery much, but I know I have a lifelong friend in Max Cleland.\n  Just prior to coming back to Washington, it was announced that Max \nand Nancy are going to be wed. My wife Jackie and I wish both of them \nthe best in the years ahead.\n\n\n                              Jesse Helms\n\n  I also want to pay tribute to my friend and colleague from North \nCarolina, Senator Jesse Helms. I don't\n\n[[Page S11236]]\n\nknow of anyone here I probably disagreed with more over the past 22 \nyears than Jesse Helms. But I also don't know of anyone with whom I \nhave had a better relationship over the last 22 years. I know that \nsounds somewhat of a contradiction to people who watch this \ninstitution, that people with whom you can have profound and \nsignificant disagreements can also be people you hold in high regard \nand respect.\n  Senator Jesse Helms and I have fought tooth and nail on almost every \nissue I can think of. But I don't know of a finer gentleman, a more \ndecent human being than Jesse Helms. And we have disagreed on policy \nmatters over and over again--he is a passionate conservative, his \nvoting record has scored a 100 percent rating from American \nConservative Union throughout his 30 years here, and he is deeply proud \nof the fact that during those years he has one of the highest voting \nrecords of loyalty to the Republican Party, in excess of 95 percent.\n  It is that passion which I admire. We don't have enough of it in \npolitics today, in my view. And while I wish we had more of on it our \nside, I respect it when I see it in anyone. Jesse Helms certainly \nbrings it to his public service. I will miss his service here. I will \nmiss working with him. There were many occasions when we actually did \nfind common ground, as we do so frequently here, on matters that don't \nachieve the high profile status as matters of disagreement do. He \nserved his State of North Carolina well. He served and represented a \npoint of view embraced by many.\n  I will miss him on a personal level as a kind and thoughtful \nindividual. Jackie and I wish he and Dot the very best in the years to \ncome.\n\n\n                             Bob Torricelli\n\n  Mr. President, Robert Torricelli is leaving the Senate. He made the \ndecision this fall not to seek reelection in the midst of his election. \nA lot of attention has been focused on that decision, but for those us \nof who have known Bob Torricelli over his 20 years of public service--\n14 years in the House, 6 years in the Senate--Bob Torricelli is a lot \nmore than an individual who decided to pull out of a race in New Jersey \nthis year. He is a passionate fighter for things he believes and he has \ncompiled a wonderful record of public service.\n  I want the Record to reflect that Bob Torricelli was a fine Senator, \na fine Member of Congress. He fought very hard on behalf of his \nconstituents, fought very hard on the issues he cared deeply about. We \nhad our disagreements over Cuban policy frequently. I always used to \nsay, when Bob Torricelli came to the floor to take the other side, he \nwas a formidable opponent.\n  He was an excellent debater, one who embraced his views with a great \ndeal of knowledge and a great deal of passion and feeling. He became \nactive in Democratic Party politics at an early age. His passion for \npolitics is something all of us came to appreciate in the Senate during \nhis years. He was elected to the House at age 31 in 1982. He did a \ntremendous job there, serving on the House International Relations \nCommittee, and rose to prominence as a House member, as a leading voice \nfor advancing and expanding democracy and human rights worldwide.\n  In 1996, he came to the Senate. His efforts on behalf of tax, \nemployment, environmental, education, and health issues are things we \nare all well aware of. He has wonderful legislative skills and was a \ngreat battler on behalf of the Democratic Party.\n  He led the Senate Democratic campaign committee during his first term \nin a cycle during which he raised a lot of money to support Democratic \ncandidates across the country. It is a thankless job. But for those of \nus who stand for election or reelection, you have to have someone who \nwill head up these committees and do so with a great deal of energy. \nBob Torricelli certainly did that for a lot of people whose careers \nmight have been terminated more briefly had it not been for his \ndedication to seeing to it that Democratic candidates would have a good \nchance to be heard.\n  I would not want this session to end without expressing my gratitude \nto Bob Torricelli for his service in this body and his service to the \npeople of New Jersey.\n\n\n                               Phil Gramm\n\n  Mr. President, Phil Gramm is also leaving the Senate, going to work \nfor UBS Warburg. Their offices are in Connecticut, so I will be looking \nforward, very carefully, at what Phil Gramm does as a new part-time \nconstituent of mine. I say that somewhat facetiously of course.\n  Phil Gramm has had a very distinguished career in public life. We \nhave served together on the Banking Committee during his entire time in \nthe Senate. We have worked together very closely on matters affecting \nthe securities industry. We coauthored a number of bills together \nduring our joint service. We were elected to the House together. Phil \nwas a Democrat in those days, then became a Republican, was elected to \nthe Senate as a Republican. He has authored major pieces of legislation \nduring his career.\n  In fact, the Brookings Institution listed three of the bills that \nPhil Gramm authored or coauthored as among a handful of the most \nsignificant pieces of legislation in the 20th century, including the \nGramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced budget proposal which attracted a wide \ndegree of attention during the 1980s. He made a mark here as a \ntenacious fighter for what he believes in. One of the most difficult \nopponents you could have on an issue is Phil Gramm. He doesn't take \nmany prisoners, and he fights very hard for the matters in which he \nbelieves. I thank him for his service and wish him well in the years \nahead.\n\n\n                             Jean Carnahan\n\n  Mr. President, I want to mention Jean Carnahan, who had a short \nservice in this body. All of us have a deep appreciation for the \ncircumstances under which she arrived--one of the most tragic set of \ncircumstances any of us can imagine. She did a remarkable job, coming \nin under difficult circumstances, and we owe her a debt of gratitude \nfor the courageous and selfless service that she provided to the people \nof Missouri, the American public, and the sense of silent grace with \nwhich she handled those personal difficulties.\n  She didn't just simply show up in the Senate--she thrived here. All \nof our colleagues would agree when I say that learning to navigate the \nways of the Senate can be difficult for anybody, but for somebody who \nnever served in public office, having, of course, been the first lady \nof her State of Missouri for 8 years, Jean Carnahan did a remarkable \njob during her time here. She made a difference on numerous pieces of \nlegislation in which she helped to forge compromises. While her tenure \nmay have been brief, she left a mark worthy of those with much longer \nservice. All of us express nothing but our very best wishes to Jean \nCarnahan and to her family in the coming years. She has become a good \nfriend to us here. I thank her for her service, and I am sure she will \nfind other ways to contribute and provide services for the people of \nthis country.\n\n\n                            Frank Murkowski\n\n  Frank Murkowski and I were elected to the Senate together in 1980. He \nhas now been elected Governor to the State of Alaska. He is moving on \nto other areas of public service. He has done a very fine job here and \nhas made a significant contribution representing the people of Alaska. \nHe had a successful career as a businessman in Alaska before coming to \nthe Senate. He was President of the Alaska National Bank from 1970 to \n1980.\n  Since his arrival here, he has kept Alaska first and foremost in his \nmind. He has been an extraordinary defender of Alaska's interests. But \nhe made many contributions, as well, to the national agenda.\n  In fact, many of his biggest fights have greatly benefitted our \nNation as a whole. In 1996, for example, Frank Murkowski led the \ncongressional effort to pass the omnibus parks bill, which created or \nimproved more than 100 national parks, forests, preserves and historic \nsites nationwide, including two in Alaska.\n  And, for more than 25 years, Frank and his wife, Nancy, have been \nleaders in the fight against breast cancer in rural Alaska, and other \nareas where access to early testing is severely lacking. He also led a \nnational effort against breast cancer here in Washington, and has been \nan integral part of securing increased Federal funding for breast \ncancer research and treatment nationwide.\n\n[[Page S11237]]\n\n  He has been a passionate advocate of oil and gas exploration in \nAlaska--one of the major debates in this body. I disagreed with Frank \nMurkowski about allowing drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge, but he certainly fought very hard on behalf of his beliefs, \nshowing up with charts and graphs and pictures of wildlife and the \nlike, day after day during that debate.\n  The people of Alaska have now elected him as their Governor. I know \nall of us wish he and his wife Nancy well as they assume new \nresponsibilities in Juneau, Alaska.\n\n\n                             Fred Thompson\n\n  Mr. President, I pay tribute to and express my gratitude to Senator \nFred Thompson of Tennessee, as well, for his service here. He has made \na significant contribution to public life during his years here in the \nSenate, as well as prior to arriving here. Fred's career in politics \nhas truly been one of life imitating art imitating life.\n  How else can you describe a man who can be seen on the Senate floor \ndebating, only to see him later that evening playing a district \nattorney on the television show ``Law and Order''? On just about any \ngiven Sunday, you can catch Fred Thompson on cable in a rerun of ``Die \nHard II,'' or ``The Hunt for Red October.'' So he has had a \ndistinguished career in film and television, also.\n  But to suggest that was the sum total of Fred Thompson's life would \nbe a tragic mistake. There is a lot more to it. He has made significant \ncontributions in real life for over 30 years. He did serve as an \nassistant U.S. attorney at one point in his life. He has been a \nprominent public figure during some of the most critical moments in our \nNation's history--not only as chairman of the Governmental Relations \nCommittee, but also during the Watergate crisis in the early 1970s.\n  Fred Thompson was just a few years out of Vanderbilt Law School when \nhe was named minority counsel to the Senate Watergate Committee in \n1973. He has been commended on many occasions for his role in the \npublic disclosure of the Oval Office audio tapes, and that deserves \nmention here again today.\n  Fred Thompson's early impact on the American political scene \nforeshadowed his later career and success in the Senate, and his ever-\ngrowing popularity in Tennessee. In 1994, he was elected by the people \nof that State to fill the seat left vacant by the election of Senator \nAl Gore as Vice-President. When he was voted in for a full Senate term \nin 1996, he received the highest number of votes cast for any candidate \nfor any office in Tennessee history.\n  Fred Thompson has compiled a distinguished career over the years, as \nI mentioned earlier, as an assistant U.S. attorney, as Watergate \ncounsel and, of course, during his years in the Senate. We are going to \nmiss him here. He and his wife Geri, I am sure, are going to have a \nbright future, and I have a feeling we will be hearing more about Fred \nThompson in the years to come.\n\n\n                              Robert Smith\n\n  Mr. President, Bob Smith from New Hampshire is also leaving the \nSenate. While, again, we have been on not only different sides of the \naisle but on the different sides of many, if not most, issues that come \nbefore the Senate, I thank Bob Smith for his service to his State of \nNew Hampshire and to the causes which he embraced very firmly.\n  Bob Smith is a very conservative Member of this body. He has also \nbecome a leading advocate, during his latter years of service, on \nenvironmental questions affecting not only the State of New Hampshire, \nbut also environmental issues across the country, including his work on \nhelping to clean up and restore the Florida Everglades. He opposed \ndrilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge despite strong support \nfrom the Bush administration and Senator Frank Murkowski.\n  So Bob Smith was more diverse in his views than some might have \notherwise believed. Again, I thank him for his service. We didn't agree \non many substantive issues that came before this body, but he was a \npassionate fighter for views he held. My wife Jackie and I wish him and \nhis wife Jo Ann all the best in the future.\n\n\n                             tim hutchinson\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Tim Hutchinson, who will be leaving the United \nStates Senate at the conclusion of the 107th Congress.\n  Although Senator Hutchinson and I have not agreed on every issue that \nhas come before us, I have always considered him a friend, and I have \nalways respected his convictions. He has certainly served as a capable \nand loyal advocate for the people of his home state of Arkansas.\n  Mr. President, I had the good fortune of getting to know Tim \nHutchinson very well during his six years in the Senate. We served \ntogether on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. And, \nin 2000, Senator Hutchinson and I co-founded the Senate Biotechnology \nCaucus, which has played an important role in educating Members of \nCongress and the public about recent developments in medical and \ngenetic research.\n  Throughout his 10 years in Washington--4 years in the House of \nRepresentatives and 6 here in the Senate--Tim Hutchinson has shown a \ndeep commitment to improving the education of America's children, \nstrengthening our national security, increasing access to healthcare, \nand safeguarding the often overlooked interests of rural America.\n  Given his background, these priorities are not surprising. Tim \nHutchinson himself was born on a small farm in rural Gravette, \nArkansas. And he was educated as a minister at Bob Jones University in \nSouth Carolina.\n  After graduating from college, he returned to Gravette, where he \nopened a Christian day school and taught history at nearby John Brown \nUniversity. I have always believed that his background as an educator \nmade Senator Hutchinson one of the most thoughtful and well-spoken \nmembers of this body.\n  Tim Hutchinson's election to the Senate in 1996 was the culmination \nof a 10-year political evolution, which began with his election to the \nArkansas Statehouse in 1985. While there, he gained a state-wide \nreputation as a tireless advocate of law enforcement.\n  Tim Hutchinson was elected to the United States House of \nRepresentatives in 1993, and in 1996 he became the first Republican in \nArkansas history to win a popular election to the Senate.\n  As a Senator Tim Hutchinson remained a committed advocate for \nconservative causes--consistently scoring over 90 percent for his \nvoting record by the American Conservative Union.\n  However, there were also several instances when Senator Hutchinson \ntook the lead on important issues that crossed party lines. For \nexample, he has always had an interest in improving public education in \nAmerica, and was an integral part of the effort to create tax free \neducation savings accounts.\n  And, during the 107th Congress, Senator Hutchinson introduced the \nNurse Employment and Education Development Act--a landmark piece of bi-\npartisan legislation to address the critical nursing shortage affecting \nrural Arkansas and the country as a whole.\n  This year, the NEED Act was incorporated into the Nurse Reinvestment \nAct, which President Bush recently signed into law. This legislation \nstands as a fitting coda to Tim Hutchinson's tenure in the U.S. \nSenate--its positive impact will be felt across America for years to \ncome.\n  Mr. President, I will miss having Tim Hutchinson as a colleague. My \nwife Jackie and I wish him and his wife Randy, all the best in future \nyear.\n  I thank all 10 of these Members for their friendship. I look forward \nto seeing them in the years ahead, and I wish them and their families \nthe very best in the years that come down the road.\n\n\n                             FRED THOMPSON\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to recognize my friend the Senior \nSenator from Tennessee. Fred Thompson will retire this year after eight \ndistinguished years in the Senate. He has packed a great deal in those \neight years. He has been a forceful leader who has made significant \ncontributions to our country in a short amount time.\n  Senator Thompson was born and raised in Lawrenceburg, TN, a little \ntown sited by the great frontiersman and Congressman Davy Crockett. \nLike Crockett, Senator Thompson charted a path in life that has allowed \nhim to use his character and great abilities for interests larger than \nhimself. He received his undergraduate degree from Memphis State \nUniversity and completed his law degree at Vanderbilt University\n\n[[Page S11238]]\n\nin 1967. In 1973 and '74, Senator Thompson served as minority counsel \nto the vice chairman of the Senate Watergate Committee, his mentor, \nSenator, now Ambassador, Howard Baker. He served as Special Counsel to \nboth the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate \nCommittee on Foreign Relations. Senator Thompson is among the most \njunior Senators in the history of the Senate to have ever served as \nChairman of a Standing Senate Committee.\n  But Senator Thompson's skills and talents go far beyond his \ncontributions to the Senate. He is also a very fine actor, not \nwithstanding Senator McCain's critiques of his performances. He has an \nexpansive list of movie and television roles that highlight his \ncommanding presence and impressive style. We will continue to enjoy \nseeing him shine in his renewed acting career. He's had excellent real \nlife practice in the Senate.\n  We will miss Fred Thompson. We will miss his common sense, sharp wit \nand decency. All of his friends in the Senate wish Fred and his new \nbride, Jeri, all the best in their new lives together. I am proud to \nhave served with him.\n\n\n                               PHIL GRAMM\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to recognize the Senior Senator from Texas. \nSenator Phil Gramm will retire this year after 24 distinguished years \nin the U.S. Congress, three terms in the House and three terms in the \nSenate. He will be missed.\n  Thirty-five years ago Senator Gramm received his Ph.D in Economics \nfrom the University of Georgia. After his time in Georgia, Senator \nGramm began his college teaching career at Texas A  University as an \nAssistant Professor of Economics in 1967. By 1973, he became the \nyoungest Full Professor in the history of the Texas A Economics \nDepartment. His grasp and understanding of economics have been \nimportant factors in our Congressional debate and government policy \nover the last twenty-four years.\n  I have had the privilege to serve with Senator Gramm on both the \nSenate Banking and Budget Committees. I have seen first hand the power \nof his intellect and grasp of the issues that have advanced free trade \nand strengthened our economy and the foundation of our democracy. His \ncontributions to our country are many. He authored numerous major \npieces of legislation during his career--and none more important than \nthe Gramm/Rudman/Hollings Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control \nAct and the Gramm/Leach/Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act.\n  All of his friends in the Senate wish Wendy and Phil much success as \nhe takes on new responsibilities. He will now have more time to help \nR.C. Slocum coach the A Aggies. The Congress and America are stronger \ntoday for Senator Gramm having served in Congress. I am proud to have \nserved with him.\n\n\n                              MAX CLELAND\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to recognize my longtime friend the Senior \nSenator from Georgia. Max Cleland and I arrived in the Senate together \nin 1997. He quickly became a respected U.S. Senator. Max Cleland has \nbeen a role model for many people over the years. And, his years of \nselfless public service have made America a better and stronger nation.\n  Senator Cleland joined the Army ROTC program at Stetson University in \nFlorida and went on to earn a Masters Degree in American History from \nEmory University as a commissioned Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Army. \nIn 1967 he volunteered for service in Vietnam. The next year he was \npromoted to the rank of Captain and soon after he was seriously wounded \nlosing both his legs and his right arm. Senator Cleland's determination \nand spirit turned his experience in Vietnam into a continuing passion \nfor interests greater than his own. His service in Vietnam further \nmotivated him to continue to help shape America.\n  At the age of 28, he won a seat in the Georgia State Senate making \nhim the youngest member and the only Vietnam veteran in that \nlegislative body at that time. Seven years later, President Jimmy \nCarter appointed him Administrator of the U.S. Veterans Administration. \nHe was the youngest VA Administrator ever and the first veteran of \nVietnam in that post. In 1982, he became the youngest Georgia Secretary \nof State and held that position for three terms until he began his \ncampaign for the United States Senate in 1995.\n  Senator Cleland is an inspiration to all of us. We will miss his \nhonesty, integrity, spirit and leadership in this body. We wish him \nwell and thank him for his service and contributions to our country. I \nam privileged and proud to have served in the Senate with my friend and \ncolleague Max Cleland. I salute you, Captain. You will be missed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). Who seeks recognition? The \nSenator from Missouri, Mrs. Carnahan.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his kind and \ngenerous remarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/18/senate-section/article/S11238-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11238-S11239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FAREWELL TO THE SENATE\n\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, today I am reminded that 2 years ago \nwhen I came to the Senate, it was with a heavy heart. Life had not \nturned out the way it was supposed to. My husband, not I, was supposed \nto have been sworn in to the Senate, and I was to be seated in the \ngallery, beaming with delight at the shared victory we had won.\n  As someone has pointed out, life is not the way it is supposed to be. \nLife is the way it is, and it is the way we cope with it that makes a \ndifference. I had some difficult lessons to learn in that regard.\n  It was not by chance when I stepped down from the dais, after being \nsworn in, that the first to welcome me was Senator Joe Biden. He had \ncome to this Chamber many years ago after a tragic loss in his own \nlife. He told me the story of having been greeted by Senator McClellan \nof Arkansas, who looked him in the eye and said: Work, hard work, it is \nthe sure path to healing.\n  Senator Biden said: I thought at the time how callous that advice \nwas; he just does not understand the hurt I am feeling. He later found \nout Senator McClellan spoke from having experienced a family tragedy of \noverwhelming proportion. Joe Biden took the advice to heart and he \npassed it on to me. You were right, Joe, and I thank you for that \nwisdom.\n  There has been much work to throw ourselves into during the 107th \nCongress. It has been a monumental period in our Nation's history, a \ntime marred by unprecedented national tragedy, deep political \ndivisions, economic upheavals, corporate corruption, continued threats \nto our national security, and now the gathering clouds of war. Through \nall of these disasters, we have seen the triumph of the American \nspirit. Yes, Americans have taken to heart the advice Louis Pasteur \nonce gave to a group of young people. He said: Do not let yourselves be \ndiscouraged by the sadness of certain hours which passes over nations.\n  Thankfully, the Congress has refused to be discouraged. We have \nendured anthrax attacks, dismantled offices, tighter security measures, \nmajor alterations to the Capitol complex, not to mention three shifts \nin legislative leadership. Through it all, we have managed to address a \nnumber of important issues. We passed a historic tax cut, reformed \neducation, overhauled campaign finance laws, called corporate America \nto a higher standard, and prepared our Nation to respond to global \nterrorism. We have found that being the guardian of freedom is a \nrelentless and consuming work. The immensity of our task would cripple \na lesser people. Rather than be cowered by events, America and her \ninstitutions have always been emboldened during times of crisis. I am \nconvinced the Author of Liberty, who has blessed and protected our \nNation in the past, will enable us to meet the stern responsibilities \nof the present.\n\n  As the 108th Congress takes on this new burden, I will not be among \nthem but my prayers will be with them. I leave realizing that to have \nserved in the Senate for even a short while is an honor afforded very \nfew in their lifetime. I am forever grateful to the people of Missouri \nwho have allowed me and my family to serve them for three generations. \nReporters often ask me to reflect on those years. Most recently, I was \nasked what impressed me most during my time in the Senate. And I\n\n[[Page S11239]]\n\nreplied it was the diligence beyond duty shown by all who are part of \nthis Chamber--Democrats, Republicans, and independents. Staff, \nparliamentarians, clerks, pages, security officers, maintenance \nworkers, elevator operators, all spend long hours serving America. For \nthe most part, their names, their selfless deeds will go unrecorded, \nbut their life and work demonstrate a deep devotion to duty.\n  In recognition of the loyalty and exemplary work of my own staff, I \nask unanimous consent to have their names printed in the Record at the \nclose of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. At this time I recognize sadly that two great towers \nof strength will be missed in this Chamber. My friend and colleague, \nMax Cleland, from his wheelchair stands taller than most men ever will. \nThe Senate will be greatly diminished by his absence. And that we will \nno longer hear the spirited voice of Paul Wellstone summoning us to \nstand up and fight will likewise diminish the fervor of this body.\n  Our Nation and my party have been further blessed by the courageous \nleadership of Senator Daschle and Senator Harry Reid. They have shown \nthe grace under pressure that marks true greatness.\n  I would be remiss if I did not mention the women of the Senate whose \nfriendship has blessed and brightened my life. I am grateful, too, for \nthe wholehearted and unwavering support of my Democratic colleagues in \nmy every endeavor, and I especially appreciate those from the other \nside of the aisle, though far fewer in number, who graciously \nencouraged me as well.\n  Tradition affords those of us who leave the Senate, either by our own \nwill or the will of the electorate, the opportunity to reflect on the \ntime in this historic Chamber, to perhaps even engage in some \nunsolicited advice. I could not pass up that opportunity. My advice \ncomes not as a seasoned insider but as one who came for a season to \nserve among my colleagues. Mine are simple maxims that spring from the \nheart, a heart filled with love for the Senate and for my country.\n\n  First, when my colleagues think on the role of government, seek a \nbalance. Seek a balance between one that does everything and one that \ndoes nothing. And where there is talk of war, let there be the free and \nopen debate that becomes our great Nation. And when there are judges to \nbe appointed, let them be selected for their temperament and \njurisprudence and not for political ideology that satisfies a special \ninterest group.\n  When we lay out our energy and environment policy, let it not be for \nshort-term gain but for the well-being of our grandchildren and the \nsurvival of our planet. And when my colleagues speak of leaving no \nchild behind, let that not be a mantra but a mission, fervent and \nfunded. When health care is thought about, the health care needs of \nchildren, family, and seniors--and I hope that will be often--I urge my \ncolleagues to lay aside partisanship and heed the plight of the hurting \nand the helpless in our society.\n  I will vote for the homeland bill, as I have each step of the way, \nfor we must make certain the information disconnect that allowed a 9/11 \nto occur never happens again.\n  During an earlier global conflict, President Roosevelt called for \nstout hearts and strong arms with which to strike mighty blows for \nfreedom and truth. Well, that is what I am hoping this consolidation \nand coordination of effort will help us to accomplish.\n  As I vote for this bill, I do so with a caution. The pursuit of \nterrorists and the protection of basic freedoms will be our greatest \nchallenge in the years ahead. In the quest to uproot terrorism, let us \ntake care to preserve those precious liberties upon which our Nation is \nfounded and upon which democracy depends. I have no doubt that in this \ngood and godly work we will ultimately succeed.\n  Let me conclude by saying that this farewell to the Senate is a \nbittersweet moment for me, one that churns up a mixture of memories and \nemotions. One such memory was of a visit I made to the Corcoran Art \nGallery to see the Jackie Kennedy exhibit. One of the displays was a \nhandwritten letter that Mrs. Kennedy sent to a friend after completing \nan extensive project at the White House.\n  She wrote:\n\n       How sad it is . . . when a work we love doing . . . is \n     finally finished.\n\n  I know how she felt.\n  I still believe, as did my husband, that public service is a good and \nnoble work worthy of our lives. Perhaps a former Member of this Chamber \nsaid it best. He was not of my party, but he certainly was of my \nprinciples. Senator Lowell Weicker wrote:\n\n       For all the licks anyone takes by choosing public service,\n       . . . there is the elation of having achieved for good \n     purpose what none thought possible.\n       And such feelings far exceed . . . whatever the hurt . . . \n     for having tasted the battle.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       Current Staff of Senator Jean Carnahan:\n     Isiah Akin, Legislative Aide\n     Amy Barber, Legislative Assistant\n     John Beakley, Special Assistant to the Senator\n     Ann Bickel, Assistant to the State Director\n     Todd Britt, Director, Eastern Missouri\n     Michael Carrasco, Office Manager\n     Chad Chitwood, Southwest Area Regional Coordinator\n     Qiana Combs, Deputy Director, Western Region\n     Sonja Cureton, Constituent Services Representative\n     Julie Egermayer, Constituent Services Representative\n     Sarah Elmore, Staff Assistant\n     Bradley Epperson, Special Advisor\n     Alex Formuzis, Press Secretary\n     Sandy Fried, Legislative Assistant\n     Rosie Haertling, Casework Supervisor\n     Stacy Henry, Assistant Scheduler\n     Margaret Hsiang, Legislative Correspondent\n     Lisa Jaworski, Legislative Aide\n     Amy Jordan-Wooden, State Director\n     Michele Ludeman, Caseworker/Administrative Assistant\n     Bryan Mitchell, Legislative Correspondent\n     Jeff Morrison, System Administrator\n     Stephen Neuman, Legislative Assistant\n     Tom Neumeyer, Southeast Area Regional Coordinator\n     Neal Orringer, Military Legislative Assistant\n     Alison Paul, Staff Assistant\n     Caroline Pelot, Deputy Director, Eastern Missouri\n     Jason Ramsey, Director, Central Missouri\n     Ryan Rhodes, Scheduler/Executive Assistant\n     Garon Robinnett, Staff Assistant\n     David Schanzer, Legislative Director\n     Raymond Schrock, Special Projects Coordinator\n     Vance Serchuk, Legislative Correspondent\n     Jan Singlemann, Regional Aide\n     Rachel Storch, Deputy Chief of Staff\n     Stephen Sugg, Legislative Assistant\n     Roy Temple, Chief of Staff\n     Cindy Townes, Data Entry Clerk\n     Pam Townsend, Staff Assistant\n     Courtney Weiner, Legislative Correspondent\n     Rogerick Wilson, Constituent Services Representative\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/18/senate-section/article/S11239-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11239-S11240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have a series of parliamentary inquiries. \nAs I understand the situation on tomorrow, Tuesday, there will be 90 \nminutes of debate before a vote occurs at 10:30; during that 90 minutes \nof debate there will be 30 minutes under the control of Mr. Lott, 30 \nminutes under the control of Mr. Daschle, and 30 minutes under the \ncontrol of Mr. Byrd; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, at 10:30 it is my understanding--and I would \nlike to inquire if I am correct in my understanding--the first vote \nwill occur on the Daschle-Lieberman second-degree amendment No. 4953; a \nsecond vote will occur on the Daschle-Lieberman first-degree amendment \nNo. 4911; a third vote will occur on the Thompson substitute, House \nbill No. 4901; the fourth vote will occur on cloture on H.R. 5005; am I \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair but let me continue.\n  As I understand it, the Thompson substitute, House bill No. 4901, \nthat is\n\n[[Page S11240]]\n\nthe substitute which was passed by the House of Representatives, sent \nto the Senate, and called up and laid before the Senate. That is the \nbill which first saw the light of day in the Senate, as I understand \nit, on or about the early morning hours of this last Wednesday, this \npast Wednesday of last week. Is that the amendment, the Thompson \nsubstitute amendment, that is the House bill which I, on a number of \noccasions, have referred to as being a bill of 484 pages?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment does contain that number of \npages.\n  Mr. BYRD. I just wanted to be sure to establish in my own mind and \ncall to the Senate's attention that that will be the third vote, then, \non that bill as we come to tomorrow morning, Tuesday of this week.\n  Now, Mr. President, a further parliamentary inquiry: Am I correct in \nstating that cloture on the bill, H.R. 5005, is not vitiated by \nquestion of the adoption of the substitute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Cloture on the bill is not vitiated by that \naction.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Further parliamentary inquiry: Is it not a fact that if cloture is \ninvoked on H.R. 5005, under the rule, 30 hours then will ensue under \nthat cloture measure?\n  If cloture is invoked, there will be 30 hours on H.R. 5005, am I \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Cloture under this consideration is 30 hours.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. In this instance, if the Thompson \nsubstitute, the House bill No. 4901, if that substitute is adopted and \ncloture then is invoked on H.R. 5005, will amendments be in order \nduring those 30 hours?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The adoption of the Thompson substitute \nprecludes amendments.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thought that was the case.\n  The adoption of the Thompson substitute means as far as further \namendments are concerned, the ball game is over; am I correct in \nputting it in that form?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I say all that, Mr. President, to say this: On last Friday \nwhen the Senate invoked cloture, what was cloture invoked on, may I ask \nof the Chair? On what did the Senate then invoke cloture?\n  I see my loss of memory is not too bad after all. It seems to be \nshared by others. Of course, I am 85--almost.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are checking the record.\n  Mr. BYRD. I say that with all respect, due respect and ample respect \nto the Chair, the Parliamentarian, and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Cloture has been invoked on amendment No. \n4901, the Thompson amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Now, Mr. President, the point I am trying to make here is--and I \nwanted it in the Record, and I wanted Senators to be aware of what they \ndid when they voted to invoke cloture on last Friday. The distinguished \noccupant of the chair did not vote to invoke cloture, nor did this \nSenator, who now is speaking.\n  There were 29 Democrats who voted against cloture last Friday. There \nwere 17 Democrats who voted for cloture last Friday. As I note--and \nthis may have been a cursory examination I have made--but I have noted, \nin a cursory examination, I believe two Republicans who were absent \nwould have voted with me against cloture and I believe four Democrats \nwho were absent would have voted with me against cloture.\n  In any event, had 6 of the 17 Democrats who voted for cloture voted \nagainst cloture last Friday, we would not be under cloture at this \npoint because the number of Senators voting for cloture on last Friday \nwould have been only 59 and the number, therefore, would have fallen 1 \nvote short of cloture.\n  Now, I tried to get my fellow Democrats to vote against cloture \nbecause I felt that we ought to have more time to discuss this homeland \nsecurity bill, which had been dropped on our desks virtually out of the \nshades of the early morning as they were lifting and the golden fingers \nof dawn were streaking across the land. I tried to get several Senators \nto vote against cloture, my plea being: ``Don't vote for cloture today. \nGive us a little more time. If we don't vote for cloture today, it will \nbe voted next week ``--meaning this week, which we have now started. \n``Don't vote for cloture today.''\n  One or two Senators listened to my importunings and voted against \ncloture.\n  Mr. President, I ask for an additional 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is granted an \nadditional 3 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, one or two Senators listened and voted \nagainst cloture. Some others listened and didn't vote against cloture \nbut voted for cloture, which was their right to do. But let me just \nshow what happened there.\n  They voted for cloture. Cloture was invoked. Some of those Senators \nwith whom I talked said: ``You have 30 hours in which amendments can be \noffered, and some of the problems that you outlined, you can get a vote \non them, and possibly those can be amended and corrected.''\n  As we have seen, only one amendment--one amendment--was offered. It \nfilled up that particular tree, so that no other amendments could be \noffered while that amendment was pending. But our good friends on the \nother side said: This far, no farther. You have offered an amendment--\nmeaning Mr. Daschle had offered an amendment on behalf of Mr. \nLieberman; that amendment was pending--you have offered this amendment. \nThat's the amendment we are going to vote on. You are not going to get \nto to offer any more amendments. The 30 hours will be run on that one \namendment.\n\n  So I hope Senators in the future will remember. Of course, I knew \nthat could be done. But I have to say I think that is the first time in \nmy memory--and I have been here during the great civil rights debates \nof the 1960s--I believe that is the first time--and I don't say it \ncritically of the Republicans; they had that right, they played by the \nrules. Our problem is we don't all know the rules. But they played by \nthe rules. We have one amendment. The 30 hours will be gone Tuesday \nmorning, and that one amendment is it, and I mean ``it.''\n  Now, when cloture is invoked on H.R. 5005, as amended, if amended, we \nwon't be able to offer any amendments. We can talk, but the ball game \nis over when we adopt the Thompson substitute. That substitute wipes \nout everything. It wipes out H.R. 5005, as far as that is concerned.\n  So the point is, we voted cloture on ourselves. We did it to \nourselves on this side. I knew every Republican would vote for cloture, \nbut I hoped that at least enough Democrats would vote against cloture--\nwe only needed six more votes in opposition. But we did it. We did it \nto ourselves. We have had a chance to offer only one amendment. That is \nit. The Republicans say: That is it, no more amendments, and we will \nvote on Tuesday.\n  I just say this so that our friends on my side of the aisle in \nparticular will know what their vote for cloture on Friday has done to \ndefeat our chances to have other amendments voted on.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken to the two leaders. There will \nbe no cloture vote this afternoon, and likely no other votes this \nafternoon. Members will have all the opportunity they want to debate \nthe Shedd nomination or, of course, the homeland security matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Levin). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have 1 minute and a half left in morning \nbusiness.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I might have \n10 additional minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/18/senate-section/article/S11240-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11240-S11242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HOMELAND SECURITY\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I wish to talk for just a moment about \nwhere we are on the homeland security bill. I wish to talk about the \namendment on which we will be voting tomorrow morning because I think \nit is important for people to look at the issue, in terms of \nunderstanding the full picture, at least given each of our abilities to \nsee the full picture.\n\n[[Page S11241]]\n\n  We now have debated homeland security, I think, for seven or even \neight weeks. It is obviously an important issue. When you are creating \na new Department that will have 170,000 members--the largest \nreorganization of Government since the creation of the Defense \nDepartment--I think having a pretty extended debate is justified.\n  I say to people who are opposed to the bill that I hope they will \nrecognize that the debate has had an effect. The distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia, who has been perhaps the most outspoken opponent of \nthe bill, I think would agree that a major problem with the bill has \nbeen changed--that being, it would have transferred to the President a \nsubstantial ability to change the appropriation levels set by Congress, \nand as such would have redistributed power from the legislative branch \nto the executive branch.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? I ask that 2 minutes \nof my inquiry not be charged against his 10.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may I say right at that point that the \nSenator is correct. That was the major constitutional flaw. That was a \nmajor constitutional flaw. It dealt with the power over the purse which \nunder the Constitution is vested here in Congress. Senator Stevens, I \nwould have to say, was himself the foremost proponent of a change, \nbacked by some degree of constitutionality. He is the major proponent \non that side of the aisle of our veering away from that precipice and \nbringing us back to leaving control in the hands of the appropriations \ncommittees, and in the hands of Congress in large part.\n  Second, I would say one of the foremost proponents of recognizing \nthat constitutional flaw was the distinguished Senator from Texas, Mr. \nGramm. I am convinced in my own mind--although I was not a little fly \non the wall down at the White House listening in--that the Senator from \nTexas was a major, major proponent of bringing us back to our senses--\nor at least the administration back to its senses--with respect to that \nconstitutional flaw. I have to believe in my own mind that he argued \nwith them to that effect.\n  Listen, that is at least the one--that is the one in the Senator's \nmind, I would guess--unassailable point that the Senators from West \nVirginia and the Senator from Alaska make; that is, with respect to the \npower of the purse. You had better back off.\n  Those are my own words. But I have reason to believe the Senator from \nTexas is responsible in great measure for what occurred down at the \nWhite House with respect to its backing off on that point.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  If I am correct, or if I have failed and my guesswork is incorrect, \nplease say so.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the point I want to make--and I think it is \na specific lesson of how government works--is that those who have \nfollowed this long debate, who have listened to the Senator from West \nVirginia, and know he has been on the losing side of vote after vote \nmay say: What effect does he have?\n  He has had a profound effect. Even though he is not a supporter of \nthe bill today and won't be at the end of the day--and I have been in a \nsimilar position on many issues, as the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia knows--his major concern about the bill has been resolved. The \ndebate and the clarity of the argument we have had on the issue of the \npower of the purse has had a profound effect on the bill. So you can be \non the losing side of the votes and yet have a profound effect on the \nend product.\n  That is the point I wanted to make. The Senator is right. I thought \nit was a change that should be made, and it is a change that has been \nmade. I think it represents an improvement.\n  I want to talk very briefly about the bill. I think I have a copy of \nit right here. Let me remind people what happened. I think everybody \nwill understand the dilemma we were in.\n  We adjourned for the election with this issue unfinished. The \nPresident came back from the election with what I believe and what I \nthink the public perceives to be a strong mandate that this is the \nimportant issue that should be dealt with.\n  The President could have said: Well, I will wait until the new \nCongress when my party will be in control, and I will write this bill \nexactly like I want to write it. He could have done that. He did not do \nthat. And I believe that is wise. Instead, he sat down with three \nmembers of the opposition party and negotiated out additional \nclarifications in the bill. These clarifications are not profound, but \nthey are important.\n  As this reorganization process goes forward, and as 170,000 people \nare moved into one agency, these changes the President agreed to will \nassure that these workers and their representatives will have an \nopportunity to give input. They will have a due process procedure, but \nin the end the reorganization will go forward. The President will have \nthe right to exercise the same national security waiver that every \nPresident--first through executive order, and from the Carter \nadministration forward under law--since John Kennedy has been able to \nexercise.\n  The next thing we had to do to get into a position to pass this bill \nis make clear what the final version of the bill would look like. We \ndidn't want to end up with a week or two weeks of a conference with the \nHouse during this session where Congress is meeting after the \nelection--sometimes referred to as a lame duck session. Many Democrats \nwho are supportive of the bill wanted to be sure in negotiating with \nthe President and in negotiating with the authors of the bill that they \nwouldn't end up having to negotiate again with Republican leaders in \nthe House. Over the weekend--not this weekend, but the weekend before--\nwe sat down with the House leaders on this issue, and we negotiated out \na final product.\n  I would say of this 484 page bill, 98 percent of it is the Gramm-\nMiller substitute which we debated for weeks. There were several \nchanges made that have been much discussed. I believe there is a more \nefficient way of characterizing those changes than the way they have \nbeen characterized. I want to try to explain them.\n  Let me just first start by saying when the House writes a bill and \nthe Senate writes a bill, there are often differences in the bill, and \nthere is always give and take. Some have talked about extraneous \nmaterial in the bill. I would have to say that in my 24 years in \nCongress, there are almost always issues dealt with in a bill that some \npeople view as extraneous. I would say there are relatively few in this \nbill. But let me talk about the issues that are subject to the \namendment Senator Lieberman has offered. This amendment strikes \nprovisions in the compromise--I think there are seven of them. I don't \nhave my notes with me, but I remember them well enough to talk about \nthem.\n  Three of these provisions have to do with liability. Let me remind my \ncolleagues that since the Civil War, we have had provisions of law that \nhave dealt with liability for people who were producing new products \nfor war efforts. One of the ways of encouraging people to be innovative \nand one of the ways to get products from the drawing board to the \nbattlefield quickly is to protect people from liability.\n  There was a provision in the original Senate amendment, the Gramm-\nMiller amendment, that the Senators from Virginia were responsible for. \nThat was a provision whereby the Federal Government would indemnify \nmanufacturers of products that would be used in the war on terrorism, \nso that if a liability issue arose, the Federal Government would step \nin and basically cover the liability. I would have to say that was not \nmy preferred option, but in putting the amendment together we accepted \nit.\n  The House had another approach, which was to basically limit \nliability, require that lawsuits occur in Federal court, and set up a \nprocedure to deal with liability that arose in these issues.\n  In putting together the compromise with the House, we took something \nbetween the two that did not have the liability limits the House \nadopted but was a movement toward reducing runaway liability and \nremoving the taxpayer from the line of fire.\n  That accounts for three of the criticisms made. I want to address the \none that is most discussed, and that is the one that has to do with \nmercury-based injections and smallpox vaccine.\n\n[[Page S11242]]\n\n  Under the bill, as it is now written, we are treating smallpox \nvaccine as an instrument of the war on terrorism. Before, we had dealt \nwith it as a response to a disease. We had a liability fund for \nvaccines in the past, but now that we have eradicated smallpox, the \nonly fear we have of it is the reintroduction by terrorist elements. So \nwe bring smallpox vaccine under this liability limit.\n  Those of my age will remember, if you get a smallpox shot, you get a \nskin reaction which produces a permanent scar. I say to my colleagues \nthat this is pretty terrorism specific because no one would take a \nsmallpox vaccination except for the terrorist threat because there are \nrisks involved. Some small percentage of people have very negative \nreactions, some people die, and almost everybody has a scar from \nsmallpox.\n  This bill would require people who sue to enter into a negotiation \nwith the Justice Department before they file suit, and to negotiate the \npossibility of a payment out of an indemnity fund.\n  Some of our colleagues have said: Why did you make it retroactive? \nWasn't that some kind of benefit to some vaccine producer? I remind my \ncolleagues that nobody is taking smallpox vaccine now, nor would \nanybody take it unless there was an imminent threat. But we do have \nsome of the vaccine stockpiled.\n  Why would you make it retroactive to cover that stockpile that has \nalready been produced? The reason you do that is, if you give a \nprotection against liability for all vaccine produced in the future but \nnot for what we have stockpiled, the manufacturers will destroy the \nstockpile and produce more vaccine. And if we had a sudden threat, we \nwould not have the stockpile.\n  So if this were a vaccine that was routinely taken, then I think the \ncriticism would be well founded. But I think it is a total \nmischaracterization to say this is some kind of pharmaceutical bailout \nwhen it is targeted toward smallpox vaccine and the stockpile now has \nrelevance only in terms of terrorism.\n  In terms of manufactured products to use in the war on terrorism, I \nsimply say, in every major conflict in modern history, we have had some \nliability limits for the people producing things for wartime use.\n  The fourth provision that would be stricken has to do with the \nWellstone amendment. Senator Wellstone offered an amendment to the bill \nthat said, if you had a company that had ever been domiciled in the \nUnited States, and it was now domiciled anywhere else in the world, \nthat company could not participate in contracts for the war on \nterrorism. In the bill that is before us, a couple of provisions were \nadded to the Wellstone amendment that allows the President some \nflexibility in cases where the application of the Wellstone amendment \nwould actually cost American jobs, where it might leave only a sole \nbidder, or where the absence of competition could drive up costs.\n\n  You might say, how could it cost America jobs? Well, let's say you \nhave a company that was once based in America and still has very heavy \npresence in America but has its headquarters in France. Many companies \nare now international companies and where their home office is has \nceased to have a lot of relevance, in my mind. In any case, the product \nmade by the French-headquartered company might actually be produced in \nAmerica. We could not buy it because the company is now domiciled in \nFrance but once was domiciled in America--maybe in 1812--but yet we \ncould buy a product that was produced in another country by a company \nthat never had an American presence.\n  There might be national security reasons or job reasons to have a \nwaiver. The amendment before us would strike that waiver. I think it is \na good waiver. I think it is a good government provision. And I think \nit is one we should have.\n  Another amendment has to do with advisory committees. I couldn't care \nless about advisory committees. I think sometimes they serve a \nproductive purpose. I think in most cases they do not. But I think we \nare foolish to be striking advisory committees when the House has \nadjourned and may not come back to agree to the change if we make it. I \ndo not think we ought to jeopardize this bill.\n  Finally, there is a provision that establishes a broad authorization \noutline. No funds are appropriated for participating in the management \nof research. There is a definition that is written into the law that, \nas I understand it, would cover roughly 12 major research universities.\n  I just ask my colleagues to look at these overall seven provisions, \nand to ask themselves a question: Would the bill be better off without \nall seven, because they are all stricken in one amendment? I think the \nanswer is no. I think there is a logical justification for the \namendments in general. And I urge my colleagues to get the whole story \nbefore they cast their vote.\n  Finally--and I think this is of equal importance--this is an \nimportant bill. We are getting toward the end. This has been progress \nthat has been hard coming. And I think we take a risk, one that we \nshould not take, by making these changes. I do not think they are good \nchanges.\n  I think, overall, we are better off with these seven provisions in \nthe bill than we are without them. I think, overall, they are \ndefensible. Any changes you get in bringing the two Houses together in \nnegotiation often are subject to criticism, but I think these are \ndefensible.\n  I think we would be taking an unnecessary risk by changing the bill. \nI hope we will not do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I have spoken personally \nwith the minority leader, and he has acknowledged that this is the best \nway to proceed. I ask that the consent be granted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?

Even if that debate entails 30 hours in the train of a \nfavorable vote on cloture on H.R. 5005?\n  Mr. REID. That is right.\n  Mr. BYRD. So that, indeed, the request has no impact whatsoever on \nH.R. 5005.\n  Mr. REID. I would also ask that the previous order with respect to \nterrorism insurance remain in effect following the Shedd vote. The \norder in effect now is that we would do the terrorism bill immediately \nfollowing homeland security.

Mr. President, I just listened to the two Senators who \nare probably most involved with the details of this homeland security \nbill--very interesting comments. I have been, frankly, disappointed \nthat it has taken us as long as it has. We have been on this measure, I \nunderstand, now for about 7 weeks, and we are still not finished--a \nbill that needs to be finished. It needs to be there for security. Yet \nwe continue to debate and worry over issues that are not as significant \nas the passage of this bill.\n  I hope we are getting closer to passing a homeland security bill. It \nis our responsibility to do that. I am almost embarrassed that we are \nnot.\n  I am pleased that cloture was invoked and that we can move forward on \nthis bill that gives the President the tools he needs to protect our \nhomeland.\n  We have talked about the details. That is good. On the other hand, \nthere are provisions in there that generally most everyone would agree \nwe ought to be moving forward with: Immigration, to change the \nreorganization of that department so that you have more emphasis on the \nimmigration aspect with regard to terrorism; reorganization of the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms so that it can work better in \nterms of terrorism as opposed to law enforcement activities.\n  Personnel flexibility has been one we have talked about for a very \nlong time. Certainly, the President ought to have as much authority for \nflexibility as others have had and as he has in other departments.\n  We also need to have, obviously, some protection for the union \nrepresentatives, and it is there; research and development, aiming it \nmore toward terrorism, that is one of the amendments; critical \ninfrastructure protection, of course, so that we get into helping with \nthe private infrastructure such as dams, such as oil refineries, these \nkinds of things--important stuff to do--the Coast Guard, strengthening \ntheir position with respect to terrorism; the one on corporate \ninversion where there was concern about being offshore. The fact is it \nis only there to be used as long as it has specific economic security \nreasons to be used. I think that is reasonable. Airport security--all \nthese things are there.\n  Again, I thought during the last month or so it became pretty clear \nthat this session of the Congress has been exceptionally slow in moving \nforward. It has not accomplished many of the things we should have \naccomplished. I had hoped that with that in our background, we would be \nready to move forward to accomplish this one that is so obvious in \nneed. I hope we can do that.\n  I am glad we do have Members on both sides who recognize the \nimportance of doing this. We have carefully crafted language that will \nbe there. It is time for us to move forward. Whether there is anything \nelse that we really need to do in this lame duck session, I wouldn't \nargue that. We obviously have to have a CR. Apparently there is \nmovement toward doing something with terrorism liability. But this is \nthe one. This is what we need to do, and we need to move forward.\n  I do appreciate the work that has been done. Particularly Senator \nThompson and Senator Gramm have worked tirelessly in putting something \ntogether that will ensure homeland security and a department that will \nbe capable of moving forward to do the things that everybody \nunderstands we need to do. Frankly, there are no more excuses to delay \nthis bill. I certainly urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment and \npass the compromise bill so the President can sign this into law.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is sad and unfortunate that I and this \nchamber must say farewell to Senator Max Cleland. As a student, a \nsoldier, a public servant, and a U.S. Senator, Max Cleland has always \npersonified the best of this country. His has been a life of patriotism \nand sacrifice, of struggle and of triumph.\n  After graduating from college, which included an internship on \nCapitol Hill, and receiving a master's degree in American history, Max \nCleland volunteered for the Army and then volunteered for service in \nVietnam. In that brutal conflict, he lost both of his legs and an arm \nin a grenade explosion. But Max Cleland never gave up. He refused to \nbecome simply a tragic symbol of an unwanted and unpopular war.\n  At the age of 28, Max Cleland became the youngest State Senator in \nGeorgia. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed him to head the \nVeterans Administration, the youngest person ever to hold that post, \nand one of the best. In that position, among his many accomplishments, \nMax Cleland helped to improve the VA hospital system and reduce delays \nin paying veterans' benefits.\n  After that, he was elected to four terms as Secretary of State of \nGeorgia.\n  In 1996, Senator Cleland was elected to the U.S. Senate. After being \nsworn into office, he told supporters:\n\n       Your dreams can come true if you continue to believe in \n     them long enough, hard enough, and never give up on them.\n\n  What a role model Max Cleland is, not only for disabled Americans but \nfor all Americans. His life demonstrates what overcoming adversity--\nprobably adversity at its worst, or almost that, at least--really \nmeans.\n  As a triple amputee, life and work have not come easily. I have read \nit takes him 3 hours just to prepare for work each day. I would imagine \nit takes him longer than that, because it takes me that long many days. \nBut I cannot imagine the amount of pure grit it takes for this man just \nto live. At times I get up from my bed at 1 o'clock in the morning, 3 \no'clock in the morning, whatever, and adjust the temperature in my \nroom. If it is a little too cold or a little too warm, I have to get up \nand go outside my room and adjust the temperature. I think of that poor \nman, Max Cleland, and how it is for him if he gets too cold or too warm \nand has to adjust the temperature in the room. He has to get out of bed \nwith much more difficulty than I, and go to the thermostat and do that. \nSo what grit it must take of him just to live.\n  Well, one of Max Cleland's heroes is the great Franklin Roosevelt \nwho, confined to a wheelchair because of paralysis, encountered many of \nthe same obstacles and challenges that face Max. Still, Franklin \nRoosevelt was elected President four times and, as President, saw this \ncountry through the Great Depression and World War II.\n  I am proud to point out that another one of Max Cleland's heroes is \none of my heroes, a Senator who is one of my mentors in this Chamber, \nSenator Richard B. Russell of Georgia. Max Cleland met Senator Russell \nwhile serving as a congressional intern. When Max returned from Vietnam \nseveral years later, with both legs gone and only one arm, he met \nSenator Russell again. That grand old Senator was so impressed with the \nyoung soldier that he had his driver give the young man a tour of the \nNation's capital.\n  During his tenure in the U.S. Senate, Senator Cleland has used \nSenator Russell's old telephone number, and has often taken his \nvisitors to see the statue of Senator Russell in the Russell Senate \nOffice Building, telling them, ``So much of me is tied up in Dick \nRussell.''\n  Max Cleland truly knows the horrors of war. Knowing that ``war is \nhell,'' he has been one of the Chamber's leading skeptics about the use \nof military force abroad and has always proved cautious when it comes \nto committing American troops overseas. In the 106th Congress, for \nexample, he was\n\n[[Page S11244]]\n\nthe first Democrat to call for a halt to the U.S.-led bombing campaign \nin Kosovo. He introduced legislation to update and improve the War \nPowers Resolution by erecting more safeguards before the deployment of \nour fighting men and women into situations of hostility.\n  I must point out that I have not always been in agreement with \nSenator Cleland. I strongly opposed a balanced budget constitutional \namendment, and I think Max Cleland supported it. I opposed the line-\nitem veto, and I believe that Max supported the line-item veto. But I \nhave never, never, not for a second, questioned his sincerity, his \nintegrity, or his respect for our Government and his love of this \ncountry.\n\n  Max Cleland is an outstanding Senator, a great American. He lost his \nSenate seat, at least for the foreseeable future, but he will never \nlose his integrity. Senator Cleland is a real winner. Just as his \nmilitary buddies were proud to have served with Max Cleland in Vietnam, \nI am honored to have served with him in the Senate. Max Cleland is a \nhero. He will always remain so.\n  May God bless Max Cleland. I wish him nothing but happiness and \nsuccess in the future.\n\n     God give us men!\n     A time like this demands strong minds,\n     great hearts, true faith, and ready hands.\n     Men whom the lust of office does not kill;\n     Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy;\n     Men who possess opinions and a will;\n     Men who have honor; men who will not lie.\n\n     Men who can stand before a demagogue\n     And brave his treacherous flatteries without winking.\n\n     Tall men, sun-crowned;\n     Who live above the fog,\n     In public duty and in private thinking.\n\n     For while the rabble with its thumbworn creeds,\n     Its large professions and its little deeds, mingles in \n           selfish strife,\n     Lo! Freedom weeps!\n     Wrong rules the land and waiting justice sleeps.\n     God give us men!\n\n     Men who serve not for selfish booty;\n     But real men, courageous, who flinch not at duty.\n     Men of dependable character;\n     Men of sterling worth;\n     Then wrongs will be redressed, and right will rule the earth.\n     God Give us Men!\n\n  Mr. President, Max Cleland is that kind of man.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I certainly confirm, underscore, and applaud \nthe statement of the Senator from West Virginia about Max Cleland. I \ndon't know of anyone in my life who has given me more inspiration than \nMax Cleland. Whenever things seem a little bit dark and dreary, I \nalways see that smiling face of Max Cleland. He is a tremendous man, a \nfine human being, and he has a lot more to contribute. His name will \ngrow from where it is today. The people of Georgia and this country \nhave not heard the last of Max Cleland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/18/senate-section/article/S11244-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, the senior Senator from North Carolina, Mr. \nHelms, is in some ways my Senator. I was born in North Carolina. I was \nborn there before Senator Helms was born there. My natural father and \nmother are buried there in North Wilkesboro, NC. One of my brothers, \nthe only brother I have still living, still lives in Wilkes County.\n  Many years ago, before the senior Senator from North Carolina joined \nthe Senate, he was a radio commentator on WRAL in Raleigh, NC. During \none of his radio commentaries, it is my understanding that the future \nSenator from North Carolina--the future Senator then, Senator Helms, \nnot Senator at that point--spoke of me as a Senator whose ``greatest \nstrength is his dedicated independence of thought and action,'' as a \nSenator who is ``neither easily frightened nor intimidated,'' as a \nSenator who ``stands up for what he regards as important.''\n  I have always appreciated those words, and over the many years, I \nhave appreciated the friendship of the senior Senator from the State of \nNorth Carolina. So when Jesse Helms was elected to the United States \nSenate in 1972, it seemed to me that we were already long-time friends, \nand we became even closer friends.\n  The more we came to know each other, the more at least I liked and \nrespected him. I think he returned the compliment, but I cannot speak \nfor that. I can only say for myself that I liked and I like Jesse Helms \nand I respect him, and I have always respected him.\n  I found Senator Jesse Helms to be a deeply religious man of immense \nintegrity, indisputable honesty, unqualified patriotism, and absolute \nindependence, a man who is absolutely fearless. He is a southern \ngentleman of the first order. He is a product of the old South and a \nproduct of his beloved North Carolina.\n  He has certainly made his presence felt in the Senate. During his \nyears in the Senate, he served as chairman of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and was \nmade a grand duke by the country of Lithuania for his contributions to \nthe reestablishing and strengthening of the independence of the Baltic \nnations.\n  He also acquired a powerful and widely recognized reputation for his \nstrong independent stands, and I am here to verify that many of the \nstands he has taken have not only been strong stands and independent \nstands but, in some cases, Senator Helms stood virtually alone.\n  Some of his positions have involved his standing, as I say, alone not \nonly against Presidential administrations but against the remainder of \nthe entire U.S. Senate, or at least most of the Senate. More than once, \nSenator Helms has been the singular vote on a particular position, and \nI know that can be a bit lonely. But he has never wavered in the \nstrength of his convictions or his votes.\n  ``The paramount thing for political leaders,'' he once explained, \n``is whether a man believes in his principles and whether a man is \nwilling to stand up for them, win or lose.''\n  That was Jesse Helms. Consequently, we always know where Senator \nJesse Helms stands. Take an issue--abortion, prayer in school, \nPresidential nominations, reducing the deficit, taxes, Government \nwaste, the future of the country-- if one did not already know where \nJesse Helms stood, Jesse Helms was always ready to tell you where he \nstood.\n\n  Some of his positions have been unpopular. Some of them may have \nseemed out of step with the march of history, but he has contributed to \nthe great debates that from time to time have been heard over and \nthroughout\n\n[[Page S11245]]\n\nthe land. Jesse Helms has made a major contribution to those debates.\n  In volume 2 of my own ``History of the Senate,'' I express the \nconcern ``ours is becoming a nation of hardened cynics.'' I went on to \npoint out that we ought to return to our beginnings. Go back to the \nhills--the hills of West Virginia or the hills of North Carolina--look \nup at the treetops and into the open sky and gain a renewed sense of \nGod's presence in our personal lives and in the life of the Nation. As \nSenators, we especially need to remember the old values, such as faith \nin God, obedience to law, respect for the flag, honesty, and thrift. \nHow very well Senator Helms has reflected those values.\n  I close, Mr. President, by repeating the words Senator Helms spoke of \nme 40 years ago, words I remember so well, words I think so aptly tell \nthe story of Senator Jesse Helms:\n\n       He is a Senator whose greatest strength is his dedicated \n     independence of thought and action. He is a Senator who is \n     neither easily frightened nor intimidated.\n\n  And foremost--\n\n       He is a Senator who has always stood up for what he regards \n     as important.\n\n  Mr. President, my wife Erma, who is an old-fashioned girl who married \nan old-fashioned guy, and I wish the very best for Jesse Helms and his \nlovely wife Dorothy Jane Coble as they enter the next phase of their \nlives.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/18/senate-section/article/S11245-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11245-S11246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO ED HADEN\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a member of my \njudiciary staff, my chief counsel on Judiciary, Ed Haden. Ed will be \nleaving the Senate at the end of this session, returning to private \npractice at the outstanding Alabama law firm of Balch & Bingham in \nBirmingham, AL, where he will work in that firm's appellate litigation \ndepartment. I will say this: My loss and the Senate's loss will be a \ngreat gain to Balch & Bingham.\n  Before joining the Senate, Ed had a distinguished legal career, \nhaving served as a staff attorney on the Alabama Supreme Court and as a \nlaw clerk for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. He came to the \nJudiciary Committee in 1999, first serving as counsel to Senator Orrin \nHatch on the nominations and constitutional law unit. In 2000, he \nbecame my chief counsel for the Subcommittee on Youth Violence and is \ncurrently chief counsel for the Subcommittee on Administrative \nOversight and the Courts.\n  Ed's work ethic is beyond reproach. From the moment he joined my \nstaff, his legal analysis has been unmatched and his commitment to the \nrule of law unwavering. His attention to detail and his ability to be \nthorough but brief at the same time has helped me enormously. I know I \ncan trust his judgment, and I thank him for dutifully managing our \nstaff and our issues since the day he arrived on our team.\n  During his tenure on the committee, Ed has proven what I knew when I \nhired him, that he would always carry himself in a professional manner, \nand even though he might not agree with those on the other side of the \naisle, he could work with them and gain their respect.\n  Ed is truly a man of utmost character. Senator Schumer, chairman of \nthe Administrative Oversight and the Courts Subcommittee, commented at \na recent executive committee meeting that:\n\n       [Ed] . . . represents the best of what we are about. He is \n     bright and diligent and honorable. His word is his bond. . . \n     . [Ed] has done a great job, with great distinction. He is \n     really an admirable lesson of what public service is all \n     about.\n\n  This is one time I could not agree with Senator Schumer more. Ed is a \nman of honor and integrity. His intellect is unmatched. Most \nimportantly, his commitment to fairness and getting the job done \ndistinguishes him. He has certainly provided extraordinary assistance \nto me, but I believe he has enriched the entire debate on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. He is indeed an extraordinary worker with a \nprodigious capacity to produce high-quality work, almost unbelievably \nso. He works long hours and is committed to producing the absolutely \nmost accurate answer for any question we are debating.\n  Ed has not only been a great manager of the complex issues that have \npassed through our committee, he also has been a good manager of the \npeople I hired to work on the committee. His ability to lead is without \nquestion, and the respect he has garnered during his service has been \nexpressed by those who worked closely with him.\n  Makan Delrahim, chief counsel to Senator Hatch, comments:\n\n       Ed is a close friend and an indispensable colleague. I \n     worked with Ed when he first came to Washington and began his \n     career as Nominations Counsel on Sen. Hatch's Judiciary \n     staff. Our friendship has continued as he moved to serve \n     Senator Sessions. Ed's intellect and integrity are second to \n     none. The committee will miss him.\n\n  Rita Lari Jochum, chief counsel to Senator Grassley, comments:\n\n       Ed Haden is an excellent lawyer and a great American. He \n     will be sorely missed by the Judiciary Committee.\n\n  Stephen Higgins, chief counsel to Senator Kyl, comments:\n\n       Ed Haden was an invaluable asset to the Judiciary \n     Committee. He is a superb lawyer and has both a tremendous \n     respect for the Constitution and a great love for this \n     Republic. We will all miss him.\n\n  Scott Frick, chief counsel to Senator Thurmond, comments:\n\n       Ed Haden possesses a unique combination of intelligence, \n     work ethic, and the ability to communicate his ideas clearly. \n     These qualities have served Senator Sessions and the State of \n     Alabama well. And in addition, he is a truly nice guy. When I \n     first joined the Judiciary Committee staff, Ed selflessly \n     offered his time and advice, and I remain appreciative of his \n     willingness to lend a hand.\n\n  John Abegg, Judiciary counsel to Senator McConnell, comments:\n\n       Ed Haden has been an invaluable asset to the United States \n     Senate and to its Judiciary Committee. His intellect, \n     resourcefulness, and work ethic are recognized and respected \n     by both sides of the aisle, as is his always courteous and \n     modest demeanor. Ed is the embodiment of the principle that \n     one can disagree with others, even passionately so, about the \n     most important of matters without being personally \n     disagreeable. He is a credit to the country, his state, and \n     his family.\n\n  Sean Woo, counsel to Senator Brownback, comments:\n\n       In many ways and especially in matters dealing with \n     judicial nominations, Ed Haden was the conscience of the \n     Republican judiciary staff. His commitment, enthusiasm and \n     intellect--applied with the Southern charm of an Alabamian--\n     will be sorely missed.\n\n  Mr. President, Ed has given me and his country an extraordinary \neffort, and I am grateful for that, as well as his loyalty and \ndedication, always having my best interest in mind and not his own, \nnever seeking credit for his great work, doing what was best for this \ncountry and Alabama. Ed is an exceedingly hard worker, a man of \nintegrity and ability, who has dedicated himself to reaching a just \nresult on every issue assigned to him, ranging from bankruptcy, where \nhe was extraordinarily engaged in a most complex bit of legislation, to \njudicial nominations. I could not have been successful without his \nleadership and assistance.\n\n  Ed's greatest strength, I believe, is that he has a remarkably \ndeveloped and rich set of core principles that guide him in his daily \nwork. He does not go in for flash or show, but for substance. He, to a \nremarkable degree, understands the glory and uniqueness of the American \nGovernment. He loves America. He works constantly to enrich her and \nstrengthen her--especially the rule of law, which has been the \nfoundation of this country's strength.\n  Ed Haden is more than just an outstanding chief counsel, he is a \ngreat friend and a great American. I thank him for his service to me, \nto the people of Alabama, and to the people of the United States. He \ntypifies what we so often see and too little hear about in this body--\nthe great work of our staffs. They give us loyalty into the night, \npreparing work for us so we can shine the next day before the TV \ncameras. I think Ed is the epitome of excellence in staff, the kind of \nperson I have valued greatly and will miss greatly.\n\n[[Page S11246]]\n\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to join in Senator Sessions' \ncomments earlier today regarding the departure of Ed Haden, a staffer \nwho has given a great deal to the Judiciary Committee during the past \nthree years. Ed has made his influence felt, and he will be missed.\n  Ed came to the Judiciary Committee in 1999 to work as my counsel in \nthe Nominations and Constitutional Law unit. He served me admirably in \nthat position. The next year, Ed became chief counsel to Senator \nSessions' subcommittee, and he continued to contribute substantively to \nmany issues handled by the full committee. Ed's reputation as a smart, \ncreative, and effective lawyer is well-earned.\n  As Senator Sessions said, the Senate's loss is someone else's gain. \nEd will be joining the Birmingham, AL, law firm of Balch & Bingham, \nwhich will no doubt benefit greatly from the association.\n  I want my colleagues to know that, as Senator Schumer said in a \nrecent Judiciary meeting, I have found Ed Haden to represent the best \nof what we are about. He is honorable and hard-working and someone who \ncan be taken at his word. I thank Ed for his great service to me and \nthe Judiciary Committee, and I wish him all the best in his future \nendeavors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business until 2 p.m.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will be speaking on a number of things at \nappropriate times this afternoon. I ask the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer, at what time do we turn to the Shedd nomination?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 2 o'clock.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. I commend the Chair for his interest in \nthe proceedings here--something he always demonstrates when he is \nthere. He has had the ability to serve in both bodies and we have what \nmight be a little bit more of a leisurely technique over here. The \nSenator from Vermont is delighted to have the Senator from Florida as a \nMember of this body.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/18/senate-section/article/S11246-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HOMETOWN HEROES SURVIVORS BENEFITS ACT OF 2002\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to encourage the Senate to pass \ntoday the Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefits Act of 2002, H.R. 5334.\n  This multipartisan legislation is to improve the Department of \nJustice's Public Safety Officers' Benefit Program. This bill allows the \nfamilies of public safety officers who suffer fatal heart attacks or \nstrokes to qualify for Federal survivor benefits.\n  I commend those in the other body, including Congressmen Etheridge, \nWeldon, Hoyer, and Oxley, for their leadership and, I might also say, \ntheir fortitude on this important legislation. On the last night the \nother body was in session, Congressman Etheridge stood as a sentry on \nthe bridge and said nothing else is going forward until this goes \nthrough. And it did pass in the House. I am proud to be the original \nsponsor of the Senate version of the Hometown Heroes bill, S. 3114. I \nthank Senators Collins, Jeffords, Landrieu, and Durbin for joining me \nas cosponsors.\n  This legislation should not be in any way controversial. It is \nsupported by the Fraternal Order of Police; National Association of \nPolice Organizations; Congressional Fire Services Institute; \nInternational Association of Arson Investigators; International \nAssociation of Fire Chiefs; International Association of Fire Fighters; \nNational Fire Protection Association; National Volunteer Fire Council; \nNorth American Fire Training Directors; International Fire Buff \nAssociation; National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians; \nAmerican Ambulance Association; American Federation of State, County \nMunicipal Employees. Actually, I will not list them all, but there are \n50 additional national organizations.\n  Public safety officers act with an unwavering commitment to the \nsafety and protection of their fellow citizens, and it is always the \ncase that they are willing to selflessly sacrifice their lives to \nprovide safe and reliable emergency services to their communities. \nHundreds of public safety officers nationwide lose their lives, and \nthousands more are injured while performing duties that put them at \ngreat physical risk.\n  Although we know that PSOB benefits can never be a substitute for the \nloss of a loved one, the families of all our fallen heroes should be \neligible to collect these funds.\n  The PSOB program authorizes a one-time financial payment to the \neligible survivors of Federal, State, and local public safety officers \nfor all line-of-duty deaths. A number of other things are in the bill. \nWe have improved this PSOB program on numerous occasions--we did it in \nthe Patriot Act--but, unfortunately, the inclusion of on-duty heart \nattack and stroke victims in the program has not been addressed.\n  This bill fixes that loophole to ensure that the survivors of public \nsafety officers who die of heart attacks and other cardiac-related \ndeaths in the line of duty, or within 24 hours of a triggering effect \nwhile on duty--regardless of whether or not a traumatic injury occurs \nat the time of the heart attack or stroke--are eligible to receive \nfinancial assistance. Heart attack and cardiac-related deaths account \nfor almost half of all firefighter fatalities and an average of 13 \npolice officer deaths each year.\n  It is time for the Senate to show its support and appreciation for \nthese extraordinarily brave and heroic public safety officers by \njoining the House and passing the Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefits \nAct.\n  Mr. President, I understand it has been cleared on this side of the \naisle. I hope that my friends on the other side of the aisle will let \nthis bill pass. We are willing on this side of the aisle to pass it, \nbut there has been objection on the other side. I hope that objection \nwill be withdrawn and this will pass so that we can join what has been \nalready done in the other body.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Leahy). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the \nlegislation just referred to by the distinguished Senator from Vermont. \nI have a particular interest in this legislation because in my former \ngovernmental capacity as the State treasurer, insurance commissioner, \nand State fire marshal of Florida, I had the occasion to come to a \ngreat appreciation of the role of the firefighter, the extraordinary \ncourage that firefighters display, and the extraordinary amount of \nproperty and life they save.\n  Fortunately, that was etched into the consciousness of America as a \nresult of what we saw on September 11--not only the police, the \nfiremen, but so many public service personnel who responded under those \nconditions. So I want to add my voice in support of the legislation \nreferred to by Senator Leahy and to those on the other side of the \naisle who might be putting a hold on this legislation.\n  There is an extreme risk to the occupation of firefighter. We \nunderstand that risk more clearly based on what we saw of the bravery \nand the devotion to duty expressed on September 11. But that bravery \nand devotion to duty goes on day in and day out in the firehouses in \ncommunities across this Nation. These firefighters should be \nappropriately compensated when infirmity and disaster strikes them.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to add my name in support of the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont and his bill.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BINGAMAN).

Mr. President, for more than 2 years, I have been working \nhard with Members on both sides of the aisle, in both Houses of \nCongress, to address the horrendous problem of innocent people being \ncondemned to death within our judicial system. This is not a question \nof whether you are for or against the death penalty. Many of the House \nMembers and Senate Members who have joined this effort are in favor of \nthe death penalty. I suspect the majority of them are in favor of it. \nIt goes to the question of what happens if you have an innocent person \nwho is condemned to death.\n  Our bill, the Innocence Protection Act, proposes a number of basic \ncommonsense reforms to our criminal justice system; reforms that are \naimed at reducing the risk that innocent people will be put to death.\n  We have come a long way since I first introduced the IPA in February \n2000. At that time, we had four Democratic cosponsors. Now there is a \nbroad consensus across the country among Democrats and Republicans, \nsupporters and opponents of the death penalty, liberals, conservatives, \nand moderates, that our death penalty machinery is broken. We know that \nputting an innocent person on death row is not just a nightmare, it is \nnot just a dream, it is a frequently recurring reality.\n  Since the 1970s, more than 100 people who were sentenced to death \nhave been released, not because of some technicality, but because they \nwere innocent, because they had been sentenced to death by mistake. One \nwonders how many others were not discovered and how many innocent \npeople were executed.\n  These are not just numbers, these are real people. Their lives are \nruined. Let me give an example: Anthony Porter. Anthony Porter was 2 \ndays from execution in 1998 when he was exonerated and released from \nprison. Why? Not because the criminal justice system worked. He was \nexonerated and released because a class of journalism students, who had \ntaken on an investigation of his case, found that did he not commit the \ncrime. They also found the real killer. A group of students from a \njournalism class did what should have been done by the criminal justice \nsystem in the first place.\n  Ray Krone spent 10 years in prison. Three of those ten years were on \ndeath row waiting for the news that he was about to be executed. Then, \nearlier this year, through DNA testing, he was exculpated and the real \nkiller was identified. These are two of the many tragedies we learn \nabout each year.\n  These situations result not only in the tragedy of putting an \ninnocent person on death row, but they also leave the person who \ncommitted the crime free. Everything fails. We have the wrong person in \nprison. But we have not protected society or the criminal justice \nsystem because the real criminal is still out running free. Often \ntimes, the actual perpetrator is a serial criminal.\n  Today, Federal judges are voicing concerns about the death penalty. \nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor has warned that ``the system may well be \nallowing some innocent defendants to be executed.'' Justice Ginsburg \nhas supported a State moratorium on the death penalty. Another \nrespected jurist, Sixth Circuit Judge Gilbert Merritt, referred to the \ncapital punishment system as ``broken,'' and two district court judges \nhave found constitutional problems with the Federal death penalty.\n  We can agree there is a grave problem. The good news is that there is \nalso a broad consensus on one important step we have to take--we must \npass the Innocence Protection Act.\n  That is why I wanted to let my colleagues know what is happening. As \nthe 107th Congress draws to a close, the IPA is cosponsored by a \nsubstantial bipartisan majority of the House and by 32 Senators from \nboth sides of the aisle, including, most recently, Senator Bob Smith of \nNew Hampshire. A version of the bill has been reported by a bipartisan \nmajority of the Senate Judiciary Committee. And the bill enjoys the \nsupport of ordinary Americans across the political spectrum.\n  What would the Innocence Protection Act do? As reported by the \ncommittee, the bill proposes two minimum steps that we need to take--\nnot to make the system perfect, but simply to reduce what is currently \nan unacceptably high risk of error. First, we need to make good on the \npromise of modern technology in the form of DNA testing. Second, we \nneed to make good on the constitutional promise of competent counsel.\n  DNA testing comes first because it is proven and effective. We all \nknow that DNA testing is an extraordinary tool for uncovering the \ntruth, whatever the truth may be. It is the fingerprint of the 21st \nCentury. Prosecutors across the country rightly use it to prove guilt. \nBy the same token, it should also be used to do what it is equally \nscientifically reliable to do: to establish innocence.\n  Just like fingerprints, in many crimes there are no fingerprints; in \nmany crimes there is no DNA evidence.\n  Where there is DNA evidence, it can show us conclusively, even years \nafter a conviction, where mistakes have been made. And there is no good \nreason not to use it.\n  Allowing testing does not deprive the State of its ability to present \nits case, and under a reasonable scheme for the preservation and \ntesting of DNA evidence, it should be possible to preserve the \nevidence.\n  The Innocence Protection Act would therefore provide improved access \nto DNA testing for people who claim that they have been wrongfully \nconvicted.\n  Just last week, prosecutors in St. Paul, MN, vacated a 1985 rape \nconviction after a review of old cases led to DNA testing that showed \nthey had the wrong man--and also identified the actual rapist. Think \nhow much better society would have been had they caught the real rapist \n17 years ago. The district attorney wanted to conduct DNA testing in \ntwo other cases, but the evidence in those cases had already been \ndestroyed. She has called on law enforcement agencies to adopt policies \nrequiring retention of such evidence, and that is what our bill would \ncall for.\n  Many cases have no DNA evidence to be tested, just as in most cases \nthere are no fingerprints. In the vast majority of death row \nexonerations, no DNA testing has or could have been involved.\n  So the broad and growing consensus on death penalty reform has \nanother top priority. All the statistics and evidence show that the \nsingle most frequent cause of wrongful convictions is inadequate \ndefense representation at trial. The biggest thing we can do is to \nguarantee at least minimum competency for the defense in a capital \ncase.\n  This bill offers States extra money for quality and accountability.\n  They can decline the money but then the money will be spent on one or \nmore organizations that provide capital representation in that State. \nOne way or another, the system is improved.\n  More money is good for the states. More openness and accountability \nis good for everyone. And better lawyering makes the trial process far \nless prone to error.\n  When I was a State's Attorney in Vermont, I wanted those I prosecuted \nto have competent defense counsel. I wanted to reach the right result \nin my trails, whatever that was, and I wanted a clean record, not a \nrecord riddled with error. Any prosecutor worth his or her salt will \ntell you the same; any\n\n[[Page S11248]]\n\nprosecutor who is afraid of trying his cases against competent defense \ncounsel ought to try a new line of work, because the whole system works \nbetter if both prosecutor and defense counsel are competent. That is \nwhat I wanted when I was prosecuting cases because I wanted to make \nsure justice was done.\n  The Constitution requires the Government to provide an attorney for \nany defendant who cannot afford one. The unfortunate fact is that in \nsome parts of the country, it is better to be rich and guilty than poor \nand innocent, because the rich will get their competent counsel, but \nthose who are not rich often find their lives placed in the hands of \nunderpaid court-appointed lawyers who are inexperienced, inept, \nuninterested, or worse.\n  We have seen case after case of sleeping lawyers, drunk lawyers, \nlawyers who meet with their clients for the first time on the eve of \ntrial, and lawyers who refer to their own clients with racial slurs.\n  Part of the problem, I think, lies with some state court judges who \ndo not appear to expect much of anything from criminal defense \nattorneys, even when they are representing people who are on trial for \ntheir lives. Good judges, like good prosecutors, want competent \nlawyering for both sides. But some judges run for reelection touting \nthe number and speed of death sentences they have handed down. For \nthem, the adversary system is a hindrance.\n  The problem of low standards is not confined to elected State judges. \nEarlier this year, a bare majority of the Supreme Court held that it \nwas okay for the defendant in a capital murder trial to be represented \nby the same lawyer who represented the murder victim. Most law students \nwould automatically say that is a conflict of interest, but our Supreme \nCourt said that was all right. And last year, a Federal appeals court \nstruggled with the question whether a defense lawyer who slept through \nmost of his client's capital murder trial provided effective assistance \nof counsel.\n  Fortunately, a majority of the court eventually came to the sensible \nconclusion that ``unconscious counsel equates to no counsel at all,'' \nbasically reversing what a State court said when it said the \nConstitution guarantees a person counsel. It does not guarantee they \nwill stay awake.\n  No law can guarantee that no innocent person will be convicted. But \nsurely we can do better than this. Surely we can demand more of defense \ncounsel than that they simply show up for the trial and remain awake. \nWhen people in this country are put on trial for their lives, they \nshould be defended by lawyers who meet reasonable standards of \ncompetence and who have sufficient funds to investigate the facts and \nprepare thoroughly for trial. As citizens, we expect that of our \nprosecutors. We ought to expect the same thing of our defense \nattorneys. That is all we ask for in the IPA.\n  I have heard four arguments against the bill. One wonders, with all \nthese people from the right to the left, all these editorial writers \nand Members of Congress from both parties supporting the IPA, what that \ntells us.\n  First, critics claim that the bill is an affront to States' rights. \nAs a Vermonter, and as a former State prosecutor, I agree that States' \nrights are very important. States should have the right to set their \nown laws, free of Federal preemption at the behest of special \ninterests. They should have the right to set their own budgets, free of \nunfunded mandates. And their reasonable expectations of Federal funding \nfor criminal justice and other essential programs should be met, rather \nthan bankrupting State governments because of Federal tax policy.\n  The IPA is entirely consistent with these principles of State \nsovereignty. It leaves State laws, including the death penalty laws, in \nplace. It offers States new funding for their criminal justice systems. \nAnd there was a provision added during the committee process \nestablishing a student loan forgiveness program for prosecutors and \npublic defenders, something that a lot of State governments say would \nhelp recruit and retain competent young lawyers.\n\n  This is one of those cases, like in the civil rights era, where the \nrhetoric of States rights is being abused as a code for the denial of \nbasic justice and accountability. Some States have made meaningful \nreforms, but many have not. They have had more than a quarter of a \ncentury and 100 death row exonerations to get their act together, but \nthey have failed. As many in this body argued in 1996, when promoting \nlegislation to speed up executions, justice delayed is justice denied. \nI agree with that. We cannot wait forever while innocent lives are in \nperil.\n  I have heard a second argument against the IPA, which is that society \ncannot afford to pay for these reforms. The truth, however, is that we \ncannot afford to do otherwise if we want to maintain confidence in our \ncriminal justice system. The costs of providing DNA testing and \ncompetent counsel are relatively small, especially when you compare \nthem to the costs of retrials that are necessitated by the lack of \nadequate counsel at trial, or the cost of locking up innocent people \nfor years or even decades. I am all for efficiency, but the greatest \nnation on Earth should not be skimping on justice in matters of life or \ndeath.\n  I have heard a third argument from a vocal minority of State \nprosecutors. They claim the bill would make it unduly difficult, if not \nimpossible, to seek the death penalty. That is a shocking claim. When I \nprosecuted cases, I felt very comfortable prosecuting those cases under \nthe laws of our State because of two things: I knew that all the \nevidence we had, including potentially exonerating evidence, had been \ngiven to the defendant. And I knew I was working in a well-functioning \nadversarial system with effective representation on the other side. \nThat is the way it is supposed to work.\n  When I hear a prosecutor say that the IPA reforms--enabling DNA \ntesting and securing adequate defense representation--would make it \nalmost impossible for him to do his job, it makes me wonder what he \nthinks that job is.\n  Finally, there is one more argument against the bill which is rarely \nstated out loud. I call it the ``innocence denial'' argument. We saw \nthis in the Earl Washington case in Virginia where, despite conclusive \nDNA evidence to the contrary, the Commonwealth for years clung to the \nhopelessly unreliable and implausible confession of a mentally retarded \nman. We see it in claims that ``the system is working'' when an \ninnocent man is released after years on death row due to the work of \njournalism students. And we see it in the often-repeated insistence \nthat, no matter how many people have been exonerated, no one can prove \nthat an innocent person has actually been executed.\n  The innocence deniers will never concede there is a problem. But with \n100 known instances of the system failing--and those are only the ones \nwe know about--it would be surprising if there were not more unknown \ncases of innocent people being sentenced to death.\n  The IPA was passed out of committee in the Senate and is supported by \na majority of the House. We ought to pass it before more lives are \nruined.\n  As a prosecutor, I never had any hesitation to seek the severest \npenalties our State could provide for people who committed serious \ncrimes. When I look at some of the cases I have reviewed over recent \nyears, when I see shoddy evidence, or when I see evidence that was not \nlooked at because it might have pointed to someone else, I wonder, why \nwouldn't society want a better system? Passing the IPA will help fix \nthese problems and give greater credibility to our criminal justice \nsystem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that the time be equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO SENATOR STROM THURMOND\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \naccomplishments of our friend and colleague, Senator Strom Thurmond, an \nindividual who has devoted his entire life to the service of the \nAmerican people and who now stands before us as one of the most \naccomplished U.S. Senators in our nation's history.\n\n[[Page S11249]]\n\n  I must say that I am saddened that I am making these comments on the \nheels of a controversy over the nomination of a highly qualified \njudicial nominee, Dennis Shedd, who was a long-time member of Senator \nThurmond's staff and who was recommended to the President for this \nappointment by Senator Thurmond. While I won't go into the specifics of \nthese hollow arguments against Judge Shedd, I cannot make these \ncomments in praise of Senator Thurmond without mentioning my \ndisappointment about the handling of Judge Shedd's nomination.\n  As our colleagues know, Senator Thurmond's nearly 50 years of service \nwithin this body make him the longest serving member since the Senate's \ninception, yet his contributions to public service and our Nation \nextend well beyond the United States Senate. From the time he served as \nSuperintendent of Education in Edgefield, SC, Strom Thurmond placed the \ngood of the Nation ahead of his personal career. He served over 36 \nyears on active and reserve duty within the U.S. Army, while \nsimultaneously holding many other public service positions.\n  Throughout, he was prepared to abandon his professional career on a \nmoment's notice--ready to fight to preserve democracy and freedom. He \nwas awarded five battle stars, as well as 18 decorations, medals, and \nawards, including the Bronze Star for Valor and the Purple Heart.\n  I have only--I say ``only''--been in the Senate for 8 years, but in \nthe relatively short time I have had the pleasure of serving in the \nSenate alongside Senator Thurmond, we have worked together as sponsors \nor co-sponsors of dozens of bills, including legislation enhancing \nlocal law enforcement efforts to protect the elderly and child victims \nof violent crime, drug interdiction efforts designed to stem the tide \nof drugs flowing into our cities and schools, laws to end the practice \nof partial-birth abortion, and constitutional amendments to protect \nvictims of violence. All of these collaborative efforts have benefited \na great deal from the insight Strom Thurmond developed during his 12-\nyear tenure as either chairman or ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee and also, of course, his 50 years of service in this body.\n  While Senator Thurmond's Senate career speaks volumes about his \ncommitment to this nation and to the people of South Carolina and to \nall Americans, I also must mention what a pleasure it has been for me \nto know Strom Thurmond as a person.\n  Over the years, he has shown great kindness and generosity to me and \nto my family. In particular, I would like to thank him for the \nhospitality he has shown my son, Brian, who recently graduated from \nSouth Carolina's Clemson University.\n  When I told Strom my son Brian was going to go to Clemson, he beamed. \nI could tell he was delighted. He said, You know, I went to Clemson. Of \ncourse I knew that. He said, I went to Clemson. I asked, Strom, What \nyear did you graduate?\n\n  He said, I graduated from Clemson in 1923.\n  I looked at him. I said, Strom, my dad was born in 1923.\n  Strom Thurmond has had quite an unbelievable career. I have had the \nopportunity, as well, to listen to many of his stories. I asked him \nabout his tenure at Clemson. He told me about the different times he \nwould run barefooted from town to town. He was a long distance runner \nwhen he was there.\n  The great Athenian general Pericles once noted that:\n\n       Where the rewards of virtue are greatest, there the noblest \n     citizens are enlisted in the service of the state.\n\n  Our American democracy, like that of the Athenians, is designed to \nreward virtue with the opportunity to represent and defend fellow \ncitizens. Certainly there is no man of our time better fit for and \ndedicated to these difficult tasks than Strom Thurmond. Indeed, he is a \ntribute to the American ethic of public service that the framers of our \nnation envisioned over two centuries ago.\n  It should come, then, as no surprise to my colleagues in the Senate, \nto the citizens of South Carolina, and to the American public that \nStrom Thurmond has left an indelible mark on our nation through his \nservice--a mark that surely will never be forgotten or held in anything \nless than the highest regard.\n  We thank Strom for his service to our country, to South Carolina, and \nto the people who will miss his kindness and his friendship. But we \nlook forward to seeing him, as we are sure we will, for a long time \nbecause he is a man of great courage and great integrity. We will miss \nhim.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his kind remarks \nabout our great friend, Senator Thurmond. I have been around here 26 \nyears, and Senator Thurmond was the leader on the Judiciary Committee \nfor most of that time. He has been a tremendous mentor and adviser to \nme.\n  He is a wonderful man. He has gone through so many changes in his \nlife, and he has had many different experiences in his life. He is \ntruly a war hero and truly one of the people I think everybody in this \nbody has to admire. There is no question about it. He is one of the \nall-time great Senators. He has represented the State of South Carolina \nfor all of these years very well.\n  I can remember traveling through the State with him. Just about \neverybody knew Strom, and he knew just about everybody in his State. It \nwas absolutely amazing to me that a person could be so revered as Strom \nThurmond was--and he deserved it.\n  He is not only a great man, but he has done great things in his life. \nHe has done great things having come from the Old South, which has been \nhighly criticized by many of us in this Chamber.\n  But let me just take a moment to pay tribute to my good friend and \nour distinguished colleague on this committee, the senior Senator from \nSouth Carolina, Strom Thurmond.\n  From the moment Strom thurmond set foot in the Senate Chamber in \n1954, he has been setting records. He was the only person ever elected \nto the U.S. Senate on a write-in-vote. That is a reworkable \nachievement. He is the longest serving Senator in the history of the \nU.S. Senate. As he approaches his 100th birthday, he is also the oldest \nserving Senator. Many of my colleagues will recall the momentous \noccasion in September of 1998 when he cast his 15,000th vote in the \nSenate. With these and so many other accomplishments over the years, he \nhas appropriately been referred to as ``an institution within an \ninstitution.''\n  In 1902, the year Strom Thurmond was born, life expectancy was 51 \nyears and today --the last time I heard--it is 77 years. But I think it \nis going up regularly. Strom continues to prove that, by any measure, \nhe is anything but average.\n  He has seen so much in his life. To provide some context, let me \npoint out that, since his birth, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, Alaska \nand Hawaii gained Statehood, and eleven amendments were added to the \nConstitution. The technological advancements he has witnessed, from the \nautomobile to the airplane to the Internet, literally span a century of \nprogress. Conveniences we have come to take for granted today were not \nalways part of Strom Thurmond's world. Perhaps this explains why during \nour Judiciary committee hearings, we have heard him asking witnesses \nwho were too far away from the microphone to ``please speak into the \nmachine.''\n  The story of his remarkable political career truly could fill several \nvolumes. It began with a win in 1928 for the Edgefield County \nSuperintendent of Schools. Eighteen years later, he was Governor of \nSouth Carolina. Strom was even a Presidential candidate in 1948, \nrunning on the `Dixiecrat' ticket against Democrat Harry Truman.\n  I must admit that he has come a long way in his political career, \ngiven that he originally came to the Senate as a Democrat. I am happy \nto say that wisdom came within a few short years when Strom saw the \nlight and joined the Republican Party.\n  That was supposed to be humorous. But I did not hear any laughter.\n  When I first arrived in the Senate in January of 1977, he was my \nmentor. As my senior on the Judiciary committee, it was Strom Thurmond \nwho helped me find my way and learn how the committee functioned. He \nhas not only been a respected colleague, but a personal friend, ever \nsince.\n  During his tenure as Chairman of the Judiciary committee, Strom \nThurmond left an indelible mark on the\n\n[[Page S11250]]\n\ncommittee and the laws that came through it. He became known and \nrespected for many fine qualities and positions--his devotion to the \nConstitution, his toughness on crime, his sense of fairness.\n  He is also famous for his incredible grip. Many of us have \nexperienced Strom Thurmond holding our arm tightly as he explains a \nviewpoint and asks for our support. I might add that this can be a very \neffective approach.\n  Strom is also known to have a kind word or greeting for everyone who \ncomes his way, and for being extremely good to his staff--and to all \nthe workers here on Capitol Hill. No question. He has gone out of his \nway.\n\n  I might add that I have seen him operate in his own home State and \nother places. I have seen him. He has operated in the most even-\nmannered, decent, honorable way to people regardless of where they came \nfrom--regardless of their color, their religion, their country of \norigin, or any other distinguishing characteristic. Strom has always \nbeen good to everybody.\n  Despite his power and influence, he has never forgotten the \nimportance of small acts of kindness.\n  Strom Thurmond is truly a legend--someone to whom the people of South \nCarolina owe an enormous debt of gratitude for all his years of \nservice. Clearly, the people of South Carolina recognize the sacrifices \nhe has made and are grateful for all he has done for them. In fact, you \ncannot mention the name Strom Thurmond in South Carolina without the \naudience bursting into spontaneous applause. He truly is an American \npolitical icon.\n  Abraham Lincoln once said that:\n\n       The better part of one's life consists of friendships.\n\n  With a friend like Strom Thurmond, this sentiment couldn't be more \ntrue. I am a great admirer of Strom Thurmond, and, as everyone around \nhere knows, I am proud to call him my friend.\n  One final note about Strom Thurmond: He is a great patriot. I am \ngrateful for his work with me over the years in support of a \nConstitutional Flag Amendment. A decorated veteran of World War II who \nfought at Normandy on D-Day, Strom Thurmond loves this country. He \nloves it very much. Let me just say this country loves him, too.\n\n  Strom Thurmond is a wonderful father. He has raised his children to \nbe very fine people. And they love him as well.\n  When his daughter died, it was one of the most tragic things I have \never seen. It was the first and only time I ever saw Strom Thurmond \nshed tears. He is such a strong, resilient, patriotic leader. But on \nthat day, at that funeral, Strom Thurmond broke down, which showed how \nmuch he loved his daughter and his family. I know how much he has. That \nis the mark of a great man.\n  I am glad today, or at least by tomorrow, hopefully, this body will \nbe able to give Strom Thurmond the only thing he has asked of us, as a \nlast request, in return for his service: the confirmation of his former \nchief counsel, Judge Dennis Shedd, who himself is a wonderful, decent \nman.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, just so all Senators understand where we \nare, I have been told that the cloture vote that was scheduled for this \nafternoon has been vitiated. But we will be voting on the Shedd \nnomination sometime tomorrow morning.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Florida on the floor. Could he \nindicate how long he wishes to speak? I was about to begin the debate \non the nomination.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. About 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished Senator from Florida be recognized for 10 minutes, with \nthe time divided equally. I make that request, that that 10 minutes of \ntime be taken equally out of both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\n\n                         Technology and Freedom\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I come to the floor not to \nspeak on the Shedd nomination--and I had spoken to the chairman of the \ncommittee--but to speak about a matter we will be discussing tomorrow \nas we take up the homeland defense bill and some of the questions of \nprivacy that have arisen, not necessarily directly involved in this \nbill but clearly in the discussion of homeland security.\n  Some grave questions of invasion of privacy have been noted. So I \nfelt compelled to take the floor of the Senate to raise further the \nissue of governmental intrusion into the private lives of people.\n  I realize that in this technologically advanced age, in order to go \nafter the bad guys, in order to be able to stop them before they hit \nus, clearly there has to be the clandestine means of penetrating the \ncommunications that are going on. That is very important to the defense \nof this country and our citizens. At the same time, the constitutional \nrights of privacy must always be foremost in our minds as we battle \nthis new, elusive kind of enemy called the terrorist.\n  So I want to offer some words. I start, first, with words from a very \nfamous American who had something significant to say about privacy, \nJustice Louis Brandeis, in which he argued, in a 1928 case, that the \nFramers of our Constitution--and I will quote Justice Brandeis:\n\n       . . . sought to protect Americans in their beliefs, their \n     thoughts, their emotions and their sensations.\n\n  Justice Brandeis went on, that the Framers of the Constitution had:\n\n       . . . conferred, as against the Government, the right to be \n     let alone--the most comprehensive of rights and the right \n     most valued by civilized man.\n\n  Now, Justice Brandeis wrote those words in a dissenting opinion in a \n1928 case involving a liquor dealer who was convicted by evidence \ngathered through a wiretap, way back then, early in the last century. \nThat case arose because technology had granted the Government an \nincreased ability to peer inside people's private lives--then, in 1928, \na wiretap.\n  The technology increased governmental authority, forcing the Supreme \nCourt to evaluate and redefine the boundaries between freedom and \ngovernmental power. The technological advances also stimulated an \nimportant national debate about the balance between individual freedom \nand the legitimate needs of law enforcement.\n  Now we are at a similar crossroads, and those words ring out to us \ntoday as we go about trying to balance the rights between individual \nfreedom and the legitimate needs of the Government to penetrate \nterrorist cells.\n  Technology has advanced faster than the Nation's norms and the laws \nfor managing them. Modern technology makes possible unprecedented \nintrusions into the private lives of American people. This ability, \ncoupled with increasing governmental demands to use that technology, \nposes a grave threat to personal privacy and personal freedom.\n  This past week, I was rivetted by the news of the revelations about \nhow the Department of Defense is developing a computer system to grant \nintelligence and law enforcement authorities the power to secretly \naccess ordinary citizens' private information, including e-mail, \nfinancial statements, and medical records--to access that private \ninformation without the protections of a court order.\n  Clearly, in this post-9/11 world, we need to develop tools that will \nenable our Government to keep us safe from terrorists by disrupting \ntheir operations. But these tools need to be balanced against the \nprotection of innocent people's right to privacy. If the right to \nprivacy means anything, it is the right of the individual to be free \nfrom unwarranted governmental intrusion.\n  So what rivetted my attention were reports, first in the New York \nTimes, the Washington Post, and then in the Washington Times, that the \nso-called Total Information Awareness Program--located in DARPA, deep \ninside the Department of Defense--would make possible unwarranted \ngovernmental intrusions such as we have never seen before.\n  It is disturbing that we are developing a research system that, if \never used, would violate the Privacy Act as well as violate a lot of \nother Federal laws on unreasonable searches of private information \nwithout probable cause, which is the typical standard\n\n[[Page S11251]]\n\nthat needs to be met. That is why we go to a judge to get an order \nallowing us to intrude on such things as searches, as seizures, on such \nthings as wiretaps.\n  I have a serious concern about whether this type of program, called \nTotal Information Awareness, can be used responsibly. So while we \ninvestigate and learn more about it, I intend to speak out to the \nCongress and to the committees on which I am privileged to serve--\nincluding the Armed Services Committee--to speak out that we need to \noversee this program to ensure that there is no abuse of law-abiding \nindividuals' privacy.\n  It has been reported that this program is authorized or endorsed by \nthe homeland security legislation pending now in the Senate. And that \ndoes not appear to be the case. While it doesn't specifically tend to \nbe the case, this legislation, the Homeland Security Department, does \ninclude a provision creating a research division within the new \nHomeland Security Department. It would develop, among other things, \ninformation technologies similar to the Total Information Awareness \nProgram. While I strongly support funding for new research, and I \ncertainly believe that we must use our technological advantage to \ndefeat our enemies, at the same time I think we better take a breath, \nbe very cautious that any new research done in the Defense Department \nor within the new proposed Department of Homeland Security does not \nthreaten our personal freedoms.\n\n  I also have grave concerns that this information awareness program is \nbeing directed by someone who is very controversial: Retired Rear \nAdmiral Poindexter, the former Reagan administration official who was \nconvicted in, you remember, the Iran-contra story. There is a very \nlegitimate question about whether or not he is the appropriate person \nto head such a sensitive program.\n  To quote from recent editions of the Washington Post, specifically \nNovember 16, an editorial:\n\n       However revolutionary and innovative it may be, this is not \n     neutral technology, and the potential for abuse is enormous.\n\n  The editorial continues:\n\n       Because the legal system, designed to protect privacy, has \n     yet to catch up with this technology, Congress needs to take \n     a direct interest in this project.\n\n  The editorial goes on:\n\n       And the defense secretary should appoint an outside \n     committee to oversee it, before it proceeds.\n\n  The editorial concludes:\n\n       Finally, everyone involved might also want to consider \n     whether Adm. Poindexter is the best person to direct this \n     extremely sensitive project.\n       Though his criminal convictions were overturned on appeal, \n     his record before the Congress hardly makes him an ideal \n     protector of the legal system. . . .\n\n  That is the Washington Post.\n  In conclusion, ever since I had the privilege to serve with the likes \nof these great Senate giants on the floor right now, Senators Leahy and \nHatch, guardians of the Constitution because of their roles on the \npremier committee that guards the Constitution in the Senate, privacy \nis an issue that has attracted my attention and concern.\n  Has my time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. NELSON of Nebraska.) The Senator's time \nhas expired.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent that I conclude my \nremarks in 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank Senators for letting me make this \ncase.\n  When I first came here, I became concerned that back in 1999 we \nallowed banks and insurance companies to merge, but we didn't protect \nindividual's privacy. It would shock people to know that if you go have \na physical exam in order to get a life insurance policy and if that \nlife insurance company is acquired by a bank, that the access to those \nindividually identifiable medical records is unlimited, without your \npersonal consent, to anywhere within that bank holding company.\n\n  You might also be interested to know that recently we had the \nissuance of rules by the Bush administration on medical record privacy, \nbut there was a huge omission in that pharmaceutical companies could go \nto drugstore chains, pay the drugstore chain for the names and ability \nto communicate to individual people who had prescriptions, and then \nthat pharmaceutical chain could contact that individual patient, asking \nthem, soliciting them to change their medication to a different kind of \nmedication, one that would be within the generic equivalent or a \ndifferent brand name than the one that the physician had prescribed for \nthem. That is an invasion of personal privacy. Yet it is allowed under \nthe rules of the new administration.\n  Take, for example, the case 2 weeks ago in Fort Myers, FL. Suddenly a \ndumpster was overflowing with tax records, bank records, Social \nSecurity numbers, all kinds of personally identifiable financial \ninformation not properly disposed of by the bank subsidiary. The bank \nsays there is no such law. So I filed a bill to protect individual's \npersonal financial privacy.\n  Lo and behold, another invasion of privacy, identity theft, one of \nthe big things, more recently, in Orlando, FL--another dumpster. Now \nall of a sudden, one of the two large pharmaceutical drugstore chains \ndumps all of the prescriptions in the dumpster, along with the bottles. \nAs a result, the personally identifiable medical information is there \nfor the public to see from someone pilfering the dumpster.\n  I think I have made my case. Privacy is something we better be \nconcerned about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have before us the nomination of United \nStates District Court Judge Dennis Shedd of South Carolina to the Court \nof Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\n  Judge Shedd's nomination was reported out of the Judiciary Committee \nlast Thursday on a voice vote. Nine Democratic Senators, including \nmyself, voted against him. As I noted before, I told Senator Thurmond I \nintended to bring this matter to a vote by the committee this year. My \nconcern at the penultimate meeting, the meeting before last week, a \nmeeting we held in October, was that we had very little time to debate \nthis controversial nominee and that threatened to prevent a committee \nvote on 17 other of the President's judicial nominees before the \ncommittee.\n  Incidentally, those 17 district court nominees and 2 circuit court \nnominees were confirmed by the Senate last week. Those 17 district \ncourt nominees were on the Senate Calendar because the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee was able to report those nominees despite unparalleled \npersonal attacks by Republicans on me as chairman. Those attacks have \nincluded everything from saying I am not bringing up nominees--although \nI am and we are at a record rate that far outpaces the Republican rate \nduring their six and one-half years of control--to even attacks in \nthese recent months on my religious beliefs as well as the religion of \nseveral of the members of the Democratic majority on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Notwithstanding these unprecedented attacks on both our religious \nbeliefs and our actions, the confirmations last week bring to 99 the \nnumber of President Bush's judicial nominees confirmed by the \nDemocratic-led Senate in the past 16 months.\n  I mention this because before that, during the 6\\1/2\\ years when the \nRepublican majority controlled the Senate, they averaged 38 judicial \nconfirmations per year. In fact, in the year 1996, over the whole year, \nthey allowed only 17 district court judges to be confirmed all year and \ndid not confirm a single circuit court nominee--not a single one. We \nhad 17 district court judges in 1 meeting and those 17 nominees of \nPresident Bush were confirmed on one day last week by the Democratic-\nled Senate.\n  I put this in the record so the people understand the historic \ndemonstration of my bipartisanship toward the President's judicial \nnominees in perspective with the recent history of judicial \nconfirmations. The fact is that in addition to the 83 district court \nnominees confirmed, the Senate has also already confirmed 16 of his \ncircuit court nominees. That is in sharp contrast to the fact that the \nRepublicans allowed only 7 circuit court nominees to be confirmed per \nyear, on average, during their control of the Senate. For example, more \nthan half of President Clinton's circuit court nominees in the\n\n[[Page S11252]]\n\n106th Congress were defeated through such obstruction--more than half.\n  In fact, the Fourth Circuit--to take one at random--is one of many \ncircuits affected by the other party's obstruction of President \nClinton's judicial nominees. In the Fourth Circuit, seven of President \nClinton's nominees to that circuit were never given a hearing or a vote \nin committee or on the floor--seven out of that one circuit alone.\n  James Beaty, one of the Fourth Circuit nominees of President Clinton, \ndid not get a hearing or a vote in 1995, or 1996, or 1997, or 1998. \nAnother Fourth Circuit nominee, Judge Richard Leonard, did not get a \nhearing or vote in 1995 or 1996.\n  Another Fourth Circuit nominee, James Wynn, did not get a hearing or \na vote in 1999, 2000, or 2001. Other Fourth Circuit nominees--Elizabeth \nGibson, Judge Andre Davis, or Judge Roger Gregory--also did not get \nhearings or votes during the period of Republican control of the \nSenate.\n  Indeed, the first hearing the Judiciary Committee held last year on a \njudicial nominee was for an earlier Fourth Circuit nominee, Judge Roger \nGregory. He had been nominated initially by President Clinton when the \nRepublicans were in control. They did not act on him. He was brought \nback by President Bush, and he became the first judge confirmed to the \nFourth Circuit in several years. He was also the first African American \nconfirmed to the Fourth Circuit in American history. That is because \nour committee in the Senate acted in the summer of 2001. Judge Gregory \nwas the first of 20 circuit court nominees on whom we proceeded to hold \nhearings in our 16 months in the majority.\n  So the partisan rhetoric about the Judiciary Committee having \nblockaded President Bush's judicial nominees and having treated \nnominees unfairly might be a good stump speech on the circuit, but it \nis belied by the facts. Frankly, I think the staff at the White House \nwho have put those kinds of misstatements in the President's speeches \nhave done the President a disservice, as they have the Senate.\n  Turning to the nomination of Judge Dennis Shedd to the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, I cannot fail to note that it \nis not without controversy. In fact, it is quite controversial. Issues \nin his judicial record raised cause for concern among many Senators on \nthe Judiciary Committee as well as with many citizens who live in the \njurisdiction of the Fourth Circuit and elsewhere in the country who \nhave written to the Senate in opposition to his elevation and \nconfirmation.\n  While considering the information gathered in the hearing process, I \nplaced Judge Shedd's nomination on the committee agenda in September. \nThat was my effort to show Senator Thurmond courtesy as a former \nchairman and to signal that I expected this committee to proceed to \nconsider the nomination before the year was out. Several Senators asked \nto hold the nomination over, and under the rules any Senator can.\n  On October 7, when I hoped to be able to list his name for \nconsideration again, I was told there would be a debate so lengthy that \nwe would not even be able to consider the 17 other judicial nominations \nof President Bush that were on the agenda or, for that matter, the \nlegislative matters we were trying to take up before the election. So I \ntold Senator Thurmond, and other Senators before that markup, it was \nfor this reason that I would not list Judge Shedd's nomination on the \nagenda for the October 8 markup, but I explained to Senator Thurmond \nand others that I hoped we would be able to consider it at our next \nopportunity, as we knew at that point we would have a lame duck \nsession. So now, having the lame duck session, I scheduled as soon as \nwe came back and Senators would be here a markup on Judge Shedd and one \nother judicial nominee.\n  The committee has received more than 1,200 letters from individuals \nand organizations, both in and out of South Carolina, expressing \nconcerns about elevating Judge Shedd. In fact, right here, it stands \nabout 2 feet high--the stack of letters we got against it. These \nletters raise serious issues. What I heard about the nominee from the \ncitizens of South Carolina and from others around the country was and \nis troubling.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed samples of letters such as \nthose from citizens of South Carolina in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    South Carolina\n\n\n                                     Legislative Black Caucus,\n\n                                  Columbia, SC, September 4, 2002.\n     Re Fourth Circuit Nomination of Judge Shedd.\n\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chair, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: The South Carolina Legislative Black \n     Caucus (SCLBC) was formed in 1975 soon after the Civil Rights \n     Movement in the 1960's. Presently, the SCLBC has 31 members: \n     seven senators and 24 representatives, including four women. \n     The SCLBC is dedicated to the struggle for fairness, equality \n     and justice for all South Carolinians, and to the civic and \n     political involvement of African-Americans, women and other \n     racial and ethnic minorities.\n       We seek to preserve the civil rights strides that occurred \n     in South Carolina over the decades, and we fight to prevent \n     any regressive step that threatens to rollback civil rights \n     and constitutional rights of American-Americans, women and \n     other racial and ethnic minorities. The nomination of U.S. \n     District Judge Dennis W. Shedd to the U.S. Court of Appeals \n     for the Fourth Circuit represents such a regressive step, and \n     accordingly, we strongly oppose the nomination.\n       African-Americans constitute a full one-third of South \n     Carolina's population, yet there is only one active African-\n     American federal judge in the state. And, there are only two \n     South Carolinian female federal judges, one on the federal \n     District Court and the other on the Fourth Circuit. This is \n     unfair and unjustified because there are many well-qualified \n     African-American and women jurists and lawyers who deserve an \n     opportunity to serve this nation on the federal judiciary.\n       Because African-Americans are one-third of South Carolina's \n     population and the Fourth Circuit has a greater number of \n     African-Americans than any circuit, it is critical that any \n     nominee, especially one from South Carolina, be an unabashed \n     champion of civil rights. The appointee should have a record \n     that demonstrates fairness and justice to all people. Based \n     on our careful review of Judge Dennis Shedd's performance on \n     the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina, \n     we have concluded that his record shows a serious hostility \n     to civil rights and constitutional protections.\n       Since his appointment to the federal bench in South \n     Carolina, Judge Shedd has engaged in right-wing judicial \n     activism by imposing strict and exacting standards when \n     reviewing employment discrimination cases brought by African \n     Americans and women. He has dismissed almost every employment \n     discrimination, sexual harassment, civil rights and \n     disability case that has come before him. Judge Shedd seems \n     to believe that discrimination is not an actionable offense \n     even when the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has \n     found ``reasonable cause'' that discrimination has occurred. \n     Judge Shedd, however, seems to apply a more lenient standard \n     in reviewing discrimination cases brought by white men. Judge \n     Shedd has allowed four out of five ``reverse'' discrimination \n     cases to proceed beyond the summary judgment phase of \n     litigation.\n       This record shows that Judge Shedd does not have an abiding \n     concern for civil rights and fairness. It further shows that \n     Shedd lacks the requisite moderate reasoning to bring balance \n     to the Fourth Circuit. In fact, his membership to the Fourth \n     Circuit would push it further beyond the mainstream of \n     American values and would subject South Carolinians and \n     residents of other states within the Fourth Circuit to an \n     extreme right-wing interpretation of this nation's civil \n     rights laws and constitutional protections.\n       Accordingly, we oppose Judge Shedd's nomination without \n     reservation. His values represent the Old South, where \n     African Americans and women were judged by different and \n     unequal standards.\n       We appreciate your attention. If you have any questions, \n     please contact me at the address and telephone number above.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Joseph H. Neal,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n         South Carolina State Conference, National Association for \n           the Advancement of Colored People,\n                                      Columbia, SC, June 24, 2002.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: We write to oppose the nomination of \n     Dennis Shedd to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       By now, you must be familiar with the importance of the \n     Fourth Circuit to the African American community. Almost a \n     quarter of the Fourth Circuit's residents are African \n     American. The Fourth Circuit, with over 6 million African \n     Americans in the five states, has the greatest number of \n     African Americans of any Circuit Court in the country. The \n     Latino population within the Fourth Circuit now at more than \n     one million persons, has nearly tripled in the last decade. \n     Based on\n\n[[Page S11253]]\n\n     these demographics, more may be at stake here for the future \n     of civil rights than in any other Circuit Court in the \n     country.\n       The Fourth Circuit is already an extremely conservative \n     Court on civil rights and Constitutional issues. This Circuit \n     ruled that federal law-enforcement officials need not follow \n     the Miranda decision, only to be reversed by the Supreme \n     Court. This Circuit authorized drug testing for pregnant \n     women without their consent, which was reversed by the \n     Supreme Court. This Circuit ruled that the Equal Employment \n     Opportunity Commission was limited to remedies contained in \n     employee arbitration agreements, and again, was reversed by \n     the Supreme Court. The Circuit also has been reversed \n     recently in capital habeas corpus cases and citizen suits \n     under environmental laws. The Fourth Circuit has issued \n     numerous other opinions that are hostile to affirmative \n     action, women's rights, fair employment, and voting rights.\n       This is also the Court to which moderate African American \n     nominees were repeatedly denied membership. No fewer than \n     four African Americans were nominated to this Court by \n     President Clinton, only to have their nominations languish \n     for years due to Senatorial obstruction. Thus, if a nominee \n     is to be confirmed to this Court, the nominee must be a \n     jurist who will bring moderation and ideological balance to \n     this Court. It is our strongly held view that this nominee is \n     not Dennis Shedd.\n       Judge Shedd's judicial record reveals a deep and abiding \n     hostility to civil rights cases. A review of Shedd's \n     unpublished opinions reveals that Judge Shedd has dismissed \n     all but very few of the civil rights cases coming before him. \n     In nearly thirty cases involving racial discrimination in \n     employment, he granted summary judgment for the employer in \n     whole or in part in all but one case; most of the cases were \n     dismissed altogether. Many of these cases were strong cases \n     with compelling evidence and litigated by experienced civil \n     rights lawyers.\n       Gender and disability discrimination cases before Judge \n     Shedd fare no better. He has granted summary judgment on \n     every sexual harassment claim on which summary judgment was \n     requested. Collectively, these rulings leave us with the \n     distinct impression that, in Dennis Shedd's view of the \n     world, discrimination does not exist, and just as \n     importantly, a jury should never be asked even to decide that \n     question.\n       We are profoundly disturbed by the mounting evidence of \n     Judge Shedd's zealous efforts to assist the defense in civil \n     rights cases. There are repeated instances of Judge Shedd's \n     intervention in civil rights cases--without prompting by the \n     defendant--in ways that are detrimental to the plaintiff \n     case. In a number of cases, Judge Shedd, on his own motion, \n     has questioned whether he should dismiss civil rights claims \n     outright or grant summary judgment. He has invited defendants \n     to file for attorneys' fees and costs against civil rights \n     plaintiffs. These are not the actions of an impartial \n     decision-maker.\n       We are extremely concerned about Judge Shedd's rulings \n     promoting ``States' rights,'' and view these as a fundamental \n     encroachment on Congress's ability to enact civil rights and \n     other legislation. Judge Shedd has a very restrictive view of \n     Congressional power. He struck down the Driver's Privacy \n     Protection Act of 1994 as legislation beyond Congress's \n     power, although this legislation was an ``anti-stalking'' \n     measure designed to prohibit public disclosure of drivers' \n     license information. In an opinion authored by Chief Justice \n     Rehnquist, the Supreme Court unanimously overturned Judge \n     Shedd's ruling and refuted his reasoning. This stands as one \n     of the few occasions in which the Supreme Court rejected \n     unanimously a holding that Congress exceeded its power in \n     enacting a statute.\n       The question of judicial temperament is raised by Judge \n     Shedd's offensive remarks during a judicial proceeding about \n     an issue that strikes at the heart of many--the Confederate \n     flag. Judge Shedd presided over a federal lawsuit seeking the \n     removal of the Confederate flag from the dome of the South \n     Carolina Statehouse. According to press accounts of a hearing \n     held in the case, Judge Shedd made several derogatory \n     comments about opposition to the flag. First, he attempted to \n     marginalize opponents to the flag by questioning whether the \n     flag matters to most South Carolinians. (It does, and thirty \n     percent of South Carolina's population is African American.) \n     He also minimized the deep racial symbolism of the flag by \n     comparing it to the Palmetto tree, which appears in South \n     Carolina's State flag.\n       Our membership in South Carolina, deserves to be \n     represented on the Circuit by a nominee who has a record of \n     judicial impartiality, is committed to the progress made on \n     civil rights and individual liberties, and has a deep respect \n     for the responsibility of the federal judiciary to uphold \n     that progress. Dennis Shedd is not that nominee. We urge you \n     and the Senate Judiciary Committee to vote against his \n     nomination.\n            Sincerely,\n                                                    James Gallman,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. We received a letter from the Black Leadership Forum, \nsigned by many well-respected African Americans, including Joseph \nLowery, and more than a dozen more internationally known figures, as \nwell as letters from other African American leaders.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 Black Leadership Forum, Inc.,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 16, 2002.\n     Hon. Ernest F. Hollings,\n     Member of the Senate, Senate Russell Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hollings: We are writing to share with you a \n     letter which the Black Leadership Forum, Inc. (BLF), whose \n     members are listed on the left side of this page, delivered \n     several weeks ago to members of the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee. The attached letter strongly opposes the \n     nomination of Judge Dennis Shedd to a seat on the Fourth \n     Circuit Federal Court of Appeals, for the reasons stated in \n     substantial detail.\n       It has come to our attention that you are actively \n     supporting Mr. Shedd's nomination and are aggressively \n     pressing the Judiciary Committee for speedy approval of a \n     hearing on his nomination by the full Senate. Therefore, we \n     feel that it is urgent for you to be directly informed by BLF \n     of the bases for our objections to this nomination. We \n     reflect in this letter the deep concern in the African \n     American community about this nomination because Mr. Shedd's \n     judicial record undercuts our closely guarded values of equal \n     justice and threatens the maintenance of our civil rights \n     advances and constitutional protections.\n       Conversations with numerous African Americans who also are \n     resident-constituents of your District, indicate that they, \n     too, believe that this nomination should not go forward. We \n     sincerely hope, therefore, that we can meet with you \n     regarding our objections to Mr. Shedd's nomination and that \n     until we have had this discussion, you will forego any \n     further actions supporting his nomination. We have called \n     your office requesting such a meeting prior to a vote by the \n     Judiciary Committee on this issue.\n           Love Embraces Justice,\n     Dr. Joseph E. Lowery,\n     Dr. C. DeLores Tucker,\n     Yvonne Scruggs-Leftwich, Ph.D.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Rainbow Push Coalition\n\n                                     Chicago, IL, August 24, 2002.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Member, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: Let me lend my voice of opposition to \n     the chorus of discontent surrounding the nomination of Judge \n     Dennis Shedd to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. I urge \n     you to oppose the Shedd nomination, based on the merits, and \n     the merits alone. A seat on the Fourth Circuit is too \n     important to the nation's judiciary not to be heavily \n     scrutinized.\n       As a native of South Carolina, I am deeply disturbed by the \n     direction taken by the Fourth Circuit in recent years. As a \n     Judicial Circuit with considerable influence on the Supreme \n     Court, those elevated to the Court should reflect the highest \n     American ideals of inclusion and equal protection under the \n     law. Moreover, the states included in the Fourth Circuit are \n     comprised of the highest percentage of African Americans, \n     than any other Circuit, thus judges on the Court must be \n     sensitive and respectful for the civil rights laws for which \n     we fought so hard.\n       Currently, the Fourth Circuit is the most extremist court \n     in the nation on civil rights issues, criminal justice \n     issues, and those involving the power of the federal \n     government, to enact legislation, which holds States \n     accountable for civil rights violations. The nomination of \n     Dennis Shedd threatens to take the Court in a further \n     extremist direction. For example, Judge Shedd's opinion in \n     the Condon v. Reno case suggests that he favors disempowering \n     Congress. American judges, and their rulings should protect \n     rights, rather than restrict the balance of power.\n       To preserve this nation's ideals of inclusion, and to \n     ensure equal protection under the law for all Americans, I \n     urge you, and other members of the members of the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee to vote ``No'' on the nomination of \n     Dennis Shedd.\n           Sincerely,\n     Reverend Jesse L. Jackson, Sr.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     National Bar Association,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 4, 2002.\n     Re Nomination of Judge Shedd, United States Court of Appeals \n         for the Fourth Circuit.\n\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: The National Bar Association hereby \n     submit this letter in strong opposition to the confirmation \n     of Dennis Shedd to the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     Fourth Circuit. We strongly urge you to vote to defeat his \n     appointment to this critical Court.\n       The National Bar Association, established in 1925 is the \n     oldest and largest organization of minority attorneys, \n     judges, legal scholars and law students in the United States \n     and in the world. During our 77 year history we strive to \n     obtain equal justice for all persons within the jurisdiction \n     of these United States of America. Real diversity can only be \n     achieved as a result of equal justice for all which directly \n     results in equal opportunity. Real diversity, equal justice, \n     and equal opportunity does not currently exist in our federal \n     judiciary.\n       The National Bar Association maintains a watchful eye on \n     federal judicial nominations, as part of its' historical \n     mission. We\n\n[[Page S11254]]\n\n     have a duty and obligation to support or oppose any \n     nomination which directly affects our struggle for equal \n     justice and equal opportunity for all. During these difficult \n     times, the United States of America must set an example to \n     the world by assuring equal justice and equal opportunity to \n     a truly diverse nation.\n       The National Bar Association feels, confirmation of Dennis \n     Shedd to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth \n     Circuit will severely undermine and inhibit its' goals of \n     equal justice for all, equal opportunity for all, and real \n     diversity. In our opinion the one thing which insulates the \n     United States of America from anarchy, civil strife, etc. is \n     our Construction (as currently amended), which provides an \n     open judiciary, where any citizen regardless of race, creed, \n     color, gender, economic status, social status, etc. can seek \n     redress. Absent an open federal judiciary, citizens will seek \n     other less civil means to voice their concerns and seek \n     redress. An open judiciary is the balance for the scales of \n     justice.\n       The essential element of an open judiciary is our \n     constitutional right to trial by jury. This right provides \n     some assurance of fair and equitable treatment in resolution \n     of disputes, without political influence of the government. \n     Therefore, we must oppose federal judicial nominees, when \n     their actions or beliefs, in any way reduce complete access \n     to the courts, right to trial by jury, or in any way \n     discourage access and right to trial by jury.\n       A review of Dennis Shedd's record appears to indicate a \n     judicial philosophy to reduce and discourage access to the \n     courts and exercise of each citizens right to trial by jury. \n     For these reasons, the National Bar Association strongly \n     opposes nomination of Dennis Shedd to the United States Court \n     of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Malcolm S. Robinson,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         The National Black Caucus\n\n\n                                         of State Legislators,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 19, 2002.\n     Re Fourth Circuit Nomination of Judge Shedd.\n\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Chair, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: The National Black Caucus of State \n     Legislators (NBCSL) is the body that represents some 600 \n     African American state legislators in 44 states, the District \n     of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Last year, we \n     celebrated our 25th year of involvement and dedication to \n     many of the most pressing social issues and policies that \n     impact our legislators' districts and the nation at large. \n     Our commitment is to our constituents as well as the national \n     agenda. Our dedicated work is to maintain the highest values \n     of civil and human rights insuring that African Americans are \n     a fair and representative part of the political and social \n     equations of this great nation.\n       In their letter to you, dated September 4, 2002, members of \n     the South Carolina Legislative Black Caucus have spoken \n     clearly and definitively in opposing the nomination of Judge \n     Dennis Shedd to the Fourth Circuit. In reviewing the \n     information presented therein and having also researched the \n     history and record of Judge Shedd, we find it woefully \n     deficient regarding the issues of fairness, equality and \n     justice. Moreover, as has been pointed out by our colleagues \n     in South Carolina ``African Americans constitute a full one-\n     third of South Carolina's population yet there is only one \n     active African American federal judge in the state.'' In that \n     there are unquestionably ``many, well-qualified African \n     American .  .  . jurists'' in South Carolina, this is rightly \n     seen an unfair and unequal treatment in the sight of fair \n     representation. Further, considering the existent \n     disproportionate representation of jurist of Color, certainly \n     an effort must be made to insure that any South Carolina \n     nominee be a strong advocate of civil and human rights. \n     Rather, Judge Shedd's performance on the U.S. District Court \n     for the District of South Carolina demonstrates what could be \n     construed as hostile to civil and constitutional rights.\n       We have learned that Judge Shedd's insensitivity to \n     fairness has been demonstrated in his review of employment \n     discrimination cases brought by African Americans and in \n     fact, women, even in such cases when the Equal Opportunity \n     Commission has found ``reasonable cause.'' But, we have also \n     found that in furtherance of this questionable action, when \n     white men bring cases of ``reverse'' discrimination, those \n     cases proceed. We also note that there have been concerns \n     raised about the number of unpublished opinion issued by the \n     Judge and further that such concerns regarding the decisions \n     were reversed or vacated by the Fourth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals.\n       The Fourth Circuit must have a judge who is mindful of the \n     rightful place that African Americans have in this nation, \n     and be a strong advocate of civil rights, human rights and \n     constitutional rights. Any nominee should have demonstrated \n     his dedication to such virtues and ideals. No other \n     individuals should be considered for this important position.\n       For these reasons among others raised by our South Carolina \n     Legislative Black Caucus, we cannot support the nomination of \n     Judge Dennis Shedd for the Fourth Circuit and would ask that \n     the opinion of our body be strongly considered in this \n     matter. Should you have any questions, or require additional \n     comment, please contact me.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  James L.

Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: On behalf of the Congressional Black \n     Caucus, we write to express our strong opposition to the \n     confirmation of Dennis Shedd to the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. We urge you to vote to defeat \n     his appointment to this critical court.\n       The Fourth Circuit has the highest percentage of African-\n     American residents of any federal circuit in the nation. As \n     you know, President Clinton tried in vain for many years to \n     integrate the Fourth Circuit by nominating no fewer than four \n     moderate African-Americans to the court, only to see their \n     nominations languish. James Beaty and James Wynn from North \n     Carolina, Andre Davis from Maryland and Roger Gregory from \n     Virginia were never given hearings before the Judiciary \n     Committee at any time during the Clinton presidency. It was \n     not until President Clinton took the extraordinary step of \n     giving Roger Gregory a recess appointment in the final days \n     of his Presidency that the last all-White circuit court in \n     the nation was finally desegregated.\n       The Fourth Circuit is also the most conservative of the \n     federal circuits. Its rulings on the rights of those accused \n     of crimes, employees who face discrimination, and individuals \n     with disabilities are far outside the judicial mainstream. \n     Given the importance of the Fourth Circuit to the African-\n     American community and the current ideological imbalance on \n     the Court, it is imperative that any nominee to this Court be \n     a jurist of moderate views who will protect the civil and \n     constitutional rights of all Americans. Dennis Shedd is not \n     that nominee.\n       Above all, we are concerned that any nominee to the Fourth \n     Circuit be committed to the rigorous enforcement of federal \n     civil rights laws. We are particularly troubled by Dennis \n     Shedd's record in this area. Throughout his eleven years on \n     the federal district court, Judge Shedd has demonstrated a \n     propensity to rule against plaintiffs in civil rights cases. \n     Based on our review of Judge Shedd's record, we doubt \n     seriously whether he can fairly and impartially adjudicate \n     the claims of persons protected by the federal civil rights \n     laws.\n       Despite the fact that employment discrimination cases \n     comprise a large portion of Judge Shedd's civil rights \n     docket, Judge Shedd has allowed only few discrimination \n     plaintiffs to have their day in court. In almost every case, \n     Judge Shedd has dismissed some or all of the claims of civil \n     rights plaintiffs before they have a chance to be heard by \n     the jury. By all evidences, Judge Shedd utilizes an extremely \n     high threshold of evidence necessary to allow a \n     discrimination claim to get to the jury. For example, in the \n     one race discrimination case in which Judge Shedd did not \n     dismiss at least some of the plaintiff's claims, a White \n     manager terminated an African-American female employee after \n     directing racial epithets at her in the presence of a co-\n     worker. Even with this evidence, Judge Shedd said it was an \n     ``extremely close question'' whether the case should be \n     dismissed. Given Judge Shedd's characterization of the \n     evidence in this case, we question his commitment to \n     following decades of case law recognizing that discrimination \n     often occurs in much more subtle but no less pernicious forms \n     and therefore may proven circumstantially. In contrast to \n     Judge Shedd's systematic dismissal of claims by African-\n     American plaintiffs, Judge Shedd has allowed ``reverse \n     discrimination'' claims by White men to proceed to trial in \n     four of the five cases in which summary judgment was \n     requested.\n       Also, in a number of cases, Judge Shedd has overruled a \n     magistrate's recommendation to allow claims to be tried to a \n     jury. In one case, a magistrate concluded that a female \n     corrections officer could pursue her claim for ``outrageous \n     conduct'' where her supervisor subjected her to repeated \n     requests for sex, lewd language, and physical contact, and \n     told her co-workers that he was having an affair with her and \n     that she was pregnant with his child. The conduct occurred \n     not only in the workplace but by telephoning the plaintiff at \n     home and by visits to the plaintiff's house, which the \n     supervisor said he could visit ``anytime he wanted.'' Judge \n     Shedd dismissed the claim, stating that while the defendant's \n     actions were ``certainly disgusting and degrading,'' they did \n     not rise to the level of outrageous conduct.\n       Judge Shedd's narrow and restrictive view of civil rights \n     claims is also evidenced by his dismissal of several cases in \n     which the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had found \n     ``reasonable cause'' to believe that discrimination occurred. \n     A finding of ``reasonable cause'' by the EEOC is extremely \n     rare (occurring in fewer than 10 percent of the cases filed). \n     Thus, the fact that Judge Shedd has refused to allow many of \n     these claims to get to the jury strongly suggests that Judge \n     Shedd utilizes an exceedingly high threshold for proving \n     unlawful discrimination. The endorsement of such a\n\n[[Page S11255]]\n\n     restrictive standard that is far outside the mainstream of \n     federal jurisprudence has devastating implications for all \n     civil rights plaintiffs if Judge Shedd is confirmed to the \n     Fourth Circuit.\n       At his June 27 hearing, Judge Shedd admitted that, during \n     his eleven years on the bench, a plaintiff has never won an \n     employment discrimination jury trial in his court. He \n     defended this record by asserting that he could not recall a \n     plaintiff ever winning a jury trial in a discrimination case \n     in any court in South Carolina. However, we have subsequently \n     learned that during Shedd's tenure on the bench, there have \n     been at least twenty-one jury verdicts favorable to \n     discrimination plaintiffs in other federal courts in South \n     Carolina, yielding over $7 million in damages. Shedd's lack \n     of awareness of the outcome of these numerous cases evidences \n     a troubling indifference toward the type of civil rights \n     cases with which, by virtue of his docket, he should be the \n     most familiar.\n       Another area of grave concern to us is Judge Shedd's narrow \n     view of Congressional power to enact protective legislation. \n     We believe that Judge Shedd has the worst federalism record \n     of any nominee considered by the Judiciary Committee thus \n     far. At the same time, the Fourth Circuit has been the most \n     active federal circuit in curtailing federal power, \n     invalidating many portions of important federal legislation \n     in recent years. Judge Shedd's record in this area signals he \n     will join this Circuit's aggressive efforts to alter the \n     balance of federal and State power in a way that threatens \n     enforcement of our most cherished civil rights laws.\n       Judge Shedd authored the original district court opinion in \n     Condon v. Reno, striking down the Driver's Privacy Protection \n     Act based on his belief that the federal government did not \n     have the power to require States to ensure that State \n     driver's license records would remain private. Although the \n     Fourth Circuit affirmed Judge Shedd's decision, the Supreme \n     Court unanimously reversed the holding in a decision by Chief \n     Justice Rehnquist. In an unpublished opinion, which usually \n     signifies a routine decision, Judge Shedd struck down part of \n     the Family and Medical Leave Act, holding that the Eleventh \n     Amendment doctrine of state sovereign immunity prevents an \n     employee from suing a State agency for a violation of that \n     statute. This issue--because it calls into question \n     Congress's power to remedy sex discrimination in the \n     workplace--has profound implications for Congress's authority \n     under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment.\n       Judge Shedd has demonstrated a reluctance to sanction law \n     enforcement for crossing the line. In a recent criminal case, \n     a deputy sheriff and a State prosecutor videotaped a \n     constitutionally protected conversation between a lawyer \n     and a defendant charged with a capital crime. The \n     defendant was convicted in state court, but the South \n     Carolina Supreme Court overturned the conviction on the \n     basis of the videotape, calling it ``an affront to the \n     integrity of the judicial system,'' and stating that \n     ``[t]he right to counsel would be meaningless without the \n     protection of free and open communication between client \n     and counsel.'' Judge Shedd presided over the federal cases \n     arising from a grand jury's investigation of the matter. \n     When the deputy offered a guilty plea, Judge Shedd \n     reportedly questioned it because he did not believe a \n     civil rights violation occurred. Judge Shedd imposed only \n     a $250 fine on the deputy and remarked at his sentencing \n     hearing that ``[the deputy] is caught up in a situation in \n     which there's at least part of the criminal defense bar \n     trying to get prosecutors and law enforcement punished. \n     That's what's going on in the law.'' In contrast, when the \n     defense attorney was convicted of perjury for denying he \n     leaked the videotape to the press after learning of its \n     existence before trial, Judge Shedd sentenced the lawyer \n     to prison and a $20,000 fine, accompanied by a lecture \n     about the serious consequences of committing perjury.\n       Judge Shedd has also exhibited a high level of \n     insensitivity on issues of race. Judge Shedd made several \n     insensitive comments as he dismissed a lawsuit aimed at \n     removing the Confederate battle flag from the South Carolina \n     statehouse dome. According to press accounts, Judge Shedd \n     suggested that South Carolinians--thirty percent of whom are \n     African-American--``don't care if that flag flies or not.'' \n     (``Judge Dismisses Most Flag Defendants, The Greenville News, \n     June 11, 1994). He also analogized the Confederate battle \n     flag, to many a symbol of support for slavery and racist acts \n     of terror directed at African-Americans, to the Palmetto \n     tree, which is on the State flag: ``What about the Palmetto \n     tree?'' What if that reminds me that Palmetto trees were cut \n     down to make Fort Moultrie and that offends me?'' (``U.S. \n     Judge Dims Hope of Battle Flag's Foes,'' The State, June 11, \n     1994.) It is shocking that Judge Shedd, who was raised in \n     South Carolina during the 1950s and 1960s, could compare--\n     even hypothetically--being ``offended'' by the representation \n     of the Palmetto tree to the reaction of the African-American \n     community to the Confederate battle flag.\n       Dennis Shedd's opinions in his eleven years on the federal \n     bench reflect hostility toward plaintiffs in civil rights \n     cases, a desire to limit Congress's authority to enact \n     legislation that is applicable to the States, and a general \n     insensitivity on issues of race. The Fourth Circuit \n     desperately requires a voice of moderation and commitment to \n     core civil and human rights values. We believe that Judge \n     Shedd is not that voice and that the Committee should \n     therefore reject his nomination to this important court.\n           Sincerely,\n         Eddie Bernice Johnson, Chair;\n         John Conyers;\n         E.

We received a letter from the Mexican American Legal \nDefense and Educational Fund, in the interest of many Latinos in the \nFourth Circuit, expressing opposition to Judge Shedd as well as \ncorrespondence from others expressing concern.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                            Mexican American Legal\n\n\n                                 Defense and Educational Fund,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 30, 2002.\n       Dear Senate Judiciary Committee Member: On behalf of the \n     Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), \n     I urge you to oppose the nomination of Dennis Shedd to the \n     4th Circuit Court of Appeals. MALDEF is a Latino civil rights \n     organization that was founded in Texas in 1968. Since that \n     time, we have expanded our work across the nation and \n     represent all Latinos. In our more recent history, we opened \n     a community outreach office on the census in Atlanta, Georgia \n     prior to the 2000 census. Due to the growth of the Latino \n     community in the Southeast and the pressing legal needs of \n     our community in that region, we expanded our office this \n     year into a full regional office handling litigation, \n     advocacy and community education within the 4th Circuit \n     states of Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, \n     and West Virginia.\n       Many people still are not aware of the rapid growth of the \n     Latino community in this region of the country. The following \n     is a sample of the Latino growth rates over that the last \n     decade in 4th Circuit states. In Maryland, Howard County's \n     Latino population grew at a rate of 104%, Anne Arundel County \n     saw its Latino population grow at a rate of 76%, Baltimore \n     County's Latino population grew by 65%, and Prince George's \n     County experienced 37% growth of Latinos. In Virginia, Prince \n     William County's Latino population grew by 94%, Fairfax \n     County experienced 71% growth of the Latino population, \n     Virginia Beach City's Latino population grew by 65%, and \n     Arlington county experienced 46% Latino growth. In North \n     Carolina, Wake County's Latino population grew by 190%, \n     Mecklenburg County saw its Latino population grow by 163%, \n     and Cumberland County experienced Latino growth at a rate of \n     97% in the last decade. In South Carolina, Richland County \n     saw its Latino population grow at a rate of 66%.\n       In addition, much of the Latino growth in these states is \n     being driven by the movement of Latino immigrants. What many \n     of these Latino immigrants face in these southeastern states \n     are barriers to housing, jobs, education, and health, as well \n     as targeting by local law enforcement similar to what many \n     Latino immigrants faced decades ago in states like \n     California, Texas and New York. While barriers and improper \n     law enforcement tactics still occur in states like California \n     and New York, these traditionally high-immigrant states also \n     now have a built-in infrastructure to serve the needs of \n     immigrants and help them find recourse if their rights are \n     trampled upon. Unfortunately, similar infrastructures do not \n     exist in most of the region covered by the 4th Circuit. As \n     such, ensuring that only nominees who will be fair to the new \n     Latino community in the southeast is particularly important.\n       MALDEF's evaluation of Dennis Shedd uncovered a \n     demonstrated lack of commitment\n\n[[Page S11256]]\n\n     to protect the civil rights of ordinary residents of the \n     United States and to preserve and expand the progress that \n     has been made on civil rights and individual liberties. In \n     every respect, Dennis Shedd has demonstrated that he would \n     likely decide cases in a manner that run counter to the \n     core principles and rights we believe are necessary to \n     protect Latinos, particularly the most vulnerable who live \n     within the 4th Circuit.\n       Throughout his eleven years on the federal district court, \n     Judge Shedd has dismissed almost all of the civil rights \n     cases that have come before him; thus, preventing the merits \n     of these cases to be heard by a jury. Based on his handling \n     of race, gender, age, and disability claims, we conclude that \n     Judge Shedd would not give Latino plaintiffs seeking legal \n     remedies for civil rights violations a fair day in court.\n       In the area of upholding federal statutes, Judge Shedd's \n     rulings regarding federalism are also troubling and follow \n     the Fourth Circuit's bold attempts to narrow the powers of \n     Congress in its protection of the rights of all Americans. We \n     conclude that Judge Shedd, as a judge on the circuit court, \n     would continue attempts to limit the powers of Congress to \n     pass legislation that protects the rights of Latinos and \n     other protected groups.\n       Judge Shedd has also exhibited a high level of \n     insensitivity or poor judgment in commenting on issues about \n     race--while serving as a federal district judge in a state \n     with a population that is 30% African-American. For example, \n     in a recent unpublished case, Judge Shedd was reported in the \n     press as making several insensitive comments as he dismissed \n     a lawsuit aimed at removing the Confederate battle flag from \n     the South Carolina statehouse dome.\n       Dennis Shedd's eleven-year record as a federal district \n     judge reflects hostility towards plaintiffs in civil rights \n     cases, a desire to limit authority to enact legislation that \n     is applicable to states, and insensitivity to issues of \n     discrimination. Further, Judge Shedd's extremist views on \n     these issues render him unsuitable to serve on the Fourth \n     Circuit. For these reasons, we urge you to oppose his \n     nomination to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Antonia Hernandez,\n                                    President and General Counsel.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, hundreds, probably thousands, of letters \nfrom South Carolina citizens arrived in my office urging a closer look \nat Judge Shedd's nomination to serve in the Fourth Circuit.\n  So we don't have a Congressional Record tomorrow morning that will be \nseveral hundred pages long, I will not include all of them with my \nremarks today.

Mr. President, there is a reason, when you look at Judge \nShedd's record, that many believe he has a reputation for assisting the \ndefense in civil cases and for ruling for the defense in employment \ncivil rights cases, for example. His holding in Condon v. Reno shows \nthat his view of the constitutional allocation of powers between the \nStates and the, Federal Government goes even beyond what we have seen \nfrom a very conservative activist Supreme Court across the street. They \nare busily rewriting the law in this fundamental area. And Judge Shedd \ngoes beyond the U.S. Supreme Court. His actions in a case involving \nserious prosecutorial and police misconduct also raise serious \nquestions about his fairness in criminal cases.\n  His record as a whole raises serious concerns about whether he should \nbe elevated to a court that is only one step below the U.S. Supreme \nCourt and whether he should be entrusted with deciding appeals there.\n  Every litigant, every defendant, every person, every plaintiff who \ncomes before a judge in the Federal courts must be assured that the \njudge will give a fair and unbiased hearing to the case at hand. The \ntest of a judge, especially a lifetime appointment, goes beyond just \nthe question of competence. When we are talking about our Federal \ncourts--remember, our Federal courts are admired around the world for \ntheir independence and their fairness, but that means that whether you \nor I, or anybody else walks into a Federal court, no matter what our \ncase is, whether we are plaintiff or a defendant, whether we are the \nGovernment or one responding to the Government, whether we are rich or \npoor, no matter what our political background is, when we walk into the \ncourtroom door, we have to be able to have confidence that this judge, \nthis Federal judge, will hear our case--he or she will hear it fairly.\n  Litigants in our federal courts should be able to have confidence to \nsay and believe that it makes no difference what my political \nbackground is, what the color of my skin is, where I am from, or \nanything else. I will win or I will lose based on the merits of the \ncase, not based on the individual prejudices of the judge.\n  Unfortunately, when one looks at Judge Shedd's record, one has to say \nthat somebody coming in to his court could not have that assurance. One \nhas to say unless they fit into a narrow category that Judge Shedd has \nroutinely favored in his cases, you are probably pretty unlucky to be \nbefore his court.\n  Let me go through these concerns in a little more detail. First, \nJudge Shedd has a reputation for assisting in the defense in civil \ncases, raising issues sua sponte (on his own motion, without a motion \nfrom the lawyers for the litigants), in essence making himself the \nthird litigator and not leaving it up to the parties--the plaintiff or \ndefendant--to litigate the case, but actually stepping in and taking \nsides and making it very clear to the people in the courtroom that he \nis taking sides.\n  He has ordered defendants to make motions for summary judgment \nwhether they wanted or planned to or not. He has resolved issues before \nthey are even raised and fully briefed, having made up his mind before \nthe case is even heard, having made up his mind on behalf of one of the \nlitigants. This shows a pattern of a judge injecting himself into \nlitigation, particularly in the shoes of corporations and others if \nthey are being sued, if they are defendants in civil litigation. Here \nare some specific cases that illustrate these interventions by Judge \nShedd to the benefit of one of the parties.\n  In McCarter v. RHNB, a case alleging gender discrimination, Judge \nShedd granted summary judgment. He did not even wait for the company to \nraise these grounds. He raised it for them and summarily ruled in their \nbehalf on an issue they had not even raised.\n  In Shults v. Denny's Restaurant, a case involving a claims of \nemployment discrimination under the Americans with Disabilties Act, \nJudge Shedd raised an issue on his own, saying he was doing it ``for \npossible resolution by summary judgment.'' In other words, putting \nhimself on the side of Denny's and in essence advocating for their \ninterests.\n  Again, deciding how best the defense should execute their litigation \nstrategy, he noted that three of the defenses asserted are potentially \ndispositive of certain claims--in other words, three of the defenses \ncould settle the case right there--and said ``these issues do not \nappear to necessitate much, if any, discovery on the part of the \nplaintiff.'' He mentioned, almost as an afterthought at the close of \nhis order, that defendants ``may also file a memorandum'' if they want.\n  It does not help when you are litigating a case if you know the judge \nhas already made up his mind for the other side. It helps even less if, \nhaving made it clear he has made up his mind for the other side, he \nactually steps in and helps the other side.\n  What kind of an image does that give to people who are expecting \nfairness and impartiality in our Federal courts? What does that say to \npeople who are being told by all of us, as we always are, that our \nFederal courts are impartial? What does it say when they watch cases \nbeing tried by a judge who takes sides openly and clearly and \ncontinuously in his courtroom?\n  In Lowery v. Seamless Sensations, a case where an African American \nwoman brought claims under Title VII for employment discrimination on \nthe basis of race, Judge Shedd turned to the person she was suing and \nsaid: Make a motion to dismiss. Then he quickly granted it. I bet you \nthat woman walked out of there wondering why she ever even bothered \ncoming into court when it was so obvious the judge made up his mind.\n\n  Take Coker v. Wal-Mart, in which it appears the judge wanted to get \nrid of this case. He wanted to make a motion on his own to send it back \nto the State court, but he did ask Wal-Mart: Give me a memo to show me \nI can really do that which, of course, is what Wal-Mart wanted.\n  In Gilmore v. Ford Motor Company, a product liability case, Judge \nShedd outlined four factors he must consider before dismissing an \naction for failure to prosecute. He found that the defendants had not \nset forth evidence addressing these four factors, but nevertheless went \non to ``glean certain pertinent information from the record.''\n  In other words, he said: Here is what you need to win this case. You \nhave not raised these issues yourself. I have gleaned them from \nsomewhere in the record. So do not worry, buddies, I\n\n[[Page S11258]]\n\nhave taken care of you; I am on your side. I will argue your case for \nyou and, in doing this, I can dismiss the case against you.\n  You almost wonder if the winning side feels they should pay their \nattorneys when the judge has stepped in to help them win the case.\n  In Simmons v. Coastal Contractors, both parties were appearing \nwithout a lawyer, or pro se. Judge Shedd noted that ``this civil action \n. . . is before the court sua sponte.'' While he must have meant the \nmotion itself was before him sua sponte, or on his own motion, he \nbrought up deficiencies in the plaintiff's complaint and ordered that \nan amended complaint be filed or the action would be dismissed on the \njudge's own motion. In other words, he essentially indicated I am going \nto decide the case. You litigants go have coffee if you want, but I am \ngoing to make up my mind, make your arguments for you, and settle the \ncase for you.\n  In another substitution for his strategic litigation judgment for \nthat of the defendants, Tessman v. Island Ford-Lincoln-Mercury, Judge \nShedd threatened to dismiss the plaintiff's Title VII action on his own \nunless the plaintiff could show cause why he should not. He said the \nplaintiff had not alleged that she had presented her claim to, or \nreceived a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC and decided that rather \nthan letting the defense move for dismissal, he would do so on his own. \nIn other words: I am going to make the arguments on the other side and \nget rid of the case.\n  Additionally, of the 11 cases relating to employment discrimination \navailable in the public record, Judge Shedd held for the employer in \nevery single one, including one case where he sat by designation on the \nFourth Circuit. Judge Shedd granted summary judgment after summary \njudgment and found for the employer and against the employee in a wide \nrange of employment discrimination claims.\n  Of the 54 fair employment cases included in the unpublished opinions \nhe provided to the Committee, more than 80 percent of them grant \nsummary judgment to the defendants. That does not appear to be a fair \nrecord. It strongly indicates plaintiffs are not receiving fair \nhearings. Employment cases are often fact-specific disputes that would \nnot seem likely to result in an overwhelming majority of summary \njudgment decisions for defendants because under the summary judgment \nstandard, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to \nthe non-movant--the plaintiff under these circumstances--and the judge \nmust find that there are no disputes about material facts and that \njudgment as a matter of law is warranted for the moving party the \ndefendants.\n  Certainly when I look at the mail I get from South Carolina and from \nlitigants and others there, there is a pervasive feeling that unless \nyou fit the right category when you come before that court, you are not \ngoing to get a hearing favorable to you--actually, an overwhelming \nfeeling that the hearings will not be fair. They will be slanted to one \nside. That is not how we maintain the integrity and independence of the \nFederal bench. For example, the National Employment Lawyers Association \nreviewed Judge Shedd's public record. They sent a letter opposing his \nconfirmation. I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                               National Employment\n\n\n                                          Lawyers Association,\n\n                                               September 17, 2002.\n     Re Dennis Sheed--Appointee for United States Court of \n         Appeals.\n\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: On behalf of the National Employment \n     Lawyers Association (NELA), I am writing you to express our \n     organization's strong opposition to the nomination of Judge \n     Dennis Shedd to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. We urge \n     the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to vote against \n     his nomination. We further urge the Administration to \n     nominate a person for that seat who will apply federal \n     employment and labor laws in a fair and even-handed manner, \n     and who will interpret those laws in keeping with the intent \n     of Congress.\n\n\n     during his hearing, judge shedd offered misleading information\n\n       Judge Shedd's employment law decisions have been, almost \n     without exception, in favor of employers. At his Committee \n     hearing earlier this year, Judge Shedd claimed that was \n     unable to recall any employment case in his courtroom that \n     had gone to trial resulted in a verdict or judgment in favor \n     of the plaintiff. By way of explanation, Judge Shedd told the \n     Committee that no judge in his district had an employment \n     case where the employee had won at trial. This statement was \n     untrue, and several other judges in the district presided \n     over trials which were won by the plaintiffs. Shedd's \n     statement is not only indicative of his anti-employee bias, \n     but also demonstrates a cavalier attitude toward the truth \n     and a willingness to offer erroneous information to the \n     Committee.\n       In addition, NELA is concerned that Judge Shedd may not \n     have opened his entire judicial record for scrutiny by the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee and the public. Shedd turned over \n     unpublished opinions only after his hearing, and never \n     provided the Committee with a full docket of his cases. \n     Without a full docket, it is impossible to determine whether \n     all of Judge Shedd's unpublished opinions have been released. \n     Your Committee is considering Judge Shedd's lifetime \n     appointment to a court where his rulings would carry enormous \n     precedential force. In light of the importance of this \n     appointment, the Committee and the full Senate should not \n     be forced to make a decision based on a record that may be \n     incomplete.\n\n\n judge shedd's employment decisions reveal a strong anti-employee bias\n\n       NELA has analyzed dozens of Judge Shedd's unpublished and \n     published decisions in employment cases. These decisions \n     reveal a willingness to bend the law and ignore precedent in \n     order to reach results-oriented rulings.\n\n\njudge shedd frequently ignored the findings of his own magistrate judge \n                   in order to rule against employees\n\n       In the federal district courts, Magistrate Judges often \n     evaluate a case and recommend to the judge whether the \n     plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence for the case to \n     go to trial. The decisions of Magistrate Judges are typically \n     affirmed, as the Magistrate Judge usually has had an \n     opportunity to fully review the facts of the case. Judge \n     Shedd has frequently ignored uncontradicted evidence and \n     overruled the recommendations of Magistrate Judges.\n       In Cleary v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., the \n     Magistrate Judge has found that there was sufficient evidence \n     for a trial where a female employee was fired in retaliation \n     for filing a sexual harassment case. The employer forced the \n     female employee to take administrative leave and then fired \n     her after she filed a sexual harassment claim, but the \n     harasser was allowed to keep working. Judge Shedd rejected \n     the Magistrate Judge's recommendation, and refused to let the \n     case go to trial. By viewing each of the seven or eight \n     incidents of harassment as a separate incident rather than as \n     a whole, Judge Shedd concluded that there was no evidence \n     that the female employee was forced to take leave and then \n     terminated for retaliatory reasons (contrary to the \n     Magistrate Judge's findings). Judge Shedd's analysis--viewing \n     each incident in isolation--is contrary to established \n     Supreme Court precedent. Judge Shedd also excused some of the \n     defendant's acts as mere ``mistakes.''\n       In Dinkins v. Blackman, Judge Shedd rejected a magistrate \n     Judge's recommendation and granted summary judgment on a \n     sexual harassment claim and other claims by the employee, \n     even though Judge Shedd found that the sexual harassment was \n     ``gross behavior.'' Judge Shedd refused to give the employee \n     the opportunity to seek further information for her case in \n     discovery, ignoring a new Supreme Court case which was \n     decided after Dinkins filed her case.\n       In Ellis v. Speaks Oil Co., Judge Shedd granted summary \n     judgment in favor of the employer on an age discrimination \n     claim, contrary to the Magistrate Judge's recommendation, \n     because he concluded that the plaintiff, a truck driver, was \n     not performing his duties up to his employer's expectations \n     of driving two trips per day. He disregarded evidence found \n     by the Magistrate Judge which showed that the plaintiff, who \n     was 62 years old, was driving two trips per day until the \n     company let him go.\n       In Roberts v. Defender Services, Judge Shedd ignored the \n     Magistrate Judge's recommendation to deny the employer's \n     motion for summary judgment in a sexual harassment case. \n     Judge Shedd agreed that the harassment in this case was \n     severe, but ruled that the woman did not prove that she was \n     really upset by the harassment, which should have been a \n     question for the jury to decide.\n\n\njudge shedd ignored clear and established precedent in order to rule in \n       favor of corporate employers against individual employees\n\n       In Ephraim v. Paul Harris Stores, Inc., Judge Shedd held \n     that a claim of invasion of privacy (false light) was not \n     cognizable under South Carolina law, despite two South \n     Caroline Supreme Court decisions that had recognized this as \n     a valid claim under state law.\n       In Rector v. Rainbow Shops, Inc., Judge Shedd disregarded \n     South Carolina state-court decisions that had held that a \n     mere insinuation is actionable in a defamation case if it is \n     false and malicious and the meaning is plain. Instead, he \n     decided that employee's termination while the store was \n     experiencing cash shortages was not reasonably capable of\n\n[[Page S11259]]\n\n     a defamatory meaning. Judge Shedd also allowed the employer \n     to read and sign the form, even though the employer offered \n     no reason for doing this. Judge Shedd did not even require \n     the employer to explain why it was necessary for the \n     termination meeting to occur in public, in the presence of \n     other store employees.\n       In Storms v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., Judge Shedd held \n     that an employee could not bring a claim for breach of \n     contract based on language contained in the company's own \n     personnel documents because there was no evidence of ``mutual \n     assent'' to those documents. He did not explain why the \n     company had not assented to the promises contained in its own \n     documents. He refused to follow precedent by the South \n     Carolina Supreme Court on this and related issues. Later, in \n     Truesdale v. Dana Corp., Judge Shedd cited his own opinion in \n     Storms and again failed to follow precedent. In this case, an \n     employee was fired in violation of the company's own \n     disciplinary policies and procedures. By interpreting the \n     employer's personnel documents in a selective, extremely pro-\n     employer manner, Judge Shedd determined that the employer's \n     policies did not protect the employee.\n\n\n  judge shedd disregarded or misconstrued evidence to the benefit of \n                               employers\n\n       In English v. Kennecott Ridgeway Mining Co., an injured \n     employee claimed that he was fired in retaliation for filing \n     a workers' compensation claim. Judge Shedd dismissed the \n     retaliatory discharge claim despite uncontradicted evidence \n     (summarized in his own opinion) which demonstrated the \n     employer's hostility toward the injured worker because of his \n     workers' compensation claim. In fact, while the plaintiff \n     ``was still under the care of the company's physician, \n     coworkers informed English that his superiors were \n     complaining that English was milking the system, that he was \n     not really hurt, and that he should be returned to full \n     duty.''\n       In Givens v. South Carolina Health Insurance Pool, Judge \n     Shedd allowed the state insurance pool to exclude AIDS/HIV \n     from health insurance coverage. Judge Shedd held that the \n     Sec. 501(c) insurance underwriting exclusion (safe harbor \n     provision) of the Americans with Disabilities Act (``ADA'') \n     exempted the Insurance pool from coverage under that statute, \n     even though the State did not do any of its own actuarial \n     studies or underwriting studies to evaluate the expensive and \n     risks of insuring persons with AIDS/HIV. Since the State \n     failed to do any of its own studies, it should have been \n     barred from being able to claim the Sec. 501(c) exemption.\n       In Gregory v. Chester County Sheriff's Dept., Judge Shedd \n     accepted a poorly reasoned recommendation from a Magistrate \n     Judge against an employee. The Magistrate Judge had found \n     that the employee could not prove that her demotion was an \n     ``adverse action'' by the employer. This ruling is contrary \n     to precedent that demotions are adverse job actions. Gurganus \n     v. Beneficial North Carolina, Inc., 2001 U.S. App. LEXIS \n     26943 (4th Cir. 2000). Although Judge Shedd stated that he \n     was supposed to review the Magistrate Judge's recommendation \n     de novo, he issued only a one-page summary order.\n       In Richberg v. Glaston Copper Recycling, Judge Shedd \n     refused to consider evidence presented by the plaintiff that \n     showed the existence of genuine issues of material fact when \n     he granted summary judgment for the employer. For example, he \n     claimed that the plaintiff had failed to challenge the \n     employer's affirmative defense that the plaintiff was \n     terminated for failing to meet ``established work \n     standards,'' although the plaintiff had submitted a positive \n     performance evaluation from his personnel file. Judge Shedd \n     also refused to follow a state court decision that had held \n     that a sixteen-day proximity in time between a workers' \n     compensation filing and a drug screen was prima facie \n     retaliation, on the grounds that the drug screen in the \n     Richberg case was ordered 50 days after the filing.\n\n\n judge shedd's appointment to the fourth circuit would stack the court \n                        with pro-employer judges\n\n       NELA members who practice in the states within the Fourth \n     Circuit repeatedly have reported that they do everything they \n     can to avoid filing employment cases in federal court and \n     avoid filing federal claims in state court, for fear of \n     removal. As a result, federal statutes prohibiting \n     discrimination in employment--Title VII, the ADA, the Age \n     Discrimination in Employment Act, the Reconstruction-era \n     civil rights acts--are largely not enforced in those states \n     because the Fourth Circuit has created a hostile environment \n     for those claims. As Committee members are aware, the Fourth \n     Circuit has been reversed even by the current Supreme Court \n     on a number of occasions, in cases involving employment and \n     other matters. See, e.g., EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc., 534 \n     U.S. 279 (2002) (reversing the Fourth Circuit decision by a \n     6-3 vote, and holding that the EEOC is not bound by \n     arbitration agreements between an employee and employer); \n     Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 531 U.S. 67 (2001) (by a 6-3 \n     vote, holding that coerced drug testing of pregnant women is \n     unconstitutional); Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428 \n     (2000) (by a 7-2 vote, the Court refused to overrule Miranda \n     v. Arizona).\n\n\n         nela strongly opposes the confirmation of judge shedd\n\n       Judge Shedd's record shows a cavalier attitude toward \n     evidence, legal precedent, and an alarming tendency to deny \n     working men and women who appear before him their day in \n     court. Judge Shedd is dismissive toward the rights of workers \n     who face harassment and mistreatment by their employers. \n     Unlike his colleagues in the District of South Carolina, \n     there has never been a pro-employee verdict in any civil \n     rights trial in Judge Shedd's courtroom. If fairness and a \n     commitment to equal justice are expected of appointees to the \n     United States Court of Appeals, then Judge Shedd has proven \n     that he cannot satisfy these expectations. For these reasons, \n     NELA urges you to oppose the confirmation of Judge Dennis \n     Shedd.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                              Frederick M. Gittes,\n               President, National Employment Lawyers Association.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I mentioned that Judge Shedd tends to go \neven beyond where an activist U.S. Supreme Court has gone. In a 1997 \ncase challenging the constitutionality of the Driver's Privacy \nProtection Act, Judge Shedd made a federalism ruling that went way \nbeyond even the extreme federalism rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court, \nand it was so bad that the U.S. Supreme Court in a 9-to-0 opinion \nreversed Judge Shedd's ruling.\n  In Condon v. Reno, Judge Shedd ruled on the constitutionality of the \nDriver's Privacy Act, which essentially prohibited States from selling \nand sharing personal information gleaned as they were picking up \ndriver's license information. He said that the Act violated the 10th \nAmendment as interpreted by the courts in New York v. United States and \nPrintz v. United States. Three years later, Chief Justice Rehnquist \nwrote for the Court explaining that, to the contrary, neither of the \ncases applied. He did not get just one of them wrong, he got them both \nwrong. The Chief Justice wrote that because the Act did not require the \nStates in their sovereign capacity to regulate their own citizens, but \ninstead regulates the States as the owners of the databases. Therefore, \nthe Act was consistent with the constitutional principles enunciated in \nNew York v. Printz.\n  In Crosby v. South Carolina, he found the Family and Medical Leave \nAct unconstitutional on the grounds that it was not properly enacted \nunder Congress's power. I mention this case because it is the second \ntime Judge Shedd ruled in such a way in an important federalism case. \nHe also ruled this way because he just took a magistrate judge's very \nbrief report and did not put in any significant analysis of his own.\n  In this case, it is almost impossible to figure out his reasoning for \nwhy this important law with bipartisan support would be \nunconstitutional, especially when acts of Congress are entitled to a \npresumption of constitutionality. One would think if somebody really \ncared about the courts of appeal and the Supreme Court, they would have \nat least given us rigorous analysis instead of making what appears to \nbe a somewhat arbitrary ruling.\n  In addition, he issued several opinions relating to a murder case \nwhere a privileged conversation between the defendant and his attorney \nwas monitored and recorded on videotape by the county sheriff's \ndepartment. Present in the room where the conversation was being \nmonitored were several of the sheriff's deputies and the county \nprosecutor who subsequently handled the case. The defendant was \nconvicted and sentenced to death but the Supreme Court of South \nCarolina reversed because of the nature of the videotaping. In its \nopinion, the Supreme Court of South Carolina--not one considered the \nmost liberal of courts--used very strong language that condemned the \nfailure to disqualify the local prosecutor's office. They cited the \nprosecutor's special responsibilities to do justice. And the South \nCarolina Supreme Court said it would not tolerate deliberate \nprosecutorial misconduct which threatens rights fundamental to liberty \nand justice. That is about as strong a condemnation by any state \nSupreme Court of a prosecutor's actions as I have ever heard.\n  So the federal prosecutions relating to the videotaping were then \nbrought to Judge Shedd's courtroom. Both the prosecutor, Fran \nHumphries, and the defense attorney, Jack Duncan, were brought before a \nfederal grand jury investigating these constitutional violations.\n  Mr. Duncan testified that he had not given a copy of the tape to a \ntelevision reporter, while Mr. Humphries testified he had not \nimmediately known the taping was taking place. Now each of them\n\n[[Page S11260]]\n\nwas charged with perjury based on these statements. As I mentioned, the \nprosecutor and several of the sheriffs, were there watching the taping. \nSo it was obvious he was not telling the truth.\n  Mr. Duncan, the defense attorney, was found guilty and sentenced to 4 \nmonths in prison. Even though the information seemed overwhelming \nagainst the prosecutor, Judge Shedd dismissed those charges.\n\n  This is enlightening because if anybody was hurt by the improper \ntaping, it was the defendant and the defense attorney. If anybody truly \ncommitted a wrongdoing, as the South Carolina Supreme Court said in the \nstrongest language against a prosecutor I can remember, it was the \nprosecutor. But having them both before his court, Judge Shedd in \neffect exonerated the prosecutor and sentenced the defense attorney to \n4 months.\n  Think of yourself as the litigant before his court. Look at all of \nthese cases I have talked about, and so many others. I do not fall in \nthe category of the sides he tends to rule with. I am on the other \nside. It would be an awful sinking feeling to go in there knowing how \ngood your case is but you are probably going to lose.\n  This particular decision shows disregard for the rights of Americans \nwho, no matter what they have been accused of, should be able to expect \nprivacy and not to be videotaped by the government when they are \ntalking to their attorneys. The law is settled in this country that \nwith attorney-client privilege you can sit down and talk with your \nattorney without the prosecutor videotaping what you are saying, \nwithout them listening to or eavesdropping on you.\n  There are a couple of people you are able to talk to with a \nreasonable expectation of privacy. You are able to talk to your spouse. \nYou are able to talk to your attorney. You are able to talk to your \npriest in a penitent relationship. Here, the prosecutor violated that--\nsomething that every prosecutor's handbook in America says is wrong, \nsomething that hornbook law says is wrong, every ethics course says is \nwrong, and every bar association says is wrong. The Supreme Court of \nSouth Carolina unanimously said it was wrong but Judge Shedd said to \nthe prosecutor: It is okay; we will get the other guy. Well, that calls \ninto question his ability to be fair in criminal cases.\n  So I am concerned when I see his record as a Federal district judge, \nand I ask myself: If this is his record as a Federal district judge, \nhow is he going to be as a circuit judge on the court of appeals? So I \nshare some of the same concerns about his fairness that we have heard \nexpressed from South Carolina and from throughout the Fourth Circuit.\n  I know arguments will be made on the other side, and this will be \ndisposed of however the Senate decides to vote, but for me, I could not \nin good conscience vote aye on this nomination. I will vote no.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters from the Leadership Conference \non Civil Rights, Alliance for Justice, and others be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and Alliance for \n           Justice,\n                                  Washington, DC, August 30, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chair, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: We, the undersigned civil and human \n     rights organizations, write to express our strong opposition \n     to the confirmation of Dennis Shedd to the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\n       First, we want to comment on the Judiciary Committee's \n     level of review of this particular nomination. On July 11, we \n     sent a letter expressing concern that the Committee had not \n     received all of the information required to make a fully \n     informed decision about whether to elevate Judge Shedd to the \n     Fourth Circuit. We urged the Committee to take steps to \n     complete the record on this nominee, and to hold another \n     hearing to allow the Committee to fully examine the complete \n     record.\n       It now appears as if the Committee has declined to ensure \n     that it has obtained the complete judicial record and has \n     decided not to hold a second hearing on the nomination. We \n     are deeply troubled that the Committee may vote on the Shedd \n     nomination without first obtaining a complete record and then \n     providing an opportunity to publicly explore that record. The \n     many concerns that we have identified in Judge Shedd's record \n     produced thus far and which give rise to our opposition only \n     strengthen our conviction that a vote on the nomination \n     should occur only after a full record is obtained and \n     examined.\n       We strongly believe that the composition of the federal \n     judiciary is a civil rights issue of profound importance to \n     all Americans, because the individuals charged with \n     dispensing justice in our society have a direct impact on \n     civil rights protections for us all. As you know, the role of \n     the federal judiciary in protecting the rights of the \n     powerless is particularly acute in the Fourth Circuit, which \n     has the highest percentage of African-Americans of any \n     federal circuit in the nation.\n       The Fourth Circuit is also arguably the most conservative \n     of the federal circuits. Several of its most conservative \n     decisions have been subsequently reversed by the Supreme \n     Court as too extreme, including Condon v. Reno, a challenge \n     to Congress's power to protect the privacy of drivers' \n     license information; an attempt to overrule the Miranda rule; \n     and Virginia's attempt to limit the right of reproductive \n     choice. Because of the high percentage of minority citizens \n     in the circuit and the very conservative nature of the court, \n     it is imperative that any new appointment to this court be a \n     person of moderate views who is wholly committed to the goals \n     of equality and equal opportunity for all Americans. After an \n     extensive review of Judge Shedd's record, it has become clear \n     that he is not that nominee.\n       We are deeply concerned about Judge Shedd's reluctance to \n     follow the law in support of vigorous enforcement of legal \n     protections against discrimination for women and minorities. \n     During Judge Shedd's time on the bench, at least forty \n     African-Americans have filed employment discrimination cases \n     that were assigned to Judge Shedd's court. Of those, Judge \n     Shedd granted summary judgment for the employer in whole or \n     in part in almost every case. In one case, Bailey v. South \n     Carolina Dep't of Social Services, Judge Shedd granted \n     summary judgment to the employer, even though the EEOC had \n     determine there was reasonable cause to believe that the \n     plaintiff was not promoted due to his race. In another case, \n     McMillan v. Department of Corrections, the plaintiff alleged \n     discrimination in the denial of a pay increase by the \n     Department of Corrections. The plaintiff's supervisor had \n     requested a pay increase for the plaintiff. At the same time, \n     another State agency conducted an investigation into racially \n     discriminatory employment practices within the Department of \n     Corrections and concluded that White employees tended to do \n     significantly better than Black employees in performance pay \n     increases. Nevertheless, Judge Shedd refused to let this case \n     go to trial. In contrast to cases involving African-American \n     plaintiffs, in four out of five discrimination cases filed by \n     White male plaintiffs, Judge Shedd has denied summary \n     judgment and paved the way for trial.\n       Judge Shedd has an equally poor record in cases involving \n     gender discrimination. In one case, Roberts v. Defender \n     Services, Inc., he granted summary judgment to an employer in \n     a sexual harassment case, even after concluding that the \n     supervisor's conduct ``clearly was, from an objective \n     standpoint, sufficiently severe and pervasive to constitute a \n     hostile and abusive work environment.'' Despite that finding, \n     Judge Shedd concluded that the plaintiff had not provided any \n     evidence that she ``subjectively perceived the environment to \n     be abusive,'' reaching this conclusion despite the fact that \n     the record contained evidence that the plaintiff's supervisor \n     made sexual comments to her on a daily basis, that she told \n     him these comments were offensive, that she and a female \n     manager took steps to report the conduct to corporate \n     headquarters, and that she resigned from her job.\n       Judge Shedd has also exhibited a disturbing tendency to \n     resolve cases on summary judgment in favor of defendants, \n     even where genuine issues of material fact were clearly \n     presented. For example, in Alston v. Ruston, Judge Shedd \n     granted summary judgment on a Section 1983 complaint after \n     concluding, as a matter of law, that a prison guard had not \n     used excessive force--despite an affidavit and a well-pleaded \n     complaint from the plaintiff alleging that the officer had \n     sprayed him in the face with tear gas without justification, \n     advanced toward him ``swinging his fists and punching \n     [plaintiff] in the mouth,'' and wielded a broomstick until \n     another officer intervened. Given the evidence presented, \n     there was no room for Judge Shedd to conclude that excessive \n     force had not taken place as a matter of law. Nevertheless, \n     Judge Shedd made such a ruling and dismissed the plaintiff's \n     case.\n       In other cases, Judge Shedd has exhibited hostility toward \n     plaintiffs in civil rights claims involving allegations of \n     misconduct by law enforcement officers. For example, in Joye \n     v. Richland Co. Sheriff's Dep't., Judge Shedd dismissed a \n     Section 1983 claim brought by a person wrongfully arrested by \n     sheriff's deputies under a bench warrant issued for his son. \n     Despite the fact that the arrest warrant described a 31 year \n     old man, standing 5' 11'', the officers arrested the \n     plaintiff who was 61 years old and stood 5' 7'' tall. The \n     plaintiff argued that the officers had acted unreasonably in \n     arresting him, in violation of his 4th Amendment rights. \n     Judge Shedd, however, concluded that the plaintiff had not \n     stated a valid 1983 claim because the officers had a \n     ``reasonable, good\n\n[[Page S11261]]\n\n     faith, belief, that they were arresting the correct person.'' \n     He therefore rejected, as a matter of law, the contrary \n     conclusion of the magistrate that the officers were not \n     entitled to a ``good faith'' defense on these facts.\n       Judge Shedd's record also displays a consistent disregard \n     for the rights of people with disabilities. He has ruled \n     against disability rights plaintiffs in almost every \n     instance, departing from settled law and adopting tortured \n     interpretations of disability rights laws. In one case, Judge \n     Shedd approved a state health insurance pool's complete \n     exclusion from coverage of a man who was HIV positive. The \n     plaintiff who filed the case sought to have it decided on an \n     expedited basis, but died eight months later before any \n     decision was rendered. In another case, a magistrate had \n     found no evidence that the plaintiff's disability interfered \n     with his ability to do his job and recommended that the \n     plaintiff be permitted to proceed with the claim. \n     Nevertheless, Judge Shedd dismissed the plaintiff's claim, \n     concluding, without citing any evidence, that the disability \n     rendered the plaintiff unable to do his job.\n       We are also very concerned about Judge Shedd's views on \n     ``state's rights'' which would limit Congress's power to pass \n     laws that are applicable to the States. Shedd authored the \n     original district court opinion in Condon v. Reno, striking \n     down the Driver's Privacy Protection Act based on his belief \n     that the federal government did not have the power to require \n     States to ensure that State driver's license records would \n     remain private. Although the Fourth Circuit affirmed Judge \n     Shedd's decision, the Supreme Court unanimously reversed the \n     holding in a decision by Chief Justice Rehnquist. We are \n     unaware of any other instance in the last 50 years where a \n     district court judge has struck down an act of Congress on \n     federalism grounds only to be unanimously reversed by the \n     Supreme Court. Judge Shedd also struck down part of the \n     Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), in Crosby v. South \n     Carolina Dep't of Health and Envtl. Control, holding that the \n     11th Amendment doctrine of state sovereign immunity prevents \n     an employee from suing a State agency for violation of the \n     FMLA. This issue--because it calls into question Congress's \n     power to remedy sex discrimination in the workplace--has \n     profound implications for Congress's authority under Section \n     5 of the 14th Amendment.\n       Judge Shedd has also exhibited a high level of \n     insensitivity on issues of race. In a recent case, Judge \n     Shedd made several insensitive comments as he dismissed a \n     lawsuit aimed at removing the Confederate battle flag from \n     the South Carolina statehouse dome. According to press \n     accounts, Judge Shedd suggested that South Carolina, 30% of \n     whom are African-American, ``don't care if that flag flies or \n     not.'' He also analogized the Confederate battle flag, to \n     many a symbol of support for slavery and racist acts of \n     terror directed at African-Americans, to the Palmetto tree, \n     which is on the State flag, stating: ``What about the \n     Palmetto tree? What if that reminds me that Palmetto trees \n     were cut down to make Fort Moultrie and that offends me?'' \n     Judge Shedd's hostility to the lawsuit in open court provides \n     strong evidence of a poor judicial temperament. His attempt \n     to minimize the symbolism of the Confederate flag to the \n     African American community and suggest it is comparable to an \n     image of the Palmetto tree reflects a stunning insensitivity \n     to the injurious impact this particular symbol still has on \n     many of our citizens.\n       In sum, Dennis Shedd's eleven-year record on the federal \n     district bench reflects hostility towards plaintiffs in civil \n     rights cases, including minorities, women and persons with \n     disabilities, a desire to limit Congress's authority to enact \n     protective legislation that is applicable to the states, and \n     insensitive to issues of race. Judge Shedd's view on these \n     issues render him a poor choice for the Fourth Circuit and we \n     therefore urge you to oppose his confirmation.\n           Sincerely,\n         Wade Henderson, Executive Director, Leadership Conference \n           on Civil Rights; Nan Aron, President, Alliance for \n           Justice; Kate Michelman, President, NARAL; Elaine R. \n           Jones, President and Director-Counsel, NAACP Legal \n           Defense and Educational Fund; Hilary Shelton, \n           Director--Washington Bureau, NAACP; Ralph Neas, \n           President, People for the American Way; Nancy Zirkin, \n           Director of Public Policy, American Association of \n           University Women; Eleanor Smeal, President, Feminist \n           Majority; Jim Ward, Executive Director, ADA Watch; \n           Judith L.

Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: On behalf of the more than 500,000 \n     members and supporters of People For the American Way (PFAW), \n     we write to express our strong opposition to the elevation of \n     Judge Dennis Shedd to the United States Court of Appeals for \n     the Fourth Circuit.\n       Judge Shedd's views on federalism are of grave concern. \n     Judge Shedd authored the original district court opinion in \n     Condon v. Reno, which struck down the Driver's Privacy \n     Protection Act based on his analysis that the federal \n     government did not have the power to require states to ensure \n     that driver's license records remain private. Although the \n     Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, an a unanimous \n     decision authored by Justice Rehnquist, the Supreme Court \n     unanimously reversed. PFAW is unaware of any other instance \n     in the last 50 years where a district court judge has struck \n     down an act of Congress on federalism grounds only to be \n     unanimously reversed by the Supreme Court.\n       In Crosby v. South Carolina Dept. of Health and Envtl. \n     Control, Judge Shedd also struck down part of the Family and \n     Medical Leave Act (FMLA), holding that the 11th Amendment \n     doctrine of state sovereign immunity prevents an employee \n     from suing a State agency for violation of the FMLA. This \n     issue--because it calls into question Congress's power to \n     remedy sex discrimination in the workplace--has profound \n     implications for Congress's authority under Section 5 of the \n     14th Amendment.\n       Judge Shedd has a troubling record on civil rights \n     enforcement. Throughout his eleven years as a federal \n     district court judge, Judge Shedd has dismissed almost every \n     civil rights case on behalf of minority claimants that has \n     come before him, thereby preventing the merits of these cases \n     from being heard by a jury.\n       For example, in Bailey v. South Carolina Dept. of Social \n     Services, Judge Shedd granted summary judgment to the \n     employer, even though the Equal Employment Opportunity \n     Commission (EEOC) had determined there was reasonable cause \n     to believe that the African American plaintiff was not \n     promoted because of his race. In McMillan v. South Carolina \n     Dept. of Corrections, a case involving allegations of race \n     discrimination, Judge Shedd refused to allow the plaintiff's \n     claim to go to trial, despite a finding by another state \n     agency that Caucasian employees tended to receive higher \n     performance pay increases than African-American employees.\n       In contrast, in four of the five cases filed in his court \n     by Caucasian plaintiffs alleging ``reverse discrimination'' \n     in employment, Judge Shedd denied summary judgment and \n     allowed the case to proceed to a jury trial.\n       Judge Shedd's record also reflects insensitivity in civil \n     rights cases alleging discrimination based on gender. For \n     example, in Roberts v. Defender Services, Inc., a \n     recommendation of the federal magistrate and granted summary \n     judgment to the defendant. In Roberts, the record contained \n     evidence that the plaintiff's supervisor made sexual comments \n     to her on a daily basis, that she told him these comments \n     were offensive, that she and a female manager took steps to \n     report the conduct to corporate headquarters, and that she \n     resigned from her job. Despite this evidence, Judge Shedd \n     stated that while the supervisor's conduct ``clearly was, \n     from an objective standpoint, sufficiently severe and \n     pervasive to constitute a hostile and abusive work \n     environment,'' the plaintiff had not provided any evidence \n     that she ``subjectively perceived the environment to be \n     abusive.''\n       A number of Judge Shedd's opinions reflect a disregard for \n     laws protecting the disabled. For example, in Payette v. \n     Westinghouse Electric Corp., Judge Shedd effectively read the \n     right of employees to ``reassignment,'' a crucial protection \n     for those with disabilities, out of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act (ADA). Congress explicitly included \n     reassignment to a vacant position, when the person is no \n     longer able to do his or her job, as one type of \n     accommodation required by the ADA. In Givens v. South \n     Carolina Health Insurance Pool, Judge Shedd ignored the plain \n     meaning of the ADA when he approved a state health insurance \n     pool's refusal of coverage for a man who was HIV positive. No \n     other medical condition was excluded, and the state had done \n     no actuarial analysis to justify the exclusion of individuals \n     with HIV/AIDS. While many courts have held that the ADA does \n     not prevent insurance plans from providing lesser benefits \n     for treatment of particular types of disabilities, this \n     ruling goes beyond those decisions.\n       Judge Shedd has exhibited a high level of insensitivity on \n     issues of race. In a recent case, Judge Shedd made several \n     insensitive comments as he dismissed a lawsuit aimed at \n     removing the Confederate battle flag from the South Carolina \n     statehouse dome. According to press accounts, Judge Shedd \n     suggested that South Carolinians, 30% of whom are African-\n     American, ``don't care if that flag flies or not.'' He also \n     analogized the Confederate battle flag, to many a symbol of \n     support for slavery and racist acts of terror directed at \n     African-Americans, to the Palmetto tree, which is on the \n     South Carolina State flag, stating: ``What about the Palmetto \n     tree? What if that reminds me that Palmetto trees were cut \n     down to make Fort Moultrie and that offends me?''\n       Given the importance of the Fourth Circuit and the current \n     ideological imbalance on the court, it is imperative that any \n     nominee to this court be a jurist of more moderate views who \n     will protect the civil and constitutional rights of all \n     Americans. Judge Shedd's record demonstrates that he is not\n\n[[Page S11262]]\n\n     the nominee. PFAW urges the Judiciary committee to reject his \n     nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Ralph G. Neas,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        National Headquarters,\n\n                                     Chicago, IL, August 24, 2002.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Member, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Leahy: Let me lend my voice of opposition to \n     the chorus of discontent surrounding the nomination of Judge \n     Dennis Shedd to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. I urge \n     you to oppose the Shedd nomination, based on the merits, and \n     the merits alone. A seat on the Fourth Circuit is too \n     important to the nation's judiciary not to be heavily \n     scrutinized.\n       As a native of South Carolina, I am deeply disturbed by the \n     direction taken by the Fourth Circuit in recent years. As a \n     Judicial Circuit with considerable influence on the Supreme \n     Court, those elevated to the Court should reflect the highest \n     American ideals of inclusion and equal protection under the \n     law. Moreover, the states included in the Fourth Circuit are \n     comprised of the highest percentage of African Americans, \n     than any other Circuit, thus judges on the Court must be \n     sensitive and respectful for the civil rights laws for which \n     we fought so hard.\n       Currently, the Fourth Circuit is the most extremist court \n     in the nation on civil rights issues, criminal justice \n     issues, and those involving the power of the federal \n     government, to enact legislation, which holds States \n     accountable for civil rights violations. The nomination of \n     Dennis Shedd threatens to take the Court in a further \n     extremist direction. For example, Judge Shedd's opinion in \n     the Condon v. Reno case suggests that he favors disempowering \n     Congress. American judges, and their rulings should protect \n     rights, rather than restrict the balance of power.\n       To preserve this nation's ideals of inclusion, and to \n     ensure equal protection under the law for all Americans, I \n     urge you, and other members of the members of the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee to vote ``No'' on the nomination of \n     Dennis Shedd.\n           Sincerely,\n     Reverend Jesse L. Jackson, Sr.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        South Carolina Legislative\n\n\n                                                 Black Caucus,\n\n                                  Columbia, SC, September 4, 2002.\n     Re Fourth Circuit Nomination of Judge Shedd.\n\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chair, Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: The South Carolina Legislative Black \n     Caucus (SCLBC) was formed in 1975 soon after the Civil Rights \n     Movement in the 1960's. Presently, the SCLBC has 31 members; \n     seven senators and 24 representatives, including four women. \n     The SCLBC is dedicated to the struggle for fairness, equality \n     and justice for all South Carolinians, and to the civic and \n     political involvement of African-Americans, women and other \n     racial and ethnic minorities.\n       We seek to preserve the civil rights strides that occurred \n     in South Carolina over the decades, and we fight to prevent \n     any regressive step that threatens to rollback civil rights \n     and constitutional rights of African-Americans, women and \n     other racial and ethnic minorities. The nomination of U.S. \n     District Judge Dennis W. Shedd to the U.S. Court of Appeals \n     for the Fourth Circuit represents such a regressive step, and \n     accordingly, we strongly oppose the nomination.\n       African-Americans constitute a full one-third of South \n     Carolina's population, yet there is only one active African-\n     American federal judge in the state. And, there are only two \n     South Carolinian female federal judges, one on the federal \n     District Court and the other on the Fourth Circuit. This is \n     unfair and unjustified because there are many well-qualified \n     African-American and woman jurists and lawyers who deserve an \n     opportunity to serve this nation on the federal judiciary.\n       Because African-Americans are one-third of South Carolina's \n     population and the Fourth Circuit has a greater number of \n     African-Americans than any circuit, it is critical that any \n     nominee, especially one from South Carolina, be an unabashed \n     champion of civil rights. The appointee should have a record \n     that demonstrates fairness and justice to all people. Based \n     on our careful review of Judge Dennis Shedd's performance on \n     the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina, \n     we have concluded that his record shows a serious hostility \n     to civil rights and constitutional protections.\n       Since his appointment to the federal bench in South \n     Carolina, Judge Shedd has engaged in right-wing judicial \n     activism by imposing strict and exacting standards when \n     reviewing employment discrimination cases brought by African \n     Americans and women. He has dismissed almost every employment \n     discrimination, sexual harassment, civil rights and \n     disability case that has come before him. Judge Shedd seems \n     to believe that discrimination is not an actionable offense \n     even when the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has \n     found ``reasonable cause'' that discrimination has occurred. \n     Judge Shedd, however seems to apply a more lenient standard \n     in reviewing discrimination cases brought by white men. Judge \n     Shedd has allowed four out of five ``reverse'' discrimination \n     cases to proceed beyond the summary judgment phase of \n     litigation.\n       This record shows that Judge Shedd does not have an abiding \n     concern for civil rights and fairness. It further shows that \n     Shedd lacks the requisite moderate reasoning to bring balance \n     to the Fourth Circuit. In fact, his membership to the Fourth \n     Circuit would push it further beyond the mainstream of \n     American values and would subject South Carolinians and \n     residents of other states within the Fourth Circuit to an \n     extreme right-wing interpretation of the nation's civil \n     rights laws and constitutional protections.\n       Accordingly we oppose Judge Shedd's nomination without \n     reservations. Hi values represents the Old South, where \n     African Americans and women were judged by different and \n     unequal standards.\n       We appreciate your attention. If you have any questions, \n     please contact me at the address and telephone number above.\n           Sincerely\n                                                   Joseph H. Neal,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      National Association for the\n\n\n                                Advancement of Colored People,\n\n                                Baltimore, MD, September 17, 2002.\n     Re Fourth Circuit Nomination of Judge Shedd.\n\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the NAACP, the nation's oldest, \n     largest and most widely-recognized grass roots civil rights \n     organization, I am writing to let you know of the \n     Association's strong opposition to the nomination of District \n     Court Judge Dennis W. Shedd to the Fourth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals. Delegates from every state in the nation, including \n     the five states comprising the Fourth Circuit, unanimously \n     passed a resolution from the South Carolina State Conference \n     in opposition to the nomination at the NAACP's annual \n     convention in Houston in early July.\n       Members of the NAACP believe that the Federal judiciary, as \n     the final arbiter of the U.S. Constitution, is the branch of \n     government primarily charged with protecting the rights and \n     liberties of all Americans. In many instances in our nation's \n     history, the courts have been the only institution willing to \n     enforce the rights of minority Americans. We cannot afford to \n     permit the Federal judiciary to retreat from its \n     constitutional obligation and resort to the type of judicial \n     activism that threatens civil rights and civil liberties.\n       No other federal circuit reflects this extreme right-wing \n     activism more than the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal, which \n     is home to more African Americans than any other circuit. The \n     Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals' hostility to civil rights, \n     affirmative action, women's rights, voting rights and fair \n     employment is unrivalled. Its decisions are so far out the \n     mainstream that the Supreme Court has reversed the Fourth \n     Circuit on basic constitutional protections such as Miranda \n     warnings.\n       Judge Shedd's addition to the Fourth Circuit would further \n     relegate that court to the periphery of judicial mainstream. \n     His judicial record and testimony before the Judiciary \n     Committee reflect a disposition to rule against the plaintiff \n     in employment and discrimination cases. Moreover, his \n     restrictive view of federal legislative authority, as \n     indicated in Condon v. Reno, 972 F. Supp. 977 (D.S.C. 1997), \n     which struck down the Driver's Privacy Protection Act of \n     1994, 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2721-25 and was later overturned in \n     a 9-to-0 decision by the Supreme Court, confirms our \n     perspective that Judge Shedd's judicial philosophy and \n     temperament would further push the Fourth Circuit to the \n     right-wing.\n       Accordingly, as unanimously passed by the over 1,200 \n     delegates to the 2002 NAACP National Convention, I ask that \n     you oppose the nomination and that you use your influence to \n     encourage the Senate Judiciary Committee to not vote him out \n     of Committee. However, if the nomination makes it to the \n     Senate floor, we ask you to vote against it.\n       I appreciate your attention and interest in this important \n     matter. Please do not hesitate to contact me or Hilary \n     Shelton, Director of the NAACP Washington Bureau at (202) \n     638-2269, if we can be of assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Kwesi Mfume,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n         South Carolina State Conference, National Association for \n           the Advancement of Colored People,\n                                      Columbia, SC, June 24, 2002.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: We write to oppose the nomination of \n     Dennis Shedd to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       By now, you must be familiar with the importance of the \n     Fourth Circuit to the African American Community. Almost a \n     quarter of the Fourth Circuit's residents are African \n     American. The Fourth Circuit, with over 6 million African \n     Americans in the five states, has the greatest number of \n     African Americans of any Circuit Court in the country. The \n     Latino population within the Fourth circuit now at more than \n     one million persons, has nearly tripled in the last decade. \n     Based on these demographics, more may be at stake here for \n     the future of civil rights than in any other Circuit Court in \n     the country.\n       The Fourth Circuit is already an extremely conservative \n     Court on civil rights and Constitutional issues. This Circuit \n     ruled that\n\n[[Page S11263]]\n\n     federal law-enforcement officials need not follow the Miranda \n     decision, only to be reversed by the Supreme Court. This \n     Circuit authorized drug testing for pregnant women without \n     their consent which was reversed by the Supreme Court. This \n     Circuit ruled that the Equal Employment Opportunity \n     Commission was limited to remedies contained in employee \n     arbitration agreements, and again, was reversed by the \n     Supreme Court. The Circuit also has been reversed recently in \n     capital habeas corpus cases and citizen suits under \n     environmental. laws. The Fourth Circuit has issued numerous \n     other opinions that are hostile to affirmative action, \n     women's rights, fair employment, and voting rights.\n       This is also the Court to which moderate African American \n     nominees were repeatedly denied membership. No fewer than \n     four African Americans were nominated to this Court by \n     President Clinton, only to have their nominations languish \n     for years due to Senatorial obstruction. Thus, if a nominee \n     is to be confirmed to this Court, the nominee must be a \n     jurist who will bring moderation and ideological balance to \n     this Court. It is our strongly held view that this nominee is \n     not Dennis Shedd.\n       Judge Shedd's judicial record reveals a deep and abiding \n     hostility to civil rights cases. A review of Shedd's \n     unpublished opinions reveals that Judge Shedd has dismissed \n     all but very few of the civil rights cases coming before him. \n     In nearly thirty case involving racial discrimination in \n     employment, he granted summary judgment for the employer in \n     whole or in part in all but one case; most of the cases were \n     dismissed altogether. Many of these cases were strong cases \n     with compelling evidence an litigated by experienced civil \n     right lawyers.\n       Gender and disability discrimination cases before Judge \n     Shedd fare no better. He has granted summary judgment on \n     every sexual harassment claim on which summary judgment was \n     requested. Collectively, these ruling leave us with the \n     distinct impression that, in Dennis Shedd's view of the \n     world, discrimination does not exist, and just as \n     importantly, a jury should never be asked even to decide that \n     question.\n       We are profoundly disturbed by the mounting evidence of \n     Judge Shedd's zealous efforts to assist the defense in civil \n     rights cases. There are repeated instances of Judge Shedd's \n     intervention in civil rights cases--without prompting by the \n     defendant--in ways that are detrimental to the plaintiff's \n     case. In a number of cases, Judge Shedd, on his own motion, \n     has questioned whether he should dismiss civil rights claims \n     outright or grant summary judgment. He has invited defendants \n     to file for attorney's fees and costs against civil rights \n     plaintiffs. These are not the actions of an impartial \n     decision-maker.\n       We are extremely concerned about Judge Shedd's rulings \n     promoting ``States' rights,'' and view these as a fundamental \n     encroachment on Congress's ability to enact civil rights and \n     other legislation. Judge Shedd has a very restrictive view of \n     Congressional power. He struck down the Driver's Privacy \n     Protection act of 1994 as legislation beyond Congress's \n     power, although this legislation was an ``anti-stalking'' \n     measures designed to prohibit public disclosure of drivers' \n     license information. In an opinion authored by Chief Justice \n     Rehnquist, the Supreme Court unanimously overturned Judge \n     Shedd's ruling and refuted his reasoning. This stand as one \n     of the few occasions in which the Supreme Court rejected \n     unanimously a holding that Congress exceeded its power in \n     enacting a statute.\n       The question of judicial temperament is raised by Judge \n     Shedd's offensive remarks during a judicial proceeding about \n     an issue that strikes at the heart of many--the Confederate \n     flag. Judge Shedd presided over a federal lawsuit seeking the \n     removal of the Confederate flag from the dome of the South \n     Carolina Statehouse. According to press accounts of a hearing \n     held in the case. Judge Shedd made several derogatory \n     comments about opposition to the flag. First, he attempted to \n     marginalize opponents to the flag by questioning whether the \n     flag matters to most South Carolinians. (It does, and thirty \n     percent of South Carolina's population is African American.) \n     He also minimized the deep racial symbolism of the flag by \n     comparing it to the Palmetto tree, which appears in South \n     Carolina's State flag.\n       Our membership in South Carolina, deserves to be \n     represented on the Circuit by a nominee who has a record of \n     judicial impartiality, is committed to the progress made on \n     civil rights and individuals liberties, and has a deep \n     respect for the responsibility of the federal judiciary to \n     uphold that progress. Dennis Shedd is not that nominee. We \n     urge you and the Senate Judiciary Committee to vote against \n     his nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    James Gallman,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         The National Black Caucus\n\n\n                                         of State Legislators,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 19, 2002.\n     Hon.

Last year, we \n     celebrated our 25th year of involvement and dedication to \n     many of the most pressing social issues and policies that \n     impact our legislators' districts and the nation at large. \n     Our commitment is to our constituents as well as the national \n     agenda. Our dedicated work is to maintain the highest values \n     of civil and human rights insuring that African Americans are \n     a fair and representative part of the political and social \n     equations of this great nation.\n       In their letter to you, dated September 4, 2002, members of \n     the South Carolina Legislative Black Caucus have spoken \n     clearly and definitively in opposing the nomination of Judge \n     Dennis Shedd to the Fourth Circuit. In reviewing the \n     information presented therein and having also researched the \n     history and record of Judge Shedd, we find it woefully \n     deficient regarding the issues of fairness, equality and \n     justice. Moreover, as has been pointed out by our colleagues \n     in South Carolina ``African Americans constitute a full one-\n     third of South Carolina's population yet there is only one \n     active African American federal judge in the state.'' In that \n     there are unquestionably ``many, well-qualified African \n     American . . . jurists'' in South Carolina, this is rightly \n     seen as an unfair and unequal treatment in the sight of fair \n     representation. Further, considering the existent \n     disproportionate representation of jurists of Color, \n     certainly an effort must be made to insure that any South \n     Carolina nominee be a strong advocate of civil and human \n     rights. Rather, Judge Shedd's performance on the U.S. \n     District Court for the District of South Carolina \n     demonstrates what could be construed as hostile to civil and \n     constitutional rights.\n       We have learned that Judge Shedd's insensitivity to \n     fairness has been demonstrated in his review of employment \n     discrimination cases brought by African Americans and in \n     fact, women, even in such cases when the Equal Opportunity \n     Commission has found ``reasonable cause.'' But, we have also \n     found that in furtherance of this questionable action, when \n     white men bring cases of ``reverse'' discrimination, those \n     cases proceed. We also note that there have been concerns \n     raised about the number of unpublished opinions issued by the \n     Judge and further that such concerns regarding the decisions \n     were reversed or vacated by the Fourth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals.\n       The Fourth Circuit must have a judge who is mindful of the \n     rightful place that African Americans have in this nation, \n     and be a strong advocate of civil rights, human rights and \n     constitutional rights. Any nominee should have demonstrated \n     his dedication to such virtues and ideals. No other \n     individuals should be considered for this important position.\n       For these reasons among others raised by our South Carolina \n     Legislative Black Caucus, we cannot support the nomination of \n     Judge Dennis Shedd for the Fourth Circuit and would ask that \n     the opinion of our body be strongly considered in this \n     matter. Should you have any questions, or require additional \n     comment, please contact me.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  James L. Thomas,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Before yielding the remainder of my time, I first say to \nmy friend from Utah, he has been very patient but then he has told us \nbefore he is a patient man.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been listening to this recitation of \nvarious cases involving Judge Shedd, and I have to say I certainly have \na different viewpoint. Let me go through those cases in approximately \nthe order that the distinguished Senator from Vermont listed them.\n  My colleague referred to Shults v. Denny's Restaurant. This was an \nAmericans with Disability Act and slander case where Judge Shedd sua \nsponte considered summary judgment and ordered the plaintiff to file a \nmemorandum in opposition to the court's sua sponte motion for summary \njudgment. This action by Judge Shedd was again based on jurisdictional \ndefenses raised in the defendant's answer: Failure to file within the \n2-year statute of limitations and failure to exhaust the administrative \nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission review.\n  In the order, requesting the plaintiff to file a memorandum, Judge \nShedd wrote:\n\n       Although the express language of rule 56 provides only for \n     the parties to move for summary judgment, Federal district \n     judges possess the inherent power to raise, sua sponte, an \n     issue for possible resolution by summary judgment.\n\n  Therefore, Judge Shedd had the right to bring this motion under the \nRules of Civil Procedure.\n  My colleague refers to Lowery v. Seamless Sensations. This was a \ntitle VII case in which the defendant raised the defense that the \nplaintiff failed to timely file both a charge of discrimination with \nthe EEOC and the lawsuit.\n\n[[Page S11264]]\n\nBoth are jurisdictional prerequisites to any Federal court action.\n  Since that defense called into question the court's subject matter \njurisdiction, Judge Shedd expedited consideration of those defenses. \nRemember, it would serve no purpose for the court to proceed on the \nmerits where the court had no jurisdiction. In order to expedite \nconsideration of the issues, Judge Shedd ordered the defendant to file \na motion to dismiss based on those defenses. Judge Shedd further \nordered that motion should be filed in his court instead of the \nmagistrate court assigned to the case. Ultimately, the defendant was \ngranted summary judgment on the grounds that the plaintiff could not \nestablish a prima facie case. Therefore, the case survived the above-\ndiscussed motion to dismiss, evidencing that although he raised the \nissue, Judge Shedd fairly evaluated the merits of the case.\n  In another matter, my colleague makes a special mention of Coker v. \nWal-Mart. Let's look at this case to see where again my colleague gets \nit wrong. In this case, the defendant removed the case from State to \nFederal court. Judge Shedd sua sponte questioned whether removal was \nappropriate, as it appears the motion for removal had been filed \noutside the 30-day time limitation established in 28 U.S.C. section \n1446(b). Doubting whether he had the authority to remand the case sua \nsponte, Judge Shedd stated he would permit the defendant to file a \nbrief addressing whether removal was timely and whether the court had \nauthority to remand.\n  Rather than assisting the defense, Judge Shedd raised the issue of \nremand, and held the defendant to the proper burden of showing that \nremoval was proper. He aided the plaintiff, who had apparently failed \nto raise the issue, this is exactly the opposite of what the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont has said. Judge Shedd had a duty to \nraise the removal issue, a purely jurisdictional matter, and he gave \nthe defendant the opportunity to challenge his sua sponte action, which \nis what a good judge would do.\n  My colleague also refers to Gilmore v. Ford Motor Company, a product \nliability case. In that case, Judge Shedd sanctioned the plaintiff for \nfailure to prosecute the action by dismissing the case. He made that \ndetermination after he properly evaluated each of the factors \nestablished by the Fourth Circuit in Ballard v. Carson. Indeed, my \ncolleague in the Senate worries more about this case than did the \nplaintiff. The plaintiff failed to respond to this motion to dismiss \nfor failure to prosecute after earlier failing to respond to the \ndefendant's motion to compel discovery.\n  Notably, my colleague did refer to Simmons v. Coastal Contractors, \nInc., a discrimination and retaliation employment case in which both \nparties represented themselves pro se. Judge Shedd sua sponte brought \nthe petitioners before the court and ordered the plaintiff to cure \nspecific deficiencies in his complaint or face dismissal. This decision \nwas an attempt to aid the plaintiff in properly drafting his complaint.\n  My colleague refers to Tessman v. Island Ford-Lincoln-Mercury, a \ntitle VII case, where Judge Shedd sua sponte challenged the court's \nsubject matter jurisdiction, given the plaintiff's apparent failure to \nallege that she had first presented her claim to the EEOC and received \na right-to-sue letter. He ordered the action dismissed unless the \nplaintiff could show cause why that action should not be taken by the \ncourt. This is a wholly appropriate approach and probably the only \napproach that could have been taken by any good judge.\n  My colleague refers to Smith v. Beck, a 1983 gender discrimination \ncase in which several women alleged discrimination when they were not \nadmitted, without male escorts to a nightclub featuring nude female \ndancers. Judge Shedd sua sponte questioned whether the plaintiffs' \nallegation sufficed to establish the defendant private club's actions \nwere under color of State law. Based on his conclusion that merely \noperating an establishment that has a State liquor license does not \ntransform a club into a State actor, Judge Shedd dismissed the case. In \nother words, he analyzed the law, as he should.\n\n  In short, my colleague has suggested that Judge Shedd ``assists the \ndefense.'' That is so highly misleading a charge it is hard to take it \nseriously. But I suppose I must since it has been raised. The truth is \nthat a judge's discretion in assisting either side to get their case \nright is fairly wide, but within bounds that Judge Shedd has not \ncrossed. The Supreme Court of the United States has written:\n\n       [D]istrict courts are widely acknowledged to possess the \n     power to enter summary judgments sua sponte, so long as the \n     losing party was on notice that she had to come forward with \n     all of her evidence.\n\n  The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals held that:\n\n       It is a fundamental precept that Federal courts are courts \n     of limited jurisdiction, constrained to exercise only the \n     authority confirmed by Article III of the Constitution and \n     affirmatively granted by Federal statute. A primary incident \n     of that precept is our duty to inquire, sua sponte, whether a \n     valid basis for jurisdiction exists, and to dismiss the \n     action if no such ground appears.\n\n  The truth is that in each of the cases in which Judge Shedd acted sua \nsponte, he provided the proper notice and opportunity to respond to the \nplaintiff.\n  Perhaps my colleague will be less troubled than he appears to be when \nhe learns that none of the cases he refers to where Judge Shedd \nsupposedly assisted the defense were reversed on appeal. Not one. It \nseems it would be best to leave the litigation of cases to the parties, \nlawyers, and judge involved rather than second-guess them on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  I, for one, am getting a little tired of some of our colleagues on \nthe other side acting as if every plaintiff's case has to be won no \nmatter what the facts and the law support. Actually, some of those \ncases have to be lost because they are not good cases.\n  Now let's just be honest about it. Cases are decided by judges and \njurors--judges in nonjury cases and juries in jury cases. I have seen a \nlot of cases where plaintiffs have not won because they should not have \nwon. To criticize judicial nominees for ruling against plaintiffs is \nnonsensical because every judge should decide against plaintiffs when \nthey are wrong. It does not take brains to figure that out. But I guess \nfor some on the other side, unless the plaintiff wins there is an \ninjustice.\n  My colleague criticizes Judge Shedd's ruling in Condon v. Reno with \nthe aim of characterizing his judicial ideology in the process.\n  I was shocked to learn by one of Judge Shedd's detractors that he is \na ``sympathetic participant in [a] judicial campaign to disempower \nCongress,'' and that he is a judge who ``resort[s] to outdated and \nreactionary views of federal power.''\n  I am sure this came as a surprise to Judge Shedd as well.\n  Condon v. Reno concerned the Driver's Privacy Protection Act. Judge \nShedd held in Condon that the Act violated the Tenth Amendment in that \nit improperly commanded states to implement federal policy.\n  The 4th Circuit affirmed Judge Shedd's ruling, while the Supreme \nCourt ultimately reversed it. But this was clearly a difficult call to \nmake; in fact, the lower federal courts that addressed the issue split \nevenly before the Supreme Court ruling, eight finding the Act \nconstitutional and eight finding it unconstitutional.\n  Those finding the Act unconstitutional together with Judge Shedd \nincluded Judge Barbara Crabb, Chief Judge of the Western District of \nWisconsin, a Carter appointee, and Judge John Gobold of the 11th \nCircuit, a Johnson appointee. Several Democrat Governors across the \nnation, including Democrats Jim Hunt of North Carolina, Jeanne Shaheen \nof New Hampshire and Don Siegelman of Alabama permitted their \nrespective State Attorneys General to sign onto an amicus brief urging \nthe Supreme Court to find the Act unconstitutional.\n  In addition, the Democrat Attorney General of Wisconsin also signed \nthe amicus brief. So, reasonable minds can differ on these matters.\n  It seems to me that either the vast right wing campaign to \n``disempower'' Congress is either much larger than previously supposed, \nor that this was a case in which thoughtful, and respected judges \ncould, and indeed did, disagree.\n  Of course, my colleagues ignore another federalism case of Judge \nShedd's United States v. Brown. That case involved the Gun Free School \nZones Act.\n  The defendant challenged the constitutionality of the Act on \nfederalism\n\n[[Page S11265]]\n\ngrounds. Judge Shedd allowed the prosecutor to prove facts at trial \nthat the Act was a valid exercise of Congressional power.\n  The Supreme Court later invalidated the Gun Free Zones Act in United \nStates v. Lopez. Unlike the Condon v. Reno, Judge Shedd upheld the \nexercise of federal power, yet not surprisingly, his critics point us \nto the Condon case but not to the Brown case.\n  That is amazing to me.\n  My colleague again comments on Judge Shedd's ruling in Crosby v. \nSouth Carolina Department of Health.\n  Interestingly he did not raise the same objections to Judge Roger \nGregory who ruled to uphold Judge Shedd's ruling when he was before us \nlast year. One wonders why?\n  Judge Shedd is criticized for adopting a magistrate report striking \ndown as unconstitutional part of the Family Medical Leave Act after a \nstate agency cited 11th amendment sovereign immunity against an \nemployee lawsuit.\n  Of course, the fact that eight of nine Circuit Courts have agreed \nwith his ruling seems not to concern my colleagues, including the \nFirst, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Eleventh \nCircuits.\n  In fact, numerous Democrat-appointed judges agreed with Judge Shedd, \nincluding Carter appointees Amalya Kearse of the First Circuit, Richard \nArnold of the Eighth, and Robert Anderson of the Eleventh; and Clinton \nnominees Sandra Lynch and Kermit Lipez of The First Circuit, Theodore \nMcKee of the Fourth, Kermit Bye of the Eighth, Jose Cabranes of the \nSecond Circuit, and Roger Gregory of the Fourth Circuit. Those are \nable, distinguished judges.\n  It should not come as any surprise that the Ninth Circuit is the only \nCircuit Court which has ruled the other way.\n  One would think from this near universal agreement that Judge Shedd's \nruling in Crosby would seem reasonable one, one well within the \njudicial mainstream, no matter how we look at it. And yet he is \ncriticized for it here on the floor.\n  In the area of Criminal Justice, my colleague makes special mention \nof the Quattlebaum murder case. Let's look at that case to see where my \ncolleague gets it all wrong.\n  In that case, officers took into custody a murder suspect, Mr. \nQuattlebaum. During police questioning of Quattlebaum, which \nQuattlebaum was informed was being videotaped, the deputy sheriff left \nthe room. Soon after the deputy sheriff left the room, he went to the \nroom where the videotaping was being done and noticed that an attorney \nwas now in the room with Quattlebaum, despite the fact that no one was \nto have access to that room other than law enforcement. The deputy \nsheriff immediately consulted with superiors and legal advisors as to \nwhat to do about the running videotape, but the damage--i.e., recording \nan attorney-client conversation--had already been done.\n\n  In response to the videotaping, prosecutors indicted the deputy \nsheriff for a civil rights violation. Mr. Quattlebaum's attorney, on \nthe other hand, about whom my colleague appears concerned, ended up \nbeing indicted for perjury based on his grand jury testimony that he \nhad not released the protected videotape to the media, and spent 4 \nmonths in prison.\n  The deputy sheriff pled guilty to charges based on the videotaping of \nthe attorney-client conversations.\n  My colleague has expressed concern that the deputy sheriff who \nconducted the improper videotaping was not more heavily penalized by \ncomparison to the defendant's attorney who perjured himself after \nreleasing the protected tape to the media.\n  That concern is easily assuaged. The sentencing range in the \nguidelines for the offense to which the deputy sheriff pled guilty was \nzero to six months imprisonment, one year of supervised release, and a \nfine of $1,000 to $10,000. The Government moved for a downward \ndeparture of the zero to six months jail time for the police officer \nbased on his assistance in the prosecution of related matters.\n  As Judge Shedd acknowledged during the sentencing hearing, in order \nto depart downward, he had to issue a sentence that was less than the \nminimum in the guidelines range, i.e., since less than zero time in \nprison is not possible, Judge Shedd, in accepting the downward \ndeparture request had to impose a fine that was less than $1,000 and \ncould not impose any jail time on Mr. Grice.\n  Judge Shedd's sentencing decisions were controlled by the crimes \ncharged and the related sentencing guidelines enacted by Congress. \nJudge Shedd's sentence of a fine without jail time was mandated by the \nguidelines once the government's request for downward departure was \naccepted.\n  My colleague's concern for the trail lawyer who served 4 months for \nperjury, after releasing a privileged videotape to the media, is not \naltogether clear to me, especially since that unethical conduct caused \na convicted murderer to escape his sentence.\n  The concern is also strange given that my colleague expressed the \nopposite concern with regard to Judge Charles Pickering for questioning \nthe inequitable result of mandatory sentencing guidelines.\n  Look, let me just bring this to an end by reading a letter of one of \nthe attorneys involved in that case. This is a letter to me by E. Bart \nDaniel, attorney at law in Charleston, SC. It is regarding the \nnomination of Dennis W. Shedd to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I have been a practicing attorney in \n     South Carolina for over 22 years. During my career, I have \n     served as an Assistant State Attorney General, an Assistant \n     U.S. Attorney, a United States Attorney under the previous \n     President Bush and an active federal trial attorney. My \n     practice over the years has developed into primarily a \n     ``white collar'' criminal defense practice. I have appeared \n     many times in court before Judge Shedd and found him to be \n     courteous and fair. He has exhibited great integrity and a \n     strong character while on the bench.\n       One of the most difficult cases in which I appeared before \n     Judge Shedd was in United States v. John Earl Duncan (3:99-\n     638-001). Mr. Duncan was a practicing attorney who was \n     convicted of perjury. Judge Shedd sentenced him to four \n     months in a federal penitentiary and four months in a \n     community confinement center (halfway house). He fined him \n     $33,386.92. Judge Shedd's decision was a difficult one, but \n     fair. As his counsel, we recognized that Judge Shedd would be \n     compelled to sentence Mr. Duncan to an active term of \n     incarceration since he was a practicing attorney who had been \n     convicted of lying to a federal grand jury.\n       During the sentencing phase of the Duncan case, Judge Shedd \n     was courteous and patient and listened intently to the many \n     people who spoke on our client's behalf including my co-\n     counsel Dale L. DuTremble and me.\n       I know of no judge more qualified for the position than \n     Judge Shedd. If you have any questions or I can be of any \n     further support, please do not hesitate to call.\n\n  That ought to put that to bed.\n  In all honesty, the charges against Judge Shedd that have been raised \nare shameful; absolutely shameful. It makes you wonder. Why? Why are we \nputting a really fine Federal district court judge who served almost 13 \nyears on the bench with a distinguished record through this type of \nbitter and I think shameless set of accusations?\n  We had originally agreed with the Democrat leadership to confirm \nJudge Shedd late last week along with other judicial nominees by \nunanimous consent, but instead, base politics appears to have \nintervened. I am hopeful we can get this done tomorrow.\n  According to an article by Byron York in National Review Online on \nFriday afternoon, it is clear what happened. He writes that, after the \nShedd vote in the Judiciary Committee on Thursday, the usual left-wing \ngroups, including, he writes, People for the American Way, Leadership \nConference on Civil Rights, Alliance for Justice, and the National \nAbortion Rights Action League, all urged Democrat Senators ``to \ncontinue the fight against Dennis Shedd in the full Senate.'' He quotes \none leader as warning that, ``controversy will follow these nominations \nto the Senate floor.''\n  Here we are about to engage in the longest debate on a Senate nominee \non the Senate floor this year. The special interest groups said jump, \nand so today we will jump high, and I guess tomorrow as well.\n  I am not complaining entirely. I am grateful to the distinguished \nchairman. I know it is a tough job to be chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, and I hope this is not his fault. I am not shy of any debate \non the President's superbly qualified judicial nominees.\n  But I do fear that, once again the American people will roll their \neyes that, when we have as much to do in the Senate that is still \nundone, the leadership would think that a divisive\n\n[[Page S11266]]\n\nand lengthy debate on a judicial nominee is a good idea.\n  But I understand why it is happening. I am not a newcomer here. It \nappears to be happening because of the Louisiana Senate election.\n  It has been rumored and reported that the Northern liberals who hold \nthe money strings and the liberal special interest groups here in \nWashington who claim to represent African American interests--have said \nthat the money won't flow and folks won't help get out the vote in \nLouisiana unless Judge Dennis Shedd, Senator Thurmond's former counsel \ngets slowed down yet again.\n  (Mr. ROCKEFELLER assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. HATCH. Now, look, most of us who have served on the Judiciary \nCommittee for a number of years have known Judge Dennis Shedd. He was \nchief of staff to Senator Thurmond when he was chairman of the \ncommittee, and his chief counsel when he was not chairman.\n  I have known him for most of my time in the Senate. He is one of the \nfinest people I have ever known. He is also one of the better Federal \ndistrict court judges in the country. Judge Shedd is a decent man. I \nresent his being dragged through this process for months, as he has \nbeen. Senator Thurmond's last request has gotten slowed down again.\n  Now, I am grateful we are going to have a vote on him tomorrow, up or \ndown. I surely hope my colleagues will look at his record, and not look \nat the distortions of his record, and will vote for him and will \nsupport Senator Thurmond and those of us who know him, and know him \nwell.\n  I think some have trouble getting the message. The message I got from \nthe recent election is perhaps different than what my colleagues across \nthe aisle received. As far as I see it, the President took three issues \nto the American people: his Iraq policy, homeland security, and his \njudicial nominees. Of course, he had other issues, but those were the \nthree primary issues.\n  The election showed that Americans trust this President, including in \nhis selection of judicial nominees. The election indicated voters \nrejected the obstruction in the Senate we experienced this last year, \nincluding on judicial nominees. Voters especially rejected the \nshrillness and the distortions of reputations they read and heard about \nin hundreds of news stories, scores of editorials, and dozens of op-\neds, and those they saw on TV. Voters sent us a clear message, it seems \nto me, that we should end the obstruction and maltreatment of judicial \nnominees, and yet here we are about to engage in hours of debate that \nwill largely see the race card played, and the role of judges--and one \njudge, in particular--distorted and mischaracterized.\n  Today, at the behest of the so-called Washington civil rights lobby, \nnow a wholly owned subsidiary of plaintiffs' trial lawyers, my friends \non the other side will spend a business day describing an experienced \njudge as biased, as pro this and anti that, and now I am afraid some of \nmy Democratic colleagues can no longer evaluate judges as unbiased \numpires who call the balls and strikes as they are, not as they alone \nsee them, and not as they want them to be.\n  Now, it is silly to suggest an umpire is pro bat or pro ball or pro \nbatter or pro pitcher, but, of course, trial lawyers, and those who \nshill for them, have an interest in exactly such scorekeeping. To say \nall plaintiffs have to win all cases is just nuts, but yet that is what \nwe have been getting lately.\n  But even this is not what bothers me the most about the debate that \nhas been scheduled today. I am reminded of what my friend Senator \nKennedy said in 1982 about those who opposed extending the Voting \nRights Act. Senator Kennedy lamented in 1982 that ``there are those \namong us who would open old wounds . . . [and] refight old battles.''\n  Mr. President, they say the more things change, the more they stay \nthe same--well, almost the same.\n  Now, with that regret expressed, I wish to express my \ngreat satisfaction that the Judiciary Committee has favorably \nrecommended the nomination of Judge Dennis Shedd of South Carolina for \na vote of the full Senate.\n\n  Mr. President, Senators feel very strongly about their staffs. Our \nlegal counsels make uncounted sacrifices to work for us and for the \nAmerican people. We are surrounded by very talented lawyers who forego \nlarger salaries for the sake of public service. Sometimes they put \ntheir personal opinions aside to advocate ours.\n  We Senators take it very personally when they are nominated and given \nthe opportunity for yet higher public service. It has been the \ntradition of the Judiciary Committee to give great courtesy to former \nstaffers. I certainly take it very personally, and know Senator \nThurmond does, too, that we have not done so in the case of Dennis \nShedd, who has served with distinction for the last 12 years as a \nFederal district court judge in South Carolina.\n  When Judge Shedd was nominated to the Federal trial bench, Chairman \nBiden had this to say to him:\n\n       I have worked with you for so long that I believe I am \n     fully qualified to make an independent judgment about your \n     working habits, your integrity, your honesty, and your \n     temperament. On all these scores, I have found you to be \n     beyond reproach.\n\n  Now, this is high praise indeed from a colleague on the other side of \nthe aisle for whom we all have the greatest respect. Judge Shedd has \nstrong bipartisan support in his home State as well, and not only from \nSenator Thurmond and Senator Hollings--a Republican and a Democrat--he \nis also strongly supported by Dick Harpootlian, South Carolina State \nchairman of the Democratic Party, and himself a trial lawyer.\n  Let me just say that again. Judge Shedd is not only supported by my \ndistinguished Democrat colleague, Senator Hollings, but also by the \nDemocratic Party chairman in South Carolina. This suggests a reality \nfar from the slogans and distortions launched against President Bush's \nnominees, and in particular Judge Shedd.\n  First, it has been suggested that Judge Shedd will add to what \nliberals and plaintiffs' trial lawyers perceive as conservative appeals \ncourt--or at least on the issues that profit them. But contrary to the \ndivisiveness card that his detractors are playing, Judge Shedd will add \ndiversity to that Court.\n  Mr. President, Dennis Shedd has served as a federal jurist for more \nthan a decade following nearly twenty years of public service and legal \npractice. While serving the Judiciary Committee, Judge Shedd worked, \namong many other matters, on the extension of the Voting Rights Act, \nRICO reform, the Ethics in Post-Employment Act, and the 1984 and 1986 \ncrime bills.\n  As Senator Biden put it: ``His hard work and intelligence helped the \nCongress find areas of agreement and reach compromises.''\n  That leads me to address a few issues that have been raised by his \ndetractors.\n  Mr. President, the last five Fourth Circuit confirmations have all \nbeen Democrats.\n  What seems to me more important to focus on--and what the American \npeople want us to focus on--is that when Judge Shedd joins the other \nmembers of the Fourth Circuit, he will not only have unmatched \nlegislative experience, he will also have the longest trial bench \nexperience on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Interestingly, by way of disproving some of my colleagues' diversity-\nmania, the last Democrat confirmed to the Fourth Circuit Court of \nAppeals, Judge Gregory, has affirmed Judge Shedd's rulings in 11 \nappeals. Notably, Judge Gregory agreed with Judge Shedd's ruling in the \nCrosby case, which found that the Family and Medical Leave Act was \nimproperly adopted by Congress, a case which the liberal groups seem \nworked up about when it comes to Shedd but not when it came to Judge \nGregory. No one asked Judge Gregory about his ruling in Crosby when he \nwas before the Judiciary Committee last year. But may Democrat \ncolleagues drilled Judge Shedd on it. Talk about discrimination.\n  Mr. President, Judge Dennis Shedd has heard more than 5,000 civil \ncases, reviewed more than 1,400 reports and recommendations of \nmagistrates, and has had before him nearly 1,000 criminal defendants.\n  Judge Shedd's record demonstrates that he is a mainstream judge with \na law reversal rate. In the more than 5,000 cases Judge Shedd has \nhandled during his 12 years on the bench, he has been reversed fewer \nthan 40 times--less than 1 percent.\n\n[[Page S11267]]\n\n  Detractors have made much of the fact that he has relatively few \ndecisions he has chosen to publish. But, in fact, he falls in the \nmiddle of the average for published opinions in the Fourth Circuit. One \nCarter appointee has published all of 7 cases, one Clinton appointee \nhas published only 3, and another Carter appointee has published 51, \nonly one more than Judge Shedd, despite being on the court for 10 years \nlonger.\n  Judge Shedd is known for his fairness, for his total preparation, and \nfor showing no personal bias in his courtroom. This is not just my \nopinion; this reflects the opinions of lawyers who practice before him. \nJudge Shedd is well-respected by members of the bench and bar in South \nCarolina. According to the Alamanc of the Federal Judiciary, attorneys \nsaid that Judge Shedd has outstanding legal skills and an excellent \njudicial temperament.\n  Here are a few comments from South Carolina lawyers: ``You are not \ngoing to find a better judge on the bench or one that works harder,'' \n``He's the best federal judge we've got.'' ``He gets an A all around.'' \n``It's a great experience trying cases before him.'' ``He is polite and \nbusinesslike.''\n  Let me take a moment also to address one of the more ludicrous \nattempts to discredit Judge Shedd that has been raised: that when he \nwas confirmed to the District Court bench he had little experience in \nthe practice of law.\n  I have to say that to ignore the remarkable experience Dennis Shedd \nhad in legislation practice crafting historic laws while serving the \nJudiciary Committee is some chutzpah. To raise an objection like that \nalmost 13 years after the fact is just plain silly. But it goes to show \nwhat we have to put up with in the obstruction and distortions of this \npast year.\n  Let's be clear, when Judge Shedd joins the other members of the \nFourth Circuit, he will not only have unmatched legislative experience, \nhe will also have the longest trial bench experience on the Fourth \nCircuit. He will also add some diversity to that court. The last five \nFourth Circuit confirmations have all been Democrats.\n\n  I have to say that the most misleading criticism raised about Judge \nShedd involves his employment cases.\n  Downright deceptive is that Judge Shedd's detractors, the outside \nliberal groups, have now taken to grouping and describing employment \ncases as civil rights cases.\n  They want us to believe that every quarrel between an employee and \nher employer rises to a Rosa Parks significance. No doubt every \nplaintiff's trial lawyer would like to think of themselves as a \nThurgood Marshall. But this deception is unfortunate and a disservice \nto the cause of civil rights that I have longed championed in this \nChamber.\n  Cloaking every small, perhaps even frivolous, employment case with \nthe mantle of the civil rights movement, Washington's professional \nnominee detractors have been particularly misleading on Judge Shedd's \nemployment cases.\n  They have misleadingly pointed out that the Judge seldom grants \nsummary judgment in employment cases in favor of the employee. Of \ncourse, they fail to point out that few judges do. Any good lawyer \nknows that. Summary judgment is a judgment without a jury, and every \ngood lawyer knows that employment cases are inherently fact-laden and \ngo to trial by a jury or more often they settle. Or in many cases, the \nemployee fails to state a claim and the case has to be dismissed.\n  Of course, Judge Shed's detractors could have noticed that he has \nonly twice been reversed in his decisions in employment cases. But of \ncourse, they did not notice that.\n  They might have pointed out that in one of the appeals that he was \ninvited to hear for the Fourth Circuit, he reversed a summary judgment \nand remanded for trial a political discrimination case against a worker \nwho was a Democrat. But they did not do that either.\n  Judge Shedd's detractors have also made irresponsible claims as to \nthe Judge's criminal case record.\n  In fact, in criminal cases, Judge Shedd has strongly defended \ncitizens due process rights from violation by the state. He has \nfrequently chastised law enforcement for errors in search warrants an \nthe questionable use of seized property. In fact, he has sanctioned the \nState for discovery problems. He is known for aggressively informing \ndefendants and witnesses of their fifth amendment rights.\n  Remarkably, Judge Shedd has never been reversed on any ruling \nconsidered before or during trial, or on the taking of guilty pleas. \nHis detractors have somehow failed to note this.\n  The cases that come before a judge are often difficult. Judge Shedd \nhas not been exempted. In one prisoner's case, Judge Shedd allowed a \ndetainee to engage in a hunger strike and ruled against government's \nattempt to force feed him.\n  Although some would seek to question Judge Shedd's respect for \nprivacy in criminal cases, into cases he protected HIV blood \ndonor's confidentiality. In another case, he ordered special \naccommodations to an HIV positive defendant to ensure his continued \nclinical treatment.\n\n  These are not the rulings of a judge who is insensitive to prisoners \nand criminals, but this is the record of a judge who works hard to get \nthe work of law enforcement right.\n  Of course, no smear campaign against a Bush judicial nominee, paid \nfor plaintiffs' trial lawyers, and carried out by their left-wing \nlobbyists, is complete without the suggestion that the nominee is foe \nof environmental rights.\n  Of course, in their paint-by-the-numbers attack, Judge Shedd's \ndetractors have ignored the wetlands protection case where he handed \ndown tough sanctions against a violator and ordered expensive wetlands \nrestoration.\n  The left-wing detractors skipped over Judge Shedd's decision in favor \nof National Campaign to Save the Environment.\n  They missed his ruling to grant standing to a plaintiff challenging a \nroad construction project on its environmental impact.\n  They missed his ruling in favor of a woman protesting possible waste \ndumping in her community.\n  The well-paid, left-wing lobbyists who have turned attacking \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees into a small cottage industry see \nonly what they want to see and not what the truth would show them.\n  The most breathtaking charge against Judge Shedd was first made by \nthe NAACP that Judge Shedd has--``a deep and abiding hostility to civil \nrights.''\n  I must admit that was outraged by this when I first read it, and I \nstill am. It is a distortion far beyond the pale of decency, and I call \non my colleagues once again to repudiate such rabid practices.\n  In part, I am outraged because there are some who would profile Judge \nShedd as merely a white male from the South and start from there to \ngive him a certain treatment.\n  If Judge Shedd's record working for civil rights legislation on the \nJudiciary Committee were not enough of an accomplishment for one \nlifetime for any man or woman, the truth is that in each of the cases \nthat have come before Judge Shedd involving the Voting Rights Act of \n1965, plaintiffs have won their claims.\n  In the Dooley case, a one person/one vote case, Judge Shedd gave the \nplaintiff a clear and strong decision. In another political rights \ncase, he ruled to protect the plaintiff's right to make door-to-door \npolitical solicitations.\n  Of course, Mr. President, you know a lot about a judge by how they \nconduct their courtroom. As you know, I have been a strong advocate for \nthe protection of religious practices in the public square. It says a \nlot about Judge Shedd, especially in these times, that he has allowed \nreligious headdress in his courtroom.\n  Judge Shedd also led efforts to appoint the first African American \nwoman ever to serve as a magistrate judge in South Carolina and has \nsought the Selection Committee to conduct outreach to women and people \nof color in filling such positions. He pushed for an African American \nwoman to be chief of pretrial services. He has actively recruited \npersons of color to be his law clerks.\n  And because of Judge Shedd's work in an award-winning drug program \nthat aims to reverse stereotypes amount 4,000 to 5,000 school children, \nhe was chosen as the United Way's School Volunteer of the Year.\n\n[[Page S11268]]\n\n  The Judiciary Committee received a very touching letter from one of \nJudge Shedd's former law clerks, Thomas Jones, that we have blown up \nhere. Perhaps the Presiding Officer will be able to read it from the \nchair.\n\n  The letter says:\n\n       Dear Senator Leahy: My name is Thomas W. Jones, Jr. I am an \n     African American attorney currently practicing as a \n     litigation associate in Baltimore, MD. Upon my graduation \n     from the University of Maryland School of Law, I had the \n     distinct pleasure of serving as a judicial clerk for the \n     Honorable Dennis W. Shedd on the U.S. District Court for the \n     District of South Carolina. During my 18 months of working \n     with Judge Shedd, I never encountered a hint of bias, in any \n     form or fashion, regarding any aspect of Judge Shedd's \n     jurisprudence or daily activities. It is apparent to me that \n     the allegations regarding Judge Shedd's alleged biases have \n     been propagated by individuals without the benefit of any \n     real, meaningful interaction with Judge Shedd, his friends or \n     family members. I trust the accusations of bias levied \n     against Judge Shedd will be given the short shrift they are \n     due, and trust further that this honorable committee will act \n     favorably upon the pending nomination of Judge Shedd for the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Thank \n     you for your attention regarding this matter. Respectfully, \n     Thomas W. Jones, Jr.\n\n  That was written on June 25 of this year to Senator Leahy.\n  I will read another letter into the Record as well. This is a letter \nfrom Phyllis Berry Myers, President and CFO of the Center for New Black \nLeadership. I believe we received it today. It reads as follows:\n\n       Dear Senator Hatch: The Centre for New York Leadership \n     (CNBL) believes the Senate's judicial nomination system is \n     broken and needs repairing.\n       We have watched with great trepidation as the Senate's role \n     of ``advise and consent'' for Presidential nominations, \n     especially judicial nominations, has become increasingly, \n     ``search and destroy,'' ``slander and defame.'' It is a \n     wonder that reasonable, decent people agree to go through the \n     confirmation process at all.\n       The confirmation process has become particularly brutal if \n     the nominee is labeled ``conservative.'' Traditional civil \n     rights groups mass to castigate and intimidate, as they do \n     now, attempting to thwart the confirmation of Judge Dennis W. \n     Shedd to the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       Once again, we are witnessing the new depth to which public \n     discourse and debate has sunk when fabrications, statements \n     taken out of context, misinformation and disinformation can \n     pass as serious political deliberation and debate. The \n     vitally needed discussion about continued civil rights \n     progress in a 21st Century world gets lost in the cacophony. \n     Our nation and true civil rights advocates are poorer because \n     of this.\n       The Senate can restore to itself, at least a modicum, a \n     sense of fair play, honor, and trust in its own policies and \n     procedures, a commitment to guarding the civil rights of all, \n     as well as advancing the rule of law by swiftly confirming \n     Judge Shedd.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Phyllis Berry Myers,\n                                                  President & CEO.\n\n  Of course, the liberal groups starkly ignore Judge Shedd's ruling in \nthe Vanderhoff case. In that case, Judge Shedd dismissed the claim of a \nfired employee who repeatedly displayed the Confederate flag on his \ntoolbox in violation of company policy. Judge Shedd rejected the \nplaintiff's contention that he was dismissed because of his national \norigin as a ``Confederate Southern American.''\n  Perhaps my colleagues have sympathy for that plaintiff, too. After \nall, the plaintiff was represented by a trial lawyer in this employment \ncase--or as they would like us to see it, a civil rights case--even \nthough it was brought on behalf of a true racist.\n  I looked at a letter that the NAACP sent to the Judiciary Committee, \na letter all the other copycat groups have repeated.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record so \neverybody can see how fake the Washington NAACP has become when they \ncarry the plaintiffs' trial lawyers' water.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                      National Association for the\n\n\n                                Advancement of Colored People,\n\n                                Baltimore, MD, September 17, 2002.\n     Re Fourth Circuit nomination of Judge Shedd.\n\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the NAACP, the nation's oldest, \n     largest and most widely-recognized grass roots civil rights \n     organization, I am writing to let you know of the \n     Association's strong opposition to the nomination of District \n     Court Judge Dennis W. Shedd to the Fourth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals. Delegates from every state in the nation, including \n     the five states comprising the Fourth Circuit, unanimously \n     passed a resolution from the South Carolina State Conference \n     in opposition to the nomination at the NAACP's annual \n     convention in Houston early July.\n       Members of the NAACP believe that the federal judiciary, as \n     the final arbiter of the U.S. Constitution, is the branch of \n     government primarily charged with protecting the rights and \n     liberties of all Americans. In many instances in our nation's \n     history, the courts have been the only institution willing to \n     enforce the rights of minority Americans. We cannot afford to \n     permit the federal judiciary to retreat from its \n     constitutional obligation and resort to the type of judicial \n     activism that threatens civil rights and civil liberties.\n       No other federal circuit reflects this extreme right-wing \n     activism more than the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal, which \n     is home to more African Americans than any other circuit. The \n     Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals' hostility to civil rights, \n     affirmative action, women's rights, voting rights and fair \n     employment is unrivalled. Its decisions are so far out the \n     mainstream that the Supreme Court has reversed the Fourth \n     Circuit on basic constitutional protections such the Miranda \n     warnings.\n       Judge Shedd's addition to the Fourth Circuit would further \n     relegate that court to the periphery of judicial mainstream. \n     His judicial record and testimony before the Judiciary \n     Committee reflect a disposition to rule against the plaintiff \n     in employment and discrimination cases. Moreover, his \n     restrictive view of federal legislation authority, as \n     indicated in Condon v. Reno, 972 F.Supp. 977 (D.S.C. 1997), \n     which struck down the Driver's Privacy Protection Act of \n     1994, 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2721-25 and was later overturned in \n     a 9-to-0 decision by the Supreme Court, confirms our \n     perspective that Judge Shedd's judicial philosophy and \n     temperament would further push the Fourth Circuit to the \n     right-wing.\n       Accordingly, as unanimously passed by the over 1,200 \n     delegates to the 2002 NAACP National Convention, I ask that \n     you oppose the nomination and that you use your influence to \n     encourage the Senate Judiciary Committee to not vote him out \n     of Committee. However, if the nomination makes it to the \n     Senate floor, we ask you to vote against it.\n       I appreciate your attention and interest in this important \n     matter. Please do not hesitate to contact me or Hilary \n     Shelton, Director of the NAACP Washington Bureau at (202) \n     638-2269, if we can be of assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Kwesi, Mfume,\n                                                  President & CEO.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. They describe their so-called civil rights complaint, and \nit boiled down to something not having anything to do with Judge \nShedd's civil rights record. They project on to Judge Shedd their \ncomplaints about the Fourth Circuit as it currently stands. Though \npersonally I believe that these charges are unfounded.\n  Well, Judge Shedd is not on the Fourth Circuit yet.\n  The NAACP's well-funded complaint is about appellate decisions Judge \nShedd has had nothing to do with. That is remarkably irresponsible for \nan organization once so distinguished. Thurgood Marshall would be very \ndispleased with this sort of sloppy advocacy.\n  Then the NAACP got to the heart of the matter. In the letter signed \nby Kwesi Mfume they show who is paying the bills. On behalf of \nplaintiff's trial lawyers, the NAACP complains about Judge Shedd's \nemployment rulings--not his civil rights or voting rights rulings which \nare unimpeachable, but employment rulings. As I have said before, we \nknow such a complaint has no basis in the reality of how employment \ncases are litigated and resolved.\n  Of course they, too, fail to note that Judge Shedd has only been \nreversed twice in employment cases during his 12-year career on the \nFederal bench.\n  The truth is the so-called civil rights attack on Judge Shedd is \nnothing but a campaign paid by and for the plaintiff's trial lawyers. \nThey stoop so low to get their profits that they have put the NAACP, \nthat once great organization, and other civil rights groups up to do \ntheir dirty work. That bothers me a lot.\n  Just so I set the record straight, I know a lot of really good trial \nlawyers in this country. I know a lot of them who fight for justice, \nfor rights for the oppressed and for those who are down trodden. I am \nnot referring to them. I am talking about those who are funding these \nvicious left-wing attacks on President Bush's judicial nominees, and \nthere are plenty of them. They are loaded with dough, and they seem to \nwant to manipulate the Federal bench like they have some of the State \ncourt benches. It is wrong.\n  Dennis Shedd is well qualified to serve on the Fourth Circuit Court \nof\n\n[[Page S11269]]\n\nAppeals. I think so, and the American Bar Association, hardly a bastion \nof conservative politics, has said so.\n  In supporting his confirmation, I for one express my gratitude on \nbehalf of the American people for an entire life spent in public \nservice.\n  One other letter I will read is a letter from the Congress of Racial \nEquality. It is written to Senator Daschle as of today's date. It reads \nas follows:\n\n       Dear Senator Daschle: This is an open letter in the \n     interest of justice. The Congress of Racial Equality, CORE, \n     enthusiastically endorses Judge Dennis Shedd for the Fourth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals. Despite a Democratic filibuster \n     against Judge Shedd--\n\n  And, of course, I am pleased there is not going to be a filibuster. I \nthink that is very unwise, and I hope we do not stoop to that level on \neither side of the aisle. I thought we had overcome that propensity in \nthe last number of years. There have been so few in the history of this \nbody, I hope we do not stoop to that again.\n  The letter reads as follows:\n\n       Dear Senator Daschle: This is an open letter in the \n     interest of justice. The Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) \n     enthusiastically endorses Judge Dennis Shedd for the Fourth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals. Despite a Democratic filibuster \n     against Judge Shedd, it is the strong opinion of CORE that \n     Judge Shedd is a more than worthy candidate for the Fourth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       Judge Shedd's character has been under attack without merit \n     and without fair scrutiny of his service to the American \n     legal system.\n       Prior to serving the bench, Judge Shedd served faithfully \n     from 1988-1990 as Chairman of the South Carolina Advisory \n     Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. A fair and \n     honest review of Judge Shedd's unpublished opinions would \n     show that he has sided numerous times with plaintiffs in \n     cases of race, gender and disability rights without falter or \n     hesitation. In each case, his decisions have allowed \n     employment discrimination lawsuits to go forward in the \n     interest of fairness and truth.\n       Judge Shedd has shown his commitment to employment rights \n     for minorities and women, particularly within the court. His \n     efforts have championed the efforts to recruit and elect the \n     first African-American U.S. Magistrate Judge in the South \n     Carolina District, Margaret Seymour. He was actively sought \n     minority and female candidates for other Magistrate Judge \n     positions, and has directed the Selected Commission in South \n     Carolina to bear in mind diversity in the selection of \n     candidates for these positions.\n       Judge Dennis Shedd's accomplishments and service have \n     transcended bi-partisan support even from his home state \n     Senators, notably, Senators Strom Thurmond and Senator Ernest \n     Hollings who wholly support his nomination.\n       In the interest of fairness, balance we ask you to look \n     past the unfounded partisan attacks of propaganda against \n     Judge Shedd and fairly examine his work for yourselves. We \n     strongly believe Judge Shedd's accomplishments and \n     contributions to justice and civil rights speaks for itself.\n       We hope that you would join CORE in our support of Judge \n     Dennis Shedd and urge Senate Democrats to end the unfair \n     filibuster against him. Let Judge Shedd have his day on the \n     Senate floor\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Niger Innis,\n                                               National Spokesman.\n\n  Again, I am pleased there will be no filibuster against this worthy \nFederal district court judge who has served with distinction for the \nlast 12 years. I caution this body, I hope we do not resort to \nfilibusters on judicial nominees, as has been recommended by some \nnotable left-wing law professors. Filibustering judicial nominations \nshould not be done lightly, if at all. When we elect a President, we \nelect a President who will have the power to choose his or her judicial \nnominees. Senator's have a right to raise any issues against those \nnominees, so long as they are honestly raised.\n  In Judge Dennis Shedd's case, the outside groups have raised a lot of \nissues that are not honestly raised. I have not heard any criticisms \nagainst him that are valid in my judgment, and I know Judge Shedd \npersonally and I have reviewed his complete record.\n  Just this morning, I received a letter from Joseph Anderson, chief \njudge for the District of South Carolina. It is noteworthy that Chief \nJudge Anderson was a Democratic member of the South Carolina \nLegislature before his appointment to the Federal bench. He served as a \ndistrict court judge for 16 years and chief judge for the last 2 years. \nHe and Judge Shedd have been suite-mates in the Federal courthouse in \nColumbia. For all of these reasons, he writes, he believes he is \nqualified to comment on Judge Shedd's abilities, qualifications, and \nreputation. Judge Anderson writes:\n\n       I can say without hesitation that Judge Shedd has a \n     reputation for fairness, both in his community and on our \n     court. As Chief Judge, I have received no complaints about \n     his courtroom demeanor, his decisions, or his procedures. It \n     is my considered opinion that all people who appear in his \n     court receive a fair hearing, regardless of the type of cases \n     involved, or the status of the parties in the case (plaintiff \n     or defendant.)\n\n  The letter continues:\n\n       Judge Shedd is scrupulous in his dealings on the court. If \n     there is any remote suggestion of the appearance of \n     impropriety, he will not hesitate, and has not hesitated, to \n     recuse himself and he is very consistent about this.\n\n  Chief Judge Anderson then addresses the quality of Judge Shedd's \ndecisions. He says:\n\n       I regularly review the advance sheets of the United States \n     Court of Appeal for the Fourth Circuit, and it would appear \n     to me that Judge Shedd has an extremely good affirmance rate \n     in that court.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       In regard to the issue of granting summary judgment or \n     otherwise dismissing cases short of trial, it appears to me \n     that Judge Shedd's record is no different from any other \n     judge in this district. That is to say, some of his cases are \n     ended by a ruling on summary judgment. Those that are not are \n     then set for trial, and a great number of those eventually \n     settle--which means that the plaintiff and defendant agree on \n     the outcome. In regard to summary judgment decisions, \n     settlements, and actual trials, Judge Shedd's statistics are \n     not significantly different from any other judge in this \n     district.\n\n  It is ridiculous to say that, because a judge has not granted summary \njudgments for plaintiffs, that he was not fair. In employment cases, \noften the entire contest is whether the plaintiff survives summary \njudgment, after which the case settles. And that is true in Judge \nShedd's cases. Once a summary judgment is refused, that means the case \nis going to be tried by a judge or jury, and then the parties settled.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Chief Judge Anderson be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                              U.S. District Court,\n\n\n                                   District of South Carolina,\n\n                                Columbia, S.C., November 18, 2002.\n     In re Dennis W. Shedd, Nominee to Fourth Circuit Court of \n         Appeals.\n\n     Senator Orrin Hatch,\n     Ranking Republican Member, Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Hatch: This in response to your request that I \n     provide information regarding Dennis W. Shedd, a judge on our \n     court, who has been nominated for a position on the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. I have served \n     as a United States District Judge for 16 years, the last two \n     as Chief Judge for our district. I knew Judge Shedd prior to \n     his appointment as U.S. District Judge, and, subsequent to \n     his appointment, he and I have served as suite mates in the \n     courthouse here in Columbia. I therefore, feel that I am \n     qualified to comment on his abilities, qualifications, and \n     reputation.\n       In response to your specific inquiries, I can say without \n     hesitation that Judge Shedd has a reputation for fairness, \n     both in his community and on our court. As Chief Judge, I \n     have received no complaints about his courtroom demeanor, his \n     decisions, or his procedures. It is my considered opinion \n     that all people who appear in his court receive a fair \n     hearing, regardless of the type of cases involved, or the \n     status of the parties in the case (plaintiff or defendant).\n       Judge Shedd is scrupulous in his dealings on the court. If \n     there is any remote suggestion of the appearance of \n     impropriety, he will not hesitate, and has not hesitated, to \n     recuse himself and he is very consistent about this.\n       I regularly review the advance sheets of the United States \n     Court of Appeal for the Fourth Circuit, and it would appear \n     to me that Judge Shedd has an extremely good affirmance rate \n     in that court.\n       In regard to the issue of granting summary judgment or \n     otherwise dismissing case short of trail, it appears to me \n     that Judge Shedd's record is no different from any other \n     judge in this district. That is to say, some of his cases are \n     ended by a ruling on summary judgment. Those that are not are \n     then set for trial and a great number of those eventually \n     settle before the trial can be conducted. In regard to \n     summary judgment decisions, settlements, and actual trials, \n     Judge Shedd's statistics are not significantly different from \n     any other judge in this district.\n       I hope this letter is responsive to your inquiry and if you \n     need any additional information, please do not hesitate to \n     let me know.\n       With kind personal regards.\n                                          Joseph F. Anderson, Jr.,\n                               Chief United States District Judge.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I believe this letter speaks volumes about Judge Shedd's \nfairness and dispels the completely unfounded criticism that Judge \nShedd's\n\n[[Page S11270]]\n\nreversal rate or dismissal rate is somehow out of sync or cause for \nconcern.\n  I have been on the Senate Judiciary Committee for 26 years. Most of \nmy colleagues will say I have acted with fairness, honesty, and candor \nduring those 26 years. Most would say I have done so as chairman of the \ncommittee when I have been chairman. I know Dennis Shedd. I know him \nvery well. I worked closely with him and Senator Thurmond, as did many \non the committee. I saw in Dennis Shedd a very scrupulously honest and \ndecent man. I never saw one iota of evidence that he was anything but \nan honest and decent, honorable human being, with the respect for all \npeople, regardless of race, religion, or origin--or any other reason. I \ncan say this man served the committee well. He was chief of staff for \nthe committee when Senator Thurmond was chairman. He got along well \nwith everyone. He did his job, and did it well.\n  He has had experience in private practice. He has had experience in \nthis legislative body that I don't think many staffers could match. He \nhas had 12 years of experience on the Federal district court bench in \nSouth Carolina where the chief judge himself says he has distinguished \nhimself.\n  I have bitterly resented some of the outside attacks which have come \nto be the norm in the case of President Bush's nominees. If a person is \nconsidered moderate to conservative or conservative, then automatically \nthese groups start to attack some of these people. It is not right. I \nhave had respect for a number of these groups in the past, but I have \nlost respect for them in the last couple of years with some of the \narguments they have made and some of the cases they have tried to make \nand some of the distortions they have foisted upon the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. It is time to quit doing that. I would like to see the \noutside groups argue their cases well, argue their ideology well, do \nwhat they are organized to do, but do it honestly, do it fairly; do not \ndestroy a person's reputation, as I think many have attempted to do \nhere, and especially a person against whom you can find no real fault.\n  I know Dennis Shedd. He is an honorable, honest, competent, \nintelligent, former chief of staff of this committee but now Federal \ndistrict judge in South Carolina. He deserves some respect in this \nbody, and he deserves the vote of this body. I hope my colleagues will \nlook past some of these unfortunate criticisms that are, in my opinion, \ndishonest, that we have shown to be distortions, and vote for Dennis \nShedd tomorrow so that he can bring a greater element of ability to the \ncircuit court of appeals.\n  Mr. President, contrary to some of the arguments made here today, it \nis clear to me that this debate is not so much about Judge Shedd, as it \nis about the purposeful delaying and denying of President Bush's \njudicial nominations.\n  The delay and speechmaking about Judge Shedd fits right into the \npattern we have been seeing for almost two years.\n  Under Democrat control, the Senate has undertaken a systematic effort \nto treat President Bush and his judicial nominees unfairly. Some have \nattempted to justify this unfair treatment as tit-for-tat, or business \nas usual, but the American people should not accept such a smokescreen. \nWhat the Senate is doing is unprecedented.\n  Historically, a president can count on seeing all of his first 11 \nCircuit Court nominees confirmed. As you can see on this chart, \nPresidents Reagan, Bush and Clinton all enjoyed a 100 percent \nconfirmation rate on their first 11 Circuit Court nominees. In stark \ncontrast, 7 of President Bush's first 11 nominations are still pending \nat the close of President Bush's first Congress.\n  History also shows that Presidents can expect almost all of their \nfirst 100 nominees to be confirmed swiftly. Presidents Reagan, Bush and \nClinton got 97, 95 and 97, respectively, of their first 100 judicial \nnominations confirmed. But the Senate has confirmed only 83 of \nPresident Bush's first 100 nominees.\n  Some try to blame Republicans for the current vacancy crisis. That is \nbunk. In fact, the number of judicial vacancies decreased by three \nduring the 6 years of Republican leadership. There were 70 vacancies \nwhen I became chairman of the Judiciary Committee in January 1995, and \nthere were 67 at the close of the 106th Congress in December 2000.\n  Some try to justify wholesale delays as payback for the past. That is \nalso untrue. Look at the facts: During President Clinton's 8 years in \noffice, the Senate confirmed 377 judges--essentially the same (5 fewer) \nas for Reagan (382). This is an unassailable record of non-partisan \nfairness, especially when you consider that President Reagan had 6 \nyears of a Senate controlled by his own party, while President Clinton \nhad only 2.\n  Finally, some might suggest that the Republicans left an undue number \nof nominees pending in Committee without hearings at the end of the \nClinton administration. Well, we left 41, which is 13 less that the \nDemocrats left without hearings in 1992 at the end of the Bush \nAdministration.\n  So you see, Mr. President, what is happening to Judge Shedd fits into \na pattern of unfairness that is not justified by any prior Republican \nactions.\n  President Bush deserves to be treated as well as the last three \nPresidents.\n\n\n                nominations record of the 107th Congress\n\n  My Democrat colleagues are apparently proud that in this Session, so \nfar, the Senate has confirmed 99 judges. There is much eagerness in \ntheir voices in asserting that this number compares favorably to the \nlast three sessions of Congress during which Republicans were in \ncontrol of the Senate.\n  Although it is flattering that the Republican record under my \nleadership is being used as the benchmark for fairness, I am afraid \nthat this does not make for a correct comparison because Republicans \nwere never in control during President Clinton's first 2 years in \noffice.\n  Let me repeat that, we were never in control during President \nClinton's first 2 years in office. The proper comparison is not to the \nRepublican record of the last 6 years of President Clinton, but to his \nfirst 2 years.\n  Despite the numbers that my colleague throws out in their comparison \nof apples to oranges.\n  Now, Mr. President I brought a visual. Here you see apples and \noranges. It is fair to say that they are difficult to compare and that \na comparison only leads the listener to conclude that they are both \nfruit. But they are not at all the same kind.\n  The fact remains that the Democrat achievement in this Session fails \nnoticeably when properly compared, apples to apples.\n  During President Clinton's first Congress, when Senator Biden was the \nChairman of the Judiciary Committee, the Senate confirmed 127 judicial \nnominees. And Senator Biden achieved this record despite not receiving \nany nominees for the first 6 months--in fact, Senator Biden's first \nhearing was held on July 20th of that year, more than a week later than \nthe first hearing of this Session, which occurred on July 11, 2001.\n  Clearly, getting started in July of Year One is no barrier to the \nconfirmation of 127 judges by the end of Year Two. But we have \nconfirmed only 99 nominees in this Session.\n  Senator Biden's track record during the first President Bush's first \n2 years also demonstrates how a Democrat-led Senate treated a \nRepublican president. Then-Chairman Biden presided over the \nconfirmation of all but 5 of the first President Bush's 75 nominees in \nthat first two-year session. Chairman Thurmond's record is similar. The \ncontrast to the present could hardly be starker.\n  We are about to close President Bush's first 2 years in office, \nhaving failed the standards set by Chairman Biden and Chairman \nThurmond. That is nothing over which to be proud.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in South Carolina, Senator Thurmond and \nI have a long tradition of working cooperatively to nominate judges. \nSenator Thurmond has made good choices in the past, and he has done so \nagain, with Judge Dennis Shedd, for elevation to the Court of Appeals \nfor the Fourth Circuit.\n  Judge Shedd is familiar to many Members, having staffed the Judiciary \nCommittee for several years, and of course serving as chief counsel and \nadministrative assistant to Senator Thurmond himself.\n  He is a very smart and capable man. For more than a decade, he has \nbeen a\n\n[[Page S11271]]\n\njudge on the United States District Court for South Carolina, based in \nColumbia. He has a reputation as a hard worker on the bench, as a \nstraight-shooter, and one who is up-to-date on the laws. By special \ndesignation, he has sat on the Fourth Court on several occasions.\n  No judge now sitting on the Fourth Circuit has as much Federal trial \nexperience. On the bench, he has handled 5,000 cases, and he has been \nreversed less than one percent in that entire time, an outstanding \nrecord of sound judgment.\n  I can say he has the support of a wide array of lawyers in South \nCarolina, and has received a well qualified rating by the American Bar \nAssociation.\n  I have a letter from Joseph Anderson, chief United States District \nJudge, who writes:\n\n        ``I can say without hesitation that Judge Shedd has a \n     reputation for fairness, both in his community and on our \n     court. As Chief Judge, I have received no complaints about \n     his courtroom demeanor, his decisions, or his procedures. It \n     is my considered opinion that all people who appear in his \n     court receive a fair hearing, regardless of the type of cases \n     involved, or the status of the parties in the case.\n\n  And here is a letter from nine faculty members of the University of \nSouth Carolina School of Law, from which Judge Shedd graduated. After \nanalyzing several of his cases they conclude: ``Judge Shedd's record on \nthe Federal bench demonstrates that he is fair and impartial in all \nmatters that come before him, including to plaintiffs in employment \ndiscrimination and civil rights cases. . . . In our view he will make \nan excellent addition to the Fourth Circuit.''\n  Let me acknowledge that the NAACP, and some others, have concerns \nwith him. But I have looked into those situations, and I find them \nwanting with respect to specific inappropriate actions by Judge Shedd.\n  We in the law know that you never have a character witness come up \nand tell what he knows of his own association, but rather you bring \nwitnesses who give testimony to his reputation in the particular \ncommunity.\n  In that regard, having checked it out, Judge Shedd is my kind of \njudge. He is hard, he is tough, but he is hard and he is tough on both \nsides.\n  We who have practiced law before the courts, and know the score, and \ndon't play games appreciate a judge who is not going to allow any games \nto be played on you.\n  I have said often that as much as we need a balanced budget, we need \nsome balanced Senators, and some balanced judges.\n  I hope we can garner bipartisan support, and to see that this Judge \nis confirmed.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the letters in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              U.S. District Court,\n\n\n                                   District of South Carolina,\n\n                                  Columbia, SC, November 18, 2002.\n     In re Dennis W. Shedd, Nominee To Fourth Circuit Court of \n       Appeals.\n     Senator Orrin Hatch,\n     Ranking Republican Member, Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: This in response to your request that I \n     provide information regarding Dennis W. Shedd, a judge on our \n     court, who has been nominated for a position on the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. I have served \n     as a United States District Judge for 16 years, the last two \n     as Chief Judge for our district. I knew Judge Shedd prior to \n     his appointment as U.S. District Judge, and, subsequent to \n     his appointment, he and I have served as suite mates in the \n     courthouse here in Columbia. I, therefore, feel that I am \n     qualified to comment on his abilities, qualifications, and \n     reputation.\n       In response to your specific inquires [I can say without \n     hesitation that Judge Shedd has a reputation for fairness, \n     both in his community and on our court. As Chief Judge, I \n     have received no complaints about his courtroom demeanor, his \n     decisions, or his procedures. It is my considered opinion \n     that all people who appear in his court receive a fair \n     hearing, regardless of the type of cases involved, or the \n     status of the parties in the case (plaintiff or defendant).]\n       Judge Shedd is scrupulous in his dealings on the court. If \n     there is any remote suggestion of the appearance of \n     impropriety, he will not hesitate, and has not hesitated, to \n     recuse himself and he is very consistent about this.\n       I regularly review the advance sheets of the United States \n     Court of Appeal for the Fourth Circuit, and it would appear \n     to me that Judge Shedd has an extremely good affirmance rate \n     in that court.\n       In regard to the issue of granting summary judgment or \n     otherwise dismissing cases short of trial it appears to me \n     that Judge Shedd's record is not different from any other \n     judge in this district. That is to say, some of his cases are \n     ended by a ruling on summary judgment. Those that are not are \n     then set for trial and a great number of those eventually \n     settle before the trial can be conducted. In regard to \n     summary judgment decisions, settlements, and actual trials, \n     Judge Shedd's statistics are not significantly different from \n     any other judge in this district.\n       I hope this letter is responsive to your inquiry and if you \n     need any additional information, please do not hesitate to \n     let me know.\n           With kind personal regards,\n                                          Joseph F. Anderson, Jr.,\n     Chief United States District Judge.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     June 26,2002.\n     Hon. John R. Edwards,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Edwards: We write to you as individual members \n     of the faculty at the University of South Carolina School of \n     Law. We are concerned that professors from law schools in \n     your state recently may have provided you with inaccurate \n     information regarding United States District Court Judge \n     Dennis Shedd, whose nomination to the Fourth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals is scheduled for a hearing in the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee this week. As members of the academic legal \n     community in South Carolina, we wish to set the record \n     straight on Judge Shedd's record on the bench, and to urge \n     your approval of this well-qualified nominee.\n       Contrary to claims made by his opponents, Judge Shedd's \n     record in cases involving state sovereignty and the scope of \n     congressional authority reflects that he has taken a fair and \n     balanced approach to these issues and is well within the \n     accepted mainstream among federal judges. On the difficult \n     issue of whether Congress had authority under the Commerce \n     Clause to enact the Driver's Privacy Protection Act (DPPA), \n     Judge Shedd concluded, after careful analysis of existing \n     case law, the DPPA violated the Tenth Amendment in that it \n     commanded states to implement federal policy in violation of \n     Supreme Court precedent, New York v. United States, 515 U.S. \n     144 (1992), and Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898 (1997). \n     See Condon v. Reno, 972 F.Supp. 977 (D.S.C. 1997).\n       While the Supreme Court ultimately ruled that DPPA \n     represented a valid exercise of Congress' Commerce Clause \n     power, 7 of the other 15 lower court judges to consider the \n     issue prior to the Court's decision agreed with Judge Shedd. \n     Among those were Judge Barbara Crabb, the Chief Judge of the \n     Western District of Wisconsin and an appointee of President \n     Jimmy Carter, and John Godbold of the 11th Circuit, a Johnson \n     appointee. In addition, several governors, including Governor \n     Jim Hunt of North Carolina, authorized their attorneys \n     general to file amicus briefs in Condon urging the Supreme \n     Court to uphold Judge Shedd's ruling and to declare the law \n     unconstitutional. To us, the disagreement among lawyers, \n     judges and scholars regarding whether DPPA was constitutional \n     in the wake of the Supreme Court's decisions in Printz and \n     other opinions reflects the difficult question presented \n     in this case. Judge Shedd's opinion represents a reasoned \n     (albeit later overruled) approach to that question.\n       On the issue of state immunity under the Eleventh \n     Amendment, opponents have cited Judge Shedd's opinion in the \n     case of Crosby v. South Carolina Dep't of Heath, C.A. No. \n     3:97-3588-19BD, as an example of his ``highly protective \n     views'' of state sovereignty. In Crosby, Judge Shedd in an \n     unpublished opinion found that the 11th Amendment protected \n     states from lawsuits in federal court under the Family and \n     Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Contrary to the claims of his \n     critics, Judge Shedd's opinion in Crosby is well within the \n     mainstream of recent Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence. In \n     fact, eight of the nine Circuit Courts of Appeals to decide \n     the issue of whether the FMLA applied to state agencies have \n     agreed with Judge Shedd's ruling in Crosby. See Laro v. New \n     Hampshire, 259 F.3d 1 (1st Cir 2001); Hale v. Mann, 219 F.3d \n     61 (2nd Cir 2000); Chittister v. Dept. Community and Econ. \n     Dev., 226 F.3d 223 (3rd Cir 2000); Lizz v. WMATA, 255 F.3d \n     128 (4th Cir 2001); Kazmier v. Widmann, 225 F.3d 519 (5th Cir \n     2000); Sims v. Cincinnati, 219 F.3d 559 (6th Cir 2000); \n     Townsell v. Missouri, 233 F.3d 1094 (8th Cir 2000); Garrett \n     v. UAB Board of Trustees, 193 F.3d 1214 (11th Cir 1999). In \n     fact, the Fourth Circuit opinion on this issue was joined by \n     recent Bush appointee Roger Gregory, who was unanimously \n     approved by the Judiciary Committee and unanimously confirmed \n     by the full Senate. See Lizzi v. WMATA, 255 F.3d 128 (4th Cir \n     2001).\n       Those less familiar with Judge Shedd's record also may not \n     be aware of his opinion in another case involving the scope \n     of Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause. In United \n     States v. Floyd Brown,  Crim. No. 94-168-19, Judge Shedd in \n     an unpublished opinion rejected a criminal defendant's \n     constitutional challenge to the Gun Free School Zones Act, \n     finding that the prosecution could prove facts at trial that \n     would support some basis for federal jurisdiction under the \n     statute. Consequently, Judge Shedd found that the Act \n     represented a valid exercise of congressional authority under \n     the Commerce Clause. The Supreme Court later disagreed with \n     Judge Shedd and struck down the Act\n\n[[Page S11272]]\n\n     in a controversial 5-4 decision. See United States v. Lopez, \n     514 U.S. 549 (1995). Nonetheless, Judge Shedd's opinion in \n     Brown demonstrates that he is far from the ``sympathetic \n     participant in the campaign to disempower Congress'' that his \n     detractors have alleged.\n       Even more disturbing than their criticism of Judge Shedd's \n     record on federalism issues is the North Carolina law \n     professors' distortion of his record in civil rights and \n     employment discrimination cases. While we will not address \n     each and every mischaracterization contained in their recent \n     letter to you, suffice it to say that those professors \n     clearly have not provided you with the full picture of Judge \n     Shedd's record.\n       For example, the assertion that Judge Shedd has never \n     granted relief in an employment discrimination case and that \n     he inappropriately uses Rule 56 summary judgment in these \n     cases in misleading and inaccurate. As you must know from \n     your career as a litigator, when a case proceeds beyond the \n     summary judgment stage, the likelihood of settlement in that \n     case increases exponentially. Moreover, an extremely high \n     percentage of employment discrimination cases around the \n     country are disposed of by summary judgment either because \n     the courts consider the claims not to be meritorious or \n     because the plaintiff failed to meet the minimal requirements \n     set by statute and judicial precedent. We understand that \n     Judge Shedd has repeatedly denied summary judgment to \n     defendants in employment discrimination and civil rights \n     cases. In addition, we are aware of only two instances in \n     which the Fourth Circuit has overturned Judge Shedd in \n     employment discrimination cases during his almost twelve-year \n     career on the bench.\n       For your information, we wanted you to be aware of a few of \n     the cases (among many) where Judge Shedd allowed plaintiffs \n     to proceed past the summary judgment stage in civil rights \n     and employment cases:\n\n       In Miles v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield, C.A. No. 3:94-2108-\n     19BD, Judge Shedd denied defendant Blue Cross & Blue Shield's \n     motion for summary judgment in a case brought under Title VII \n     of the Civil Rights Act, where an African-American employee \n     alleged that she was fired because of her race. The case \n     included allegations that the plaintiff's supervisor used \n     racially disparaging remarks on several occasions. The \n     supervisor also allegedly stated that he did not want an \n     African-American to hold the position held by the plaintiff.\n       In Davis v. South Carolina Department of Health, C.A. No. \n     3:96-1698-19BD, Judge Shedd refused to dismiss a Title VII \n     lawsuit by an African-American employee who claimed that she \n     was denied a promotion because of her race. The case involved \n     allegations that the company promoted an unqualified white \n     employee, and that a supervisor who participated in the \n     decision not to promote the plaintiff had made racially \n     disparaging remarks to her.\n       In Ruff v. Whiting Metals, C.A. No. 3:98-2627-19BD, Judge \n     Shedd refused to dismiss a Title VII race discrimination case \n     brought by an African-American welder after he was laid off. \n     The case involved allegations that supervisors repeatedly \n     made racial statements in the workplace, and that one \n     supervisor claimed that he was going to use the pending \n     layoffs to ``get rid of some'' African-American employees.\n       In Black v. Twin Lakes Mobile Homes, C.A. No. 0:97-3971-19, \n     Judge Shedd denied summary judgment for the defendant, an \n     owner of a mobile home park who sought to evict an HIV-\n     positive tenant because of his medical condition. Shedd's \n     ruling allowed the plaintiff's lawsuit alleging \n     discrimination under the Fair Housing Act to go forward.\n       In addition to the above cases, Judge Shedd also has \n     presided over three cases where the NAACP has alleged \n     violations of the Voting Rights Act in which the NAACP \n     prevailed. NAACP v. Lee County, C.A. No. 3:94-1575-17; NAACP \n     v. Holly Hill, C.A. No. 5:91-3034-19; NAACP v. Town of \n     Elloree, C.A. No. 5:91-3106-06. Far from displaying a \n     hostility to civil rights and employment discrimination \n     cases, Judge Shedd's record demonstrates that he is a judge \n     who keeps an open mind, applies the law to the facts, and \n     treats all parties fairly.\n       In sum, as members of the academic legal community in South \n     Carolina [we can unequivocally state that Judge Shedd's \n     record on the federal bench demonstrates that he is fair and \n     impartial in all matters that come before him, including to \n     plaintiffs in employment discrimination and civil rights \n     cases. In addition, his career on the bench and as a staff \n     member of the United States Senate shows that he has a clear \n     understanding of and appropriate deference to Congress' \n     legislative powers. In our view, he will make an excellent \n     addition to the Fourth Circuit, and we urge you to support \n     his nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n         F. Ladson Boyle; David G. Owen; S. Allen Medlin; Howard \n           B. Stravitz; William J. Quirk; Randall Bridwell; Ralph \n           C. McCullough II; Dennis R. Nolan; Robert M. Wilcox.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I support the confirmation of Judge \nDennis W. Shedd of South Carolina as U.S. Circuit Judge for the Fourth \nCircuit.\n  Judge Shedd has served more than 10 years as a United States District \nJudge for the District of South Carolina where he has earned a \nreputation for sound judgement and fairness. Prior to his appointment \nto the Federal bench, Judge Shedd spent nearly 20 years in the practice \nof law and public service, including ten years as a staff member of \nU.S. Senator Strom Thurmond. During his tenure in the Senate, Judge \nShedd served as Counsel to the President Pro Tempore as well as Chief \nCounsel and Staff Director of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  While serving on the Federal bench, Judge Shedd has been a member of \nthe Judicial Conference Committee on the Judicial Branch and its \nsubcommittee on Judicial Independence. He has also participated in \ncommunity activities where he has helped organize and promote drug \neducation programs in the Columbia, SC public schools.\n  Judge Shedd has handled more than 4,000 civil cases and over 900 \ncriminal matters. No judge currently sitting on the Fourth Circuit has \nas much Federal trial experience. In the thousands of cases Judge Shedd \nhas handled, he has been reversed fewer than 40 times--less than one \npercent. In addition, a majority of the ABA's Standing Committee on the \nJudiciary rated Judge Shedd ``Well Qualified.''\n  I believe Judge Shedd has demonstrated the character, wisdom, and \njudicial temperament needed to be an outstanding judge on the Federal \nappellant bench. I encourage my colleagues to support his nomination.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President I am greatly pleased that the full Senate \nis considering the nomination of Judge Dennis Shedd to the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Judge Shedd is a man of \nimpeccable character who will make an outstanding addition to the \nFederal appellate bench. He possesses the highest sense of integrity, a \nthorough knowledge of the law, and a good judicial temperament. These \nqualifications have earned Judge Shedd widespread respect and \nbipartisan support in my home State of South Carolina. In addition to \nRepublican support, Senator Ernest Hollings and State Democratic Party \nchairman Dick Harpootlian have endorsed his nomination.\n  I am exceedingly proud of Dennis Shedd. He was a loyal employee of \nmine for 10 years and is very deserving of this high honor. Judge Shedd \nhas been successful at every stage of his professional life and has \ndedicated most of his career to public service. Upon graduation from \nthe University of South Carolina School of Law, he joined my staff and \neventually served as administrative assistant. Thereafter, during my \ntenures as chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, he \nserved as the committee's chief counsel and staff director. As a staff \nmember, he gained a well-deserved reputation for honesty and hard work.\n  Upon returning to South Carolina, Judge Shedd entered the private \npractice of law and also served as an adjunct law professor at the \nUniversity of South Carolina. In 1990, President Bush nominated Dennis \nShedd to the United States District Court for the District of South \nCarolina, and he has served ably for more than a decade. On numerous \noccasions, Judge Shedd has been given the honor of sitting on the \nFourth Circuit by designation.\n  Judge Shedd's performance on the district court has been marked by \ndistinction. He has been assigned more than 5,000 cases during almost \n12 years on the bench. Out of all these cases, he has only been \nreversed 37 times, resulting in a reversal rate of less than 1 percent. \nThese numbers indicate both the skilled legal mind and the thorough \npreparation that he will bring to the Fourth Circuit. Judge Shedd also \npossesses a good judicial temperament, treating all litigants in his \ncourtroom with dignity and respect.\n  Unfortunately, some groups have portrayed Judge Shedd's judicial \ncareer in a negative light. I would like to take a moment to address \nthese allegations and concerns. An examination of Judge Shedd's record \nindicates that he is not only fair and impartial, but personally \ndedicated to upholding the constitutional rights of all people.\n  Judge Shedd has been criticized for his handling of Alley v. South \nCarolina, a lawsuit wherein the plaintiffs sought to remove the \nConfederate flag from atop the statehouse dome in Columbia, SC. The \nSouth Carolina NAACP has asserted that Judge Shedd ``made several \nderogatory comments about those opposing the flag, and\n\n[[Page S11273]]\n\nminimized the deep racial symbolism of the Confederate flag by \ncomparing it to the Palmetto tree, which appears in South Carolina's \nstate flag.''\n  These allegations are misleading and inaccurate. A close look at the \ntranscript of the hearing reveals that Judge Shedd made a point of \nsaying that his comments were not meant to be disparaging. In fact, he \nsaid, ``I'm not going to denigrate the constitutional claim abut the \nConfederate flag.'' Furthermore, Judge Shedd never ruled on the merits \nof the case. Rather, he abstained to allow a claim to go forward in \nState court, arguably the forum better equipped to handle the issue.\n  Additionally, it is important to note that Judge Shedd's comments \nabout the Palmetto tree were made during his examination of the \nlawyer's legal argument in the case. The argument hinged on the \noffensive nature of the Confederate flag, and Judge Shedd pointed out \nthat many symbols could be perceived as offensive, such as the Palmetto \ntree on the State flag. Judge Shedd then stated, ``I'm not determining \nnow on whether or not the flag should be there at all. I'm just doing \nwhat--you lawyers have been with me before know, I'm exploring your \nlegal theory.'' In this case, Judge Shedd was simply engaging in the \nSocratic method with the lawyers, and his words should not be twisted \nto insinuate any personal feelings about the propriety of flying the \nConfederate flag over the statehouse dome.\n  I would like to point out the case of Vanderhoff v. John Deere, the \none case involving the Confederate flag in which Judge Shedd did rule. \nIn that case, an employee was fired because he refused to comply with \ncompany policy and remove the Confederate flag from his toolbox. The \nemployee sued under title VII, a statute designed to prohibit workplace \ndiscrimination based on race, sex, religion, and national origin. He \nargued that his national origin was a ``Confederate Southern American'' \nand that he had been the subject of discrimination. Judge Shedd \nrejected this argument and dismissed the plaintiff's claim. Thus, on \nthe one Confederate flag case where he ruled on the merits, Judge \nShedd's decision went against a flag proponent.\n  In recent weeks, Judge Shedd has been the subject of vicious attacks \nbased on his handling of employment discrimination cases. Over and over \nagain, we have head the accusation that Judge Shedd shows a bias \ntowards defendants. A review of Judge Shedd's record indicates that he \nhas been fair to the civil rights claims of plaintiffs in his \ncourtroom. In fact, Judge Shedd has only been reversed two times in \nemployment discrimination cases. With such a low reversal rate, I am \ndisappointed that some groups have insisted on attacking this fine \njudge.\n  One commonly cited case is Roberts v. Defender Services, in which \nJudge Shedd dismissed a plaintiff's sexual harassment claim. In this \ncase, Judge Shedd merely followed the law as established by the Supreme \nCourt, which held in Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775 \n(1998), that the work environment must be both objectively and \nsubjectively offensive. While the plaintiff had clearly shown that the \nwork environment was objectively offensive, Judge Shedd determined that \nshe had not made a showing that she perceived it to be offensive. He \nbased his determination on the fact that she had recommended the \nposition to someone else and stated that the employer was ``a nice \nperson'' who was ``pretty good to work for.'' These comments by the \nplaintiff demonstrate that Judge Shedd's decision was reasonable under \nthe circumstances of this case.\n  The truth is that Judge Shedd has issued rulings that have benefitted \nplaintiffs on numerous occasions. For example, in Miles v. Blue Cross & \nBlue Shield, C.A. No. 3:94-2108-19BD, an action was brought under title \nVII of the Civil Rights Act by an African-American employee who alleged \nthat she was fired because of her race. There was ample evidence that \nthe plaintiff had been subjected to racial slurs before being fired. \nJudge Shedd appropriately denied the defendant employer's motion for \nsummary judgment.\n  In another case, Davis v. South Carolina Department of Health and \nEnvironmental Control, C.A. No. 3:96-1698-19BD, an action was brought \nunder title VII by an African-American employee who alleged that she \nwas denied a promotion because of her race. There was evidence that an \nunqualified white employee had been promoted and that racially \ndisparaging remarks had been made. Judge Shedd followed the law and \ndenied the defendant employer's motion for summary judgment. Again in \nRuff v. Whiting Metals, C.A. No. 3:98-2627-19BD and Williams v. South \nCarolina Department of Public Safety, C.A. No. 3:99-976-19BC, Judge \nShedd denied a defendant's motion for summary judgment on race \ndiscrimination claims.\n  In the case of Treacy v. Loftis, C.A. No. 3:92-3001-19BD, Judge \nShedd, overruling a magistrate judge's recommendation, declined to \ngrant summary judgment on a fired employee's claim of intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress. In that case, the plaintiff claimed \nthat her job was terminated due to her involvement in an interracial \nrelationship. Judge Shedd, in refusing to grant summary judgment, \nallowed the case to go forward.\n  There are many other cases like these. Judge Shedd's record reveals \nthat he has upheld important rights protected by the Constitution. If \nelevated to the Fourth Circuit, Judge Shedd will continue to protect \ncivil liberties.\n  In addition to Judge Shedd's proven record of protecting civil \nrights, he has personally dedicated himself to providing equal \nopportunities for women and minorities. As an example, Judge Shedd \nserved as chairman of the South Carolina Advisory Committee to the U.S. \nCommission on Civil Rights. He also played an instrumental role in the \nselection of Margaret Seymour as the first female African-American U.S. \nmagistrate judge in the district of South Carolina. When Judge Seymour \nwas nominated by President Clinton to the district court, Judge Shedd \nfully supported her nomination. Furthermore, Judge Shedd has hired both \nAfrican-American and female law clerks.\n  I would like to turn to another accusation that has been leveled \nagainst Judge Shedd. He has been accused of espousing an unreasonably \nnarrow interpretation of congressional power based on his decision in \nCondon v. Reno, 972 F.Supp. 977 (1997), in which he struck down the \nDriver's Privacy Protection Act. The act regulated the dissemination of \nState motor vehicle record information, and the State of South Carolina \nchallenged its constitutionality. Judge Shedd ruled that under Supreme \nCourt precedent, the act violated the 10th amendment by impermissibly \ncommandeering State governments, forcing them to regulate in a specific \nfashion. The Fourth Circuit upheld this decision, Condon v. Reno, 155 \nF.3d 453 (4th Cir. 1998), but the Supreme Court ultimately reversed. \nReno v. Condon, 120 S.Ct. 666 (2000).\n  I stress that this case was one of first impression. Given the U.S. \nSupreme Court opinions in New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144 \n(1992), and Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898 (1997), Judge Shedd's \nruling was entirely reasonable. In a very persuasive opinion, he \ncompared the Drivers Privacy Protection Act with those acts invalidated \nin New York and Printz and found it to have similar constitutional \ndefects.\n  Judge Shedd was not alone in his analysis. At least one liberal \ncommentator, Erwin Chemerinsky, concluded that the Supreme Court's \ndistinction of the Drivers Privacy Protection Act from the statutes \nstruck down in New York and Printz was unconvincing. While Chemerinsky \nagreed with the final outcome of the case, he has argued that the \nSupreme Court should have overruled both New York and Printz in order \nto reach its decision in Reno. Professor Chemerinsky's argument lends \nsupport to the proposition that Judge Shedd, in striking down the \nstatute, was correct in his interpretation of the law at that time.\n  In addition, of the 16 lower Federal court judges who considered the \nconstitutionality of DPPA, 8 determined that the statute was \nunconstitutional. In short, there is nothing to indicate that Judge \nShedd's decision in this case was out of the mainstream.\n  Another case that has been cited is Crosby v. U.S., in which Judge \nShedd held that the plaintiff's claim under the Family and Medical \nLeave Act was barred by the 11th amendment to the Constitution. Judge \nShedd's detractors have argued that this case is another example of his \nnarrow view of congressional power. However, this accusation\n\n[[Page S11274]]\n\nis unfair and unwarranted. In this case, Judge Shedd sought to follow \nthe law as established by the Supreme Court. He was not attempting to \nmake new law, but was instead seeking to apply the law correctly. \nFurthermore, Judge Shedd was not alone in his decision. Out of nine \ncircuit courts that have considered this same question, eight have \nagreed with Judge Shedd. It is worth noting that Judge Roger Gregory, \noriginally appointed by President Clinton, joined the Fourth Circuit's \nopinion that agreed with Judge Shedd's ruling.\n  Judge Shedd has also been criticized as being antiplaintiff for \ndisposing of matters sua sponte, or on his own motion. This charge is \nwithout merit for a number of reasons. First, Federal judges face \nenormous caseloads. If an area of the law is clear, it is completely \nproper for the judge to act on his own motion, helping to move \nlitigation along and clear the dockets. Second, the law clearly allows \nfor district court judges to consider matters without prompting from \nlawyers. The Supreme Court has acknowledged this, stating in Celotex \nCorp. v. Catrett, 830 F.2d 1308 477 U.S. 317, 326 (1986), that district \ncourts may grant summary judgment sua sponte to a party that has not \nmoved for summary judgment. As long as a judge is acting properly, \nwhich Judge Shedd has always done, sua sponte decisions are entirely \nappropriate.\n  I have known Judge Dennis Shedd for over 24 years and can personally \nvouch for his integrity and high moral character. He is truly a man of \nknowledge, ability, and superior ethical standards. Judge Shedd will \nbring a wealth of trial experience to the Fourth Circuit, having \nhandled more than 4,000 civil cases and over 900 criminal matters. In \naddition, he possesses unmatched legislative experience. It is no \nsurprise that the American Bar Association gave Judge Shedd a rating of \n``Well Qualified.'' I am proud to support my friend, Dennis Shedd, and \nI hope to see him confirmed to the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe Fourth Circuit. I ask unanimous consent that the attached materials \nbe printed in the Record.\n\n    Dennis W. Shedd--Nominee to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals\n\n       Background. Appointed by President George H.W. Bush to the \n     United States District Court for South Carolina in 1990, \n     Dennis W. Shedd has served as a federal jurist for more than \n     a decade.\n       In addition to his service on the District Court, he sat by \n     designation on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on several \n     occasions. Shedd also has served on the Judicial Conference \n     Committee of the Judicial Branch and its Subcommittee on \n     Judicial Independence.\n       From 1978 through 1988, Judge Shedd served in a number of \n     different capacities in the United States Senate, including \n     Counsel to the President Pro Tempore and Chief Counsel and \n     Staff Director for the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n       Judge Shedd is well-respected by members of the bench and \n     bar in South Carolina. According to South Carolina \n     plaintiffs' attorney Joseph Rice, ``Shedd--who came to the \n     bench with limited trial experience--has a good understanding \n     of day-to-day problems that affect lawyers in his courtroom. \n     . . . He's been a straight shooter.'' Legal Times, May 14, \n     2001.\n       According to the Almanac of the Federal Judiciary, \n     attorneys said that Shedd has outstanding legal skills and an \n     excellent judicial temperament. A few comments from South \n     Carolina lawyers; ``You are not going to find a better judge \n     on the bench or one that works harder.'' ``He's the best \n     federal judge we've got.'' He gets an A all around.'' It's a \n     great experience trying cases before him.'' ``He's polite and \n     businesslike.''\n       Plaintiff lawyers commended Shedd for being even-handed; \n     ``He has always been fair.'' ``I have no complaints about \n     him. He's nothing if not fair.'' Almanac of the Federal \n     Judiciary, Vol. 1, 1999.\n       Judge Shedd would bring unmatched experience to the Fourth \n     Circuit. He has handled more than 4,000 civil cases since \n     taking the bench and over 900 criminal matters. In fact, no \n     judge currently sitting on the Fourth Circuit has as much \n     federal trial experience as Judge Shedd, and none can match \n     his ten years of experience in the legislative branch.\n       Shedd's record demonstrates that he is a mainstream judge \n     with a low reversal rate. In the more than 5,000 cases Judge \n     Shedd has handled during his twelve years on the bench, he \n     has been reversed fewer than 40 times less than one percent). \n     Since taking his seat on the Fourth Circuit in 2001, Judge \n     Roger Gregory (a Democrat appointed by President Bush) has \n     written opinions affirming several of Judge Shedd's rulings. \n     Judge Gregory also agreed with Judge Shedd's holding in \n     Crosby v. South Carolina Dep't of Health (case cited by Judge \n     Shedd's opponents) that Congress did not effectively abrogate \n     State sovereign immunity in the Family and Medical Leave Act. \n     See Lizzi v. WMATA, 255 F.3d 128 94th Cir. 2001.\n       Judge Shedd has been completely forthcoming with the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee's requests for information. Earlier this \n     year, Judge Shedd sent nearly one thousand unpublished \n     opinions to the Committee for review immediately after \n     Chairman Leahy requested them. Judge Shedd has continued to \n     provide additional unpublished opinions, as well as all other \n     information the Committee has requested regarding his \n     rulings, opinions and judicial record generally.\n       Judge Shedd has bi-partisan support from his home state \n     Senators; Senators Thurmond and Hollings support his \n     nomination.\n       A majority of the ABA's Standing Committee on the Judiciary \n     rated Judge Shedd ``Well Qualified.'' Democrats have called \n     the ABA rating the ``gold standard'' for judicial nominees.\n                                           Rosenberg Proutt Funk &\n\n\n                                               Greenberg, LLP,\n\n                                     Baltimore, MD, June 25, 2002.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, the Dirksen \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: My name is Thomas W. Jones, Jr. I am an \n     African-American attorney currently practicing as a \n     litigation associate in Baltimore, Maryland.\n       Upon my graduation from the University of Maryland School \n     of Law, I had the distinct pleasure of serving as a judicial \n     clerk for the Honorable Dennis W. Shedd (``Judge Shedd'') on \n     the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina. \n     During my eighteen months of working with Judge Shedd, I \n     never encountered a hint of bias, in any form or fashion, \n     regarding any aspect of judge Shedd's jurisprudence or daily \n     activities.\n       It is apparent to me that the allegations regarding Judge \n     Shedd's alleged biases have been propagated by individuals \n     without the benefit of any real, meaningful interaction with \n     Judge Shedd, his friends or family members. I trust the \n     accusations of bias levied against Judge Shedd will be given \n     the short shrift they are due, and trust further that this \n     honorable Committee will act favorably upon the pending \n     nomination of Judge Shedd for the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\n       Thank you for your attention regarding this matter.\n           Respectfully,\n     Thomas W. Jones, Jr.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 13, 2002.\n     James Gallman,\n     President, SCNAACP,\n     Columbia, SC.\n       Dear President Gallman: Thank you very much for your \n     interest in the nomination of Judge Dennis Shedd to the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. I want \n     to assure you that Judge Shedd is an outstanding Federal \n     Judge, and he is committed to upholding the rights of all \n     people under the Constitution. Rather than being hostile to \n     civil rights, as his detractors have claimed, Judge Shedd is \n     committed to the ideals of equal justice under the law. I am \n     confident that upon an examination of his record, you will \n     find that Dennis Shedd is eminently qualified, applies the \n     law fairly, and exhibits an appropriate judicial temperament.\n       I would like to address your concerns regarding Judge \n     Shedd's civil rights record. I believe that it is commendable \n     in all respects. First of all, Judge Shedd has been accused \n     of granting summary judgment for defendants in almost every \n     case. This accusation is false. A review of Judge Shedd's \n     record indicates that he has been fair to the civil rights \n     claims of plaintiffs in his courtroom. In fact, he has issued \n     rulings that have benefitted plaintiffs on numerous \n     occasions. For example, in Miles v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield, \n     C.A. No. 3:94-2108-19BD, an action was brought under Title \n     VII of the Civil Rights Act by an African-American employee \n     who alleged that she was fired because of her race. There was \n     ample evidence that the plaintiff had been subjected to \n     racial slurs before being fired. Judge Shedd appropriately \n     denied the defendant employer's motion for summary judgment.\n       In another case, Davis v. South Carolina Department of \n     Health and Environmental Control, C.A. No. 3:96-1698-19BD, an \n     action was brought under Title VII by an African-American \n     employee who alleged that she was denied a promotion because \n     of her race. There was evidence that an unqualified white \n     employee had been promoted and that racially disparaging \n     remarks had been made. Judge Shedd followed the law and \n     denied the defendant employer's motion for summary judgment. \n     Again in Ruff v. Whiting Metals, C.A. No. 3:98-2627-19BD and \n     Williams v. South Carolina Department of Public Safety, C.A. \n     No. 3:99-976-19BC, Judge Shedd denied a defendant's motion \n     for summary judgment on race discrimination claims.\n       In the case of Treacy v. Loftis, C.A. No. 3:92-3001-19BD, \n     Judge Shedd, overruling a magistrate judge's recommendation, \n     declined to grant summary judgment on a fired employee's \n     claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress. In \n     that case, the plaintiff claimed that her job was terminated \n     due to her involvement in an interracial relationship. Judge \n     Shedd, in refusing to grant summary judgment, allowed the \n     case to go forward.\n       Judge Shedd has also been accused of making insensitive \n     remarks about the Confederate flag during proceedings in the \n     case of\n\n[[Page S11275]]\n\n     Alley v. South Carolina, C.A. No. 3:94-1196-19. a lawsuit in \n     which the plaintiffs sought to remove the Confederate flag \n     from atop the Statehouse dome. These allegations are \n     misleading and inaccurate. A close look at the transcript \n     reveals that Judge Shedd made a point of saying that his \n     comments were not meant to be disparaging. In fact, he said, \n     ``I'm not going to denigrate the constitutional claim about \n     the Confederate flag.'' Judge Shedd went on to say, ``I'm not \n     determining now on whether or not the flag should be there at \n     all. I'm just doing what-you lawyers have been with me before \n     know, I'm exploring your legal theory.''. The transcript \n     clearly indicates that Judge Shedd was questioning the \n     lawyers about their arguments in this case, something that is \n     done every day in courtrooms across the nation. Furthermore, \n     Judge Shedd never ruled on the merits of the case. Rather, he \n     abstained to allow a claim to go forward in state court, \n     arguably the forum better equipped to handle the issue.\n       I would like to point out the case of Vanderhoff v. John \n     Deere, C.A. No 01-0406-19BD, the one case involving the \n     Confederate flag in which Judge Shedd did rule. In that case, \n     an employee was fired because he refused to comply with \n     company policy and remove the Confederate flag from his \n     toolbox. The employee sued under Title VII, a statute \n     designed to prohibit workplace discrimation based on race, \n     sex, religion, and national origin. He argued that his \n     national origin was a ``Confederate Southern American'' and \n     that he had been the subject of discrimination. Judge Shedd \n     rejected this argument and dismissed the plaintiff's claim. \n     Thus, in the one Confederate flag case where he ruled on the \n     merits, Judge Shedd's decision went against a flag proponent.\n       In addition to Judge Shedd's demonstrated fairness in the \n     civil rights arena, he has shown that he is personally \n     committed to ensuring equal opportunities for women and \n     minorities. He was instrumental in the selection of Judge \n     Margaret Seymour, now a Federal District Court Judge, as the \n     first African-American female magistrate judge in the \n     District of South Carolina. He has also made an effort to \n     hire African-American and female law clerks. In fact, Thomas \n     Jones, an African-American man who clerked for Judge Shedd, \n     wrote a letter to Senator Leahy in which he said that the \n     allegations made against Judge Shedd should ``be given the \n     short shrift they are due . . . .''\n       Next, I would like to address the concerns raised by the \n     case of Condon v. Reno, 972 F. Supp. 977 (D.S.C. 1997), in \n     which Judge Shedd held that the Driver's Privacy Protection \n     Act (DPPA) was unconstitutional. He was eventually reversed \n     by the Supreme Court. Reno v. Condon, 528 U.S. 141 (2000). It \n     is important to stress that this case was one of first \n     impression. Given the United States Supreme Court opinions in \n     New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144 (1992), and Printz v. \n     United States, 521 U.S. 898 (1997), Judge Shedd's ruling was \n     entirely reasonable. In a very persuasive opinion, he \n     compared DPPA with those Acts invalidated in New York and \n     Printz and found it to have similar constitutional defects.\n       While the Supreme Court ultimately disagreed with Judge \n     Shedd, his opinion was not outside of the mainstream. Of the \n     16 lower Federal court judges who considered the \n     constitutionality of DPPA, 8 determined the statute \n     unconstitutional. Some of these judges, such as Judge Barbara \n     Crabb and Judge John Godbold, were nominated by Democratic \n     presidents.\n       In summary, I believe that Judge Shedd is a highly \n     qualified candidate who will make an excellent addition to \n     the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. It \n     is a shame that he has been characterized as a judge with an \n     agenda to curtail civil rights. On the contrary, Judge Shedd \n     has demonstrated that he will apply the law fairly to all \n     people. In addition, he has received a rating of ``Well \n     Qualified'' by the American Bar Association, and he has the \n     support of South Carolina Democrats, such as Senator Fritz \n     Hollings and state Democratic Party Chairman Dick \n     Harpootlian.\n       I hope that this information is helpful during your further \n     consideration of Judge Shedd, and I hope that you will join \n     me in support of this fine man. I have known Judge Shedd for \n     a long time, and he is in all respects an honorable public \n     servant. Again, thank you for your interest.\n       With kindest regards and best wishes,\n           Sincerely,\n     Strom Thurmond.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                       U.S. Senate\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 30, 2002.\n     Letters to the Editor,\n     The New York Times,\n     New York, NY.\n       Dear Editor: This letter is in response to the editorial \n     that appeared in your paper on July 28, 2002, entitled ``The \n     Secret History of Judges.'' The piece questioned whether \n     Judge Dennis Shedd, whom President Bush nominated to the U.S. \n     Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, has adequately \n     supplied the Senate Judiciary Committee with all relevant \n     information regarding his 11 years as a Federal District \n     Court Judge. I can assure you that Judge Shedd has been \n     thoroughly responsive to Committee requests and has provided \n     an extraordinary amount of material. In fact, to the best of \n     my knowledge, there is simply nothing left for him to hand \n     over. This tired call for more information is nothing more \n     than a delay tactic being utilized by political groups that \n     oppose most of President Bush's judicial nominees, even when \n     the nominees are, like Judge Shedd, extremely well-qualified.\n       All interested parties have had ample time to examine Judge \n     Shedd's record. On June 27, 2002, Judge Shedd testified \n     before the Committee for more than two hours, during which \n     time he answered all questions asked of him. After the \n     hearing, individual Senators had the opportunity to submit \n     questions, and Judge Shedd prepared written responses to \n     questions from six Senators.\n       Previously, on March 22, 2002, the Committee requested all \n     of Judge Shedd's ``unpublished'' opinions. To fulfill this \n     extremely broad request, as many as a dozen district court \n     employees were required to undertake an extensive and time-\n     consuming manual search of case files within the district as \n     well as an electronic search of available computer records. \n     Within 12 days, Judge Shedd provided a first set of documents \n     to the Committee. As Judge Shedd was able to secure \n     additional documents from out-of-state court storage, he \n     supplemented his initial response with a second set of \n     documents on May 20, 2002. In summary, Judge Shedd \n     expeditiously supplied the Committee with more than 13,000 \n     pieces of paper. Therefore, all documents responsive to this \n     request have been available to Committee members for a \n     significant period of time.\n       Although it has been suggested that Judge Shedd had not \n     provided the appropriate documentation, the record will \n     reflect that Judge Shedd has diligently worked to produce all \n     documents, of which he and other court employees are aware, \n     that satisfy the Committee request. While Judge Shedd has \n     been assigned some 5,000 civil cases, many of these cases \n     included routine matters, such as foreclosures, and have \n     ended without any substantive ruling by Judge Shedd. \n     Likewise, cases are often referred to Federal magistrate \n     judges who make reports and recommendations to the District \n     Court Judge. While Judge Shedd has received some 1,400 \n     reports from magistrate judges, many of these are on non-\n     substantive issues. I can assure you that the opinions Judge \n     Shedd has supplied represent, to the best of his knowledge, \n     all of his substantive ``unpublished'' opinions.\n       Your editorial asserts that civil rights groups have \n     identified ``important rulings by Judge Shedd that have not \n     been handed over.'' I have previously requested that these \n     groups identify the particular cases in which they are \n     interested, but they have yet to do so. I would once again \n     urge these groups to identify the cases that cause them \n     concern, and Judge Shedd will be happy to locate any \n     information on these cases that will assist Committee members \n     as they evaluate his nomination.\n       In short, Judge Shedd has acted promptly, professionally, \n     and in good faith in his dealings with the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee. His record is as complete as any other circuit \n     nominee we have ever had before the Committee. There simply \n     is no justifiable basis to clam that he has failed to respond \n     to Committee requests.\n       It is my sincere hope that Judge Dennis Shedd will soon be \n     confirmed as a Federal Circuit Court Judge. He is a fine man \n     who has performed ably on the Federal bench for more than a \n     decade. He has responsively provided the Senate Judiciary \n     committee with documentation that chronicles his career as a \n     distinguished jurist. Quite simply, Judge Shedd's record is \n     complete, and it proves that he is committed to upholding the \n     rights of all people under the Constitution.\n           Sincerely,\n     Strom Thurmond.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Fairness: Judge Shedd's ABA ``Well Qualified'' Rating--The ABA Rated \n         Judge Shedd ``Well Qualified'' for the Fourth Circuit\n\n       According to the ABA Standing Committee on Federal \n     Judiciary, a nominee is evaluated on ``integrity, \n     professional competence, and judicial temperament.''\n       ``Integrity is self-defining. The prospective nominee's \n     character and general reputation in the legal community are \n     investigated, as are his or her industry and diligence.''\n       ``In investigating judicial temperament, the Committee \n     considers the prospective nominee's compassion, decisiveness, \n     open-mindedness, courtesy, patience, freedom from bias, and \n     commitment to equal justice under the law.''\n       ``To merit Well Qualified, the prospective nominee must be \n     at the top of the legal profession in his or her legal \n     community, have outstanding legal ability, wide experience, \n     the highest reputation for integrity and either have shown, \n     or have exhibited the capacity for, judicial temperament, and \n     have the committee's strongest affirmative endorsement.''\n       Source: The ABA Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary: \n     What It Is and How It Works, American Bar Association (July \n     1999) (pages 4 and 6).\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Post and Courier, Nov. 15, 2002]\n\n                     Shedd's Advance a Welcome Sign\n\n       President Bush's nomination of U.S. District Court Judge \n     Dennis Shedd of Columbia to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of \n     Appeals finally was sent to the full Senate by the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee Thursday. That overdue action represents \n     an important step forward in breaking the partisan logjam on \n     federal judicial appointments.\n       It also represents a potential step away from what Sen. \n     Strom Thurmond aptly described as ``destructive politics'' \n     last month\n\n[[Page S11276]]\n\n     after Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-VT, reneged on his \n     promise to send Judge Shedd's nomination to the full Senate. \n     Sen. Thurmond, who's retiring after a long, distinguished \n     career in politics, vividly expressed his outrage at this \n     violation of personal trust, telling his colleagues: ``In 48 \n     years in the Senate, I have never been treated in such a \n     manner.''\n       And the Judiciary Committee's growing habit of blocking \n     presidential appointments to the Federal bench has reached \n     critical mass over the last year and a half. Democrats' \n     protests that Senate Republicans had subjected President \n     Clinton to the same mistreatment don't hold up when the rates \n     of rejection are considered, particularly at the appeals \n     court level. That blatantly party-line obstruction of \n     judicial appointments became a campaign season liability for \n     the Democrats in some states, including South Carolina, where \n     Republican Lindsey Graham repeatedly stressed the need to \n     break that pattern by giving President Bush a GOP Senate--and \n     a GOP-controlled Judiciary Committee--in his winning campaign \n     to replace Sen. Thurmond.\n       Recognizing the incoming Senate's intentions on this issue, \n     and the voting public's message, Sen. Leahy didn't call for a \n     committee roll-call vote on the nominations of Judge Shedd \n     and Professor Michael McConnell to the appeals courts \n     Thursday, instead allowing them to advance.\n       And despite familiar objections from special-interest \n     groups that seem intent on branding any judge who has ever \n     issued a purportedly conservative ruling as a reckless \n     ``extremist,'' Judge Shedd has the support of not just \n     leading Republicans, but of Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-SC. \n     The senator has been openly critical of the Judiciary \n     Committee's previous attempts to derail this nomination.\n       Thursday's Judiciary Committee decision was not merely a \n     victory for Judge Shedd, President Bush, Sen. Thurmond and \n     Sen. Hollings. It was a victory for fairer, more efficient \n     consideration and confirmation of presidential judicial \n     appointments by the Senate.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Greenville News, Oct. 15, 2002]\n\n                           Insulting Thurmond\n\n       Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, a \n     Democrat from Vermont, did a number last week on retiring \n     South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond, and in the process \n     thumbed his nose at both the Constitution and any sense of \n     fair play. Highly partisan Democrats don't want Thurmond's \n     choice for the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, U.S. \n     District Judge Dennis Shedd, to get a well-earned promotion \n     to the appeals court.\n       Shedd is eminently qualified, but he has been painted as an \n     opponent of civil rights, the disabled and common workers. \n     The case hasn't been made, but then, the Democrats who oppose \n     his nomination aren't interested in making the case with \n     facts. They have conveniently used Shedd as an election \n     issue.\n       With the U.S. Senate in the hands of Democrats, it has \n     become something of a sport in Washington to prevent \n     President Bush from getting his top choice for federal \n     judges. But Sen. Leahy sunk to a new low last seek by \n     refusing to allow a vote on the Shedd nomination, and in \n     doing so, it became obvious he had flat-out lied to Sen. \n     Thurmond. Leahy had promised South Carolina's 99-year-old \n     senior senator a Judiciary Committee vote on Shedd, but that \n     was before word leaked that a committee Democrat would vote \n     for Shedd. If his nomination got to the full Senate, he would \n     be approved, especially with South Carolina's Sen. Fritz \n     Hollings wholeheartedly supporting this nomination.\n       The Senate Judiciary Committee has become a graveyard for \n     Bush's top choices for seats on the federal appeals court. \n     The Democrats have flexed their muscles to prevent the \n     nomination of reputable choices--such as Charles Pickering \n     and Priscilla Owen--from making it to the Senate floor for a \n     vote they probably would win. But now the powerful Leahy has \n     proven he can go lower--by denying a vote, even after he made \n     a promise to allow one.\n       Thurmond was indignant last week, making a rare Senate \n     speech in which he said about Leahy, ``In my 48 years in the \n     United States Senate, I have never been treated in such a \n     manner.'' Thurmond is leaving a Senate in which a man's word \n     is no longer his honor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        [From the Orangeburg Times and Democrat, Oct. 13, 2002\n\n                    Nomination of Shedd Held Hostage\n\n       The continuing battle over federal judgeships grows more \n     frustrating.\n       It's a partisan and philosophical battle that has gone \n     beyond what was ever intended by the framers of our \n     Constitution. The founders gave presidents appointment power \n     for judges, with the Senate's role being advice and consent.\n       Particularly since the Clinton years of the 1990s, the \n     process has been paralyzed by politics. A Republican Senate \n     left Clinton nominees hanging, never even giving them a \n     hearing and a vote. The Democratic Senate has been doing the \n     same thing with President Bush's nominees.\n       On Tuesday, partisanship got closer to home when Cordova \n     native and S.C. U.S. District Judge Dennis Shedd was denied a \n     vote by the Senate Judiciary Committee on his nomination to \n     the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       The decision to delay the vote prompted S.C. Republican \n     Sen. Strom Thurmond, for whom Shedd once served as a top \n     aide, to react angrily at the committee and its Democratic \n     leader, Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont. Leahy said the vote on \n     Shedd was too contentious for the session and would have \n     sparked a debate delaying action on other judicial \n     candidates.\n       That may be, but Thurmond was taking the rejection \n     personally, addressing the Senate Judiciary Committee himself \n     in a rare appearance.\n       ``In my 48 years in the U.S. Senate, I have never been \n     treated in such a manner. You assured me on numerous \n     occasions that Judge Shedd would get a vote, and that is all \n     that I have ever asked of you. I have waited patiently for 17 \n     months, and I have extended every courtesy to you,'' Thurmond \n     said to Leahy.\n       The judgeship battles are likely to trample on more Senate \n     decorum, particularly when judges meet vocal opposition as \n     has Shedd. Despite endorsements by the American Bar \n     Association and others, Shedd has faced criticism from the \n     NAACP and other organizations contending his record shows no \n     sympathy for those in discrimination cases. Sixth District \n     Congressman Jim Clyburn is among opponents.\n       But Shedd enjoys the support of both Republican Thurmond \n     and Democrat Ernest F. Hollings from South Carolina. And he \n     is former chief legal counsel to the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee, which Thurmond formerly chaired.\n       Thurmond's anger over the delay of Shedd's nomination \n     probably won't change the equation.\n       A vote probably will not come until next year--and may not \n     come then unless the Republicans regain control of the U.S. \n     Senate in November's election. That would mean that Thurmond, \n     who will soon turn 100 and is not seeking re-election, won't \n     be voting on a judicial candidate he recommended and \n     President Bush nominated way back on May 9, 2001.\n       In all, Bush has nominated 126 U.S. Appeals Court and U.S. \n     District Court nominees, and the senate has confirmed 80: 14 \n     judges to appeals courts and 66 to district courts. Most of \n     the others haven't been put to a vote.\n       Shedd should not be one of them. His record is a good one, \n     and it is that record that should be the test of his \n     approval, not what others believe about his personal or \n     political philosophy.\n       Shedd is certainly not out of the judicial mainstream and \n     his opinions are not rooted in controversy.\n       Sen. Hollings is known for his candid if not controversial \n     assessment of people. The S.C. Democrat is solidly behind \n     Shedd, being the one to introduce him initially to the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee.\n       Saying Shedd ``has an outstanding record of sound \n     judgment,'' Hollings told the Judiciary Committee that Shedd \n     is ``my kind of judge--hard and tough, but hard and tough on \n     both sides.''\n       His nomination should be brought to a vote by the Senate \n     committee and then the full Senate, where we're confident he \n     will win approval.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will speak today in morning business \nbriefly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n\n\n                           Homeland Security\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to say a few words about the issue \nof homeland security. I will not talk at the moment about the bill \nitself, which we will vote on tomorrow, but a couple of issues dealing \nwith homeland security that are very important, that have been raised \nin recent days and need to be discussed.\n  One issue deals with something that is happening in the Defense \nDepartment. My colleague Senator Nelson from Florida spoke of it \nearlier today. That is the creation of an Information Awareness Office \nand the prospect of having an agency that would amass your most \npersonal information--credit card purchases, travels, medical \ninformation, and so on--and put it into a single database. That \nconcerns me greatly. I will speak about that in a moment.\n  But first I will speak about another issue relating to homeland \nsecurity. This is an issue that was recently highlighted by a task \nforce headed by former Senator Warren Rudman and former Senator Gary \nHart.\n  That task force included former Secretaries of State Warren \nChristopher and George Shultz, retired Admiral William Crowe, former \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and others. There is a very \nsignificant blue ribbon task force.\n  They issued a report that was sponsored by the Council of Foreign \nRelations. The report was titled ``America Still Unprepared, America \nStill In Danger.''\n\n[[Page S11277]]\n\n  The task force found that 1 year after the September 11 attacks, \nAmerica remains--according to them--dangerously unprepared for another \nterrorist attack. At the top of the list of concerns in this task force \nwas this:\n\n       650,000 local and State police officials continue to \n     operate in a virtual intelligence vacuum without access to \n     terrorist watch lists that are provided by the United States \n     Department of State to immigration consular officials.\n\n  Why is this important? Well, consider that 36 hours before the \nSeptember 11 attack, one of the hijackers who piloted the plane that \ncrashed in Pennsylvania, named Ziad Jarrah, a 26-year-old Lebanese \nnational, was actually pulled over by the Maryland State Police for \ndriving 90 miles an hour on Interstate 95. If this fellow's name had \nbeen on the State Department terrorist watch list--and it happens that \nit was not--there would have been no way for that Maryland State \ntrooper to know it. That Maryland State trooper can type a name into \nthe system and go to the NCIC where they have the database of convicted \nfelons, but that trooper has no access to the watch list that the \nImmigration Service has courtesy of the State Department.\n  You have all of these people around the country--law enforcement \nofficials--who are actually the first line of defense and the first \nresponders in the event something happens. And they are out there \nstopping people with traffic stops and stopping suspicious people who \nare driving automobiles without license tags, and so on. They don't \nhave any idea whether someone they have just stopped is a known \nterrorist on a watch list prepared by the State Department and given to \nthe Immigration Service and given to the consular offices. Why? Because \nthey currently have no mechanism to access it.\n  Right now, a county sheriff somewhere in a northern county in North \nDakota is patrolling a road. If down that road for some reason would \ncome a terrorist who crossed over a remote section on the border \nbetween the United States and Canada and a county sheriff stops that \nknown terrorist who is on the watch list for driving 90 miles an hour \non Highway 22, there isn't any way that county sheriff is going to be \nable to access that watch list and know that he or she has pulled over \na known terrorist.\n  That is wrong.\n  Let me read an excerpt from the Hart-Rudman report, discussing what \nthey regard as a top concern:\n\n       With just 56 field offices around the nation, the burden of \n     identifying and intercepting terrorists in our midst is a \n     task well beyond the scope of the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation. This burden can and should be shared with \n     650,000 local county and State law enforcement officers. But \n     they clearly cannot lend a hand in the counterterrorism \n     information void that now exists. When it comes to combating \n     terrorism, the police officers on the beat are effectively \n     operating deaf, dumb and blind.\n\n  That is from the report.\n  Again, quoting from the report:\n\n       Terrorist watch lists provided by the United States \n     Department of State to immigration and consular officials are \n     still out of bounds for State and local police. In the \n     interim period, as information sharing issues get worked out, \n     known terrorists will be free to move about to plan and \n     execute their attacks without any bother from local law \n     enforcement officials because they can't know their names \n     and they can't access the list.\n\n  My staff has been in contact with this task force. We have also been \nin contact with the State Department and the White House, asking when \nsomething is going to be done to connect the dots here. Since we made \nthese contacts, the administration is apparently looking for ways to \nintegrate that terrorist watch list--called the Tipoff database--with \nthe National Crime Information Center which is accessible by State and \nlocal law enforcement officers. I call on the administration to \nexpedite, as much as is possible, the effort to make this happen. We \ncan't waste another day in this regard, as all of us know.\n  The head of the CIA said the other day that we are in as much risk \nfrom a terrorist act as we were the day before September 11. If that is \nthe case, then we ought to expect that all law enforcement officials \naround this country would have access to that terrorist watch list.\n  Let me go now to the second issue. I just spoke of the need for law \nenforcement to have access to a list of known terrorists and those who \nassociate with known terrorists for purposes of protecting this \ncountry.\n  Well, one can certainly go to the other extreme in gathering \ninformation in the name of homeland security. And a good example of \nthat is a project that is being developed in the Department of Defense, \nby the Information Awareness Office.\n  The Information Awareness Office is developing a long-term plan for \nwhat is called data mining. A master plan would be developed by which \nall of the information that moves around electronically in our \ncountry--every purchase you make with a credit card, every magazine \nsubscription you buy, every medical prescription you fill, every Web \nsite you visit, every e-mail you send or receive, every academic grade \nyou ever received, every bank deposit you made, every trip you book - \nwould go into a massive database. And the Federal Government would use \nthe database to identify suspicious behavior.\n  That is not what we ought to be doing in this country. We ought to \nhave a war on terrorism. But we ought not, in our zeal to engage in \nthis war on terrorism, in any way break down the basic civil liberties \nthat exist in our Constitution. The right to privacy is one of the most \nbasic rights in America--the right to expect there is not a Big Brother \nwith a massive computer system gathering all the information about \neverything everyone is doing in this country and evaluating it, \nperusing it, and moving it back and forth to try to determine who might \nor might not be doing something maybe suspicious.\n  That is not, in my judgment, in concert with the basic civil \nliberties that we expect in this country and that are guaranteed to the \ncitizens in this country. We must stop this before it starts.\n  I understand that a change in law--specifically a change in the 1974 \nPrivacy Act--would be required to implement this data mining program. \nThat, in my judgment, is not going to happen in the Congress. I would \nnot support such a change, and I think most of my colleagues would \noppose a change of that type.\n\n  (Mrs. MURRAY assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator says he is confident that the Congress will do \nno such thing? I say most respectfully to the Senator, I would not \ncount on what the next Congress might do. I am very much afraid of what \nthe next Congress might do in many areas. Doesn't the Senator share \nthat feeling?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, I happen to----\n  Mr. BYRD. I say, Congress normally would not do that. But I am not \ntoo sure what the next Congress might do.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I understand the concern expressed by my \ncolleague. Let me say, there is a great disinfectant in this country, \nand that disinfectant is sunlight. If we can shed some light on these \nkinds of proposals, I do not think there is any question the American \npeople will demand--will demand--of this Congress to preserve the basic \nrights, and especially the basic right to privacy that exists and that \nthey expect to continue in the life of this country.\n  So I understand the point that the Senator from West Virginia makes, \nbut I believe the more we disclose the efforts of those who would \nsuggest that it is all right to snoop about everybody and everything \nthat goes on in this country, the more we will expose, in my judgment, \nthe great, great concern and anger of the American people to demand \ntheir right to privacy and demand that we not amend the 1974 Privacy \nAct in order to accommodate this kind of activity.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Of course I will yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am not going to detain the Senator. My colleague here \nwishes to get the floor, and I am not going to detain him, but I still \nhave to say that I am surprised at some of the things we do here.\n  The distinguished Senator from North Dakota is one of the brightest \nSenators I have ever seen over my good many years in this institution. \nBut let's take the war, the resolution on a war with Iraq. I took the \nposition that if we are, indeed--I was against that resolution, but I \nsaid, if, indeed, we are going to shift this kind of power to the \nPresident, a power to declare war, then\n\n[[Page S11278]]\n\nshouldn't we put a sunset provision in, shouldn't we stop that, at \nleast give him 2 years, and then say that we have to take another look \nat that?\n  Was the Senator surprised, as I was, to see this very body--and even \nmore surprisingly to see our own party--oppose that provision, a sunset \nprovision, when the Constitution says Congress shall have the power to \ndeclare war, and we were shifting that power to the Chief Executive to \ndetermine how and when our military forces would be used, for how long \nand where? And he has that power in perpetuity. The next President \nafter him will have that same power.\n  I was surprised. I am surprised to see where this Senate, which has \nbeen the great protector of the American people and the constitutional \nsystem for over 200 years, is going of late. I have been very bitterly \ndisappointed in this Senate, of which I am a part, to see where it is \ngoing. It seems to have lost its nerve, lost its way, lost its vision, \nlost its understanding of its role under the Constitution.\n  Well, I thank the Senator and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, let me conclude by saying, I understand \nthe angst and the concern expressed by my colleague.\n  After September 11, a day that this country experienced a terrible, \nterrible tragedy--we have come together and we have worked together to \ntry to protect our homeland. But there have also been, in this period, \ninstances where we have gone overboard. We should not sacrifice privacy \nrights in the name of homeland security. We need to find an appropriate \nbalance between the two.\n  There is much we can do, and much we should do, and much we will do, \nin my judgment, to improve law enforcement capabilities, but we can do \nthat without injuring the American people, without diminishing the \nright to privacy.\n  I understand the point that the Senator from West Virginia makes. But \nmy point is, if someone is creating an office with the expectation that \nCongress will amend the 1974 Privacy Act so that the Federal Government \ncan track where you shopped, where you spent money, where you traveled, \nwhat airline you ride on, how much you owe, what kinds of grades you \nreceived--if someone thinks that the Congress is going to allow that to \nhappen, that someone is sadly mistaken.\n  I do not think Congress is going to allow that to happen. I am not \ngoing to allow that to happen. My colleague from Florida spoke on the \nfloor earlier today and it prompted me to want to come to say, as one \nMember of the Senate, I think there will be many of us who come to the \nfloor of the Senate and say, this isn't something that will be allowed. \nThis is not something that Congress will entertain in any serious way. \nThe right to privacy is critical. It is important. And we must respect \nit.\n  So I spoke about two things: One is the need for law enforcement \nofficials around the country to access the State Department terrorist \nwatch list. That is important, and it is necessary. I also spoke about \nthe prospect of gathering raw data about everybody in the country, \nabout everything they do, to identify ``suspicious'' behavior. That is \ndangerous, and we ought not to consider it.\n  Madam President, others want to speak. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                The Children's Health Insurance Program\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I rise today to ask unanimous \nconsent for a bill which has been hotlined on our side and which \nrelates to improved protection for children under the Children's Health \nInsurance Program. And it is not a bill which I will hand to the clerk \nat the time that I have completed my remarks, nor will I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be printed in the Record, although it is ready and \nbeing hotlined, because we want to try to resolve a few remaining \nproblems from several States on our side, which I do not think we are \ngoing to be able to do. We have tried in every way to do it.\n  Fundamentally, the Senator from West Virginia is on his feet trying \nto convince those States, whether they are here or not, whether their \nstaff members perhaps are, not to try and do what has happened so often \nbefore under the Children's Health Insurance Program, and that is a \nState at the last moment using the leverage of the final seconds of \nCongress to try to leverage a better deal for itself.\n  The House is coming back to pass homeland security. There was one \nobjection made on that side in the House. That person is being worked \nwith at this time. If that objection is not raised and there is not an \nobjection raised here, then the Children's Health Insurance Program \ncould get funding for another 2 years. If not, funds will be returned \nto the Federal Government. Children will not get health insurance, and \nthere will be a very dramatic effect which this Senator does not want \nto see happen.\n  This bill, which I will not ask unanimous consent to report, is very \nmuch bipartisan. It has been worked on for a very long period of time. \nIt started back in 1992, something of that sort. It had a slow \nevolution because Senator John Chafee and myself wanted very much for \nthe bill to be done under Medicaid. The Governors struggled strenuously \nto have the entire matter handled on a State-by-State basis, which was \nin effect a mistake because it meant some States that were very \naggressive picked it up, and in others that were not so aggressive--my \nown being one of those--it took a number of years for the program to \nget going. That was lost time, lost health care for children.\n  It is very much a bipartisan, bicameral agreement that we believe is \nin the best interests of our constituents and that we can do it on the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program this year.\n  The budget situation clearly is going to get a lot worse, starting in \nJanuary. We need to protect the CHIPS funds before they are spent on \nother matters, as indeed they will be because, as I indicated, the \nmoney will be returned to the Federal Government. Don't expect that to \ncome back into children's health insurance.\n  It is my understanding there are a number of Senators who have \nexpressed concern and have stated their intention to hold up this bill \nin an effort to get the best possible outcome for their State. I do \nunderstand that. I have been through that a number of times even this \nyear with individual States, now two or three States, one or two \nStates, where they are trying to use a formula, which has been worked \nout, which applies to all States equally, to increase that formula to \nallow them to do other things which are outside of the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program is obviously larger than any \none State. My State does not get what it needs. There are only 20,000 \nchildren on a regular basis who are covered, although 55 have come in \nand out of that program, but I cannot say in all conscience that 55 are \ncovered. The Children's Health Insurance Program is in a situation that \nif we do not act now, this money will be lost from the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program for good.\n  It will happen. We have a new administration, new priorities, new \nbudget, and the same OMB director who has very firm views about this.\n  This is not, however, a permanent solution. I am trying to stanch the \ndrain, the bleeding for these next 2 years. I am trying my level best \nto do that.\n  This bill actually has a chance to pass in the Senate and in the \nHouse and to be taken up and passed in its entirety. I only ask with \nall of my heart that Senators give it a chance, that Senators not try \nto leverage the last possible variety or program outside of the CHIP \nprogram or extension of or some particular addition which will bring \ndown, in fact, if an objection at this very late stage, with a day or \nso remaining, which will obviously work, is held. If that objection is \nheld, then there will be no bill at all.\n  Earlier this year I worked in a bipartisan manner to develop a very \ncomprehensive proposal based on a basic and fundamental philosophy that \nno child should go without needed health care. I was pleased at the \ntime to be joined by my good friend Senator Lincoln Chafee, Senator \nKennedy, and Senator Hatch to introduce the\n\n[[Page S11279]]\n\nChildren's Health Insurance Improvement and Protection Act of 2002. \nUnfortunately, no action has been taken on that proposal, and I am left \nworrying that we will end this session in a day or two having forgotten \nour children.\n  Therefore, I am introducing a proposal that will at least protect the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program for the next 2 years. This is not a \npermanent solution. This can change. But it is a solution for the next \n2 years so money does not have to be returned. Children will be left \nbehind.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program, as the Presiding Officer \nknows very well, has been an unqualified success. It has been an \namazing success. Last year 4.6 million children across America were \nenrolled in the Children's Health Insurance Program and the percentage \nof children without health insurance has declined in recent years by \nreason of the Children's Health Insurance Program. In my State of West \nVirginia, the CHIP program provides health coverage on a permanent \nbasis to over 20,000. And, of course, it needs to do much better than \nthat. As I indicated, we were slow in starting a number of years ago. \nWe have picked up our pace more recently.\n  Health insurance coverage is key to assuring children's access to all \nkinds of health care. I need not go into this. Uninsured children who \nare injured are 30 percent less likely than insured children to receive \nmedical treatment, 3 times more likely not to get a needed \nprescription. Health outcomes are affected in all respects. As children \ndo eventually become adults, they carry with them the legacy of what \nthey didn't get as children in the way of health insurance.\n  However, the continued success of the CHIP program is now, as I have \nindicated--I hope soberly enough--in very serious jeopardy. On \nSeptember 30 of this year, $1.2 billion in unspent children's health \ninsurance funds was sent back to the General Treasury. It is gone. In \naddition, some $1.5 billion of these funds are projected to revert back \nto the Treasury next September 30. If we do not act to protect this \nmoney for children and send money to the States that can in fact use \nit, we will have failed our children.\n  A 2-year fix is only a first step. There is much more that we need to \ndo. The Bush administration projects that 900,000 children will lose \ntheir health insurance coverage between fiscal years 2003 and 2006 if \nwe do not take action this year.\n  The bill I am discussing, that I hope will not be blocked by any \nindividual Member, is tremendously important. It is called the CHIP \nDip. Federal CHIP funding has dropped by more than $1 billion this \nyear, and this reduction has no underlying health policy justification \nwhatsoever. I cannot honestly imagine that with so many children at \nstake in so many different States, that one would look at the last \nmoment to leverage a particular advantage.\n  I have been through this before even this year with a Senator from \nanother State. And in formulas, there are various ways, technical ways, \nof things happening. Those can be brought up in a very careful and \neffective way at the last moment, and people can dig in their heels. \nBut I beg Senators to look at the overall results for our children.\n\n  If we do not get this bill, it will affect the next 2 years. All of \nthis, I might say, resulted in something that took place during the \nbudget compromises that we had in 1997. These programs all have sort of \nobscure beginnings, but there are very large consequences.\n  As a result, a number of States will have insufficient Federal \nfunding to sustain their enrollment. They just won't have that money. \nThey will have no choice but to scale back or limit their Children's \nHealth Insurance Programs. I cannot imagine anything worse.\n  We have talked about judges this afternoon while I was presiding. We \ntalked about homeland security. I am talking about children's health \ninsurance. I would not put that second to either of the previous two \ndiscussions. I care passionately about it. I remember precisely when \nthe Senate got together and asked all the staff to leave, and 20 of us \nwith very different points of view sat around a number of years ago and \nwe worked out a children's health insurance budget, which passed very \neasily. Some people had never talked about health insurance at all, and \nwe said this cannot do for children. It passed and it has been moving \nalong ever since.\n  The biggest problem will result in enrollment cuts in the CHIP \nProgram and the future health problems, as I indicated, of adults who, \nas children, could have received benefits under the CHIP Program but \nwho did not because we were unable to take action, or the program was \nfundamentally insufficient.\n  We are trying to do the best we can. I am introducing this concept of \nthe bill. It is being hotlined on our side. It has not been hotlined on \nthe Republican side yet.\n  Again, it is only a first step that we need to take. We need a \ncomprehensive and reasonable approach to shore up CHIP financing and \navert a devastating enrollment. I cannot think of anything more \nimportant that we can do as a nation.\n  I conclude by saying we need to put more money into this program. \nHowever, this legislation--at least for the short period--will protect \n$1.2 billion that should be spent on children's health insurance rather \nthan on roads or other matters, and will put money into States that can \nuse it now to cover children. It is the least we can do.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I urge my \ncolleagues on the other side to support it in the last days when it is \nhotlined on their side of the aisle. I urge my colleagues on this side \nof the aisle to support it for the protection of 4.6 million children \nacross America and giving us a chance to do more.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I see two of my distinguished colleagues \non the floor of the Senate who want to speak. At this moment, I am in \nno great hurry to get away. I am happy to accommodate both of them.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I may yield to either Senator Specter or \nSenator Frist--Senator Frist first. How much time would the Senator \nlike?\n  Mr. FRIST. Less than 15 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would like 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. For not to exceed 25 minutes--15 and 10--and that I then \nregain my right to the floor, even though I may walk away from the \nfloor in the meantime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank our distinguished President pro tempore for \naccommodating our schedules.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business, if that is necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Homeland Security\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I rise to address a homeland security \nissue that we will be voting on tomorrow morning. Specifically, I would \nlike to discuss the Lieberman amendment. This amendment strips out \ncertain provisions which Senator Lieberman and other proponents of the \nprovision believe are unrelated to the underlying homeland security \nbill.\n  More specifically, I want to address the issue of vaccines. There are \nthree claims that have been made by the proponents of the Lieberman \namendment, as they relate to the vaccine provisions. For my colleagues \nwho were not on the floor Friday, I refer them to some of my underlying \ncomments on the policy of the homeland security bill and the vaccine \nprovisions which I mentioned on the floor Friday.\n  This afternoon, what I would like to do specifically is examine these \nthree claims. First, the proponents of the Lieberman bill say that the \nunderlying vaccine provisions in the bill remove individual rights to \nsue. Their second claim is that Thimerosal, contained in vaccines, \ncauses autism. The third claim I would like to refute is that these \nvaccine provisions do not belong in the homeland security bill.\n  Claim No. 1: The proponents of the Lieberman amendment say the \nvaccine provisions remove individual rights to sue. They are saying \nthese provisions are an example of Republicans fronting for special \ninterests; that they take away individual rights to sue and provide \nlegal immunity from liability for vaccine makers.\n\n[[Page S11280]]\n\n  My response is that these provisions do nothing more than require \ninjuries that are related, or allegedly related, to a vaccine to first \nproceed through the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VIC program). \nThe VIC program was very specifically established in the mid-1980s for \nall injuries that are allegedly related to a vaccine.\n  Since the mid-1980s, all such injuries alleged to be caused by a \nvaccine are collected and channeled quickly and appropriately first \nthrough this Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. A no-fault, efficient \nalternative to our tort system; very quickly.\n  That requirement is law today. The provisions that are in the \nunderlying homeland security bill simply restate and clarify what that \nlaw is and what that law does. If there is an alleged vaccine-related \ninjury, you first go to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. After \na period of time, whether or not the program decides in your favor, \nwhether or not there is what you regard as adequate compensation, at \nthe end of that program, you can simply state that you still want to go \nto court. Whatever that program decides, you are free to go to court. \nYou are free to sue, and there are no caps in terms of liability.\n  The provisions in this bill take away no one's right to sue. The \nprovisions in the underlying homeland security bill provide no immunity \nfrom liability.\n  A little perspective: There are currently about 875 cases alleging \ninjury due to the presence of a preservative called Thimerosal that is \nno longer used in vaccines. Right now, these 875 cases are in front of \nthe Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, consistent with the law since \nthe 1980s. These cases are in no way affected by the provisions in the \nhomeland security bill. I want to repeat that. These 875 cases that are \nin the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program are being dealt with in an \norderly process that was outlined several months ago, and they are in \nno way affected by the provisions in the underlying bill.\n  If individuals are unsatisfied with what the Vaccine Injury \nCompensation Program decides, at the end of it, you can say: Forget \nwhat you have concluded from me; I am going straight to court. Anyone \ncan do that today, and one can still do that with the provisions of \nthis bill.\n  The only people who are really affected by the language in this \nunderlying homeland security bill are the trial lawyers who are trying \nto circumvent the very law this body passed in the mid-1980s--a law \nwhich has worked very well since that point in time. The trial lawyers \nbasically are trying to create a loophole in the current law.\n  The provisions in the underlying homeland security bill state very \nsimply that you first go to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, \nand for good reason. After which, you can still go to court and sue \nwith no caps or no limits.\n  Claim No. 2--and this one probably bothers me as much as any because \nit is twisting medical science. I am not sure exactly what the reasons \nare, but this claim is Thimerosal-containing vaccines cause autism. \nAdditionally, proponents claim that Thimerosal as an additive in a \nvaccine has a causal relationship to the autism, a disease with \nincreasing incidence. The incidence of autism is increasing. We do not \nknow why, and that is why it is important for us to conduct the \nappropriate research.\n  There has been a lot of misrepresentation about the various vaccine \nprovisions in the bill, but this one really irks me the most. It is \ngrandstanding which crosses the line because it is not what science \nsays. It is not what the medical community says. It is not what medical \nscience in the broadest sense says. In fact, it is the exact opposite \nof what the Institute of Medicine has said.\n  Last week on the floor one of my colleagues said these provisions in \nthe underlying homeland security bill--saying why they must be \nstricken--said specifically:\n\n       Liability protection for pharmaceutical companies that \n     actually make mercury-based vaccine preservatives that \n     actually have caused autism in children. . . .\n\n  That is scientifically wrong. Science does not validate it. Let me \ntell you what science says. I quote the October 2001 Institute of \nMedicine record. The report is called ``Thimerosal-Containing Vaccines \nand Neurodevelopmental Disorders.'' That report concluded:\n\n       The hypothesis that Thimerosal exposure through the \n     recommended childhood immunization schedule has caused \n     neurodevelopmental disorders is not supported by clinical or \n     experimental evidence.\n\n  The argument that is being used in support of the Lieberman amendment \nas the reason to support stripping these provisions is based on a false \npremise, a totally false premise, according to medical science today. \nWhat bothers me about it, and the reason this bothers me more than any \nof the other three claims, is probably because it scares parents. It \nsays vaccines are going to hurt your children, and that demagoguery is \ngoing to mean these parents are not going to let their children get \nthese childhood vaccines. These vaccines fight diseases that have \ncaused pandemics and epidemics, diseases that will kill children if we \ndo not make the vaccines available. Epidemics will occur, and death \nwill ensue.\n  I challenge my colleagues to go to the American Academy of Pediatrics \nand to the Institute of Medicine and ask that question: Does \nThimerosal, according to the scientific literature, cause autism? The \nanswer is no.\n  A number of the people on the floor have also held up a New York \nTimes magazine article quoting it as further proof that the \npreservative Thimerosal causes autism. I do not want to spend a lot of \ntime on it, but I do want to read what the people who are quoted in the \narticle are saying.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Institute for Vaccine Safety, Johns Hopkins University, \n           Bloomberg School of Public Health,\n                                                November 11, 2002.\n     Proposed title: Misleading the public about autism and \n         vaccines.\n\n       To the editor: The unfortunate use of a sensationalized \n     title in the article published November 10, 2002 in the New \n     York Times Magazine ``The not so crackpot autism theory: \n     reports of autism seem to be on the rise. Anxious parents \n     have targeted vaccines as the culprit. One skeptical \n     researcher thinks it's an issue worth investigating,'' \n     absolutely misrepresents my opinion on this issue. Also, the \n     caption under the photograph of me ``Neal Halsey says that \n     vaccinologists have no choice but to take the thimerosal \n     threat seriously'' is not a statement that I ever made. There \n     is no ``threat'' as thimerosal has been removed from vaccines \n     used in children. The headline, the press release issued \n     prior to publication, and the caption are inappropriate. I do \n     not (and never did) believe that any vaccine causes autism.\n       I stated to the author on at least two occasions that the \n     scientific evidence does not suggest any causal association \n     between vaccines and autism and he reaffirmed that the \n     article would reflect my opinion. Unfortunately, the title \n     implies the opposite opinion. A ``fact checker'' employed by \n     the New York Times asked me several questions and minor \n     corrections were made, but I was never shown the text of the \n     article and no questions were asked about the title that \n     implies a belief that I do not hold. It was my expectation \n     that the title would be about thimerosal and the difficult \n     decisions that were made during the past three years that \n     have resulted in the removal of thimerosal as a preservative \n     from vaccines administered to infants and young children. \n     Changes in the use of thimerosal were made by the Food and \n     Drug Administration and the vaccine industry with urging by \n     the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Public Health \n     Service in a concerted effort to make vaccines as safe as \n     possible.\n       The sensationalized title sets an inappropriate context for \n     everything in the article. Readers are led to incorrectly \n     believe that statement in the article refer to autism. I have \n     expressed concern about subtle learning disabilities from \n     exposure to mercury from environmental sources and possibly \n     from thimerosal when it was used in multiple vaccines. \n     However, this should not have been interpreted as a support \n     for theories that vaccines cause autism, a far more severe \n     and complex disorder. The studies of children exposed to \n     methylmercury from maternal fish and whale consumption and \n     the preliminary studies of children exposed to different \n     amounts of thimerosal have not revealed any increased risk of \n     autism.\n       Inappropriated reporting has contributed to public \n     misunderstanding of vaccines and other health care issues. \n     The use of deceptive title is one of the primary means that \n     newspapers have misled the public. The New York Times and \n     other newspapers need to conduct self-examinations into this \n     role in misleading the public and modify procedures \n     accordingly to help prevent future major misrepresentations \n     of scientific data and opinions. Another disserve to the \n     public comes\n\n[[Page S11281]]\n\n     when scientists become reluctant to talk with the media for \n     fear of being misquoted or misrepresented. I have already \n     spent a great deal of time correcting the misinformation in \n     the Sunday's NYT Magazine article. Naturally, the next \n     reporter from the NYT who contacts me will be met with \n     skepticism and reluctance unless changes are made to prevent \n     recurrences of this debacles.\n       Apparently, editors, not authors, write most titles. To \n     avoid misinterpretations authors should propose titles and \n     assume responsibility for making certain that titles do not \n     misrepresent the opinions of individuals or information \n     presented in the article. Proposed titles and subtitles \n     should be included in the review by ``fact checkers''' when \n     interviewing people whose opinions are included in the title. \n     The best way to avoid these problems would be to permit \n     individuals referred to in articles an opportunity to read a \n     draft of the text before it is to late to correct mistakes or \n     misunderstandings.\n       The New York Times and other newspapers and magazines \n     should have policies requiring authors, editors and fact \n     checkers to disclose personal associations with issues \n     covered in articles they are involved in preparing and they \n     should be relieved from their responsibility for articles \n     where they have personal issues or conflicts of interest.\n       The general public and parents of children with autism have \n     been misled by the title of this article and the news \n     release. This is a disservice to the public and the value of \n     my opinion has been diminished in the eyes of physicians, \n     scientists, and informed members of the public. I encourage \n     interested readers to review my scientific publications and \n     to read objective reviews of this and under other vaccine \n     safety issues conducted by the Institute of Medicine \n     (www.iom. edu).\n                                                Neal Halsey, M.D.,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n         Department of Pediatrics, Duke University School of \n           Medicine,\n                                                       Durham, NC.\n     Subject: Thimerosal issue.\n\n       To the Editor: As one of the two authors of the July 7, \n     joint PHS/AAP 1999 statement that you cite in your article on \n     ``The Not-So-Crackpot Autism Theory'' it is appropriate that \n     several misconceptions in your article be rectified. The EPA \n     guidelines on mercury levels related to methyl mercury, a \n     very different compound from ethyl mercury which is the \n     metabolite of thimerosal. Three other guidelines issued by \n     federal and World Health Organization agencies were not \n     exceeded by the vaccine levels.\n       Nevertheless we chose to recommend the removal of \n     thimerosal, not because there was any evidence of its \n     toxicity to vaccine recipients, but to enhance public \n     confidence in vaccines. To the credit of the pharmaceutical \n     industry, within 1 year all vaccines for children were free \n     of thimerosal.\n       The only possible exception is influenza virus vaccine \n     which is not recommended for children less than 6 months of \n     age and for which a newly licensed product is now available \n     free of thimerosal. Despite the absence of thimerosal from \n     these products over the past two years, there has been no \n     decrease, in fact an alleged increase, in the incidence of \n     autism among our childhood population--strongly suggesting \n     other factors involved in its etiology. Regrettably this \n     exemplifies another issue where the best-intentioned actions \n     have served to benefit no one other than the liability \n     lawyers who feed on events of this sort as sharks in bloodied \n     waters.\n           Yours sincerely,\n\n                                           Samuel L. Katz, MD,\n\n                                      Wilburt C. Davison Professor\n                                            and Chairman Emeritus.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I will quote a couple paragraphs from \neach.\n  The first is from Dr. Neal Halsey, who is profiled in the article in \nthe New York Times and who is characterized as being concerned about \nthe Thimerosal threat. Dr. Halsey heads up the Johns Hopkins University \nInstitute for Vaccine Safety, and he wrote saying that this story\n\n       absolutely misrepresents my opinion on this issue. . . \n     .There is no ``threat'' as thimerosal has been removed from \n     vaccines used in children. The headline, the press release \n     issued prior to publication, and the caption are \n     inappropriate. I do not (and never did) believe that any \n     vaccine causes autism.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       I stated to the author on at least two occasions that the \n     scientific evidence does not suggest--\n\n  Does not suggest--\n\n       any causal association between vaccines and autism and he \n     reaffirmed that the article would reflect my opinion. \n     Unfortunately, the title implies the opposite opinion.\n\n  He concludes:\n\n       The general public and parents of children with autism have \n     been misled by the title of this article and the news \n     release. . . .I encourage interested readers to review my \n     scientific publications and to read objective reviews of this \n     and other vaccine safety issues conducted by the Institute of \n     Medicine.\n\n  The second letter is from Dr. Samuel Katz, Professor and Chairman \nEmeritus at the Department of Pediatrics at the Duke University School \nof Medicine. Dr. Katz writes:\n\n       As one of the two authors of the July 7 joint PHS/AAP 1999 \n     statement that you cite in your article . . . it is \n     appropriate that several misconceptions in your article be \n     rectified. . . .we chose to recommend the removal of \n     Thimerosal, not because there was any evidence of its \n     toxicity to vaccine recipients, but to enhance public \n     confidence in vaccines. To the credit of the pharmaceutical \n     industry, within 1 year all vaccines for children were free \n     of Thimerosal.\n\n  Dr. Katz concludes:\n\n       Despite the absence of Thimerosal from these products over \n     the past two years, there has been no decrease, in fact an \n     alleged increase, in the incidence of autism among our \n     childhood population--strongly suggesting other factors \n     involved in its ideology. Regrettably, this exemplifies \n     another issue where the best-intentioned actions have served \n     to benefit no one other than the liability lawyers who feed \n     on events of this sort as sharks in bloodied waters.\n\n  The final statement is from Every Child by Two, the Rosalynn Carter-\nBetty Bumpers Campaign for Early Childhood Immunizations in a statement \nreleased today:\n\n       Most importantly, we are concerned that the Senate may be \n     inadvertently fueling fears that vaccines cause autism. In \n     fact, well-respected studies concluded that the evidence is \n     inadequate. Much research is available to support these \n     conclusions.\n\n  Madam President, the third claim--and I will be brief on the third \nclaim--we have heard on the floor from the advocates of the Lieberman \namendment, which I encourage my colleagues to oppose, is that the \nvaccine provisions do not belong in the homeland security bill. I would \nargue just to the contrary. If we do not have a stable manufacturing \nbase for vaccines, there is absolutely no way we can prepare our \ncommunities and our Nation in the event there is a biological warfare \nattack on our soil.\n  We talk a lot about smallpox, and we all know today we are \ninadequately protected because today we are inadequately vaccinated \nagainst smallpox. We cannot destroy the manufacturing base for our \nvaccines today. We started with 12 vaccine companies in this country, \ncompanies that made vaccines. In large part because of the liability \nissue, the number of companies making vaccines has decreased to four \nvaccine manufacturers in the world. Only two vaccine manufacturers are \nin this country, and at the same time, the National Institutes of \nHealth is embarking upon a new initiatives to develop a vaccine for \nbotulinum toxin, a major initiative on their part. If we vote to strike \nthese provisions, we are putting at risk our manufacturing base which \nwe absolutely must have to be a prepared Nation. Vaccine development \ncannot be ramped up quickly because manufacturing is a highly complex \nprocess. These important provisions further stabilize the vaccine \nsupply system, and thus, are key to our ability to establish \nappropriate homeland security.\n  Those are the three claims we have heard over the last 2 to 3 days. I \nencourage my colleagues to look at earlier statements on what the \nvaccine provisions are specifically.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Lieberman amendment tomorrow \nand to move forward on this important homeland security bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time remains of the 25 minutes identified by \nthe Senator from West Virginia?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                       Nomination of Dennis Shedd\n\n  Madam President, I will briefly comment on two matters: First on the \nconfirmation of Judge Shedd, and second on the pending Lieberman \namendment to the homeland security bill.\n  I support confirmation of Judge Shedd for a number of reasons. First, \nhe has been found well qualified by the American Bar Association, the \nhighest rating which can be given. I knew Judge Shedd when he served as \nchief counsel, chief of staff, to the Judiciary Committee from 1981, \nwhen I came to the Senate and started to serve on the Judiciary \nCommittee, until 1988. I believe he is a fair, equitable, and competent \njurist. I know Judge Shedd's record on the U.S. district court where he \nhas served since 1991. I asked Judge Shedd some questions, and he \nresponded in some detail.\n\n[[Page S11282]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that Judge Shedd's written response be \nincluded at the conclusion of my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. In those written comments he pointed out that in civil \ndemonstration cases he has been fair and equitable: One bench trial \nverdict of over $2 million and another over $1 million; he has employed \nboth female and African-American law clerks; and, in general, set forth \nthe specifics to show that he has not been discriminatory in his \njudicial practices. These comments have been checked out by staff and \nfound to be accurate.\n  Judge Shedd has been criticized for circumventing the authority of \nCongress under the commerce clause in a very celebrated case, United \nStates v. Brown, involving the Gun-free School Zones Act. Judge Shedd \nfound that it was constitutional and was later reversed by the Supreme \nCourt of the United States under United States v. Lopez. In brief, it \nis a complicated subject, but Lopez, the Supreme Court decision of \n1995, curtailed the authority of Congress under the commerce clause.\n  Judge Shedd has been said to have limited what Congress can do on \nStates' rights. Here is a case where he found congressional authority. \nIt was a close case. He was reversed--or later the Supreme Court \ndecided he was in error. But I think it illustrates the point that \nJudge Shedd did give latitude for congressional enactments.\n  It is my hope that Judge Shedd will not be part of the so-called \npayback theory. I did not like what happened to President Clinton's \nnominations when Republicans controlled the Senate. As the Record will \nshow, I supported Judge Roger Gregory for the Fourth Circuit. We have \nhad some of the payback consideration on the Fifth Circuit I think \nfairly stated with Judge Pickering, and I hope that will not occur with \nJudge Shedd. It is my hope we will soon have a protocol which will take \npoliticization out of judicial selections when there is a Democratic \nPresident, such as President Clinton, with a Republican Senate. Now the \nshoe is on the other foot, and we have a Republican President, \nPresident Bush, and a Senate controlled by the Democrats. We ought to \nmove away from that.\n  As the Record will show, I have supported qualified nominees \nsubmitted by President Clinton and was pleased to note that there was \nreciprocity. All 11 of Pennsylvania's district court judges have been \nconfirmed, as has Judge Brooks Smith, the one contested circuit judge.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n      Response of Judge Dennis Shedd to Senator Specter's Question\n\n       During my June 27, 2002, hearing before the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee, Senator Specter asked me if I believed \n     that the NAACP's opposition to my nomination was fair. I \n     responded that I do not think it is fair. Senator Specter \n     then asked me to provide a written answer explaining my \n     position. I trust that this will be responsive to the \n     Senator's request.\n       In lodging its opposition to me, as I understand it, the \n     NAACP has focused on a relatively small number of cases--\n     primarily employment discrimination cases--in which the \n     plaintiffs did not prevail. Relying on these cases, and \n     ignoring my complete record, the NAACP has attempted to \n     create the impression that I do not treat civil rights \n     plaintiffs fairly. However, this is a complete \n     mischaracterization of my record as a district judge, and it \n     is based on a very limited--and misleadingly selective--\n     sampling of my casework. My complete record as a district \n     judge demonstrates that the charge is not accurate.\n       I do not wish to belabor this response with a case-buy-case \n     rebuttal of the employment cases for which, to my knowledge, \n     I have been criticized. Of course, people are entitled to \n     disagree bout the outcome of a particular case depending on \n     their viewpoint. However, as an initial matter, I would note \n     that I have not been made aware of any criticism which \n     suggests that my decisions in these cases are legally \n     incorrect or improper. I do not claim to have been correct on \n     every issue that has come before me, but I can tell you that \n     I have conscientiously endeavored to be correct.\n       Moreover, contrary to the misimpression that the NAACP has \n     attempted to create, I have on many occasions denied \n     defendants' motions for summary judgment (or to dismiss) in \n     employment cases. I have done so when a magistrate judge has \n     recommended that I grant the motion, and I have done so over \n     the defendant's vigorous objection. Typically, once a \n     plaintiff defeats a summary judgment motion in this type of \n     case, the case settles, and that has happened often in my \n     cases. However, I have also had employment cases, in which I \n     denied the defendant's motion, thereafter process to verdict. \n     Further, sitting by designation with the Fourth Circuit, I \n     joined with Judge Sam Ervin in reversing a summary judgment \n     and remanding a case in order to allow the employment \n     discrimination plaintiffs to proceed to trial. I believe \n     these examples alone refute the NAACP's criticism of me.\n       As I am sure you are aware, an individual's civil rights \n     may be implicated in federal litigation in many contexts \n     outside the realm of employment discrimination. I have been \n     presented with countless cases of various types in which an \n     individual's civil rights were implicated, including (but not \n     limited to) criminal cases, voting rights cases, habeas \n     corpus cases, and cases involving allegations of governmental \n     misconduct of some type. My complete record in these types of \n     cases further reflects the fact that I do not have any type \n     of anti-civil rights bias.\n       For example, I have presided over trials in which civil \n     rights plaintiffs have won jury verdicts or gained a \n     settlement at trial. I have granted relief in at least five \n     habeas corpus cases. I ruled in favor of the plaintiff and \n     upheld the one-person/one-vote principle in a case in which \n     the plaintiff challenged the method of electing members to a \n     local school board, and I have handled a number of Voting \n     Rights Act cases in which (to my recollection) the plaintiffs \n     in each case succeeded on their claim of a violation.\n       I have always endeavored to be vigilant in ensuring the \n     protection of civil rights in criminal cases as well. I have, \n     for example, granted judgment of acquittal on numerous \n     occasions to defendants where I believed, as a matter of law, \n     that the government failed to meet its burden of proof. I \n     have also disallowed the government from using evidence at \n     trial when I thought that its use would improperly \n     disadvantage the defendant. It is also my practice during \n     trial to ensure very specifically that defendants are aware \n     of their constitutional right to testify or not to testify. \n     Similarly, it is my practice to ensure that witnesses who I \n     believe may incriminate themselves by their testimony are \n     aware of their rights, and I have appointed counsel in some \n     instances to advise these witnesses before they testify.\n       I would also note that my overall record in civil cases \n     demonstrates that I do not have any bias against plaintiffs. \n     I have, for example, awarded a bench trial verdict of over \n     $2,000,000 in one case, and over $1,000,000 in another case. \n     In addition, I have presided over jury trials which led to \n     substantial verdicts in a plaintiff's favor, and I have on at \n     least one occasion directed a verdict of liability in a \n     plaintiff's favor. I have also raised, sua sponte, the \n     propriety of the removal of cases from state court, thereby \n     setting in motion the procedure by which the plaintiffs could \n     return to their chosen forum (i.e., state court). I have also \n     assisted parties in civil cases in reaching a settlement, and \n     often this has occurred where it appeared as though the \n     plaintiff would otherwise gain no recovery.\n       Apart from my case record, I believe that my commitment to \n     ensuring fairness for all persons is exhibited by my conduct \n     in other matters. For example, I have employed female and \n     African-American law clerks. I have also actively recruited \n     and support minority and female candidates for magistrate \n     judgeships.\n       Now in my twelfth year on the district court. I have \n     handled thousands of civil and criminal cases in which I have \n     issued countless rulings, all of which are public record. \n     During this time, my concerted effort has been to ensure that \n     all litigants are treated fairly according to the law. I do \n     not approach any case, or any litigant, with any type of \n     bias, and I do not decide issues before me on anything other \n     than the pertinent law. I am gratified that I have earned a \n     reputation among lawyers in this district (as reported in the \n     Almanac of the Federal Judiciary) for being fair and \n     impartial. I believe my impartiality is reflected by the low \n     number of cases in which I have been reversed, as one could \n     reasonably expect that any type of bias on the part of a \n     district judge would manifest itself over time in appellate \n     response to judge's work.\n       I would like to point out an incident that occurred earlier \n     this year, as I believe it is akin to the current accusations \n     against me. On May 3, an article appeared in the Washington \n     Post stating, in essence, that I was insensitive to disabled \n     persons because I would not allow a blind woman to be present \n     in the courtroom during a trial over which I presided. That \n     article was printed without anyone from the newspaper \n     contacting me to verify the allegation, which I readily could \n     have refuted. However, after the article ran, I was able to \n     obtain a transcript of the trail in question, and it very \n     clearly confirmed what I already knew; I had made special \n     efforts to accommodate the woman in question, and I only \n     ordered her to leave the courtroom (as I was required to do \n     by the Federal Rules of Evidence) after the parties \n     identified her as a potential witness and requested that all \n     trial witnesses be sequestered. In other words, the woman was \n     required to leave the courtroom because she was a potential \n     witness, not because she was blind. Fortunately, when the \n     actual facts came to light, the newspaper ran another story \n     setting the record straight.\n       I mention this story not as a complaint, but as an example \n     of how a perfectly legitimate set of facts can easily be \n     misused to\n\n[[Page S11283]]\n\n     portray a false impression. I believer that this has occurred \n     in this instance, and I am very appreciative to the Committee \n     for providing me the opportunity to set the record straight \n     about my judicial career.\n       In closing, I would add a personal comment. In my life, I \n     have seen first hand the unfair and unequal treatment of \n     disadvantaged people in society. That is one reason I have \n     always cared so deeply for doing my best to treat all people \n     fairly and with respect. Those who know me would emphatically \n     agree that I have an abiding concern for fairness. I believe \n     my record as a judge underscores my dedication to his \n     principle and I will continue to show fairness and respect to \n     all in my judicial actions, as well as in my public and \n     private life.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time remains, Madam President, of the 10 \nminutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes 50 seconds.\n\n\n                           Homeland Security\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, we face a very difficult situation on \nhomeland security in a number of respects. I spoke last week about my \nconcern that there was not sufficient authority in the Secretary to \ndirect the intelligence agencies and my concern about the labor-\nmanagement provisions. I did not offer amendments because when the \nHouse of Representatives has, in effect, gone home, if we pass \namendments, there will have to be a conference and the bill will be \nbrought down.\n  I believe it is vitally important that homeland security be passed, \nthat we move ahead to put all the so-called dots on the screen, as I \nspoke at length on last week. Had all the dots been on the screen, I \nthink 9/11 might well have been prevented. I do not accept the \nassertion of CIA Director George Tenet that another 9/11 is inevitable.\n  The House-passed bill from last Wednesday, which has come over, is a \nvoluminous bill, hundreds of pages long. As we start to consider it, \nthere are seven provisions now which Senator Lieberman has sought to \nstrike: Provisions on childhood vaccines; protections for qualified \nantiterrorism technologies; the university of homeland security \nadvancement, which seems to pinpoint Texas A the extended duration \nof the advisory committee; the exemption for FACA; the airport security \nliability protections; the provision on contracting with offshore \nentities, which Senator Wellstone had added, to prohibit the Secretary \nfrom contracting with inverted domestic corporations.\n  All of these provisions, I think, require very extensive \nconsideration and analysis. I am very distressed to see them added on \nthe bill, with no hearings and no chance for consideration. Now we are \nfaced with a homeland security bill which is very heavily weighted with \nprovisions which are undesirable. It makes it difficult.\n\n  Candidly, I am not sure how I would vote on all of these provisions \nif they were presented individually. I do think that on a matter of \nthis importance, it would have been orderly procedure to have these \nprovisions submitted for hearings and consideration. It may well be \nthat by the time we add up all of the provisions, the disadvantages may \nwell outweigh the advantages of this bill on homeland security.\n  Ultimately, the need to have homeland security, to have a Secretary \nwho will be able to put all of the investigative agencies under one \numbrella, is so important that we will have to swallow hard. This is \nreally a case where it is a matter of take it or leave it on a bill \nwhich is undesirable in many aspects, but the importance of protecting \nAmerica from terrorist attacks outweighs so many of these provisions \nwhich are highly undesirable.\n  There is an old expression about not wanting to see either \nlegislation or sausage made. This homeland security bill is problemsome \nin so many respects that it is giving sausage a bad name. It goes very \nfar. However, it is so important to have a Secretary with authority on \nhomeland security to act to protect against terrorism. This bill is \nvery weighty and has undesirable aspects, and there are amendments \nwhich would have improved the bill tremendously.\n  I lodge these objections that the procedural posture really of \nlegislative blackmail, with the House having gone home, a take-it-or-\nleave-it proposition, puts this Senator in a very difficult position. \nUltimately, I think the necessity for homeland security outweighs these \ndisadvantages, but barely.\n  I again thank my colleague from West Virginia for arranging this \nsequence, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield whatever time he may wish to consume to the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, with my retaining the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia. He has been my friend for nearly 30 years, and his \nconstant courtesy is one of the reasons for it.\n  Mr. BYRD. And will be for the next 30.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                       Tribute to Emmylou Harris\n\n  Madam President, last week, at the Birchmere Music Hall in \nAlexandria, VA, there was a concert that honored one of the most \ndistinguished songwriters and singers I know, Emmylou Harris. Emmylou \nHarris was honored because of the work she has done to aid victims of \nlandmines and to help stop the scourge of landmines throughout the \nworld. In honoring her, some of the best artists of this country came \nand sang for her. They honored both her work and, of course, they \nhonored her amazing talent.\n\n  My wife Marcelle and I, and our daughter Alicia, and Emmylou's \ndaughter, mother, and friends were there to hear this. She received the \naward from the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation, the Patrick \nLeahy Humanitarian Award. I can't think of anything that gave me more \npleasure than to give it to her.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from Rolling Stone magazine \nof November 13, 2002, speaking of Emmylou being honored in Washington, \nDC, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [Rolling Stone, Nov. 13, 2002]\n\n                        Emmylou Honored in D.C.\n\n                          (By Lynne Margolis)\n\n\n     musicians, politicians praise harris for landmine charity work\n\n       When Senator Patrick J. Leahy presented singer-songwriter \n     Emmylou Harris with his namesake humanitarian award Tuesday \n     night at the Birchmere Music Hall in Alexandria, Virginia, he \n     said her work on behalf of landmine victims might have \n     touched more lives--in more important ways--than her vast \n     body of beloved music.\n       Harris, who received the award from the Vietnam Veterans of \n     America Foundation for her creation and continued support of \n     the Concerts for a Landmine Free World benefits, said it \n     merely represented how blessed she is to be able ``to give \n     something back'' in exchange for a career that brings her so \n     much joy that ``you really can't call it work.''\n       Harris seemed even more humbled than usual by the shower of \n     accolades from Leahy, VVAF president Bobby Muller and some of \n     her closest musical friends including Steve Earle, Buddy and \n     Julie Miller, Patty Griffin, Nanci Griffith, Guy Clark, \n     Rodney Crowell, John Prine and Jamie O'Hara, all of whom \n     performed at the benefit concert. Pal Mary Chapin Carpenter \n     was unable to attend because of back problems, but sent \n     flowers that adorned the stage of the intimate, 500-seat \n     venue. Most of the artists had participated in earlier \n     Landmine Free World concert tours and, like Harris, have \n     visited countries devastated by landmines that still remain \n     years after military conflicts have ended. Leahy has \n     spearheaded efforts for a global landmine ban; VVAF aids \n     civilian victims of those conflicts.\n       During a night that focused on the purest of musical \n     elements--lyrics, wooden guitars, and frequently, Harris' \n     angelic soprano soaring in harmony with her equally talented \n     friends--she gave as much praise to her fellow activists and \n     performers as they did to her.\n       ``Really what I have done has been given the opportunity to \n     reflect, or deflect, some of the light that shines on me \n     because of the nature of my work, and shine it on these \n     people, these causes, these situations,'' she said backstage.\n       ``I'm so, so grateful for the opportunity to be able to do \n     that. Because that's the only way I know to be really \n     thankful for my blessings. This is a really wonderful moment \n     for me. And I'm so grateful to all my fantastic friends who \n     made it possible.''\n       The night contained a few overtly political references or \n     anti-war proselytizing, though Prine performed ``Your Flag \n     Decal Won't Get You Into Heaven'' and his 1970 tearjerker \n     gem, ``Hello in There,'' with its reference to parents who \n     lost a son in Korea. Harris noted that her father was a World \n     War II veteran and Korean War POW, and that the show was \n     occurring one day after Veterans Day as well as the twentieth \n     anniversary of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial dedication. She \n     talked about playing at the memorial's fifteenth\n\n[[Page S11284]]\n\n     anniversary five years ago and how listening to O'Hara sing \n     his ``50,000 Names'' was ``the most cathartic experience I've \n     ever had in my career.'' As he performed the tune again, \n     sniffles could be heard in the audience. Later, at Harris' \n     request, Earle did ``a song about faith,'' the title track \n     from his new album, Jerusalem.\n       Earlier, Leahy cracked that everybody in Washington was in \n     the room except U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft, who \n     ``listens to Steve Earle all the time.'' The outspoken Earle \n     has made his anti-war and anti-death penalty views well known \n     in Washington.\n       Harris noted that ``Jerusalem'' provided a necessary note \n     of hope, adding ``we're in a very difficult time right now.'' \n     Backstage she said, ``I don't know whether [war is] \n     inevitable or not. Certainly, the world is gonna change in \n     some way pretty soon. I can't see the status quo staying the \n     same.''\n       But this was a night for positivity and humor, despite the \n     profusion of sad love songs and achingly beautiful hormonies \n     delivered on tunes such as Harris' ``Prayer in Open D'' \n     (performed by the Millers as ``Prayer in D'' because, Buddy \n     explained, ``I can't play an open D'').\n       For the encore, Harris brought out John Starling and Mike \n     Auldrige, original members of the D.C.-area bluegrass band \n     the Seldom Scene, for the Louvin Brothers' classic ``Satan's \n     Jeweled Crown,'' which she recorded on Elite Hotel.\n       The evening was probably best represented by comments \n     delivered by Leahy. ``There are people in Southeast Asia, in \n     Africa, in Central America, around the world, who are going \n     to be helped by what you have done,'' he said. ``They will \n     never know you, they'll never hear your songs, they'll never \n     know your fame. They'll never be able to do anything to help \n     you, but because you've helped them, their lives are \n     immeasurably better. And how many people in life can say \n     that?''\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield the floor, and I thank the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. The distinguished Senator from Vermont is welcome, and I \ncongratulate him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/18/senate-section/article/S11284-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11284-S11296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FAREWELL TO SENATOR ROBERT SMITH\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, last year when my beloved little dog Billy \npassed away, many people came to me to express their condolences. It \nwas like losing one of the family. My wife and I have shed many tears \nover little Billy. There is never a day that I don't pass his little \nbox of ashes that is sitting up in my bedroom, never a day that I don't \ntouch that little box and think of little Billy. He has been with us 15 \nyears.\n  We have a new dog now, one which is a very sweet little female dog. \nShe is a lap dog. She is a Shi Tzu, a dog that came out of Tibet. It \nwas bred to be a lap dog in the palace, extremely friendly, knows no \nperson is not a friend. She just smothers my wife's face with kisses--\nand mine, too. So we love her.\n  But I said to Erma the other night: Erma, if Billy could come back \ntomorrow, would he still be No. 1? And both she and I said yes; even \nthough we love this little dog, the little dog we have now, the \nfemale--she is called Trouble; I think my wife saw me coming when she \nnamed the little dog Trouble. I said to Erma, if Billy came back \ntonight, would he still be No. 1, and she said yes. And we both agreed \nthat Billy would still be No. 1.\n  Last year, when our beloved dog Billy Byrd passed away, many people \ncame to me to express their condolences. But one who really, really \ntouched me was a big, hulking Navy combat veteran who came to my office \nand showed a personal compassion in that moment of sorrow. That person \ncame to talk about the little dog that I had lost. He had read about \nthe passing of our little dog Billy. He read the story in the \nnewspaper, and he came to my office to express his sorrow.\n  Who was he? That person was the senior Senator from New Hampshire, \nMr. Robert Smith. He would make about two of me, Robert Byrd. Here he \ncame to my office, took his own busy time to come to my office. This \nwas back in April of this year. He came to my office, paid a special \nvisit to my office to tell me how sorry he was to hear about my little \ndog Billy.\n  So once again, as I have many times in my long years with which God \nhas blessed me, I came to realize that the people with whom we work \nhere in the Senate often have a personal side that we do not get to \nknow or understand in our working relationships on the Senate floor. \nOur colleagues are usually much more complex than their public persona \nwould lead one to believe and have facets to their characters that are \nnot often seen in their daily official activities.\n  But Senator Robert Smith's thoughtful expression of sympathy gave me \na better understanding and appreciation for this man who for several \nyears now has proudly represented his State in the Senate. He is on the \nArmed Services Committee with me. I have served on that committee now \nwith him these many years. Senator Smith possesses an admirable quality \nof perseverance. As a young man, he had to work his way through \ncollege. Although he was the son of a naval aviator who was killed in \ncombat during World War II, when Robert Smith was old enough, he \nenlisted in the Navy and he proudly served our country in combat in \nVietnam. He is a person who had to run for Congress three times before \nbeing elected. As a Senator, his tenacious adherence to his independent \nways eventually cost him his Senate seat.\n  He has often been portrayed as a fierce conservative, but I came to \nperceive him as the ``citizen legislator'' that he promised to be when \nhe was first elected to Congress in 1984. In his twelve years in the \nSenate, he has been a forceful advocate of the many and various causes \nin which he believes, and he has never been deterred by the labels \nothers may place on those views.\n  Bob Smith's politics is not easy to characterize, from his support \nfor a constitutional amendment to balance the budget to helping to \npreserve and protect our environment, he has defied easy labels. \nSenator Smith has also been a strong advocate for modernizing his \nstate's and the nation's infrastructure, and for that I sincerely \napplaud him. He has also tenaciously fought to gain a thorough \naccounting of American MIAs and POWs.\n  I have probably opposed Senator Smith more than I have agreed with \nhim, but I have consistently been impressed with his independence of \nspirit and thought, and his dedication to the causes in which he \nbelieves. I am confident that in his future efforts he will continue to \ndemonstrate the steadfastness, courage, and integrity that he has \nexemplified during his twelve years in this chamber. I wish him well in \nhis future endeavors.\n  I hope he will, indeed, come back and visit those who are his \ncolleagues of this date.\n\n\n                     RECONSTRUCTION OF AFGHANISTAN\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on another matter, it was just over one year \nago, on November 12, 2001, that Afghanistan's government of religious \nextremists fled Kabul. The rule of the Taliban soon collapsed in the \nrest of the country, and a new government, endorsed by the United \nNations, took shape. Despite this new government, the United States \nstill has more than 8,000 troops in Afghanistan performing a number of \nimportant missions, from tracking down al-Qaida terrorists who have \ntaken to the hills to providing security to the new Afghan President. \nIn other words, from tracking down al-Qaida terrorists, who have taken \nto the hills on the one hand, to providing security to the new Afghan \nPresident on the other hand.\n  But the situation in Afghanistan is anything but stable. Our troops \nstill face hit-and-run attacks from al-Qaida and Taliban fighters. The \nleadership of the new Afghan government has been targeted for \nassassination. Warlords that control portions of Afghanistan's \ncountryside have questionable allegiance to the central government. Two \nmillion Afghan refugees have returned to their homes in the past year, \nmany finding that their homes had been destroyed by war and their \nfields ravaged by drought.\n  But with the Administration gearing up for a new war in Iraq, \nimportant questions must be asked. What is our plan for Afghanistan? \nHow great is the risk that we will lose the peace after winning a war \nin a poor, landlocked Central Asian country? Is the potential for war \nwith Iraq shifting our attention from unfinished business in \nAfghanistan?\n  Recent press reports on the situation in Afghanistan are not \nencouraging. On November 8, the Washington Post carried an article \nwhich quotes the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Richard \nMyers, as saying that we have ``lost a little momentum'' in tracking \ndown terrorists in Afghanistan. With al Qaeda adapting to our\n\n[[Page S11285]]\n\nmilitary tactics, the report continues, the Pentagon is now debating \nwhether to emphasize reconstruction efforts at the expense of military \noperations.\n  Such a shift in mission should not be taken lightly. Unless clear \ngoals are laid out for the rehabilitation of Afghanistan and a sensible \nstrategy is enunciated to achieve those ends, our nation could find its \nfeet sinking into the quicksand that is Afghanistan.\n  I was in Afghanistan 47 years ago. I went to Afghanistan as a member \nof the subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. I saw \nenough of Afghanistan to convince me at that time that it was very \ndifficult to subjugate that country. Since then, the Soviets tried and \nfailed. Before then, the British tried and they failed. We have already \nspent over $20 billion in Afghanistan, and we still don't have Osama \nbin Laden. We are a long way from winning that war, if that is what we \nare trying to do.\n  Let us not forget our recent, tragic history with nation building, \nsuch as our attempts to pacify the chaos of Somalia in the early 1990s. \nWe should also not forget that in 1979, the Soviet Union grabbed \ncontrol of Kabul in little more than a day, but spent the next nine \nyears trying to extend its control to the rest of the country. Those \npeople are not easy to handle.\n  Today, the United States has no clear goals or sensible strategy for \nhow to work with our allies to rebuild Afghanistan. Instead of a clear \nplan of action, we hear lip service about a Marshall Plan for \nAfghanistan. Start sinking money into that bottomless pit. Such grand \npromises, if left unfulfilled, would send the wrong message to our \nallies and the Afghan people about our commitment to seeing that that \ncountry does not again become a haven for terrorists.\n  The Administration has already sent confusing messages to Congress \nabout its commitment to rebuilding Afghanistan. On August 13, 2002, the \nPresident refused to designate as emergency spending $174 million in \nhumanitarian aid for Afghanistan, which was contained in the Fiscal \nYear 2002 Supplemental Appropriations Act. By refusing to designate \nthose funds as an emergency, the President did not allow the funds to \nbe spent as Congress intended.\n  While the President refused to spend that money, he has publicly \npromised $300 million in foreign aid to Afghanistan for fiscal year \n2003. However, Congress has not received any such request. As the \ncommittee report for the Fiscal Year 2003 Foreign Operations \nAppropriations bill, as reported unanimously from the Senate \nAppropriations Committee on July 18, states:\n\n       The Committee is, therefore, perplexed that, despite calls \n     for a Marshall Plan for Afghanistan and the critical \n     importance to U.S. national security, the administration did \n     not submit a formal fiscal year 2003 budget request for \n     Afghanistan. The Committee has been informally advised that \n     the administration plans to spend approximately $98,000,000 \n     for Afghanistan in funds from the Foreign Operations, Export \n     Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act.\n\n  If the administration fails to back up its promises of aid with \nactual dollars, how are we ever going to complete our mission in \nAfghanistan? We ought to be reasonable with our promises, but once we \nmake a commitment, this nation should put our money where our mouth is.\n  It is clear that the United States must do more to focus the \ninternational community on creating a concrete plan of action for \nrebuilding Afghanistan. But the first step in creating this plan is to \nget the administration's attention off of Iraq just long enough to give \nserious consideration to the problems in Afghanistan. To that end, the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee has reported a bill to authorize \n$3.3 billion in aid for Afghanistan. This bill was passed by the Senate \nlast week.\n  While I share with the authors of the bill the great concern about \nthe potential for Afghanistan to slide back into chaos and disorder, I \nhave serious reservations about several provisions of this bill.\n  First, the bill authorizes $3.3 billion in foreign aid for \nAfghanistan with no indication of why this figure was proposed. It is \nimportant to understand that the authorization of those funds does not \nactually allow the U.S. Government to spend a single dime for \nAfghanistan. It takes an appropriations bill to spend that money. As \nChairman of the Appropriations Committee, the committee that is \nexpected to come up with the cash to fund such an authorization, I do \nnot understand how this figure of $3.3 billion was reached. I am left \nwith the impression that the bill in question authorizes these billions \nof dollars simply to send a message that rebuilding Afghanistan is an \nimportant task.\n  Second, as Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I am not sure \nwhere Congress would find the funds to fulfill the $3.3 billion \ncommitment to Afghanistan. Will the administration support cutting back \non some of our foreign aid programs in order to send money to \nAfghanistan? Or will the administration propose to increase our foreign \naid spending in order to fund this new aid package? Without the \ncooperation of the administration, it would be difficult to appropriate \nthe full amount of the funds that are authorized by this bill. As I am \nsure the sponsors of the bill would agree, the last thing we need are \nmore empty promises to help the people of Afghanistan.\n  Third, the Afghanistan aid bill contains a sense of the Congress \nprovision that encourages the President to work to expand the U.N. \npeacekeeping mission now underway in Kabul to include the whole of \nAfghanistan. Right now, the United States is not a participant in that \npeacekeeping mission. It is not clear what role our troops would have \nin such an expanded peacekeeping mission, but Congress should be \ncareful not to endorse the commitment of our soldiers to such a mission \nbefore we have an understanding of what that commitment might entail, \nsuch as how many troops might be involved, how long they might be \nthere, and what goals must be achieved before withdrawal.\n\n  Finally, while this bill pushes for more aid and more peacekeepers \nfor Afghanistan, we are still without a plan or strategy for our \ninvolvement in that country. The administration needs to work with our \nallies and the United Nations to produce an understandable strategy \nthat will address the reconstruction needs of Afghanistan, while \nsharing the costs among all countries that have an interest in the \npeace and security of that nation.\n  The future of Afghanistan is an important national security issue for \nthe United States. Discontent is being sown in Afghanistan by al-Qaida \nagents, and if order again breaks down in Afghanistan, we can bet that \nterrorists and extremists will try to take advantage of the situation. \nIf Osama bin Laden is still alive, which recent reports seem to \nindicate, I am sure that he is looking forward to the failure of U.S. \nand allied efforts to bring security and stability to Afghanistan. If \nwe are to head him off at the pass, the first thing we need to do is \nhave a clear plan of action.\n  While the President seems eager to use military force against Saddam \nHussein, I urge him first to take care of the unfinished business in \nAfghanistan. The situation is crying for his attention. The Senate has \npassed a bill to authorize funds to address the problems in \nAfghanistan, but it is up to the President to show the leadership that \nis needed to prevent the situation in that country from further \ndeterioration.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator from West Virginia yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. REID. I apologize for interrupting, but I wanted to engage the \nSenator for a brief minute on homeland security.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Let me tell you what I wanted to ask the Senator. I heard \nthe very fine statement of the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, \ntalking about all the bad things that are encompassed in the Daschle \namendment. But he finished his statement by saying: Well, but there is \nnothing else we can do. I am going to have to vote for the bill.\n  The Senator from West Virginia has served in the House of \nRepresentatives, is that not true?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I have, also. Now, the Senator is aware that the House of \nRepresentatives has not yet completed its business. They have sent \neverybody home, but the leadership is still in\n\n[[Page S11286]]\n\nplace. Does the Senator understand that?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. And they, the leadership, have the authority to pass, as we \ndo here, legislation by unanimous consent. Does the Senator understand \nthat?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. My concern here is that Members of the House of \nRepresentatives, including Dan Burton, one of the leading long-term \nHouse Members and a very conservative man from Indiana--I served with \nhim when I was there--he said, talking about the things that are in the \nDaschle amendment, of which the Senator from West Virginia is a \ncosponsor----\n  Mr. BYRD. By unanimous consent, I had asked to cosponsor the \namendment, yes.\n  Mr. REID. Chairman Burton said:\n\n       These provisions don't belong in the bill. This is not a \n     homeland security issue. This is a fairness issue.\n\n  And he goes on to say, talking about one provision; that is, the \nvaccine:\n\n       Fifteen years ago, one in every 10,000 children were \n     autistic. Today, one in every 250 children is autistic. We \n     have an epidemic on our hands. More and more parents believe \n     the autism affecting their children is relating to a vaccine \n     or a mercury preservative.\n\n  And he goes on. I say to the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, as to people talking about endangering the homeland security \nbill by voting for this amendment, does the Senator agree with me this \nis senseless? That if this amendment is as bad as Chairman Burton and \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania said, shouldn't we vote on the merits of \nthat and just have the House accept our changes? We wouldn't have to go \nto conference. Does the Senator understand that?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, the House could accept the amendment. If the Senate \nadopts the amendment, the House could accept it and there would be no \nconference.\n  Mr. REID. Wouldn't that be the best? Let's say this amendment has the \nmerits, as indicated in the statement of Congressman Burton. We have \nheard statements here on the floor for several days now about all the \nvery bad things in this homeland security amendment.\n  This is my question to the Senator from West Virginia, who has \nstudied this legislation more than anyone else: Wouldn't it seem \nappropriate and good legislation if we voted in favor of this amendment \nand sent it back to the House? That is why they arranged to come back, \nin case there would be some housekeeping they have to do. Wouldn't that \nbe the best thing to do with this large 484-page piece of legislation?\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I should think so. It would be my feeling, Mr. President, \nthat we ought to look at the amendment on its face, on its merits, and \nvote for it. If I were disposed to vote against it--there are some who \nwill--but those of us who are for it should not back away because of \nsome scare tactic that is being used by the White House to try to get \nMembers to vote against that amendment. Where is the House of \nRepresentatives supposed to be? They get paid the same salaries as we \ndo. Their job is not finished. Our job is not finished. Why shouldn't \nthey be here?\n  Over the many years I have been in the Senate, 44 years now, time and \ntime again I have seen the House pass a conference report or \nappropriations bill or something, and walk away and leave the Senate \nholding the bag. There is no reason why they should not have to come \nback, if we pass an amendment and it goes to conference. They should \ncome back and finish their work. This is an important piece of work. \nThey ought not go home on the pretext that, if this measure is passed \nby the Senate, they should not have a conference on it. Or the White \nHouse should not be spreading the scare stories.\n  If the House wants to have a conference, that's fine. If the House \ndoesn't want to have a conference and wants to accept the bill, it can, \nor it wants to accept the amendment, it can. Then that could go to the \nPresident for his veto, if he wishes.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate very much the Senator yielding.\n  I simply close by saying I really think we would be doing the \nPresident, the Congress, and the country a favor by adopting this \namendment. It would take all the talk radio out of all the bad things \nin this bill--at least many of the bad things. I repeat, I think we \nwould be doing the President a favor by passing this amendment, sending \nthis bill to the House, and then let them handle that bill accordingly.\n  I am confident that they arranged to come back, anyway, for things \nlike this. I think they probably understood it would be very difficult \nfor the Senate to accept their bill exactly as they sent it to us. So, \nagain, I appreciate the Senator yielding. I think anyone saying--as the \nSenator from Pennsylvania did, and I am paraphrasing him, not saying \nexactly what he said--that even though there were bad things in this \namendment, he saw no alternative but to go ahead and vote to get this \nthing out of here because otherwise the whole bill would come down, I \nsimply state for the record that will not happen and that is not the \ncase.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  I would only add that if the whole thing comes down, that may be for \nthe best. That may be for the best. It has a lot more wrong with that \nbill suddenly dumped upon us in the early hours of Wednesday morning. \nAs far as I am concerned, greater mischief can happen in many ways than \nhaving that bill die. As far as I am concerned, we ought to be back \nnext year and take our time and do a good job on that bill. I have \nalways been for homeland security. I was one of the first around here \nto state that we needed a Department of Homeland Security. But this \nbill that has 484 pages in it, that has been suddenly dumped upon us, \ndumped on us--as far as I am concerned, it would be no great tragedy if \nthat bill would die and we could start again next year.\n  Having that bill is not going to make the American people one whit \nmore secure--not one whit--because even if that bill is passed, the \nPresident is going to have 12 months in which to submit his plan, which \nwe know nothing about at this time. When we pass this bill, we will not \nknow anything about his plan. But under that bill the Congress \nauthorizes the President to submit his plan. That plan will \nautomatically go into effect after a certain number of months, the most \nof which would be 12 months. It will automatically go into effect.\n  We don't know today what is in his plan. He probably doesn't know yet \nwhat he intends to submit as a plan. As far as I am concerned, we are \nbuying a pig in the poke and Senators ought not vote for that bill. But \nat the very least, Senators ought to vote for this amendment because it \ndoes clean up a little bit of what is wrong with the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Republican leader.\n\n\n                     Tribute To Senator Phil Gramm\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, it is a pleasure and a privilege for all \nof us to serve in the Senate. One of the great benefits of serving in \nthe Senate is we have the opportunity to serve with some outstanding \nindividuals--outstanding leaders not only in their States but \noutstanding leaders in their country.\n  One of those individuals that I will always rank as one of my \nfavorite Senators, and one of the most effective Senators I have had \nthe privilege and pleasure of serving with, is Senator Phil Gramm of \nTexas.\n  Senator Gramm was elected to and served 6 years in the House. He was \nelected in 1978. He was elected as a Democrat. Eventually he resigned \nand ran as a Republican. I think he was the first person to do that in \na century. It was a pretty phenomenal thing. Then he came to the Senate \nwhere he has served for 18 years. Much to my regret, he announced he \nwould be retiring and will soon complete his very distinguished Senate \ncareer. Seldom do you find a person who makes such a difference in \npublic policy over that period of time, as Senator Gramm has.\n  I was elected to the Senate in 1980, and I remember very well the \nGramm-Latta budget bill that passed the House of Representatives in \n1981. That was Senator Gramm, a Democrat, working with Congressman \nLatta, a Republican, to basically pass President Reagan's economic \nbudget, a phenomenal accomplishment; it laid the guidelines for \nreducing and changing taxes. The maximum tax rate actually, in 1981, \nwas 70 percent; 6 years later it was 28 percent--a phenomenal \nachievement. Some might disagree with it, but it\n\n[[Page S11287]]\n\nwas a phenomenal achievement. And it was due, in great part, to the \nleadership of Phil Gramm.\n\n  So every once in a while we have the privilege of serving with \nsomeone who can make a real difference. And Senator Gramm has done \nthat. He did it in the House. He has done it in the Senate. He has made \naccomplishments. He has made legislation. He has angered his opponents, \nbut I think in all cases, his adversaries or his opponents, while they \nmay have disagreed with him on the issue, had to respect him for his \nconviction, for his commitment, for his effectiveness. I respect that.\n  Many of us made tributes to Senator Wellstone. We regret the tragedy \nof his death. But we respected his commitment. Likewise, I can tell \nyou, I know Senator Wellstone would say he would have to respect \nSenator Phil Gramm. He did not agree with him--he agreed with him very \nlittle--but he had to respect him. One of the great things about the \nSenate is that we can disagree on issues, but we can have respect and \nadmiration for people who have convictions and commitments, and, on \noccasion, when they prove the effectiveness of that to actually change \nlaw.\n  Most of us remember the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Balanced Budget Act \nthat passed in 1985 and was basically reaffirmed in 1987. It gave us \ncaps and targets and rescissions, and so on. That is still basically \npart of our budget law today. I have had the pleasure of serving with \nSenator Gramm on the Budget Committee for many years. Serving on the \nBudget Committee is a thankless task, but he has been a leader within \nthe Budget Committee. He is a person who has believed in budgets, a \nperson who has believed in discipline, and he was able to make that \nlaw.\n  If you look at the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Service Modernization \nAct, in 1998, again, he proved he could work with Democrats and \nRepublicans to make significant revisions of law. He did that from his \nposition as chairman of the Banking Committee.\n  Today we are debating homeland security, and he is one of the \nprincipal authors of the President's homeland security bill, which I \nhope and pray we will finish tomorrow, and, again, in large part \nbecause of his leadership, and also the leadership of Senator Thompson, \nwho, regrettably, also is retiring from the Senate.\n  So we are losing some great Members who I hate to see leave. But, \nlikewise, I would just like to say it has been a pleasure and a \nprivilege to work with, in my opinion, one of the most effective, one \nof the most outstanding, Senators I have had the pleasure of knowing in \nmy Senate tenure.\n  It has been a pleasure to have Senator Gramm join me on the Senate \nfloor. He has sat right behind me for the last 18 years. He has made a \nmonumental contribution to this country and to his State of Texas.\n  I am very happy for both Senator Gramm and his lovely wife Wendy and \ntheir family. I wish them every success. I am confident they will enjoy \nevery success. Senator Gramm is an outstanding leader who has made \ninvaluable contributions to make our country better. He has made the \nState of Texas better and he has made our country better. I thank him \nvery much for his commitment, his effectiveness, and his public \nservice.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for \nhis remarks about the remarkable Phil Gramm. And I would like to \nattempt to make some comments upon his leaving us. My abilities are \ninadequate because he is, indeed, a very special American and human \nbeing.\n  Don has delineated a number of his historic achievements: with the \nbudget, with health care, with homeland security, and so many others. \nBut there are a lot of qualities about Phil that are important.\n  He has told us often, particularly after the untimely death of Paul \nCoverdell, that we should tell those we love that we love them, that we \nought not to wait. I don't know if I have said that directly to him, \nbut I love Phil Gramm. I have loved him virtually since I have come to \nthis body. He has consistently been, to me, the most principled, \ninteresting, and courageous battler for America I have ever seen. I \nhave said on many occasions, recognizing the poor grammar, that Phil \nGramm is our ``most invaluable Senator.'' By that I mean he is the one \nthis body could least do without. I truly believe that.\n  This body will be diminished by his leaving. He has been a force--a \nforce--for the best of American values. First and foremost, Phil Gramm \nhas been a champion for freedom. He has never doubted, as have many of \nhis former colleagues in the academy, the validity of the American \ndream. He has studied history, traveled widely, and read much. His \nexperience and learning have only confirmed his belief in the American \nideal of democracy, freedom, and free enterprise. He knows it works. He \nknows this has been the system that has made America the envy of the \nworld.\n  As a patriot, and in possession of this important truth, he has given \nhis total effort to preserving and extending our brilliant heritage. \nFrom the time he gets up until the time he goes to bed, he fights for \nthese great values of America. He has done so with more purity of \npurpose and depth of understanding than any I have known. Yes, he can \ncompromise, and he does on occasion, but his compromises are always \nfocused on whether or not the deal is best for America. Will it further \nfreedom? That tends to be his test.\n  First and foremost, Phil Gramm fully comprehends the greatness and \nuniqueness of America. And his life has been directed with incredible \nfidelity toward its preservation and enhancement.\n  I recall one of the great trips I have taken in the Senate. It was \nCODEL Gramm to Europe. Phil insisted we stop at Normandy and examine \nthat scene of carnage and courage. On another occasion, we visited the \nFlanders Cemetery, and Phil read us the great poem: ``On Flanders \nFields.'' We could not leave, he said, until we laid a wreath at the \nTomb of the Unknown Soldier. We also carefully examined the battlefield \nat Point du Hoc on the Normandy coast. Phil showed us, with great \npride, where the brave Texans scaled and took that great fortified \nheight at Point du Hoc, a key moment in the D-Day victory.\n  Phil Gramm, with great clarity, has seen his battles for freedom in \nthis Congress--absent, of course, the physical danger of war--in the \nsame way. He sees his role as a soldier for freedom, and that he has \nbeen. Indeed, he has been a glorious warrior for freedom.\n  Our heritage of liberty has always been endangered by hostile outside \nenemies, ignorance, corruption, and political whims of the moment \nwithin. Phil Gramm has stood in the breach and, in the same vein as his \nbeloved Texans at Normandy, he has carried the battle to the enemies of \nfreedom. Time and again, he has staked it all--put his career and his \nreputation on the line--for those ideals.\n  He has been blessed with a great partner in his glorious struggle to \nenhance the American dream--Wendy Gramm. Everyone who knows Wendy loves \nher. And so does Phil. They are an unlikely pair: the loud Phil and the \nsmall, brilliant, and soft-spoken Wendy. Surely, it could only have \nbeen a match made in Heaven. Wendy's balance, her integrity, and her \nvision for America, which she so deeply shares with Phil, make them one \nof America's great couples.\n  Thirdly, we cannot discuss his career without considering his \neffectiveness in advocacy. With an economist's ability to see the big \npicture, Phil has an unsurpassed ability to demolish small minded \nproposals. His skill in debate is legendary. I have not seen his equal \nin my tenure in this body. No one gets to the core of the matter better \nor can put the complex in layman's terms more effectively than Phil \nGramm--no one. Some are good at spin, but Phil Gramm does not spin. He \nanalyzes. He distills arguments, and he puts them to the test of \nrigorous thought. He reduces them to their simplest form and then \ndemonstrates with his powerful mind and verbal skill how such proposals \neither further or constrict the American way.\n  Phil, though quite frank and blunt, could get away with comments few \nothers could. Many of our colleagues have quoted from Phil some of his \nremarkable comments. He made a very important speech on economic \nrelations between the United Kingdom and the United States when we were \nin Europe. He expressed concern about the\n\n[[Page S11288]]\n\nUK's move toward Europe. He recognized our historic relationships \nbetween our countries, and he urged them to join NAFTA. The speech made \nheadlines all over Europe. It was a magnificent address. He knew it was \nimportant when he delivered it. He delivered it entirely without notes. \nI was very proud of him.\n  During the course of it, he noted the objections made by certain \nEuropeans to American beef, much of which comes from Texas, of course, \nbecause of their fear of growth hormones. As an aside, he noted:\n\n       Maybe you need to eat more of our beef. It could keep you \n     from giving up your sovereignty.\n\n  His ability to demolish the conceit of the left that government can \nprovide Americans more and better goods and services than the private \nsector is also unsurpassed. His advocacy for free trade is unsurpassed. \nPhil believes in the concept of truth. He respects truth, and he \nbattles to always appeal to objective truth. Thus he is not a \nspinmeister. He is a Texas straight shooter.\n  He will challenge an opponent's flawed core principles even when it \nmay not be politically correct to do so. He will not just dance around \nthe issue. He goes right to the heart of the matter, with integrity and \ncourage. A few are taken aback by his directness, but most respect his \nhonesty even if they disagree. And he has never allowed debate to ruin \nfriendships.\n  Still, Phil Gramm does not take the future of America lightly. It is \nnot just a matter of debate with him. It is not a matter of polls. He \nworks to prevail on issues important to this country's future. This is \nnot an intellectual exercise. It is in a different way as important to \nhim as our victories in the past have been on the battlefield. His \nconstant goal has been to make America better.\n  Perhaps you think I overstate the case, but I don't think so. I think \nhe is a special, glorious warrior for the American way of life. And why \nshould I not say here what I have said privately; that is, that a true \nrecording of history will list him as one of the half dozen great \nSenators of the past century. This warrior for freedom will not cease \nwhen he leaves this body. Who knows, he may do more good from the \noutside than from the inside.\n  What we do know, however, is that while he was here, his \ncontributions to America and to liberty were truly magnificent. I have \nbeen honored to know Phil Gramm and to have been his friend. I will \nmiss him. This Senate will miss him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I understand the Senator from Alabama has some other \nremarks he would like to make. I appreciate his allowing me to proceed \nbetween the remarks he just made on Senator Gramm and others he will be \nspeaking on momentarily. One of them is the person I want to commend, \nbut I can't do that without thanking Senator Sessions for what he had \nto say about Senator Phil Gramm.\n  I have had so much to say about him over the past month, I won't \nrepeat it here. I have already made some remarks on the floor and had a \nchance last week at the retirement dinner to talk about him. He \ncertainly will be greatly missed. He is such a talented, intelligent, \npersistent but delightful person. He has been a great Senator, great \nCongressman. He has a very large record of which he can be proud. I \nhave worked with him in the House when he was a Democrat, in the House \nwhen he was a Republican, and in the Senate.\n  There are a lot of bills that would not have passed, a lot of issues \nwould not have been properly handled if he had not been willing to take \nthe time, dig into the substance, and get them done. But they are great \nbills, great laws that have his name on them: Gramm-Latta, the first \nbudget of the Reagan years; and Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, which was a \nbudget restraint mechanism he put in place in the 1980s here in the \nSenate; and Gramm-Leach-Bliley, the reform bill on financial services \nthat was passed a couple years ago, and many others. But I took the \ntime recently to add up bills or issues that I knew he was involved in \njust over the last 2 years that would have been much more expensive if \nthey had passed, would have been hugely expensive. He probably has \nsaved the taxpayers over the past 2 years somewhere close to $1 \ntrillion, certainly in the hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  There might be those who say we should have spent that money. Well, \nyou can argue that, but I can show direct cases where he has helped \ninfluence legislation or stopped legislation that would have been very \ncostly to working taxpayers in America.\n  I thank Senator Sessions for what he had to say today.\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO R.J. ``DUKE'' SHORT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon before the Senate \nadjourns for the year to recognize the extraordinary contributions of \nan individual who is not a Senator but who, in addition to having been \na long time staff member here, is one of the Chamber's most beloved \nindividuals, I believe. That is R.J. ``Duke'' Short or, as Senator \nThurmond would call him, ``Duke Short,'' which is pretty hard to \nunderstand if you don't know what he is actually saying.\n  My colleagues on both sides of the aisle know well that Duke has \nserved for the past decade as chief of staff to the legendary Senator \nThurmond, who is retiring next year at the age of 100. Duke has served \nour ``centennial Senator'' with incredible ability and grace. His \njudgment, his demeanor, and his knowledge on both the ways and \ntraditions of this Chamber have impressed me. I have actually gone to \nhim and asked for advice and made sure he knew what we were thinking \nabout doing and making sure Senator Thurmond was comfortable with that.\n  I know many Senators have gone to Duke and sought his counsel as one \nof our longest serving and most effective staff members.\n  In so many ways Duke has been the Senate's unelected 101st Senator, I \nbelieve. The trust Senator Thurmond puts in him is obvious to anyone \nwho has watched the two of them interact over the years. Duke is \nStrom's most constant companion, his closest and most trusted adviser \nand, I believe, his dearest friend. Theirs is not the usual \nrelationship of a Senator and staffer. It is more like a father and \nson.\n  I know that Duke has had opportunities to go do other things, but at \nthe urging or at the request of Senator Thurmond, he stayed. And he is \ngoing to stay with Senator Thurmond to the last day the Senator is \nhere.\n  Even though they have been close on a personal basis, Duke Short has \nnot misunderstood his role or stepped beyond the boundaries into the \nrole of an elected official. He has always had a clear understanding of \nhis responsibilities and, most importantly, where his job ends and an \nelected official's begins. It takes a person of extraordinary integrity \nand incredible common sense to be able to juggle both the role and the \nresponsibilities that Duke Short has shouldered, and I can say without \nhesitation or equivocation: Well done, Duke. He should be very proud of \nhis service to the Senator, to the Senate, and to his country.\n  By the way, there is something more to his career than his service to \nSenator Thurmond and the Senate. He served in the Army's prestigious \n82nd Airborne. Then he came to the Senate as a staffer in 1974, where \nhe served as a senior investigator for the Subcommittee on Internal \nSecurity.\n  He rose quickly through the ranks, later serving as chief \ninvestigator of the full Senate Judiciary Committee where he oversaw \nliterally hundreds of judicial nominations and helped shepherd through \nthe confirmations of Chief Justices and Associate Justices who now sit \non the Supreme Court. To this day, he is remembered fondly by judges \nand justices all across the Nation as the individual with whom they \nworked most closely and who was always courteous and wise in his \ncounsel as to how they should conduct themselves during the \nconfirmation process.\n  As in his other duties in the Senate, Duke performed in the \nconfirmation arena with the greatest dignity and integrity. Many of you \nmay be surprised to know that Duke Short had a life before even his \nmilitary service and before coming to the Senate. He was a U.S. \nTreasury Department agent and received numerous awards for \ndistinguished service and assistance to our Nation's Federal, State, \nand local law enforcement officers and officials.\n  But it wasn't always the law enforcement, investigations, or \ngovernment.\n\n[[Page S11289]]\n\nHe also originally was a chiropractor. That was his original \nprofession. He is a graduate of the Palmer College of Chiropractic with \nthe degree of Doctor of Chiropractic. Maybe there was some other role \nhe performed for the Senator that we didn't know about.\n  What an interesting career this gentleman has had. He is an alumnus \nof North Georgia College and the recipient of South Carolina's most \ndistinguished civilian award--the Order of the Palmetto. He is, of \ncourse, most fortunate to be married to Dee, a charming lady whom we \nwill miss along with Duke when they go on to their next career.\n  I know my colleagues join me in wishing Duke good luck and our best \nwishes as he leaves the Senate in January at the conclusion of Senator \nThurmond's record-setting term.\n  We will miss Duke's good humor and his style. He is the epitome of a \nSouthern gentleman. He leaves this institution with a marvelous record. \nToo often we commend each other and we talk about the great deeds of \nSenators, and not enough attention is given to loyal staff members who \nserve in this body and in this room and on committee staffs and on \npersonal staffs. But Duke Short could not leave without proper \nrecognition of his service.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Republican \nleader for those comments about Duke Short. I likewise want to say \nsomething about him and didn't know that he intended to make those \nremarks.\n  Duke has been a friend of mine for 20 years. I have admired him \ngreatly. He is the kind of person who comes along and reaffirms your \nfaith in basic democracy, basic decency of the human race. After 30 \nyears of service in the Senate as a senior staff member, he will be \nleaving.\n  Our Nation--and particularly the State of South Carolina--owes Duke \nShort a great debt of gratitude for his many years of distinguished and \nable public service in the Senate. As my colleagues well know, he \nserved for many years as chief of staff to our legendary Strom \nThurmond, who retires next month at the age of 100, after more than 47 \nyears of service in this Chamber.\n  Over the years he has worked with Senator Thurmond Duke has earned a \nreputation as someone who always conducted himself with the utmost \nintegrity and honesty. Given great authority--perhaps more than almost \nany other staff member in the Senate--he always dedicated himself to \nthe highest principles of public service and demonstrated an \nuncompromising devotion to his mentor and boss, Strom Thurmond.\n  There is, among the world's cynics, a belief that the longer men and \nwomen remain in positions of public trust, the more they fall victim to \nthe vagaries of power and influence. Duke Short stands as a wonderful \nexception to that rule, an example of truly unselfish public service, \nwhether as a Federal agent or in the Army, a man who dedicated his life \nto things bigger than himself and found, in turn, enormous satisfaction \nin the giving.\n\n  In his years in the Senate--at least the ones I have been privileged \nto witness--Duke Short has earned more than just satisfaction from a \njob well done. He has earned, I believe, the respect, admiration, and \nfriendship of every Senator in this body. In so many ways, he was one \nof us--a Member of the Senate family who never forgot that the only \nreal power in politics is that which we hold from the public, and his \nonly reason for service was to serve his Senator.\n  Duke came to the U.S. Senate in 1974 as a senior committee \ninvestigator. It was the beginning of a long and extraordinary \npartnership between him and Senator Thurmond. When Strom became \nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1980, Duke was appointed \nchief investigator and, in that capacity, he oversaw and coordinated \nthe confirmation of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Associate Justices \nO'Connor, Scalia, Souter, Kennedy, and Thomas. He became the Senator's \nchief of staff nearly a decade ago and has served in that capacity ever \nsince. All of us came to rely on Duke's judgment, his unerring sense of \nfair play and, of course, his uncanny ability to always represent the \nwishes of his boss, Senator Thurmond.\n  Prior to coming to the Senate, Duke served the Nation in other \nimportant ways. He was a member of the Army's prestigious 82nd Airborne \nDivision and a respected U.S. Treasury Department agent. His \ncontributions to law enforcement are legend within South Carolina and \nthroughout the Nation. He has been a recipient of numerous national, \nregional, and State awards from law enforcement associations, and he \nwas presented in 1990 with the State of South Carolina's highest \ncivilian award, the Order of Palmetto.\n  When Senator Thurmond was chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, Duke served as a close adviser on a wide range of issues \nfrom preparedness to nuclear arms control. Once again, he earned the \nrespect of the Nation's highest officers and service chiefs, in \naddition to Cabinet members and the national security staffs of several \nPresidents.\n  Duke Short is one of those rare staff members whose expertise and \njudgment are called upon in a variety of settings. Through it all, he \nalso demonstrated more than just a vast technical knowledge of \ndifferent issues; he impressed us all with his deep and abiding love of \nand respect for the institutions of the Senate, as well as the vital \nimportance of the legislative oversight process.\n  In all these arenas, Duke Short distinguished himself as an \nindividual of rare humility. Working closely with Presidents, Cabinet \nmembers, Senators, Justices of the Supreme Court, and even foreign \nleaders, Duke's style always managed to disarm, to respectfully inform \nand, taking a page out of Strom Thurmond's book, to politely and \ndiplomatically move situations to where the people of South Carolina \nbenefited most.\n  Finally, Duke is fortunate in one other area. He is married to an \nexceptional lady, Dee, who is truly the apple of his eye and one of the \ngreat inspirations of his life. Duke and Dee Short have always managed \nto light up any social and business event they attended.\n  Mr. President, the Senate will miss Duke Short's leadership, but \nindividually I believe each of us will miss our friend, Duke Short. In \nan era of increasing rancor and incivility in public life, Duke Short's \neasygoing manner, his lighthearted humor and unswerving loyalty to \ncountry and friends will be sorely missed.\n  On behalf of a grateful Senate, thank you, Duke, for your good work \nand good will. May God continue to bless you and your fine family.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, for the past several decades, serving one \nof the United States Senate's most legendary figures--Senator Strom \nThurmond of South Carolina--has been Robert J. Short. I rise today to \npay tribute to the man we in the Senate fondly know as ``Duke Short.''\n  Duke is to be commended for his fine work and years of dedication to \nour Country. When I first arrived in Washington, DC., in January of \n1977, Senator Thurmond was my senior on the Senate Judiciary Committee. \nAs I settled in to my new role on the Judiciary Committee, I came to \nknow and respect Duke, a bright and eager individual who was working at \nthe time as Chief Investigator on the Committee.\n  Duke had first come to work in the Senate in 1974, and until 1976, he \nserved as a Senior Investigator on the Senate Subcommittee on Internal \nSecurity. From 1976-1989, he was the Chief Investigator on the Senate \nCommittee on the Judiciary. He has served as Chief of Staff and \nAdministrative Assistant to President Pro Tempore Emeritus Senator \nStrom Thurmond since 1989.\n  Throughout the course of Duke's work in the Senate, he has assisted \nin the confirmations of literally hundreds of district and circuit \ncourt nominees, and of every sitting Supreme Court Justice. He played a \nkey role in assisting the Judiciary Committee in its inquiry in the \n1960's into motorcycle gang violence, as well as many other important \nmatters. He has developed a remarkable wealth of knowledge about the \nSenate as an institution, and is widely respected by Senators past and \npresent on both sides of the aisle.\n  Duke has been recognized throughout his distinguished career with \nmany prestigious awards, too numerable to mention here, but most \nrecently including a Reserve Officers Association\n\n[[Page S11290]]\n\nAppreciation Award in 2000, an FBI Director's Appreciation Award and \nthe Order of the Palmetto--the State of South Carolina's highest award, \nin 2001. This year, Duke received the ACA's Third Annual Patients' \nChampion Award.\n  Duke's career has been characterized by service to our great Country, \nnot only in his work for the Senate for nearly thirty years, but in his \nearlier service in the U.S. Army with the 82nd Airborne Division, and \nas a special agent in the Intelligence Division of the Department of \nthe Treasury.\n  Duke Short has served Senator Thurmond, South Carolinians, and his \ncountry well, with the spirit and endless dedication of a true patriot. \nWe will sorely miss him in the United States Senate and wish him all \nthe best in his retirement.\n\n\n                       Tribute to Strom Thurmond\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will now take the opportunity to pay \ntribute to the senior Senator from South Carolina, the Honorable Strom \nThurmond. \n  The accomplishments of this man in his nearly 100 years of life, are \ntruly amazing. All of his continuous years of public service to our \ncountry illustrate that Senator Thurmond's life has put the service of \nhis country first. Born on December 5, 1902, in Edgefield, SC, he \ngraduated from Clemson College, now Clemson University, in 1923. He \nstudied law under his father.\n  For 8 years, he served as the town attorney, and he also served as a \nSouth Carolina State senator.\n  A true patriot, he joined the U.S. Army Reserve as a second \nlieutenant in 1924. He landed in Normandy on D-Day with the 82nd \nAirborne Division during World War II. He had been a judge. He was in \nhis forties. They did not really want him to join the Army at the time \nthe war broke out. He insisted that he be allowed to do so and walked \naway, as some would say, old enough to know better. But he ended up in \nGreat Britain preparing for Normandy and the invasion with the 82nd, \nand he again volunteered. He volunteered to be on the glider force that \nwould fly in behind enemy lines at the time of the D-Day invasion.\n  He got into one of those gliders. They are pulled off by bombers, and \nlet go. Hopefully the plane lands safely. He was asked one time: How \nwas the landing, Strom?\n  He said: All I can say is I didn't have to open the door; you could \nwalk out the side.\n  None of these landings were safe. It was a highly dangerous mission. \nHe volunteered in his midforties to do that. He stayed until the end of \nthe war. I asked him if he stayed to the end. He said yes, until \nGermany surrendered in combat and he was put on a train heading toward \nthe Pacific when Japan surrendered. He earned 18 decorations, medals, \nand awards, including the Legion of Merit with oak leaf cluster, Bronze \nStar for Valor, and the Purple Heart, among others.\n  His political career flourished when he was elected Governor. In \n1948, he decided to run for President of the United States as a States \nrights candidate. He carried four States and received 39 electoral \nvotes, the largest independent electoral vote in U.S. history.\n  However, the most memorable moment, I guess, came when he was elected \nto the Senate in 1954 as a write-in candidate. In the Senate, the \nhighest office ever to be elected by a write-in, I understand, in the \nSenate, Strom Thurmond served on several committees. He has been a \nfixture on the Armed Services Committee on which I serve and where he \nhas with constancy of purpose fought for a strong America and for our \nveterans. He served as chairman of this committee from 1995 to January \nof 1999 and was bestowed the great honor of being named chairman \nemeritus in 1999. Serving with Senator Thurmond on this committee was a \ngreat learning experience.\n  I am convinced his combat experience provided him with an excellent \nbackground to understand the intricacies of our military and the need \nof this Nation to be strong and avoid war but to win it, if necessary.\n  He has helped lead our effort in this Nation to victory in the cold \nwar, to defeat and challenge head-on godless, totalitarian communism, a \nforce incompatible with American values. He never faltered. He stayed \nthe course throughout the entire cold war. He celebrated its victory.\n  He never was among those souls who waned, who blamed America first, \nwho always thought America was at fault and causing the problems in the \nworld.\n  His career was marked by determination, surely based on personal \nexperience with war, to never have our soldiers outgunned in war. This \nwas a magnificent service to our country, of historical importance, and \nin which he played a key role.\n  Additionally, I have had the pleasure to serve with Senator Thurmond \non the Judiciary Committee where he has been a member since 1967. He \nserved as chairman from 1981 to 1987 and chairman of the Subcommittee \non Constitution, Federalism, and Property Rights from January to June \nof 2001. Coming from a lineage of law study and being a former judge, \nSenator Thurmond has cherished his role on this committee and continues \nto work to promote the rule of law and assure quality judges are \nappointed to Federal courts.\n  He has been a champion of the rule of law on the Judiciary Committee \nfor 35 years. Yes, he has changed many of his views over the years. He \ncame to see segregation was wrong, that it hurt African Americans, \nwhites, and it hurt America. Still, his classical view that the law is \nsacred, that it must be followed, never wavered.\n  His leadership in passing the Federal sentencing guidelines was \nperhaps the greatest change in criminal law in the entire last century. \nIt was enacted to equalize sentencing--those who commit the same crime \nserve the same time--and it abolished parole. He was a tower of \nstrength in the battle to bring back respect for law enforcement, to \nprovide rights to crime victims, and to crack down on criminals.\n\n  As a former prosecutor, I am convinced the great battles he led in \nthe 1980s--sentencing guidelines, abolishing parole, allowing for the \ndenial of bail in certain circumstances--were historic steps that \nstimulated the strong efforts by State law enforcement to break the \nback of the surging crime rates of the sixties and seventies and \nresulted in substantial reduction in crime.\n  Longer prison sentences for repeat and dangerous criminals have saved \nthousands of innocent lives. People have not been murdered because \ndangerous criminals have been apprehended and locked up. No man gave \nmore steadfast leadership to this change than Strom Thurmond. Indeed, \nhe appointed the first chairman of the Sentencing Guideline Commission \nwho did a remarkable job, or at least he sought the appointment of \nJudge Wilkins from South Carolina.\n  One of the great memories I have of spending time with Senator \nThurmond was when he asked me, a new Senator, to accompany him on a \ntrip to China in 1997. On this trip, we had some time to climb the \nGreat Wall of China. Senator Thurmond was the oldest person ever to \nclimb the Great Wall unassisted, and it was quite a climb. His ability \nto put situations in perspective is illustrated by the fact that upon \nreaching the top of the wall, he said: This is a big wall. Let's go. Up \nearly to exercise, dining late often, as we did on the trip, he did not \nflag, leaving the rest of us in his wake.\n  Though he is nearing the century mark, his determination to fulfill \nhis service is remarkable. Just this past week, we had the elections of \nthe Republican leadership. Senator Thurmond was there at 9 a.m. for the \nelections. Then we had our lunch with the Republican Policy Committee \nwhile last-minute issues were discussed, and he attended that. That \nafternoon, the Defense authorization bill was up for debate and \npassage. He was one of the few Senators to be in the Chamber, and only \nat 15 minutes till 6, when he was sure no votes would be held that \nnight--which he asked me to confirm was accurate--did he leave. It was \na long, hard day.\n  That is typical of his commitment to service. His fierce commitment \nto America and the Senate is legendary. During his service from 1994 to \n2000 as President pro tempore of the Senate, he was consistently on \ntime every morning to open the Senate, conduct the Pledge of \nAllegiance, and introduce the Chaplain for invocation. He knew the \nimportance of his office, and he did not fail in that responsibility.\n  It has been a monumental career, a life almost larger than life. \nStrom Thurmond has set a high standard for\n\n[[Page S11291]]\n\nduty, service, and country. It has been my honor to know and serve with \nhim. He is a true southerner, a true American, and a true patriot.\n  Strom Thurmond will be forever remembered as a man who for a century \nwas a vigorous proponent of strong national defense, a sound legal \nsystem composed of judges who follow, not make, law, and justice for \nvictims of crime, and stiff punishment for wrongdoers.\n  One of his most enduring qualities, a quality that undoubtedly is a \nfactor in his longevity, is his positive view of life, his optimism, \nhis cheerfulness, and positive leadership which still are remarkable \nand continue to this day.\n  I am sure there have been times when he did not feel well, but his \nhearty greetings never changed. I have enjoyed hearing him call to me \nand say: How's the king of Alabama doing today?\n  Having watched his leadership for 6 years now in the Senate, I am \nconvinced his positive leadership and character are major factors in \nhis success.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Tribute to Senator Hutchinson\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, Senator Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas, one \nof our colleagues, will soon be leaving us. I thank him for his service \nto his State and also to our country.\n  For the last 6 years, I have had the pleasure of working with Senator \nHutchinson. He is a neighbor; he is a friend. I have gotten to know him \nvery well. He served on my whip team. He is a very energetic and \ndynamic person who I think served his State and our country very well.\n  He served in the Arkansas State House of Representatives for 8 years. \nHe served in the U.S. House for 4 years. I got to know him when he \nserved in the statehouse, and I was very impressed with him. Actually, \nhis congressional district was adjacent to that of Oklahoma. So I got \nto know him then. When he came to the Senate, I asked him if he would \nserve on my whip team, and he did. We became very good friends. He is a \nvery energetic and committed person who did an outstanding job in the \nSenate. He is also a very intelligent and diligent Member.\n  He served on the Armed Services Committee and the HELP Committee and \ndid a fantastic job. I worked with him. I was chairman of the task \nforce dealing with the Patients' Bill of Rights and then was made \nchairman of the conference on the Patients' Bill of Rights. Senator Tim \nHutchinson was there all the time, trying to pass a good and affordable \nPatients' Bill of Rights, one that would not bankrupt employers and one \nthat would help provide good rights for patients all across this \ncountry. It has been a pleasure and privilege to serve with Tim \nHutchinson in the Senate.\n  In the Senate we have the opportunity to work with outstanding \nindividuals. Tim Hutchinson is one of those individuals. The election \ndid not work out for him, but I am very optimistic that his future is \nvery bright indeed. I thank him for his service to this body. I think \nhe has made the Senate a better place, and I compliment him for his \nservice.\n\n\n                   Tribute to Senator Frank Murkowski\n\n  Mr. President, I also wish to comment on our retiring colleague, \nSenator Frank Murkowski. Senator Murkowski and I were elected together \nin 1980, so we have been very good friends for the last 22 years.\n  I have served with Senator Murkowski for the last 22 years on the \nEnergy Committee. For the last several years, he has been the chairman \nof the Energy Committee. Talk about persistence, about dedication, and \nabout a person who has really served his State of Alaska and served our \ncountry well; it is Senator Frank Murkowski. As a result of his \nleadership, many of us have gone to Alaska.\n  Senator Stevens and Senator Murkowski love their State. We all love \nour States, but they love their State with great enthusiasm and are \nvery successful, forceful advocates for their parochial interests, as \nwell as for our country.\n  Senator Murkowski was thinking about how he could improve his State, \nbut he was also thinking about our national energy posture. Frankly, we \nfind ourselves in very difficult shape; we are importing the majority \nof our oil, and it only gets worse. He has tried to reverse that trend.\n  I compliment him for his leadership on the Energy Committee. He was a \nvery effective and forceful chairman of the Energy Committee and served \nour country very well there.\n\n  I also had the pleasure of serving with him on the Finance Committee. \nHe is a person who is a very good friend of taxpayers, a person who \nreally wanted to grow our economy, and a person who I think was \nrecognized by his State for his outstanding leadership. He was recently \nelected as Governor of the State of Alaska, and I have no doubt he will \nbe an outstanding Governor of that great State.\n  So my compliments to Senator Frank Murkowski and to his lovely wife \nNancy. They are very good friends of ours, a very outstanding \nsenatorial couple who have made the Senate a better place and who make \nour country a better place. I thank and compliment him for his 22 years \nof service in the Senate and look forward to working with him as the \nnext Governor of the State of Alaska.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Tribute to Senator Tim Hutchinson\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for \nhis kind remarks about Senator Tim Hutchinson. He was one of my closest \nfriends. He and Randi are fine people. We served together on the Armed \nServices Committee and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee. I saw him perform day after day with fidelity to the \nprinciples that he campaigned on when he came to the Senate. He fought \nfor what he believed in. He was one of the most able advocates in the \nChamber. I do not think you could name on the fingers of your hand any \nSenator who could compete with him insofar as advocating positions on \nthe floor. He stood for the great values of America.\n  While on the Armed Services Committee, I remember one battle he got \ninto as Personnel Subcommittee chairman. He made great progress in \nregard to the problem of the great educational institutions in America, \ncolleges and high schools, that barred military recruiters from coming \non campus to recruit personnel for a career in the military. It is \nunthinkable to me that that would occur, but it happens in this \ncountry.\n  Indeed, the very liberties we have that provide for education and \nallow people to debate and disagree are protected by our military, and \nit denied them the right to come on campus to seek people to serve, \nwhich is really unbelievable. He fought that battle and reached an \nagreement eventually that essentially achieved the end of that \nunconscionable procedure.\n  He also presided on that subcommittee during consideration of a \nconsistent series of pay raises for our men and women in the military. \nWe have now gotten to the point where we are seeing our military get \npaid a far more decent wage than they were a few years ago.\n  On the HELP Committee, he was a prime advocate for the President's No \nChild Left Behind bill. He and I sponsored legislation called Dollars \nto the Classroom. We intended to put as much money to those teachers \nwhere learning occurs to try to enhance those magical moments when a \nteacher and a child come together and learning occurs. That was our \nvision, that is what we fought for, and No Child Left Behind had a lot \nof that in it.\n  As Senator Nickles said, Senator Hutchinson fought for and was a \ngreat advocate during the battle over the Patients' Bill of Rights. He \nwas a very responsible and articulate spokesman on some complex issues \non which Senator Nickles led us as we carried on that\n\n[[Page S11292]]\n\ndebate. I do appreciate him remembering and commenting on the \nextraordinary contributions of Tim Hutchinson. We are going to miss \nhim. I will miss him personally. His leadership will be missed. I know \nhe will have a great future in front of him.\n\n\n                   Tribute to Senator Frank Murkowski\n\n  Mr. President, it is a sad day to think Frank and Nancy Murkowski \nwill not be with us. I admire them so much.\n  We have had the occasion, my wife Mary and I, to spend time with \nthem. I have come to respect him. I was in Alaska not too many years \nago and passed his home in Fairbanks and talked to some of his \nneighbors, all of whom had such a high opinion of him.\n  He was a champion for energy. He understood that energy is good, not \nbad. He understood we need a great capacity, at the lowest possible \ncost, so American citizens can carry on their travel, heat and cool \ntheir homes at the lowest possible cost. Keeping energy costs down is \nimportant. He knew and warned us repeatedly that we were becoming too \ndependent on Middle East oil and energy and we needed to enhance our \ndomestic production. He convinced me and almost the majority of this \nSenate that Alaska and the ANWR reserve could produce large amounts of \noil with no threat to the environment, touching only the smallest \nportion of that vast reserve. I admired him for that and I supported \nhim.\n  He also supported one of the programs that I believe was extremely \nenvironmentally friendly, the bill we call the CARA Act, which would \nallow revenue from offshore oil and gas wells in the Gulf and wherever \nthey would drill to be plowed back into environmental programs in our \ncountry. It would provide a constant and guaranteed source of funds for \nenvironmental benefit. It was a good and forward-looking bill, far more \nhistoric, with greater potential for environmental benefits than a lot \nof people understood--although it did certainly have broad support in \nthe environmental community.\n  It has been a pleasure to serve with Frank. I have been impressed \nwith his steadfastness, his constancy of purpose, his understanding \nthat your message has to be repeated to break through the sound barrier \nin the country. I admire him and respect him very much. We will be \nmissing him. I look forward to having the opportunity to visit Frank \nand Nancy as often as possible when they come back to the capital city \nhere as Governor of Alaska.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Homeland Security\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, tomorrow morning the Senate will vote on the \namendment introduced by Senator Daschle to the homeland security bill. \nThis amendment will strike several provisions in the bill that were \nadded by the other body in the dark of night without their ever having \nseen the light of day until after they were adopted. I have added my \nname as a cosponsor of the amendment because I was troubled by the \nsubstance of these last-minute provisions. I was pleased that Senator \nDaschle and Senator Lieberman were taking action to strike the new \nlanguage from the bill. I support the amendment and I hope that other \nSenators will support it, as well.\n  I have cosponsored the amendment because I believe the Senate has a \nduty to take the time to improve legislation when it needs improving, \nas it does, obviously. This bill certainly needs improving. I had hoped \nthat more Senators would be able to offer their amendments to this \nbill.\n  I have heard several of my colleagues expressing concerns about what \nis in the bill, as well as what is not in the bill. I have concerns of \nmy own, many of which I have expressed in recent days. I also have \namendments that could be offered to address these problems, just as \nother Senators have amendments that they had hoped to offer. But here \nwe are, consuming all of our time under cloture in consideration of \nthis single amendment. The Senators in the minority are keeping us from \nvoting on the Daschle amendment until all 30 hours of debate have run. \nThe Republican side of the aisle is doing this to prevent other \namendments from being offered during this time.\n  While the administration is pressing hard to avoid other amendments, \nthe die was already cast for this bill when the Senate voted last \nFriday to invoke cloture. Caesar crossed the Rubicon on January 11, in \nthe year 49 A.D., on the night of January 11. Whether he crossed the \nRubicon before midnight or after midnight on that night, I don't \nrecall; I am not sure I ever knew. It was on that night that he crossed \nthe Rubicon. He paused thoughtfully and then he said:\n\n       The die is cast.\n\n  So be it.\n  I voted against cloture last week on Friday because I believed that \nthere were problems in this bill that should be thoroughly addressed in \nthe Senate; that we needed more time to debate those problems and that \nwe needed more time in which to offer amendments to the 484-page bill \nthat had been dropped on our desks on the morning of last Wednesday. I \ntried to get some of our Democratic colleagues to vote against cloture \non Friday, so that we would have a little more time in which we \nSenators and our staffs could study that hurriedly-put-together bill, \nhurriedly passed by the other body. I felt that we should not invoke \ncloture on last Friday, that we should take a few more days, study the \nbill, and try to amend it before cloture, as I knew, would finally be \nadopted.\n  But my words were to little avail. There was at least one Senator who \ndid vote against cloture at my importuning him to do so. And I deeply \nappreciated his willingness to listen and his willingness to vote \nagainst cloture.\n  There were others who were not quite so willing. They listened \npatiently, but they went on their way and voted for cloture. Some of \nthem thought that, inasmuch as we would then have 30 hours under \ncloture, we could offer our amendments. But I knew that the entire 30 \nhours could be spent on one amendment. I had never seen it done before, \nbut it very well could be. I was aware of that. I didn't think it would \nbe done, but we have seen it has been done by the Republican minority, \nwhich has said: This far; no farther. You have offered one amendment, \nthat being the Daschle amendment on behalf of himself and Mr. \nLieberman--you have offered that amendment, and the entire 30 hours \nwill be spent on that amendment. You will not have any opportunity to \noffer any other amendment.\n  I still believe that there are serious problems in the bill that go \nfar beyond the provisions stricken by the Daschle amendment. That was \nnot an all-encompassing amendment as far as I was concerned. It was an \namendment in the right direction but, even with the adoption of the \namendment, there is going to be a tremendous amount of power shifted to \nthe President. He is going to have a full year in which to indicate to \nthe rest of us what his plan is for reorganizing, and for organizing \nthe new Department. He probably doesn't know at this moment what his \nplan will be. But he has a year, under this bill, to offer his plan. \nAnd it will, ipso facto, automatically go into effect at some point. \nCongress is out of the loop. Congress will not be asked to approve his \nplan. Congress will only be informed of his plan. That's it. We have no \nfurther say in the matter.\n  So his plan, being a pig in a poke, a plan which we do not know now, \nthat plan will at some point go into effect without any further vote on \nthe part of Congress. Congress will not be asked to approve it. And \nthis bill, which we will pass on tomorrow, will not give Congress the \nright to vote to approve that plan.\n  Moreover, an amendment, if I had been able to offer it, to provide \nfor congressional approval--that amendment would not have been germane \nunder cloture. So we were headed off there. So we have helped to cut \nour own throats, to a degree, by having voted for cloture last Friday.\n  I urged Senators last Friday, as I said before, not to vote for \ncloture last week, so we would have more time in which to read and \nstudy this bill that was dropped suddenly into our laps by\n\n[[Page S11293]]\n\nthe other body. I pleaded with this Senate not to shut off debate and \nlimit amendments, and 28 other Senators voted with me not to do so.\n\n  There were 29 Senators who voted against it and they were all \nDemocrats. Mr. President, 29 Democrats voted against cloture last \nFriday. Only 17 Democrats voted for some cloture. There were other \nDemocrats who were absent and not voting and their votes, of course--at \nleast four of those Senators would have voted against cloture. That \nwould have brought the vote up to 33 votes against cloture, well over \nhalf the Democratic caucus. So that if only six of the 17 Senators who \ndid vote for cloture last Friday had not voted for cloture and voted \nagainst it, or had not voted for cloture, then there would have only \nbeen 59 votes for cloture, which would have meant that cloture would \nnot have been invoked.\n  Sixty-five votes in totality were for cloture. So all that was needed \nto defeat cloture was for six of those Senators who voted for cloture \nto vote against cloture.\n  Many of my colleagues last week, as I pleaded with them to vote \nagainst cloture, reassured me that we would have the opportunity to \noffer amendments after cloture was invoked. But those Members should \nlook carefully at where the Senate stands today, because there is an \nimportant lesson to be learned about the rules of the Senate and the \neffect of cloture on the ability of Senators to offer amendments. Not \nonly have Senators been restricted to offering only those amendments \nthat are ruled to be germane--and we know that under the cloture rule--\nbut Senators have been unable to offer any amendments at all, other \nthan the amendment introduced by the majority leader.\n  Not all Senators could foresee that would happen, but all Senators \nshould have known that could happen under the rule. It did happen. So I \nhope the Senators who voted for cloture, some of them at least, will \nhave some afterthoughts that will help in the future to remind them \nthat we ought not be in such a great hurry to invoke cloture, \nespecially on an extremely complicated bill which has been brought to \nour attention in its entirety just within the past few days beginning \nwith last Wednesday.\n  When I say to Senators that we should not shirk our responsibilities \nas legislators by invoking cloture, especially so quickly, so early on, \nI understand the kind of opportunities that are available under \ncloture, we will all understand this in the future.\n  I understand that the rules of the Senate have been used fairly to \nprevent amendments from being offered to the homeland security \nlegislation. When I hear the arguments that voting for the single \namendment that has been offered will jeopardize passage of the bill, I \nunderstand that such arguments were made possible by the vote to invoke \ncloture.\n  The Senate has painted itself, in a way, into a corner, by invoking \ncloture on the Thompson amendment. We have no one to blame but \nourselves for allowing the administration and the other body to \ncharacterize this modest amendment as a threat to the passage of \nhomeland security legislation. The administration wants to limit any \namendments to one up-or-down vote so that the administration can argue \nthat a vote for this amendment is a vote to ``kill'' the homeland \nsecurity bill. There is simply no basis whatsoever in fact for the \nadministration's attempts to politicize this vote by claiming that the \nvote on this amendment by Mr. Daschle and Mr. Lieberman will kill the \nbill.\n  This legislation has been introduced for consideration by the Senate, \nand the extent of that consideration should not be confined to a few \ndays of debate over whether simply to rubberstamp the legislation so it \ncan be sent to the President for his signature.\n  If the President wants to insist on getting this bill passed before \nCongress adjourns, he could persuade both Houses of Congress to pass \nbills and work out their differences in conference. Such a conference \nis one which may or may not take very long.\n  As a matter of fact, the House could very well accept the amendment, \nif the amendment by Mr. Daschle and Mr. Lieberman should prevail--the \nHouse could very well accept that amendment, and the bill would go to \nthe President.\n  For now, I think the Senate should do its job. Senators need to look \ncarefully at the bill, do what they can to make improvements before \nvoting. And they only have this one chance--vote up or down on the \nDaschle amendment.\n  That will help some but not enough. But that might allow some \nSenators in their own good consciences to vote for the bill. As far as \nI am concerned, it is not enough because there would still be a \ntremendous shift of power from the legislative branch to the President. \nAnd I don't feel like shifting that power to any President--not just \nthis one, but in particular this administration with its way of wanting \nto do things in a secretive manner and wanting to run a government out \nof the White House, and not in the full light of day or under the full \nscrutiny of the press and the people.\n  I intend to vote against this bill, and I know that a majority of \nSenators will likely vote for it. But whether Senators plan to vote for \nthis bill or against it, we should all work to make sure that the \nSenate passes the best possible bill that it can under the \ncircumstances. We ought to act responsibly in response to this \neleventh-hour legislation that did not see the light of day until only \na few days ago. We should not surrender our duties under the \nConstitution by allowing legislation to be dictated to this Senate in \nan atmosphere of political brinkmanship.\n  Senator Daschle's amendment strikes a number of very troubling \nprovisions that were added to this bill at the last minute in the hopes \nthat the Senate would cave in to the administration's empty rhetoric. \nSenator Daschle and Senator Lieberman have called this bluff, and this \namendment has cast a high-powered spotlight on language in this bill \nthat cannot possibly withstand the light of day and the strict scrutiny \nof time. These shameful provisions could never survive public scrutiny, \nand now that they have been brought into focus, the Senate must ensure \nthat they do not survive our consideration.\n  So let us see on tomorrow whether or not the Senate has the will and \nthe courage to take a strong stand against this power grab. That stand \ncan be taken by voting for the Daschle-Lieberman amendment.\n  This amendment strikes several provisions in this bill that do not \ndeserve to be enacted into law. The first of these provisions in one \nthat I have previously addressed, relating to unnecessary and dangerous \nexemptions from the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The language in \nthis bill would give new blanket authority to the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity to exempt advisory committees from existing public disclosure \nand conflict-of-interest rules. These rules already allow exemptions \nfor sensitive information relating to national security. This bill \nwould allow the Secretary to cloak committee activities behind a veil \nof secrecy, regardless of whether those activities actually involve \nissues of national security.\n  I believe that too much secrecy in government is dangerous to our \ncivil liberties, and we should not authorize such broad exemptions \nwithout compelling evidence of the need for unchecked blanket \nauthority.\n  The President of the United States already has that authority on a \ncase-by-case basis. But now we are going to extend it to the Secretary \nof the new Department, and of course he can exercise blanket authority \nif he so wishes.\n  If we are to preserve our liberty and the integrity of our \nconstitutional system, executive decision making must be subject to \nscrutiny and oversight by the Congress, the media, and the public. I \nsupport striking this language from the bill, and I thank Senators \nDaschle and Lieberman for bringing it to the attention of the Senate.\n  The Daschle amendment also strikes several provisions in this bill \nthat protect corporate campaign contributors from lawsuits. The first \nof these provisions would prohibit lawsuits against companies that \nmanufacture vaccines by people who have been harmed by those vaccines, \nincluding children suffering from autism as a result of preservatives \nused in childhood vaccines.\n  Another of these liability provisions would enact sweeping tort \nreform for products that are designated as anti-terrorism technologies. \nThese provisions would protect companies that manufacture everything \nfrom gas\n\n[[Page S11294]]\n\nmasks to computer software when their products fail, even when the \ncompanies know that their products will not work.\n  The final liability provision would give immunity to companies \nresponsible for providing security screening in airports. The Senate \nrejected similar language last year during its consideration of the \nairline ``bailout'' bill, yet now we are being asked to approve it \nbecause it has been inserted into politically popular legislation. The \nattempt to slip this provision past the Senate is another example of \nthe haste with which this bill has been drafted and considered by this \nCongress. Issues like these liability provisions should be carefully \nscrutinized before they become law, not just rubber-stamped by \nimpatient lawmakers looking to put issues behind them and go home.\n  Another provision that has already been considered by this Senate \nrelates to doing business with companies that have moved their \nheadquarters out of the United States to avoid paying U.S. taxes. In \nits consideration of the Lieberman substitute to the homeland security \nbill, the Senate adopted an amendment offered by the late Senator \nWellstone that prohibited the Secretary of Homeland Security from \ncontracting with such companies, unless he needed to do so for national \nsecurity reasons. The Thompson substitute guts the Wellstone amendment \nby allowing the Secretary expanded powers to waive this prohibition to \nprevent the loss of jobs or to save money for the government. The \nSenate should reject this attempt to undermine the will of the Senate \nby restoring the language of Senator Wellstone's amendment to the \nhomeland security bill.\n\n  The Thompson substitute also tries to slip in language to delay the \nimplementation of new airport security regulations. The Senate enacted \nprocedures in last year's airline security bill for the Transportation \nSecurity Agency to issue regulations for improving security in our \nNation's airports. The new language in the Thompson substitute would \nmodify these procedures by requiring the Transportation Security \nOversight Board to ratify any regulations before they become effective. \nI see no good reason for this modification, If there is one, the Senate \nshould take the time to debate it rather than hastily approving it as \npart of this massive legislation.\n  The final provision that will be stricken by the Daschle-Lieberman-\nByrd amendment is the language directing that a new homeland security \nresearch center be created at Texas A University.\n  I don't think the amendment specifically says that, but its \nprovisions are such that that particular university would be most \nfavored and targeted for location of such a center.\n  The amendment removes items from the list of highly specific criteria \nwhich all but guaranteed that Texas A would be the only university \nwhich would qualify for the new research center.\n  Mr. President, striking these provisions from the Thompson amendment \nis a good start. I believe that the Senate should go further in \nfulfilling its constitutional duty to improve this legislation before \npassing this bill. I believe there are many other provisions of this \nbill which should be stricken and begun anew next year.\n  In fact, I think we would all be more secure if we put off the whole \nbill and started over next year.\n  For example, there is a provision that the President may submit his \nrecommendations to Congress and the only thing that Congress can do is \njust at that point agree to his recommendations. The Congress has no \nopportunity to approve or not approve of those recommendations as far \nas this bill is concerned. We might expect a great deal of chaos as \nthese 28 agencies are moved into the Department. This will take place \nwithin the next year. The President has not yet submitted his plan for \nhaving the agencies moved into the new Department, but his plan will be \nsubmitted at some point and, ipso facto, will go into effect.\n  Under an amendment which I had offered earlier to the homeland \nsecurity measure--that being at that time, I believe, the Lieberman \nbill that came out of the committee of which he is chairman--I had \noffered an amendment to provide for an orderly phase-in of agencies \ninto the new Department over a period of a year.\n  Under my amendment, the recommendations of the administration would \nhave gone to the Lieberman committee and to its counterpart in the \nHouse of Representatives. And those two committees would have had an \nopportunity, then, to hold hearings and, under expedited procedures, \ncould have brought out bills, reported bills, to implement the phasing \nin of agencies into the new Department, with there being three phases, \nof 120 days each, which would have created an orderly process whereby \nthese various agencies would have been phased into the new Department.\n  Also, the Congress would have been kept in the loop in each case, \nwith the Lieberman committee and its counterpart in the House being \nable to hold hearings, call witnesses, vote out bills by expedited \nprocedures. Those bills would come to the Senate. They could be called \nup in the Senate under expedited procedures so that there would be no \nfilibuster, and those bills would be amended, passed on; and in this \nway the creation of the new Department, with the orderly phasing in of \nthe agencies, would occur over the same period of time--1 year--as is \nthe case with the current bill.\n  As it is, when we pass this bill in the Senate, we are out of the \nloop; we have automatically put ourselves, the Congress, to the \nsidelines. And the President then can do as he wishes. He can submit \nhis plan, and that plan would automatically go into effect. Congress \nwill be on the sideline. We will have said: Here it is, Mr. President. \nIt's all yours. We have no more say in it. It's yours. Just be kind \nenough to let us know what your plans are. That's all we ask. Let us \nknow what your plans are.\n  But under my amendment, those recommendations would have come to the \nCongress. Congress would have kept itself in the loop. It would have \nbeen able to maintain oversight. And with each phase, each of the three \nphases, as it passed from the first, to the second, to the third, \nCongress would have benefited by its experience under the first, and \nthen under the second, and there would have been an orderly phase-in, \nand with Congress, as I say, retaining its place in the loop.\n  But that amendment was opposed even by Mr. Lieberman and, I believe, \nthe majority leader. The majority leader I think voted against it. It \nwas his right to do so. But Mr. Lieberman, the author of the bill which \nhad been reported out by his committee, voted against the amendment. So \nI thought it would have been an improvement to the bill and certainly \nwould not have been in derogation of the committee in its work. But \nthat amendment was rejected. And there you are. I tried. I failed to \nbring about that improvement. So that is another improvement that I \nthink ought to still have been put into the bill that is before us.\n  So I have seen the handwriting on the wall. I know this bill will \nprobably pass the Senate. Having said that, I believe that the \namendment by Mr. Daschle and Mr. Lieberman is important because it does \nmake some needed improvements to the bill. The Senate has a duty to \napprove at least these minimal proposals, if I may say that about \nthem--they are important improvements--before handing over this broad \ngrant of power to the executive branch.\n  I urge Senators to vote for the Daschle-Lieberman amendment on \ntomorrow morning.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           procurement policy\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, the homeland security legislation we have \nbeen debating takes on many organizational and administrative \nchallenges, but one challenge it does not cover fully is in the area of \ninformation technology. Specifically, I am talking about departmental \npolicies and guidelines for purchasing computer software. No doubt, \neffective procurement policies will be essential not just to the sound \nadministration of the Department, but also to the successful \nachievement of a number of important policies identified in this \nlegislation, including most notably, the ability of law enforcement and \nintelligence agencies to share data and coordinate activities to \nrespond to or prevent terror or criminal acts.\n  For those sharing and analyzing data electronically, the security of \nthe software being utilized, such as database\n\n[[Page S11295]]\n\nand operating system software, is critical. These software technologies \nare referred to by those in the industry as ``information assurance'' \ntechnology. Information assurance technology is what is needed to \nassure information systems operate effectively, ensure the security of \nthe information contained in these systems, and verify the identities \nof those authorized to use these systems. At its most fundamental \nlevel, information assurance software, for example, includes operating \nsystems, database, and user authentication software.\n  It should not be a surprise to anyone here that agencies within the \nFederal Government that are responsible for our most sensitive \ninformation have to rely on information assurance technology. In fact, \nin January of 2000, the National Security Telecommunications and \nInformation Systems Security Committee, an entity within the National \nSecurity Agency, proposed a policy that called on all Government \nagencies to purchase only those commercial-off-the-shelf, or COTS, \nsoftware that had undergone an independent evaluation process that \ntests the security of the software. Toward that goal, the committee \noutlined a specific acquisition policy for those information systems \ncritical to national security. This policy--the National Security \nTelecommunications and Information Systems Security Policy #11, or \nNSTISSP #11--states that Federal agencies with information systems \ninvolved in national security can only purchase commercial information \nassurance software that has been independently evaluated to be secure.\n  This sounds a bit technical, but if we take a step back and look at \nthis proposed policy as consumers, it makes perfect sense. Today, many \nhousehold items, like our dishwashers, televisions, stereos, and \ncomputers, have the now famous Underwriters Laboratory Label. This \nlabel provides consumers with the peace of mind that the products they \nare purchasing have met independent public safety tests.\n\n  Consumers have been purchasing products with the Underwriters \nLaboratory ``seal of approval'' for more than a century. However, \nbusinesses large and small, and local, State, and Federal Government \nagencies purchase computer software with no thought given to whether or \nnot the software has met some outside measure of security assurance. \nThat is an extremely risky proposition. Computer software is essential \nto our Nation's critical infrastructures, including our railroads, \nairports, pipelines, utilities, and financial services. At the \nGovernment level, information technology is critical to the \nadministration of key Federal programs, our homeland defense, and most \nnotably, our national security.\n  The costs of insecure, vulnerable information systems are real and \nsobering. Computer viruses, like Nimda and Code Red, penetrate, disrupt \nand disable information systems through security holes in software. \nLast year, according to industry estimates, these viruses inflicted $13 \nbillion in damages on our economy and even incapacitated systems within \nour own Defense Department.\n  Fortunately, information technology laboratories exist that perform \nfunctions similar to the Underwriters Laboratory. Many software \ncompanies have these independent labs evaluate their products to \ndetermine if they meet various levels of security assurance. For \nexample, the international Common Criteria provides for security \nevaluations that are recognized in 15 countries, including the United \nStates, Germany, Canada, and Great Britain. Thus, if a software product \nis certified under the Common Criteria, it is recognized among all \nparticipating countries. More to the point, this certification is \ndesigned to validate the security claims made by software companies, \nmuch like the Underwriters Laboratory validates the safety claims of \nappliance manufacturers. In his book, ``Secrets and Lies'' \ncybersecurity expert Bruce Schneier noted that the Common Criteria is a \n``giant step in the right direction.''\n  NSTISSP #11 is the Federal Government's way of saying that for its \nmost sensitive national security systems, it is not enough for \ninformation technology providers to say their products are secure. Now, \nsoftware providers must have independent evaluations to back up their \nclaims.\n  It is my understanding that the Defense Department is working to \nimplement an information assurance acquisition policy based on NSTISSP \n#11. That is an important and positive step, one called for in the \nDefense authorization bill conference report.\n\n  The reason why I am bringing this issue to the attention of my \ncolleagues today is because I believe it is an issue that deserves the \nattention of the new Department of Homeland Security. After all, if the \ntragic terrorist attacks of September 11 proved anything, it is that \nour most sensitive information systems in Federal information sharing \nand coordination of strategies will likely take place among those law \nenforcement agencies within and outside of the Homeland Security \nDepartment. Information sharing and analysis also is likely to occur \nbetween our law enforcement and intelligence agencies. All of this \nactivity requires that the Department of Homeland Security to have \nstrong information assurance strategies, including those involving the \npurchase of information assurance systems in the commercial market.\n  I see the distinguished chair of the Governmental Affairs Committee \nand manager of the legislation currently pending on the floor. I know \nthis is an issue of great interest and concern to him, and I would now \nyield the floor to him for any comments he wishes to make.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the distinguished Senator from Ohio for \nyielding, and I thank him for his comments, which are right on the \nmark. Information assurance will be critical to the new Department of \nHomeland Security, and independent evaluations can be useful tools to \nimprove the security of information systems. In fact, information \nassurance is critical to the entire Federal Government and deserves to \nbe a key component in any cybersecurity strategy. I look forward to \nseeing this framework for independent software evaluation evolve and \nimprove through processes like the National Information Assurance \nPartnership and the Common Criteria.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank the distinguished chair of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee for his comments. I look forward to working with him \nand the new Department of Homeland Security to ensure that the \nDepartment's information assurance policies include the purchase of \nsecure, stable information systems.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I also thank the Senator from Ohio for his comments \nand look forward to working with him, as well.\n\n\n                   unaccompanied child protection act\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am disappointed that the bill before \nus does not contain in its entirety the Unaccompanied Child Protection \nAct, bipartisan legislation I introduced at the beginning of this \nCongress and that was included as Title XII of the Lieberman substitute \nto H.R. 5005.\n  I am pleased, however, that the measure contains one key component of \nthat legislation: the transfer of authority over the care and custody \nof unaccompanied alien children to the Office of Refugee Resettlement \nwithin the Department of Health and Human Services.\n  This is key for two reasons: First, we do not want to burden the \nSecretary of Homeland Security with policy issues unrelated to the \nthreat of terrorism. The Department will have a huge and important \nmission when this legislation is done and its attention should be \nfocused on that mission.\n  Second, the federal government has a special responsibility to \nprotect the children in its custody. For too long, the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, INS, has not lived up to that responsibility. \nThe children's provisions in this legislation is an important first \nstep in correcting decades of questionable practices with regards to \nchildren that come under the agency's watch.\n  As I mentioned before, this is an important first step in providing \nprotection for unaccompanied alien children. I ask my friend from \nArizona, who is a senior member of the Judiciary Committee and part of \nthe leadership on the other side of the aisle, if he would agree to \nwork with me next year to further refine the important reforms relating \nto the treatment of unaccompanied alien children.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank my friend from California for her question. I know \nthat\n\n[[Page S11296]]\n\nshe has worked long and hard on these issues and that it is her work \nand her dedication that is responsible for the inclusion of the \nchildren's provisions in the homeland security bill.\n  I would further say to my friend from California that while \nadditional reforms may be warranted, the legislation before us today \nwas primarily a structural bill, not a policy bill. That fact prevented \nthe consideration of some of the reforms she has championed from being \nincluded in this legislation.\n  I pledged to work with her in the 108th Congress to help fashion \nlegislation that could address some of the issues that had to be left \nout of this measure.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Arizona. You may be \ninterested to know that I first became involved in this issue when I \nheard about a young 15-year old Chinese girl who stood before a U.S. \nimmigration court facing deportation proceedings. She had found her way \nto the United States as a stowaway in a container ship captured off of \nGuam, hoping to escape the repression she had experienced in her home \ncountry.\n  Although she had committed no crime, the INS sent her to a Portland \njail, where she languished for seven months. When the INS brought her \nbefore an immigration judge, she stood before him confused, not \nunderstanding the proceedings against her. Tears streamed down her \nface, yet she could not wipe them away because her hands were \nhandcuffed and chained to her waist.\n  While the young girl eventually received asylum in our country, she \nunnecessarily faced an ordeal no child should bear under our \nimmigration system. This young Chinese girl represents only one of \n5,000 foreign-born children who, without parents or legal guardians to \nprotect them, are discovered in the United States each year in need of \nprotection.\n  So you see, this issue calls for clearer policy direction from \nCongress. I thank my friend and look forward to working with him in the \nbeginning of the 108th Congress.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the reorganization of our homeland \nsecurity efforts is necessary if we are to achieve a higher level of \nsafety for American citizens.\n  The bill before us improves our security by combining into a single \ndepartment the federal agencies and programs that today have a role in \nproviding homeland security. Those organizations comprise some 170,000 \npeople. Bringing them together under a single reorganized department \nwill enable us to improve coordination of the Government's efforts to \ndefend the United States against terrorist attacks.\n  By creating the cabinet-level position of Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, the bill ensures there will be a leader of this effort, with \nthe appropriate authority and responsibility to carry out that mission.\n  The creation of a Border and Transportation Security Directorate--\nbringing together the Immigration and Naturalization Service from the \nJustice Department, the U.S. Customs Service from the Treasury \nDepartment, and the newly created Transportation Security \nAdministration--will make a single entity responsible for securing our \nborder and transportation systems and preventing the entry of \nterrorists into our country.\n  The Coast Guard, which also plays an important role in securing our \nborders, will move from the Department of Transportation to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. By maintaining the Coast Guard as an \nindependent agency reporting directly to the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, this bill ensures the Coast Guard will have the resources and \nadvocacy it needs to conduct its important security missions as well as \nits other missions, such as search-and-rescue and boating safety.\n  This legislation also creates a Directorate of Emergency Preparedness \nand Response, which will coordinate the federal government's response \nto terrorist attacks and major disasters. Combining all the Federal \nGovernment's emergency response efforts into a single entity will \nimprove the Government's coordination with state and local entities in \npreparing for and responding to terrorist attacks.\n  The need for this reorganization is critical to our national \nsecurity. Its scope is necessarily quite extensive. If this effort is \nto be effective, the President must have the flexibility to adapt the \nnew department as needed to carry out its mission. This bill provides \nhim the management flexibility he needs while protecting the rights of \nthe Federal workers who will serve in the new department.\n  This bill represents to most extensive reorganization of the Federal \nGovernment in over 50 years. By taking resources from existing \ndepartments and agencies and placing them in a new organization, it has \nrequired a very difficult balancing of competing interests and views. \nThe success of those efforts is a tribute to those who have worked so \nhard to bring this legislation about.\n  The President in particular deserves praise for bringing together a \nwide variety of interests and addressing a variety of concerns about \nthe new department. Here in the Senate, Senator Thompson, the ranking \nmember of the Governmental Affairs Committee and one of the sponsors of \nthe compromise proposal before us now, deserves great credit for his \nefforts to ensure this legislation was both effective and fair. Senator \nLieberman, the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, was one \nof the first to identify the need for this department and to call for \nits creation, and he should be commended for his efforts as well.\n  The bill before us is the beginning, not the end, of our efforts to \nadapt to the new threats we face. After the Department of Homeland \nSecurity is created, we may find that other changes will be needed, but \nthis legislation is a very important step to ensuring that our nation, \nour homeland, and our citizens, are protected to the fullest extent \npossible from the new and dangerous threats that confront us.\n  I support this effort and I urge all Senators to vote for it.\n  Let's get on with it.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller).

Mr. President, I appreciate the fact that we have now \npassed an air cargo security bill that I think will move the ball a \nlong way down the road toward ensuring the safety of the traveling \npublic and our aviation industry.\n  Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, we have spent a tremendous amount \nof time, effort, and resources improving our passenger aviation \nsecurity system. In fact, tomorrow we have a very important deadline \nthat will be met. All of the airport screeners in our country will be \nFederal employees who have met a series of stringent requirements, \nundergone mandatory training, and passed performance and written \nexaminations.\n  I am proud of the work we have done in this area, but I am also \nconcerned that we have been neglecting other modes of transportation as \nwe continue to focus on passenger aircraft. 1 year ago, Congress \ncreated the Transportation Security Administration to implement and \noversee security on our highways, in our airports, on trains, and in \nour ports. However, until now, we only gave to the TSA the tools to do \nthe job with respect to passenger aviation security.\n  Last week, we finally passed the port security bill. Now we need to \ntake another step toward transportation security. While I am confident \nthat our efforts have dramatically improved aviation security, we have \nnot closed all the loopholes in our air cargo operations. This issue \nmust be addressed.\n  Twenty-two percent of all air cargo in the United States is carried \non passenger flights, but only a tiny percentage of this cargo is \ninspected. There is no point to carefully screening every piece of \nluggage if the cargo placed aboard the same flight is not inspected at \nall. That is why I introduced the Air Cargo Security Act with my friend \nfrom California, Senator Dianne Feinstein. We reasoned it was pointless \nto require air passengers to wait in long security lines, undergo \nrigorous searches, which all of us have certainly had the privilege of \nsuffering through, if we then allow packages to travel on the very same \nflight with no inspections whatsoever. Ignoring this problem could be \nan invitation to disaster.\n  My legislation was the subject of a closed-door hearing of the \nAviation Subcommittee. Without going into details, it was apparent \nthere are significant vulnerabilities in our existing system of air \ncargo security. The Transportation Security Administration is doing the \nbest it can with limited resources. But clearly, legislation is \nrequired.\n  I modified the bill in response to those weaknesses and the \nrecommendations made by the Transportation Security Administration, as \nwell as the\n\n[[Page S11305]]\n\nDepartment of Transportation Inspector General.\n  This bill was unanimously passed by the Commerce Committee in \nSeptember as part of a larger package of aviation security measures. \nSome of these provisions made their way into the homeland security \ncompromise draft, but air cargo security is too important to simply \nwait until next year.\n  The bill before us will establish a more reliable and accountable \nknown shipper program, with frequent inspections of shipping \nfacilities, tamper-proof identification cards for employees, and an \naccessible shipper database.\n  For the first time, the Transportation Security Administration will \nhave the power to revoke the license of a shipper or freight forwarder \nwhose practices are unsound or who has engaged in illegal activity.\n  The bill also requires the Transportation Security Administration to \nconduct regular inspections of foreign shipping facilities. Freight \nforwarders will have to submit to random inspections, and the TSA must \nalso implement a training program for cargo professionals. All cargo \nfacilities must have an improved security plan.\n  While we tighten these rules and procedures, we must be careful not \nto cause any economic damage to an airline industry that is already in \ndire straits. It is critical that the measures we impose allow both \npassenger and cargo carriers to compete on an equal footing. We drafted \nthis bill in consultation with air cargo carriers and the airlines. I \nam pleased that we have gained their support, because it is important \nwe have the regulators and the aviation industry working together to \nmake the most seamless security system possible, not only in our \ncountry but throughout the world.\n\n  I also want to point out that the bill before us would accomplish \nseveral other goals. These provisions have all been approved by the \nCommerce Committee, and I thank Senators Hollings and McCain for their \nleadership.\n  The bill reauthorizes the National Transportation Safety Board \nthrough fiscal year 2005. I was proud to serve as vice chair of the \nNational Transportation Safety Board before I came to the Senate. This \nagency investigates civil aviation accidents and significant incidents \nin other modes of transportation: railroad, highway, marine, and \npipeline. The NTSB also issues safety recommendations aimed at \npreventing future accidents. This reauthorization also strengthens \nperformance requirements for booster seats for children weighing more \nthan 50 pounds. The NTSB's important work is completed on a very \nreasonable budget. I am pleased to support this reauthorization bill.\n  The bill before us also makes technical corrections to last year's \nAviation and Transportation Security Act. It allows TSA to use \nbiometric identification technologies such as retina scans and \nfingerprints to assist in aviation security. It defines circumvention \nof airport security as a Federal crime. It authorizes a study on blast-\nresistant cargo containers, and it strengthens security at flight \nschools. These necessary measures fine-tune the comprehensive security \nlegislation we passed last year. I am pleased we have cleared this \nlegislation, and I urge my colleagues in the House to follow suit.\n  Mr. President, I would make a parliamentary inquiry. Am I correct in \nconcluding that all of the necessary steps and procedures have occurred \nto assure that this bill has been passed and that Senate action on S. \n2949 is now complete?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Ms. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  I appreciate the cooperation of my colleagues. I thank Senator Reid \nfor helping me in this wrap-up. I know he has not yet come to the \nfloor, but I know that he helped us in clearing this bill. This bill \nhas been cleared by unanimous consent. It is a very important step in \nsecuring our homeland. We have taken great strides to secure our \nairports and the passenger screening is quite thorough. Everybody has \nto smile when you say that, because anyone who has flown in America in \nthe last 6 months has certainly been subjected to a lot of scrutiny. I \nhave certainly been frisked. I have had my shoes taken off, all of \nthose things that drive people crazy. But the bottom line is, we do \nhave a safer system. We got the wake-up call on 9/11 of 2001. We have \ntaken extraordinary steps to secure our country and our aviation \nsystem. Anyone who says our system is not safer today than it was on \nSeptember 10 of 2001 either has not flown or is being disingenuous.\n  I would like to thank Admiral Loy at the Transportation Security \nAdministration, and certainly Secretary Mineta and President Bush for \ntheir strong leadership in homeland and transportation security. We are \ngoing to do everything we can to make sure our people are safe.\n  The port security bill was a huge step in the right direction. I have \none of the largest petrochemical complexes in the world in Houston, TX. \nI want to make sure they had all the authority and resources they need \nto secure that port. In fact, just this week, I talked to the people \nfrom the Port of Houston, and they are taking steps on their own. We \nneed to help them at the Federal level to improve security, but they \nare not waiting for us to act. They know the importance of this issue \nbecause they are on the front lines, hearing of new threats from Osama \nbin Laden just recently. So they are battening down the hatches.\n  We are going to do the same thing with air cargo in the bill we just \npassed. If the House does come back this year, I will urge my \ncolleagues in the House to look at this bill and try to work with us to \nmake sure the belly of the airplane is just as safe as the passenger \ncabin is today. All of us want that to happen. I appreciate everybody's \ncooperation in passing this very important piece of legislation. Mr. \nPresident, I look forward to chairing the Aviation Subcommittee next \nyear, working with Senator Rockefeller, my ranking member, with whom I \nhave had a great working relationship. We have passed the aviation \nsecurity measure that is the law today. We worked together to pass the \nport security bill.\n\n  Senator Rockefeller and I have a great vision for what we can do in \naviation to make our system not only secure and safe for the traveling \npublic, but also economically viable. Without an aviation industry, \nthis country would lose in commerce and in the freedom of our people to \ntravel. Our country is vast and we need aviation. I am looking forward \nto chairing that Subcommittee with Senator Rockefeller and working to \ntry to make sure that we maintain an economically viable aviation \nindustry that is safe and secure for the traveling public, and for the \ngoods that comprise our commerce.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on S. 2949, the Aviation \nSecurity Improvement Act. This bill builds and improves upon work that \nbegan last year when Congress passed the Aviation and Transportation \nSecurity Act, ATSA, P.L. 107-71. During the 10 months since that law's \nenactment, there has been a significant change in the way aviation \nsecurity is handled. However, there is a long way to go until we \nachieve all our aviation security goals. I believe the bill before us \nwould make many positive steps in the continuing effort to protect the \nnation's air transportation system. This bill also contains the text of \nS. 2950, the National Transportation Safety Board Reauthorization.\n  I want to begin by commending Senators Hutchison and Snowe for their \nwork on the air cargo security issue addressed in this legislation. The \ncargo provisions flow directly from their bills and would bolster an \naspect of aviation security that was not addressed in great detail in \nlast year's law. This is one area in which we can and should be \nproactive to get ahead of potential problems or vulnerabilities.\n  There is a particular issue in this bill that I want to discuss \nbriefly. In last year's security bill, we mandated that airport \nscreeners had to be U.S. citizens. While imposing that requirement was \nan understandable impulse, it had some negative ramifications that were \nnot clear at the time. For example, American Samoans are not now \neligible to be screeners because they are considered nationals, not \ncitizens.\n  S. 2949 includes a provision to allow nationals of the U.S., \nhonorably discharged veterans of the U.S. military, and lawful \npermanent residents who were employed as airport security screeners at \nthe time of ATSA's enactment, to be eligible to compete for jobs\n\n[[Page S11306]]\n\nas federal security screeners. The provision would not require that \nthese individuals be hired, but give TSA the discretion to hire them if \nthey meet all the other statutory requirements concerning the hiring of \nscreeners. This is a fair and reasonable expansion of the existing \nprovision.\n  A similar provision was added to the Homeland Security bill. However, \nthe provision in the Homeland Security bill only expands the definition \nto include U.S. nationals. It would still exclude an important segment \nof the population-legal permanent residents. LPRs as they are known, \ncan join the military and risk giving up their lives fighting for our \ncountry. Yet, to date, they cannot be hired as security screeners. This \nis wrong, and we should correct it now.\n  In addition, S. 2949 would reauthorize the National Transportation \nSafety Board. The NTSB is an independent Federal agency charged with \ninvestigating every civil aviation accident in the United States. It \nalso investigates significant accidents in the other modes of \ntransportation--railorad, highway, marine, and pipeline--and issuing \nsafety recommendations intended to prevent future accidents. We are all \naware of the important role the NTSB plays in the safety of our \ntransportation system, and it is important that we move ahead with this \nreauthorizing legislation.\n  A key element of this bill involves authorization for the NTSB's new \nTraining Academy, which will be the centerpiece of its teaching and \ntraining of transportation accident investigators worldwide. It also \nwill provide state-of-the-art classrooms and laboratory space for \naccident investigation. This is especially important with the advent of \nnew technology that is being used to build, fuel, and more all modes of \ntransportation.\n  The legislation also would streamline the NTSB's procurement process \nduring accident investigations and allow the Board to transfer its \nfamily assistance responsibilities to any Federal agency that takes \nover an investigation, such as the FBI, provided that the other agency \nis willing and able to handle those duties. Finally the bill would \nreauthorize the NTSB's funding for its day to day activities.\n  The importance of the agency is well known to all. I urge the support \nof this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/18/senate-section/article/S11306-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE CONFIRMATION OF MICHAEL McCONNELL TO THE 10TH CIRCUIT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last Friday, the Senate approved the \nnomination of Michael McConnell to the United States Court of Appeals \nfor the Tenth Circuit. As a professor, first at the University of \nChicago, and then at the University of Utah, Mr. McConnell has been a \nstrong voice for reexamining First Amendment jurisprudence of Free \nExercise Clause and the Establishment Clause. He has expressed strong \npersonal opposition to abortion to Roe v. Wade, to the clinic access \nlaw. He has testified before the Congress against the Violence Against \nWomen Act on the grounds that it was unconstitutional.\n  Each of these issues was explored to some degree at his hearing \nbefore the Judiciary Committee and in follow up written questions. No \none doubts that Professor McConnell is personable and intelligent. No \none doubts that he is an outstanding and provocative professor. I see \nwhy so many of his law professor colleagues like him and have endorsed \nhis nomination. But the Judiciary Committee also received letters from \nhundreds of law professors reminding us that the burden of persuasion \non lifetime judicial appointments should be on the nominee, as well as \na recent letter signed by hundreds of law professors opposing \nconfirmation of Professor McConnell.\n  The question I was left with after his nomination hearing was whether \nwe had witnessed another confirmation conversion. Stated another way, I \nremain very concerned that Professor McConnell may turn out to be an \nactivist on the 10th Circuit.\n  For instance, I still have a hard time reading his writing on the \nactions of Federal District Court Judge John Sprizzo in acquitting \nabortion protesters as anything other than praise for the extra-legal \nbehavior of both the defendants and the judge. Even though Professor \nMcConnell has now been confirmed, I continue to be concerned that he \nappeared to commend a judge and regard him as a hero for not following \nthe law.\n  I find his responses regarding the Violence Against Women Act \nconvenient.\n  I see his refusal to take responsibility for his harsh criticism of \nthe Supreme Court's decision in the Bob Jones case as an attempt to \ndistance himself from his prior approval of the ability of religious \ninstitutions to discriminate on the basis of race, even if they are \nreceiving benefits from the Government.\n  At his hearing, and in follow-up written questions, Professor \nMcConnell sought to assure us that he understands the difference \nbetween his role as a teacher and advocate and his future role as a \njudge. He assured us that he respects the doctrine of stare decisis, \nand that as a Federal appeals court judge, he will be bound to follow \nSupreme Court precedent.\n  Although many of President Clinton's nominees who assured the Senate \nof these same things when they were nominated were discredited and not \nconsidered, this nomination has moved forward and been approved.\n  I reluctantly supported this nomination to the 10th Circuit based on \nProfessor McConnell's assurances. I trust that he will not seek to \nundermine women's reproductive rights derived from the Constitution and \narticulated in Roe v. Wade. I trust that as an appeals court judge he \nwill divorce his personal views on abortion and on racial \ndiscrimination in religious institutions from his decisions as a judge, \nand that he will act to uphold existing law. I trust that he will not \nseek to circumvent the doctrine of stare decisis and that he will not \nwork to change the law through activism on the bench.\n  There are already admirers who predict that Professor McConnell is \ndestined for a short stop at the 10th Circuit on the way to a Supreme \nCourt nomination. I do not speculate about such things. Professor \nMcConnell has yet to create a record on the 10th Circuit. I mention it \nonly to note that no one should confuse my support of Professor \nMcConnell's nomination to the 10th Circuit as an endorsement or \napproval for any other position.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/18/senate-section/article/S11306-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11306-S11307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN REMEMBRANCE OF PAUL WELLSTONE\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, like all of my colleagues, I was shocked \nand deeply saddened by the tragic accident that claimed the life of \nSenator Wellstone, his wife Sheila, their daughter Marcia, two pilots, \nand three members of Paul's staff. My heart goes out to the families \nand they will remain in my thoughts and prayers.\n  It was always a privilege working with Senator Wellstone. In fact, \none of the last images I have of him was in the final days of the \nsession, when I encountered him coming up the aisle in the Senate \nChamber after a vote with his typical boundless energy, warm smile, and \nfriendly greeting. He was a compassionate, honorable man--and it was \nobvious to all of us that, together, Paul and Sheila made an \nextraordinary and loving team.\n  As a public servant, Senator Wellstone's most enduring legacy will \nsurely be his career of conscience in elective office. With his \nunwavering passion and integrity, he was highly respected and will be \nlong remembered.\n  With both of us hailing from northern border States, we shared the \nsame perspective on a number of issues such as the reimportation of \nprescription drugs, and we worked together over the years to ensure the \ncritical low-income energy program, LIHEAP, would be there for the \npeople of Maine and Minnesota.\n  I was proud to serve with him on the Small Business Committee where I \nsaw his diligence and tenaciousness firsthand, and to work with him on \nissues of importance to our veterans such as a bill establishing July \n16 as a National Day of Remembrance for Atomic Veterans, as well as a \nmeasure providing for increases in veterans spending. I was also \npleased to help champion his and Senator Domenici's legislation to \ncreate mental health parity--a perfect illustration of his compassion \nand the causes for which he felt duty-bound to fight.\n  Indeed, all of us and, most importantly, the people of Minnesota \ncould count on Paul to stand up for his deeply held beliefs, speaking \nalways from\n\n[[Page S11307]]\n\nthe courage of his convictions. He personified the notion of being able \nto disagree--even vehemently--without being disagreeable.\n  In fact, I cannot help but recall that when Senators were offering \ntheir appreciation to Senator Helms upon the occasion of his \nretirement, Senator Wellstone offered very heartfelt and touching \nwords. He acknowledged that he and Senator Helms often differed on the \nissues. But Paul respected the purity of the convictions of his \ncolleague across the aisle--and he wished him well.\n  Now, it is Paul Wellstone who has left our midst, and the entire \nSenate family shares in the sense of loss. We have a desk that was once \nfilled with Paul's irrepressible spirit, and it strikes me that Paul \nWellstone perished in pursuit of the very ideal he held to be so noble \nand worthy--public service.\n  This institution is always at its strongest when it is populated with \nmen and women of Paul Wellstone's authenticity. We are diminished by \nhis passing, and he will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/18/senate-section/article/S11307-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11307-S11308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONFIRMATION OF JOHN ROGERS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week the Senate voted to confirm the \nnomination of John Rogers who is nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Sixth Circuit. By confirming this nomination, we are trying to \nmove forward in providing help to the Sixth Circuit. Earlier this year, \nwe held a hearing for Judge Julia Gibbons to a seat on the Sixth \nCircuit, who was confirmed by the Senate on July 29, 2002 by a vote of \n95 to 0. With last night's vote, the Democratic-led Senate confirmed \nthe 15th judge to our federal Courts of Appeal and our 98th judicial \nnominee since the change in Senate majority in July 2001. I have placed \na separate statement in the Record on the occasion of confirming that \nmany of this President's judicial nominees in just 16 months.\n  Republicans often say that almost half of the seats on the Sixth \nCircuit are vacant but what they fail to acknowledge is that most of \nthose vacancies arose during the Clinton administration and before the \nchange in majority last summer. None, zero, not one of the Clinton \nnominees to those current vacancies on the Sixth Circuit received a \nhearing by the Judiciary Committee under Republican leadership. With \nthe confirmation of Professor Rogers, we have reduced the number of \nvacancies on that court to six, but four of those remaining lack home-\nState consent due to the President's failure to address the legitimate \nconcerns of Senators in that circuit whose nominees were blocked by \nRepublicans during the period of Republican control of the Senate.\n  The Sixth Circuit vacancies are a prime and unfortunate legacy of the \npast partisan obstructionist practices under Republican leadership. \nVacancies on the Sixth Circuit were perpetuated during the last several \nyears of the Clinton administration when the Republican majority \nrefused to hold hearings on the nominations of Judge Helene White, \nKathleen McCree Lewis and Professor Kent Markus to vacancies in the \nSixth Circuit.\n  One of those seats has been vacant since 1995, the first term of \nPresident Clinton. Judge Helene White of the Michigan Court of Appeals \nwas nominated in January 1997 and did not receive a hearing on her \nnomination during the more than 1,500 days before her nomination was \nwithdrawn by President Bush in March of last year. Judge White's \nnomination may have set an unfortunate record.\n  Her nomination was pending without a hearing for over four years--51 \nmonths. She was first nominated in January 1997 and renominated and \nrenominated through March of last year when President Bush chose to \nwithdraw her nomination. Under Republican control, the Committee \naveraged hearings on only about eight Courts of Appeals nominees a year \nand, in 2000, held only five hearings on Courts of Appeals nominees all \nyear.\n  In contrast, Professor Rogers was the fifteenth Court of Appeals \nnominee of President Bush to receive a hearing by the Committee in less \nthan a year since the reorganization of the Senate Judiciary Committee. \nIn 16 months we held hearings on 20 circuit court nominations. \nProfessor Rogers was being treated much better than Kathleen McCree \nLewis, a distinguished African American lawyer from a prestigious \nMichigan law firm. She never had a hearing on her 1999 nomination to \nthe Sixth Circuit during the years it was pending before it was \nwithdrawn by President Bush in March 2001.\n  Professor Kent Markus, another outstanding nominee to a vacancy on \nthe Sixth Circuit that arose in 1999, never received a hearing on his \nnomination before his nomination was returned to President Clinton \nwithout action in December 2000. While Professor Markus' nomination was \npending, his confirmation was supported by individuals of every \npolitical stripe, including 14 past presidents of the Ohio State Bar \nAssociation and more than 80 Ohio law school deans and professors.\n  Others who supported Professor Markus include prominent Ohio \nRepublicans, including Ohio Supreme Court Chief Justice Thomas Moyer, \nOhio Supreme Court Justice Evelyn Stratton, Congresswoman Deborah \nPryce, and Congressman David Hobson, the National District Attorneys \nAssociation, and virtually every major newspaper in the state.\n  In his testimony to the Senate in May, Professor Markus summarized \nhis experience as a Federal judicial nominee, demonstrating how the \n``history regarding the current vacancy backlog is being obscured by \nsome.'' Here are some of things he said:\n\n       On February 9, 2000, I was the President's first judicial \n     nominee in that calendar year. And then the waiting began. . \n     . .\n       At the time my nomination was pending, despite lower \n     vacancy rates than the 6th Circuit, in calendar year 2000, \n     the Senate confirmed circuit nominees to the 3rd, 9th and \n     Federal Circuits. . . . No 6th circuit nominee had been \n     afforded a hearing in the prior two years. Of the nominees \n     awaiting a Judiciary Committee hearing, there was no circuit \n     with more nominees than the 6th Circuit.\n       With high vacancies already impacting the 6th Circuit's \n     performance, and more vacancies on the way, why, then, did my \n     nomination expire without even a hearing? To their credit, \n     Senator DeWine and his staff and Senator Hatch's staff and \n     others close to him were straight with me.\n       Over and over again they told me two things: 1. There will \n     be no more confirmations to the 6th Circuit during the \n     Clinton administration[.] 2. This has nothing to do with you; \n     don't take it personally--it doesn't matter who the nominee \n     is, what credentials they may have or what support they may \n     have--see item number 1. . . .\n       The fact was, a decision had been made to hold the \n     vacancies and see who won the presidential election. With a \n     Bush win, all those seats could go to Bush rather than \n     Clinton nominees.\n\n  As Professor Markus identified, some on the other side of the aisle \nheld these seats open for years for another President to fill, instead \nof proceeding fairly on the consensus nominees pending before the \nSenate. Some were unwilling to move forward, knowing that retirements \nand attrition would create four additional seats that would arise \nnaturally for the next President. That is why there are now so many \nvacancies on the Sixth Circuit.\n  Had Republicans not blocked President Clinton's nominees to this \ncourt, if the three Democratic nominees had been confirmed and \nPresident Bush appointed the judges to the other vacancies on the Sixth \nCircuit, that court would be almost evenly balanced between judges \nappointed by Republicans and Democrats. That is what Republican \nobstruction was designed to avoid, balance. The same is true of a \nnumber of other circuits, with Republicans benefitting from their \nobstructionist practices of the preceding six and a half years. This \ncombined with President Bush's refusal to consult with Democratic \nSenators about these matters is particularly troubling.\n  Long before some of the recent voices of concern were raised about \nthe vacancies on that court, Democratic Senators in 1997, 1998, 1999, \nand 2000 implored the Republican majority to give the Sixth Circuit \nnominees hearings. Those requests, made not just for the sake of the \nnominees but for the sake of the public's business before the court, \nwere ignored. Numerous articles and editorials urged the Republican \nleadership to act on those nominations.\n  Fourteen former presidents of the Michigan State Bar pleaded for \nhearings on those nominations. The former Chief Judge of the Sixth \nCircuit, Judge Gilbert Merritt, wrote to the Judiciary Committee \nChairman years ago to ask that the nominees get hearings and\n\n[[Page S11308]]\n\nthat the vacancies be filled. The Chief Judge noted that, with four \nvacancies, the four vacancies that arose in the Clinton Administration, \nthe Sixth Circuit ``is hurting badly and will not be able to keep up \nwith its work load due to the fact that the Senate Judiciary Committee \nhas acted on none of the nominations to our Court.'' He predicted: ``By \nthe time the next President in inaugurated, there will be six vacancies \non the Court of Appeals. Almost half of the Court will be vacant and \nwill remain so for most of 2001 due to the exigencies of the nomination \nprocess. Although the President has nominated candidates, the Senate \nhas refused to take a vote on any of them.''\n  However, no Sixth Circuit hearings were held in the last three full \nyears of the Clinton Administration (almost his entire second \npresidential term), despite these pleas. Not one. Since the shift in \nmajority last summer, the situation has been exacerbated further as two \nadditional vacancies have arisen.\n  The Committee's April 25th hearing on the nomination of Judge Gibbons \nto the Sixth Circuit was the first hearing on a Sixth Circuit \nnomination in almost five years, even though three outstanding, fair-\nminded individuals were nominated to the Sixth Circuit by President \nClinton and pending before the Committee for anywhere from one year to \nover four years. Judge Gibbons was confirmed by the Senate on July 29, \n2002, by a vote of 95 to 0. We did not stop there, but proceeded to \nhold a hearing on a second Sixth Circuit nominee, Professor Rogers, \njust a few short months later in June.\n  Just as we held the first hearing on a Sixth Circuit nominee in many \nyears, the hearing we held on the nomination of Judge Edith Clement to \nthe Fifth Circuit last year was the first on a Fifth Circuit nominee in \nseven years and she was the first new appellate judge confirmed to that \nCourt in six years.\n  When we held a hearing on the nomination of Judge Harris Hartz to the \nTenth Circuit last year, it was the first hearing on a Tenth Circuit \nnominee in six years and he was the first new appellate judge confirmed \nto that Court in six years. When we held the hearing on the nomination \nof Judge Roger Gregory to the Fourth Circuit last year, it was the \nfirst hearing on a Fourth Circuit nominee in three years and he was the \nfirst appellate judge confirmed to that court in three years.\n  A number of vacancies continue to exist on many Courts of Appeals, in \nlarge measure because the recent Republican majority was not willing to \nhold hearings or vote on half--56 percent--of President Clinton's \nCourts of Appeals nominees in 1999 and 2000 and was not willing to \nconfirm a single judge to the Courts of Appeals during the entire 1996 \nsession.\n  From the time the Republicans took over the Senate in 1995 until the \nreorganization of the Committee last July, circuit vacancies increased \nfrom 16 to 33, more than doubling. Democrats have broken with that \nrecent history of inaction. In the last 16 months, we have held 26 \njudicial nominations hearing, including 20 hearings for circuit court \nnominees.\n  Professor Roger's nomination was also the fourth judicial nomination \nfrom Kentucky to be considered by the Committee in its first year, and \nthe eighth nomination from Kentucky overall. There are no judicial \nvacancies left in the State.\n  Professor Rogers of the University of Kentucky College of Law has \nexperience as an appellate litigator and a teacher, and is a prolific \nauthor on a number of difficult legal topics. It is important to note \nthat aspects of his record raise concerns. As a professor, he has been \na strong proponent of judicial activism. No Clinton judicial nominee \nwith such published views would ever have been confirmed during the \nperiod of Republican control. In his writings, Professor Rogers has \ncalled on lower court judges to reverse higher court precedents, if the \nlower court judge thinks the higher court will ultimate reverse its own \nprecedent. Such an activist approach is inappropriate in the lower \nFederal courts. The Supreme Court itself has noted that lower courts \nshould follow Supreme Court precedent and not anticipate future \ndecisions in which the Supreme Court may exercise its prerogative to \noverrule itself.\n  Prognostications about how the Supreme Court will rule often turns \nout to be wrong. For example, some predicted that the Supreme Court \nwould overturned Miranda, but the Supreme Court, in an opinion by Chief \nJustice Rehnquist, declined to do so. Similarly, people like Professor \nRogers have called on the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, but \nthus far the Supreme Court has rejected calls to reverse itself in this \nimportant decision regarding the rights of women and has resisted calls \nto return this country to the awful period of dangerous back alley \nabortions.\n  Professor Rogers also suggested in his academic writings that lower \ncourt judges should consider the political views of Justices in making \nthe determination of when lower courts should overrule Supreme Court \nprecedent. In his answers to the Committee, Professor Rogers \nacknowledged that he had taken that position but he now says that lower \ncourts should not look to the views of Justices expressed in speeches \nor settings other than their opinions. Also, in his answers to the \nCommittee, Professor Rogers said he would give great weight to Supreme \nCourt dicta, or arguments that are not part of the holding of the case. \nI would like to take this opportunity to urge him to take seriously the \nobligation of a judge to follow precedent and the holdings of the \nSupreme Court, rather than to look to dicta for views that may support \nhis own personal views. I would also urge him resist acting on his \nacademic notion that a judge should diverge from precedent when he \nanticipates that the Supreme Court may eventually do so.\n  Professor Rogers has assured us that he would follow precedent and \nnot overrule higher courts, despite his clear advocacy of that position \nin his writings as a scholar. He has sworn under oath that he would not \nfollow the approach that he long advocated. As with President Bush's \nEighth Circuit nominee Lavenski Smith, who was confirmed earlier this \nsummer, I am hopeful that Professor Rogers will be a person of his \nword: that he will follow the law and not seek out opportunities to \noverturn precedent or decide cases in accord with his private beliefs \nrather than his obligations as a judge.\n  I would also note that during his tenure at the Justice Department, \nProfessor Rogers appeared to support an expansive view of the power of \nthe Executive Branch vis-a-vis Congress. I am hopeful, however, that \nProfessor Rogers will recognize the important difference between being \na zealous advocate for such positions and being a fair and impartial \njudge sworn to follow precedents and the law.\n  When he was asked to describe any work he had handled which was not \npopular but was nevertheless important, he said that the case which \ncame to mind was one in which he defended the CIA against a lawsuit \nseeking damages for the CIA's illegal opening of the private mail of \ntens of thousands of U.S. citizens during this 1970s or 1980s. Those \nwere dark days of overreaching by the intelligence community against \nthe rights of ordinary law-abiding American citizens. Although times \nhave changed forever since the tragic events of September 11, I think \nit is important that the American people have access to judges who will \nuphold the Constitution against government excesses while also giving \nacts of Congress the presumption of constitutionality to which our laws \nare entitled by precedent.\n  Professor Rogers has repeatedly assured the Committee, however, that \nhe would follow precedent and not seek to overturn decisions affecting \nthe privacy of women or any other decision of the Supreme Court. \nSenator McConnell has also personally assured me that Professor Rogers \nwill not be an activist but is sincerely committed to following \nprecedent if he is confirmed. I sincerely hope that his decisions on \nthe Sixth Circuit do not prove us wrong.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/18/senate-section/article/S11308-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11308-S11309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, 20 years ago, President Reagan signed a \nproclamation designating the first National Alzheimer's Awareness Week. \nToday, as part of this year's National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness \nMonth, I would like to commend and thank all those who have worked to \nbattle this terrible disease.\n  As the chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee that oversees \nfunding for the National Institutes of Health, and someone who has \nwatched many close friends succumb to Alzheimer's over the years, I \nhave learned perhaps more than I wish I knew about this disease. In \n1982, 2 million people suffered from Alzheimer's; today, the number is \n4 million. By the year 2050, that number will rise to 14 million, and \nwe will be paying $357 billion a year in health care costs, unless \nscience can find a way to prevent or delay this disease.\n  Fortunately, that goal is in sight. Researchers are finally closing \nin on what causes Alzheimer's; they are using cutting-edge brain \nimaging to figure out how to diagnose it; and they are studying \neverything from folic acid and statins to Advil and gingko biloba to \nsee if any of these drugs and supplements can help delay it.\n  Much of that research would not have been possible without the \nsubstantial increase in Federal funding that Senator Specter and I, \nworking together on the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation Appropriations Subcommittee, have secured for NIH. In fiscal \nyear 1998, when we began our bipartisan effort to double the NIH's \nbudget, NIH spent $356 million on Alzheimer's disease. When Congress \ncompletes the doubling effort this year, that number will rise to \nalmost $650 million.\n  But it is still not enough. We need to raise that total to $1 billion \nas soon as possible, if we're really going to be serious about reducing \nthe physical and economic costs of Alzheimer's. According to experts, \ndelaying the onset and progression of Alzheimer's for even 5 years \ncould save as much as $50 billion in annual health care costs. \nPresident Reagan's son-in-law, Dennis C. Revell, makes an excellent \ncase for investing more money in Alzheimer's research in an op-ed in \ntoday's Washington Times.\n  In the meantime, we are fortunate that so many people across this \ncountry are working to support Alzheimer's research and care. I have \nworked for many years with the national Alzheimer's Association, as \nwell as with their local chapters in Iowa, and I can tell you firsthand \nthat they will not rest until scientists find a cure. As the Nation \nrecognizes Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month throughout November, I \nthank them for their dedication.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Alzheimer's Disease\n\n                         (By Dennis C. Revell)\n\n       ``That's the worst part of this disease. There's nobody to \n     exchange memories with.'' (Nancy Reagan, Sept. 25, ``60 \n     Minutes II.'')\n       Alzheimer's disease doesn't make special arrangements for \n     anyone, even for the leader of the free world. In tragic \n     irony, 20 years ago this week President Reagan launched a \n     national campaign against Alzheimer's disease. In a historic \n     White House ceremony, he drew national attention to \n     Alzheimer's and defined it as a major health menace. He \n     proclaimed November National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness \n     Month, warning the American people of ``the emotional, \n     financial and social consequences of Alzheimer's disease.'' \n     With vision and leadership, he argued for research as ``the \n     only hope for victims and families.''\n       The brain is a miracle when it works, and a mystery when it \n     fails. One of the most haunting, puzzling, and soon to be \n     most costly of the brain's failures is Alzheimer's--a \n     degenerative, progressive, and terminal brain disorder.\n       Most people think of Alzheimer's strictly as memory loss. \n     It is much more, although memory loss alone would be scary \n     enough. Memories are the records of our lives--the essential \n     stuff of our identities and personalities--the very essence \n     of what we share with those we love.\n       On Nov. 5, 1994, Ronald Reagan wrote a courageous letter to \n     the American people about his own diagnosis of Alzheimer's, \n     and his 1982 presidential campaign against the disease became \n     his family's personal struggle.\n       We have made giant strides toward fulfilling his vision, \n     and now this Congress and President Bush have the opportunity \n     to finish the battle he began. Congress has steadily invested \n     public funds in Alzheimer's research over the past 20 years \n     and the Alzheimer's Association has added millions in private \n     funds.\n       That investment in research is now paying off. Science is \n     at the point where effective treatment and prevention of \n     Alzheimer's is within reach. The research infrastructure \n     is in place; the paths for further investigation are \n     clear. The missing ingredient is money. A $1 billion \n     federal investment now will pay big dividends in the \n     future.\n       When Ronald Reagan sounded his battle cry against \n     Alzheimer's, an estimated 2 million people were suffering \n     from this awful disease. Today, the number has grown to more \n     than 4 million, with an additional 19 million family members \n     suffering the emotional and financial impact--24 hours a day, \n     seven days a week, 365 days a year.\n       Unfortunately, over the next 50 years, as many as 14 \n     million baby boomers will be the next large pool of victims, \n     unless we find ways to further slow down or stop the changes \n     in their brains that might already be taking place.\n       The threat to so many American families should be enough to \n     urge us to action, but the economic impact of the disease \n     drives us as well. In just 10 years, the annual cost of \n     Alzheimer's disease to Medicare and Medicaid will rise from \n     $50 billion to more than $82 billion. Since 1998, estimates \n     of the annual cost of Alzheimer's disease to American \n     business have risen from $33 billion to more than $61 \n     billion.\n       During this Alzheimer's Awareness Month, we reflect upon \n     the extraordinary progress we have made as a nation these \n     past 20 years:\n       Twenty years ago, there were no treatments for Alzheimer's \n     disease; today, four Alzheimer drugs have been approved, and \n     researchers are working to bring even more promising \n     treatments, including a potential vaccine, to market.\n       Twenty years ago, we had little information on risk factors \n     to point the way to prevention; today, there is growing \n     evidence that known risk factors for heart disease, including \n     high blood pressure and high cholesterol, may also increase \n     the risk for Alzheimer's.\n       Twenty years ago, only a handful of scientists were \n     studying Alzheimer's; now, thousands of scientists around the \n     world are racing to find the answers.\n       Twenty years ago, Alzheimer scientists were working in \n     isolation; today, 33 Alzheimer's disease centers are funded \n     by the National Institute on Aging, where scientists \n     collaborate to speed the search.\n       We are so close. Thanks to the dynamics Ronald Reagan set \n     in motion two decades ago, science has changed the view of \n     Alzheimer's disease from one of helplessness to one of hope. \n     But this is no time to sit back and rest on a sense of \n     accomplishment.\n       The answer is still research, research, and more research. \n     Individuals and families living with the disease research. \n     Individuals and families living with the disease have joined \n     the Alzheimer's Association in challenging Mr. Bush and \n     Congress to increase the federal commitment to Alzheimer \n     research.\n       We call on Congress to increase funding for the National \n     Institutes of Health to $1 billion a year to continue the \n     momentum in Alzheimer research. We call upon Mr. Bush to make \n     this important cause his own by including in his budget for \n     next year the necessary funds to accelerate the pace of \n     research.\n       We are in a race against time. Without sufficient research \n     resources now, we will lose that race.\n       We can change the course of Alzheimer's disease, for the 4 \n     million people suffering today, for the 19 million family \n     members who are caring for them, and for up to 14 million \n     Americans who today face the fate that befell a man who means \n     so much to us and to the world.\n       Testifying before the Senate about Alzheimer's disease \n     shortly before her own death, Maureen Reagan took up her \n     father's mission, calling upon Congress to ``make this the \n     last generation that would live without hope.''\n       Both Ronald Reagan and Maureen always looked to a brighter \n     horizon. Congress and Mr. Bush can ensure that we reach that \n     horizon before the sun sets on another generation with \n     Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/18/senate-section/article/S11310-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11310]]\n                THE SCHOLAR RESCUE FUND ALUMNI RESEARCH\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, next year I intend to speak more about the \nScholar Rescue Fund Alumni Research Program.\n  I am aware of this through my friendship with Dr. Henry Jarecki. I \nbelieve that it is something more Senators should be aware of, and \nsomething that would appeal to Senators in both parties. Perhaps one of \nthe best ways to describe it would be to include in the Record remarks, \nby Dr. Jarecki, and I so ask unanimous consent to have those remarks \nprinted.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Allan Goodman has, in introducing me, spoken of the fact \n     that I accepted Henry Kaufman's mandate to help develop the \n     IIE's newly-established Scholar Rescue Fund. Doing what Henry \n     tells me to do is easy for me and this mandate was even \n     easier: I have been a refugee and I am an academic; and the \n     risks of free speech are tattooed on the skin of my relatives \n     and on my mind. I wanted to start immediately.\n       When I came to talk to Allan about the program, he was as \n     enthusiastic as I was but wondered whether we should wait \n     with the start until we had the endowment funds to make sure \n     that the program would last. His comments sounded so sensible \n     that I didn't at first know what to say. But that, as people \n     who know me, didn't last too long.\n       I told him how, in 1937, Franklin Roosevelt had convened a \n     conference of representatives from 80 countries in Evian, \n     France, to encourage them to accept Hitler's Jews, and how \n     speaker after speaker had praised President Roosevelt's \n     wonderful idea but said that, unfortunately, his particular \n     country could not take part at that moment because of a \n     unique problem they were having in his particular country \n     just at that particular time. Finally, the representative of \n     Rafael Trujillo, then known as the Butcher of Santo Domingo \n     for having machine-gunned hundreds of Haitian refugees who \n     tried to cross the border into the Dominican Republic, got up \n     to speak. Trujillo was, understandably enough, in bad odor \n     all over the world and so he tried to make amends by letting \n     his representative announce that Trujillo had agreed to let \n     100,000 of the refugees settle in the Dominican Republic.\n       The world's refugee organizations then set to work to make \n     sure that it all went well. They started by developing \n     precise criteria: how many merchants, how many farmers, and \n     what ages they should be; how many married and unmarried and \n     a lot more. By the middle of 1938 they had developed their \n     criteria and started to interview prospective candidates for \n     the trip. By that time, it was a lot easier to interview \n     candidates because many of them were already in concentration \n     camps. Over the next 9 months, these careful choosers found \n     900 who could go to the Dominican Republic, where most of \n     them settled in a small town called Sosua and survived the \n     war. Over 99,000 were left behind to die.\n       When I got through with my story, Allan told me to get on \n     with it and get on with it we have after I found generous \n     kindred spirits in my fellow Trustee Jeffrey Epstein and in \n     George Soros, both of whom I want not to thank in the name of \n     persecuted scholars in over 60 countries from whom we now \n     have requests for help. Sixty countries! What are they \n     thinking of? How can benighted tyrants and despots be smart \n     enough to know how powerful free-thinking scholars can be? \n     And how they must intimidate them into silence. ``They kill \n     your voice even before their kill you,'' said Maimul Khan, a \n     rescued scholar from Bangladesh who is here with us tonight.\n       I learned a lot from Allan's first reaction. It made me \n     understand how important it would be to find financial and \n     popular support for IIE programs that did not yet have \n     endowment or government backing. Back in the 30's when we \n     were raising money on our own, we made and carried out the \n     decision to bring European scholars to the States. We only \n     had enough money to bring out 300 of them but that was enough \n     to help found a graduate facility at the New School here in \n     New York.\n       This story from the thirties was just one of the many \n     stories I heard when I first joined the Board of IIE a few \n     years ago. I was impressed with the history of the Institute \n     which has undertaken hundreds of educational programs in its \n     80 years of existence, including the ``crown jewel'' of \n     such programs, the Fulbright Program that it has \n     administered on behalf of the Department of State since \n     that program's inception. With the help of its sponsors \n     and donors, the IIE has had an essential role in the \n     growth and development of hundreds of thousands of people \n     who are today leaders in every field of endeavor--be it \n     government, science, academe or business.\n       Just two weeks ago, three scientists were awarded the Nobel \n     Prize; two of them for their work on neutrinos, particles so \n     small that they are virtually impossible to detect. The one \n     from Japan and the one from Italy were Fulbrighters who \n     studied here in the Fifties. Last year, too, two Nobel Prize \n     winners for economics were Fulbrighters.\n       In your program this evening is a list of all of the \n     Fulbrighters and other IIE participants who, like our \n     founders Elihu Root and Nicholas Murray Butler, have been \n     awarded the Nobel Prize. It is an impressive roster of a \n     small subset of the IIE alumni network.\n       While I was learning about our history, I discovered that \n     my mentor and Chairman at Yale, the renowned psychiatrist \n     Fritz Redlich, had first visited the United States in 1930 on \n     an IIE program which brought him for a year from Vienna to \n     the University of Iowa. Fritz told me that in 1938, when he \n     recognized that he had to leave Vienna or go to a \n     concentration camp, his sponsor at Iowa was the only American \n     he knew who could provide him the ``affidavit'' required by \n     the U.S. government--the document that I and all other \n     refugees knew so well as committing the person who signed it \n     to not letting the recipient end up on welfare, a charge to \n     the state.\n       Fritz came here, became a professor at Yale, then head of \n     the Department of Psychiatry and eventually Dean of the Yale \n     Medical School. He was a brilliant and caring doctor who \n     wrote extensively on whether the poor got the same treatment, \n     or even the same diagnoses, as the rich. And he was, like me, \n     an iconoclast. It was he who brought me to Yale, a fact that \n     has had such a strong influence on my own life.\n       Fritz was, of course, not the only scholar who was rescued \n     from Hitler's Germany and the countries falling to Nazi \n     control. As I mentioned before, the Institute's ``University \n     in Exile'' program brought more scholars to America, enough \n     indeed to form the graduate faculty of the New School \n     University here in New York, a university which to this day \n     remains a vibrant academic institution.\n       The list of IIE alumni is not limited to scholars fleeing \n     persecution or Nobel Prize winners, however; it would fill a \n     ``Who's Who'' of world leaders: Valery Giscard d'Estang, \n     former President of France; Margaret Thatcher, former Prime \n     Minister of England; 10 Heads of State, 56 Ambassadors, 44 \n     Nobel Laureates, 115 University presidents, and 400,000 more \n     men and women who have been educationally enriched by the \n     experience we helped them to have.\n       The accomplishments of the IIE Alumni Network have indeed \n     been so illustrious that their stories seemed to me a natural \n     way to explain to the world just why international education \n     was so valuable and to obtain popular support for our \n     educational and humanitarian programs. To make sure that an \n     understanding of this network was available to us all, I \n     accepted Tom Russo's and Allan Goodman's challenge to \n     establish and codify an IIE Alumni database.\n       We will use this database to let the world know about the \n     kinds of people who have made good, in part because of the \n     programs designed and administered by the Institute. That \n     awareness will help us to develop support for additional \n     programs that are responsive to the needs of the current \n     moment--like the Scholar Rescue initiative I and others \n     have told you about.\n       I encouraged Dan Greespahn, who has done a terrific job \n     heading the Alumni Research Program, to find out as much a he \n     could about our alumni, both so that we could learn about \n     them and so that they could help us develop our new programs. \n     It was in the course of developing this Alumni Database that \n     we encountered Ruth Gruber, about whom you will hear more \n     momentarily.\n       And so there was a wonderful confluence of events: My \n     mentor and close friend, Fritz Redlich, who led Yale \n     University to the heights of scholarly achievement through \n     encouraging the free flow of ideas, and Ruth Gruber, an \n     outstanding humanitarian, journalist and author: both IIE \n     alumni--Fritz coming here and Ruth going there, both in 1930.\n       Henry Kaufman, on whose vision all of this rests, suggested \n     that we create an award to recognize some of the most \n     accomplished of those alumni. What better way to do so than \n     to name the award for someone who, for me at least, is the \n     paradigm of what IIE strive for--Fritz Redlich.\n       (Fritz, will you please stand and be recognized.)\n       Fritz, in appreciation of what you have meant to me and to \n     your thousands of students and in recognition of IIE's role \n     in ensuring your safety here in the United States, we want to \n     name our annual award the Fritz Redlich Alumni Award. Thank \n     you for letting us do so.\n       Tonight we present the first Fritz Redlich Alumni Award to \n     Ruth Gruber.\n       Our efforts to tell you about Ruth are made somewhat easier \n     by our friends in the film industry who, in 2001, made a CBS \n     television mini-series that detailed Ruth's rescue of 1000 \n     refugees form Europe in 1944. In that film, the part of Ruth \n     Gruber was played by the highly accomplished actress Natasha \n     Richardson.\n       Ms. Richardson's performances on stage, screen and \n     televsion--both here and abroad--have been recognized by the \n     most prestigious awards in the entertainment industry. They \n     began in 1986 when she received the London Drama Critics's \n     Most Promising Newcomer Award. In 1992, she received the \n     London Drama Critics Best Actress Award. She received a Tony \n     for her performance as Sally Bowles in Cabaret, as well as \n     Outer Critics Circle, Drama League and Drama Desk Awards for \n     Best Actress. And there are many, many more.\n       Natasha Richardson is with us this evening to introduce \n     Ruth Gruber and to present her with the Fritz Redlich Alumni \n     Award. Let's start Natasha's introduction of Ruth by taking a \n     look at Natasha playing her in the film I told you about.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/18/senate-section/article/S11311-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11311]]\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO N.

And what a year \nit was.\n  Jack was on the front lines during the Senate debate over accounting \nreform, and he played a key role in our office's involvement in the \nSarbanes-Oxley Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act. He got a \nbit more than he bargained for by playing the lead staff role during \nfloor action and the conference committee, but he performed with great \naplomb and professionalism.\n  Jack has also been immensely valuable in raising our awareness of \nNative American banking issues. He took the lead in conceptualizing and \norganizing a hearing in the Senate Banking Financial Institutions \nSubcommittee on ways we might increase private capital in Indian \nCountry. He brought together an impressive group of witnesses whose \nideas I hope we can implement in the future. Jack also provided \nvaluable assistance on a number of other tribal-related housing and \nbanking issues.\n  Another noteworthy contribution of Jack's was his hard work in \nputting together S. 3034, the Check Truncation Act. While it may not be \nthe most high-profile subject, check truncation would modernize our \nfinancial system in significant ways, and be particularly helpful in \nrural areas such as South Dakota where the physical transportation of \nchecks is often difficult and expensive. Jack helped us to lead the \ncharge to modernize our system, and I am hopeful we can complete action \non that bill next year.\n  Finally, I would be remiss if I did not mention Jack's role in our \ncontinued efforts to pass comprehensive deposit insurance reform. Jack, \nwho came to us from the FDIC's division of insurance, proved to be an \ninvaluable in-house resource for my staff on matters related to deposit \ninsurance. He was also willing to travel out to South Dakota to meet \nwith bankers throughout the State to ensure that our bill reflects the \nneeds of Main Street bankers across this country.\n  It is my pleasure and honor to stand before the Senate today to thank \nJack Taylor publicly for his service to the United States Senate. I am \npleased he will continue to serve our country by returning to the FDIC, \nwhich is lucky to have him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/18/senate-section/article/S11311-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO COLONEL JOSEPH M.

Mr. President, I rise to recognize an important and \nmoving statement made by Ambassador Joseph Verner Reed, Under-\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, on September 11, 2002. \nAmbassador Reed's remarks are a true example of the national strength, \npersonal mourning, and international support that we all have \nexperienced since September 2001. I ask that his remarks be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The remarks follow.\n\n Remarks by Ambassador Joseph Verner Reed, Under-Secretary-General of \n                           the United Nations\n\n       On behalf of the Secretary-General of the United Nations \n     Kofi A. Annan, I bring greetings and good wishes on this \n     solemn anniversary commemorating September 11, 2001--9/11--\n     The Day of Terror.\n       The Secretary-General regrets that he could not be with us \n     today. He is very much involved, as you know, with \n     preparations of the 57th General Assembly as well as the \n     ongoing task of pursuing the course of peace in the 17 Peace \n     Keeping Missions around our troubled globe.\n       The Secretary-General is presiding at a commemoration of 9/\n     11 on the Great Lawn at the United Nations with 191 member \n     states participating.\n       First, allow me to salute the organizers of this \n     International Symposium. The mission of the Virtue Foundation \n     is as laudable as it is imperative.\n       ``From Tragedy to Unity: A Celebration of the Human \n     Spirit.'' That is the theme of this Symposium.\n       None of us can ever forget the tragedy and terror and \n     sadness that 9/11 brought upon our nation, our society and \n     the world. But, the prominent panelists in today's \n     discussions in this hallowed Museum will not dwell on the \n     past horror. Rather, their focus will be on healing and \n     renewal and rekindling strength in our citizenry.\n       With this lofty, indeed noble--yet irrefutably \n     appropriate--purpose in mind, today's Symposium will inspire \n     all of us to rebuild and create a more cohesive and caring \n     community.\n       Amid sorrow we will create anew. That is what our world \n     needs now. Whether a life or a building or a spirit--there is \n     a call now to rebuild--a need for a new beginning.\n       This anniversary day is also very much a Time of \n     Remembrance.\n       None of us here in the Rainey Auditorium and across the \n     length and breadth of our beautiful nation will ever forget \n     that horrible moment a year ago today when we heard the \n     unspeakable news. We will never forget where we were, whom we \n     were with or what we were doing. 9/11 was the Opening Day of \n     the 56th General Assembly of the United Nations. It was the \n     day the United Nations celebrates the International Day of \n     Peace. I was on my way to Headquarters. On hearing the news \n     of the first crash I returned to our house joining my stunned \n     wife in staring at the television. We shared the national \n     experience of a quantum leap into a new, frightening and \n     uncertain world. We immediately sensed this was the world we \n     would now live in for the rest of our lives.\n\n[[Page S11312]]\n\n       This past year has been a period of national mourning.\n       I hesitate to say but reality makes me do so--A sense of \n     dread and sadness has gripped our nation in the searing \n     emotional aftermath of the Day of Terror.\n       The world must never forget that September 11, 2001 was the \n     bloodiest day on American soil since our civil war. Our flags \n     are half-staff. The Congress has designated today Patriot Day \n     to honor the sacrifice made by 3,000 innocent citizens on \n     that tragic day. National character does not change in a day. \n     9/11 did not alter the American character, it merely revealed \n     it--it forced--the emergency of a bedrock America of courage, \n     resolve, resourcefulness and, above all, resilience. What the \n     enemy did not know or anticipate was that beneath the outward \n     normality of America in post-Cold War repose lay a sleeping \n     giant that Admiral Yamamoto knew he had awakened on December \n     7, 1941 and that Osama bin Laden had no inkling he had \n     awakened on September 11, 2001.\n       The world then witnessed an astonishing demonstration of \n     resilience, the kind only a nation of continental size and \n     prodigious productivity, of successful self-government and \n     self-conscious spirituality could summon.\n       The anniversary of this stunning national `state change'; \n     will be respectfully celebrated in tears, sorrow and \n     reflection. The death toll of the 9/11 attacks did not just \n     affect New York and the United States. Though the \n     overwhelming number of those who died was American citizens \n     there were victims from 36 countries around the world. Our \n     neighbor to the south, Mexico, with 27 who died, was the \n     hardest hit of the foreign lands.\n       The old diplomatic refrain that ``one man's terrorist is \n     another man's freedom fighter'' can no longer be argued. \n     Ladies and Gentlemen--let me be perfectly clear: September 11 \n     proved once and for all that ``Terror is terror.'' Terror is \n     inexcusable, it is indefensible, it is wrong.\n       That Day of Terror transformed ``terrorism.'' In the past, \n     in their madness, terrorists yearned for a lot of people \n     watching, not a lot of people dead. Last year, the rules \n     changed. Those terrorists--those assassins--sought to kill \n     thousands as hundreds of millions watched in horror.\n       The murderers got what they wanted.\n       But, they and the rest of Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda \n     network miscalculated America's might and resolve.\n       This September 11 marks not just a day of infamy, but also \n     the close of Year One of the War on Terrorism. And to win the \n     war we need to demonstrate--as America has done in other \n     great wars of necessity--patience, endurance, determination, \n     and a willingness to bear any burden.\n       Their attack on the symbols of United States economic and \n     military power stirred the world's only superpower to place \n     terrorism at the heart of its--and the world's--foreign and \n     domestic policy.\n       The message today is clear. The United States will not \n     negotiate terrorism. Nor will it compromise with terrorists. \n     Rather she will destroy them and all the evil for which they \n     stand. Of that, I have no doubt.\n       We will never forget 9/11.\n       Today's Symposium, then, is an important one. Today is the \n     day to begin to move from this tragedy to ``unity and a \n     celebration of the human spirit.''\n       Thank you Director de Montebello for making this great \n     Museum the home of this gathering. Thank you Dr. Salim and \n     Dr. LaRovere for your initiative. To all the organizers, \n     musicians, members of the staff of the Met and the \n     distinguished participants who will be with us today I salute \n     each of you.\n       Let us find healing and strength in remembrance. I pray \n     that the coming year will bring us closer together--within \n     our families and our communities--and ever more committed to \n     caring for one another.\n       May we enjoy years of peace for our children, for the \n     future, for all mankind.\n       Peace!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/18/senate-section/article/S11312-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11312-S11313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO DR. MARCELO HOCHMAN OF CHARLESTON, SC, FOR HIS HUMANITARIAN \n                                EFFORTS\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the headlines always are the \nIsraelis and the Arabs at each other's throats, so it's noteworthy when \na Jewish doctor treats a Muslim child--gratis. I know of the expertise \nof Dr. Marcelo Hochman and I know of his humanitarianism. He has been \ndoing it for years. I ask unanimous consent that this article from the \nNovember 17th Charleston Post and Courier be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows.\n\n              Local Surgeon Helping Turkish Boy Face World\n\n                         (By Allison L. Bruce)\n\n\n    boy's family searches world for aid; find community of help in \n                               charleston\n\n       For 4-year-old Batuhan Itku, a trip to Charleston marks a \n     new beginning.\n       The Turkish boy was born with a birthmark covering more \n     than half of his face and causing severe disfigurement. He \n     couldn't shut his right eye and a cleft lip make eating \n     difficult.\n       After more than 30 doctors told Batuhan's parents, Levent \n     and Ayla Itku, that they could not operate on Batuhan, Levent \n     Itku said he and a friend from work created a Web page to see \n     if other doctors elsewhere in the world could help.\n       Doctors from Canada, Germany and the United States \n     responded to the site, but after Levent Itku sent medical \n     information to them, only Dr. Marcelo Hochman remained.\n       Hochman is a facial plastic and reconstructive surgeon and \n     a leading expert in treating hemangiomas. His practice is The \n     Facial Surgery Center in Charleston.\n       He not only was willing to operate on Batuhan but also \n     agreed to donate his services.\n       Levent Itku said he and his wife ``couldn't believe what \n     they heard . . . until the moment they came here and saw him \n     (Hochman),'' according to interpreter Yesim Otay. ``At the \n     beginning, they didn't have any hope. They thought it would \n     be the same thing they heard before,'' Otay said, translating \n     for Itku. Now, she said, ``they have a great hope.''\n       Batuhan's vascular birthmark is called a hemangioma, a \n     condition that Hochman said affects about 10 percent of the \n     population. They range from a pinpoint to large, severe \n     deformations that usually affect the face, head and neck.\n       About 30 percent of hemangiomas require medical attention, \n     Hochman said.\n       Common names for some forms of the birthmark include a \n     portwine stain or strawberry.\n       For Batuhan, the hemangioma is severe and will require more \n     than one operation.\n       ``Had we seen him early on with aggressive medical \n     treatment and laser treatment, perhaps he could have \n     avoided this horrific disfigurement,'' Hochman said.\n       Hochman said doctors often tell families not to treat the \n     condition.\n       ``The prevailing advice parents get is to leave it alone, \n     it will go away.'' he said. While that may be the right \n     advice for some patients, Hochman said, he often sees \n     children and adults who have been waiting for years for it to \n     go away.\n       ``What we're trying to do is change the way the primary \n     care physicians see these lesions,'' he said. ``There is hope \n     for treatment. It is very common and lots of things can be \n     done.''\n       The Itkus are staying at the Ronald McDonald House downtown \n     as Batuhan recovers from his first surgery. His stitches come \n     out Monday.\n       Levent Itku said Batuhan is aware of everything Hochman \n     did. After the surgery, he woke up one morning and patted his \n     face, saying ``Dr. Hochman did this to my face.''\n       ``He has a chance in his future life,'' Levent Itku said.\n       At the Ronald McDonald House, Batuhan--a bright, cheerful \n     child--plays with a bag of toys and books. He finds a plastic \n     drill, which he proceeds to use while making drill-like \n     sounds on every piece of furniture available. He grins and \n     laughs as his parents and others join in making the sounds \n     with him.\n       He waves at people he knows at the house and constantly \n     talks with his parents and guests.\n       His face shows signs of the first surgery. Hochman created \n     an eye lid for Batuhan so he can close his eye for the first \n     time. The cleft lip is also repaired so that he can eat \n     better.\n       Batuhan's trip to Charleston for the surgery took a lot of \n     coordination. Aside from Hochman donating his services, St \n     Francis Hospital and local business owners also contributed. \n     Patricia Dwight arranged for Batuhan and his family to get \n     to the United States by collecting frequent flier miles \n     donations. Dwight owns Adventure Travel and has lived in \n     Turkey. After hearing about Batuhan's case, she made a \n     point to visit the Itkus while she was visiting Istanbul.\n       ``After meeting the family and seeing what incredible \n     people the mother and father were, I was more inspired to \n     help,'' she said. ``They're dealing with it in such a \n     remarkable way. Without them being the way they are, this \n     would not have happened either.''\n       On the Internet, she found out about a United Way program \n     that uses frequent flier miles to provide transportation. \n     With the help of several local donations, including a large \n     donation of miles from Henry Cheves Jr., Dwight was able to \n     bring the Itkus to the United States.\n       She also is leading the effort to create The Hemangioma \n     Treatment Foundation. The foundation would help provide \n     treatment of children and adults with vascular birthmarks and \n     training for doctors in other companies.\n       Dwight said Batuhan's case was the catalyst for creating \n     the foundation, which is currently under Trident United Way \n     until it receives non-profit status.\n       A large part of Hochman's efforts in the last decade has \n     been to educate other doctors about treating hemangiomas.\n       During the past 12 years, Hochman has traveled to other \n     countries to operate on children with hemangiomas. He has \n     traveled to Russia, Latin America and Mexico repeatedly.\n       Aside from demonstrating for doctors in other countries how \n     the surgeries can be done, Hochman has edited a textbook on \n     hemangiomas and hopes that more doctors in the United States \n     also will explore the different kinds of treatment available.\n       He said he receives thousands of e-mails each year. Many of \n     those come from overseas.\n\n[[Page S11313]]\n\n       Two Costa Rican girls are coming to Hochman for treatment \n     for hemangiomas this week.\n       Another 35 children in Costa Rica are waiting for \n     treatment, as well as more children in Turkey.\n       Levent Itku said he wanted to thank all of the people who \n     had helped his family, including Hochman, Dwight, the Ronald \n     McDonald House and the Turkish community in Charleston, \n     including Otay and Carol Arkok, who also helped with \n     translation and took the family to dinner and shopping.\n       Dwight said at a time when Muslims and Jews are often in \n     conflict, ``here we have a marvelous example of interfaith \n     cooperation . . . We have a marvelous man of one faith \n     helping this needy child of another faith.''\n       Hochman said that had never crossed his mind.\n       ``I didn't even think about it until Patricia said, `Isn't \n     it wonderful that a Jewish doctor is treating a Muslim child? \n     ''' he said. ``These people need help, and if we have the \n     expertise, it's a privilege to help take care of them.''\n       ``These families endure so much. It feels good to be able \n     to change that.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/18/senate-section/article/S11313-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 5:07 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House agrees \nto the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 2621) to amend title \n18, United States Code, with respect to consumer product protection.\n  The message also announced that the House agrees to the amendment of \nthe Senate to the bill (H.R. 3609) to amend title 49, United States \nCode, to enhance the security and safety of pipelines.\n  The message further announced that the House agrees to the amendment \nof the Senate to the bill (H.R. 3833) to facilitate the creation of \nanew, second-level Internet domain within the United States country \ncode domain that will be haven for material that promotes positive \nexperiences for children and families using the Internet, provides a \nsafe online environment for children, and helps to prevent children \nfrom being exposed to harmful material on the Internet, and for other \npurposes.\n  The message also announced that the House agrees to the amendments of \nthe Senate to the bill (H.R. 3908) to reauthorize the North American \nWetlands Conservation Act, and for other purposes.\n  The message further announced that the House agrees to the amendments \nof the Senate to the bill (H.R. 4664) to authorize appropriations for \nfiscal years 2003, 2004, and 2005 for the National Science Foundation, \nand for other purposes.\n  The message also announced that the House agrees to the amendment of \nthe Senate to the bill (H.R. 5469) to amend title 17, United States \nCode, with respect to the statutory license for webcasting, and for \nother purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/18/senate-section/article/S11313-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11313-S11315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n       EC-9596.

A joint resolution adopted by the Alaska State \n     Legislature relative to the desecration of the United States \n     Flag; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                       Legislative Resolve No. 59\n\n       Be it resolved by the Legislature of the State of Alaska:\n       Whereas certain actions, although arguably related to one \n     person's free expression, nevertheless raise issues \n     concerning public decency, public peace, and the rights of \n     expression and sacred values of others; and\n       Whereas there are symbols of our national soul, such as the \n     Washington Monument, the United States Capitol Building, and \n     memorials to our greatest leaders, that are the property of \n     every American and are therefore worthy of protection from \n     desecration and dishonor; and\n       Whereas the American Flag was most nobly born in the \n     struggle for independence that began with ``The Shot Heard \n     Round the World'' on a bridge in Concord, Massachusetts; and\n       Whereas, in the War of 1812, the American Flag stood boldly \n     against foreign invasion, symbolized the stand of a young and \n     brave nation against the mighty world power of that day and, \n     in its courageous resilience, inspired our national anthem; \n     and\n       Whereas, in the Second World War, the American Flag was the \n     banner that led the American battle against facist \n     imperialism from the depths of Pearl Harbor to the \n     mountaintop on Iwo Jima, and from defeat in North Africa's \n     Kasserine Pass to victory in the streets of Hitler's Germany; \n     and\n       Whereas Alaska's star was woven into the fabric of the Flag \n     in 1959, and that 49th star has become an integral part of \n     the Union; and\n       Whereas the American Flag symbolizes the ideals that good \n     and decent people fought for in Vietnam, often at the expense \n     of their lives or at the cost of cruel condemnation upon \n     their return home; and\n       Whereas the American Flag symbolizes the sacred values for \n     which loyal Americans risked and often lost their lives in \n     securing civil rights for all Americans, regardless of race, \n     sex, or creed; and\n       Whereas the American Flag was carried to the moon as a \n     banner of goodwill, vision, and triumph on behalf of all \n     mankind; and\n       Whereas the American Flag was raised by New York City fire \n     fighters atop the rubble of the World Trade Center and became \n     the symbol of a nation challenged as it had never been \n     before; and\n       Whereas the American Flag to this day is a most honorable \n     and worthy banner of a nation that is thankful for its \n     strengths and committed to curing its faults and remains the \n     destination of millions of immigrants attracted by the \n     universal power of the American ideal; and\n       Whereas the law as interpreted by the United States Supreme \n     Court no longer accords to the Stars and Stripes that \n     reverence, respect, and dignity befitting the banner of that \n     most noble experiment of a nation-state; and\n       Whereas House Joint Resolution 36, which passed the United \n     States House of Representatives and has been referred to the \n     United States Senate, proposes an amendment to the United \n     States Constitution stating, ``The Congress shall have power \n     to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the \n     United States''; and\n       Whereas Senate Joint Resolution 7, introduced in the United \n     States Senate, proposes an amendment to the United States \n     Constitution stating, ``The Congress shall have LR 59 power \n     to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the \n     United States'';

Res. 122\n\n       Whereas the current status quo on Cyprus remains \n     unacceptable and the reunification of Cyprus remains a \n     desirable foreign policy objective;\n       Whereas a just and lasting resolution of the Cyprus \n     problem, in full consideration of United Nations Security \n     Council resolutions and international treaties, must \n     safeguard the security and fundamental rights of the \n     population of Cyprus, Greek-Cypriots and Turkish-Cypriots \n     alike;\n       Whereas Cyprus is among the leading candidate countries for \n     accession to the European Union, in recognition of its \n     commitment to free markets, human rights, democracy, and the \n     rule of law;\n       Whereas the European Union guarantees to all its citizens \n     the indivisible universal values of human dignity (supporting \n     fair and equal treatment of all), freedom (right to security, \n     marriage, family, among others), equality (celebrating \n     cultural, religious, and linguistic diversity), solidarity \n     (protecting workers' rights and providing social security), \n     citizens' rights (voting), and justice (holding a fair \n     trial);\n       Whereas membership in the European Union will guarantee \n     each citizen of the Republic of Cyprus important legal, \n     civil, and human rights, as well as the means and legal \n     recourse necessary to secure the full application of these \n     fundamental individual rights, and to promote the respect of \n     cultural diversity and traditions;\n       Whereas membership in the European Union will bring \n     significant benefits to both Greek-Cypriots and Turkish-\n     Cypriots, including new economic opportunities, access to new \n     markets, a freer exchange of goods and services, balanced and \n     sustainable development as well as the free movement of \n     persons, goods, and services and capital;\n       Whereas the European Council in its Summit Conclusions of \n     December 1999, in Helsinki, stated that ``a political \n     settlement [of the Cyprus problem] will facilitate the \n     accession of Cyprus to the European Union . . . [i]f no \n     settlement has been reached by the completion of accession \n     negotiations, the Council's decision on accession will be \n     made without the above being a precondition . . . [i]n this \n     the Council will take account of all relevant factors'';\n       Whereas both the United States and the European Union in \n     their summit statement on the New Transatlantic Agenda of \n     June 14, 2001, pledge to continue to work together to support \n     the efforts of the United Nations Secretary General to \n     achieve a comprehensive settlement with respect to Cyprus in \n     full consideration of relevant United Nations Security \n     Council resolutions and international treaties;\n       Whereas the Greek and Turkish Cypriot leadership began \n     direct talks on January 16, 2002, with the United Nations \n     Special Advisor in attendance and the European Council at the \n     Seville Conference in June 2002 called on the Greek and \n     Turkish Cypriot leaders to intensify and expedite their talks \n     in order to seize the unique opportunity to reach a \n     comprehensive settlement; and\n       Whereas resolution of the Cyprus problem is also consistent \n     with American values, as enshrined in the rights guaranteed \n     by the Constitution of the United States, which guarantees \n     the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the current status quo on Cyprus must be ended and the \n     island and its people be reunited, in a bizonal, bicommunal \n     federal Cyprus, with full consideration of United Nations \n     Security Council resolutions and international treaties;\n       (2) the direct and intensive negotiations between the Greek \n     and Turkish Cypriot leaders, which began in January 2002, and \n     which are continuing on a regular basis, have been most \n     welcome and are encouraged to continue until a comprehensive \n     settlement has been achieved;\n       (3) while a successful resolution of the Cyprus problem \n     would facilitate the accession of Cyprus to the European \n     Union, in the absence of such a resolution, the accession of \n     Cyprus to the European Union could act as a further catalyst \n     for the solution of the Cyprus problem without the latter \n     being a precondition for accession and with all relevant \n     factors being considered;\n       (4) membership of the Republic of Cyprus in the European \n     Union should be strongly supported;\n       (5) all Cypriots be urged to support and encourage efforts \n     to bring the Republic of Cyprus into the European Union; and\n       (6) the various agencies of the United States Government in \n     support of United Nations efforts to facilitate a settlement \n     should pursue as an issue of high priority new initiatives \n     that will help promote and achieve reunification, \n     reconciliation, stability, and prosperity on Cyprus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/18/senate-section/article/S11329-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11329-S11338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     VETERANS BENEFITS ACT OF 2002\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nconcur in the amendment of the House, and that a statement of Senator \nRockefeller be printed in the Record as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I urge the Senate to pass S. 2237, the proposed \n``Veterans Benefits Act of 2002.''\n  Mr. President, the pending measure is the final compromise version of \nan omnibus bill that would improve a variety of veterans benefits, from \npensions for heroes awarded the Medal of Honor to fairness in \nevaluating the disabilities of veterans with hearing loss. I will \nbriefly highlight some of the provisions of which I am most proud, and \nrefer my colleagues seeking more detail to the Joint Explanatory \nStatement accompanying this statement.\n  S. 2237, which I will refer to as the ``Compromise Agreement,'' would \neliminate many inequities and obstacles that affect veterans and their \nfamilies. I thank Ranking Member Arlen Specter and his staff for their \nefforts on behalf of our Nation's veterans, and my colleagues in the \nHouse for working with our Committee staff to craft this agreement.\n  I would also like to take this moment to note the loss of a dear \ncolleague, a dedicated advocate for veterans. Many have eulogized \nSenator Paul Wellstone in the past few weeks, and I do not need to tell \nmy colleagues of his passion, his energy, and his unwavering commitment \nto shout on behalf of those who cannot speak for themselves. However, \nfew have noted his work on behalf of America's veterans, particularly \nthose most neglected by a Nation that has not always kept its promises. \nSenator Wellstone worked on behalf of homeless veterans, veterans \nsuffering from the mental illnesses that can be the silent legacy of \nthe battlefield, and for those who returned from war to fight their own \ngovernment's denials about the invisible wounds caused by chemicals and \nradiation. Paul Wellstone may have launched his political career in \nprotest of the Vietnam War, but as a Senator, he chose to fight for \nthose who served. It is up to all of us now to carry on his work.\n  As veterans and their families--like the rest of Americans expect to \nenjoy--lengthening life spans, we must regularly review and update laws \ncrafted in earlier times. Last year, I proudly authored legislation to \nallow survivors of severely disabled veterans to continue receiving VA \nhealthcare coverage through the program called CHAMPVA after age 65. \nSection 101 of the Compromise Agreement would take this further, \nallowing the eligible surviving spouses of veterans who died from \nservice-connected disabilities or in the line of duty to retain their \neligibility for CHAMPVA benefits even if they remarry after age 55. \nThose who sacrificed so much for their Nation throughout their lives \nshould not be further penalized by losing the special healthcare safety \nnet that CHAMPVA offers.\n  Mr. President, Congress last year authorized VA to offer special \nmonthly compensation to women who had lost one or both breasts as a \nresult of military service. VA's subsequently promulgated regulations \nlimited eligibility for this benefit to women who had undergone simple \nor radical mastectomy. Even if this restriction plays no role in a \nwoman's medical decisions, it implies unfairly that tissue-sparing \ntreatments create no physical, emotional, or financial obstacles to a \nwoman's health. Section 102 of the Compromise Agreement would extend \nthis eligibility to women veterans who have endured service-connected \nloss of 25 percent or more of a breast's tissue, or radiation treatment \nto a breast. As women comprise a growing percentage of our Armed \nServices, we must ensure that they receive fair recognition for their \nsacrifices, and equitable assistance in overcoming the medical \nchallenges that they face.\n  I am enormously proud that the Compromise Agreement would help \nveterans who have both service-connected and unrelated hearing loss \nexpect a fair disability rating. Currently, VA can consider whether a \nveteran has bilateral damage to ``paired'' organs or extremities--such \nas kidneys, lungs, feet, or hands--when rating the veteran's \ndisability, even if only one of the paired organs was injured through \nmilitary service. However, VA can only consider how non-service-\nconnected hearing loss might further disable a veteran if he or she \nsuffers total deafness in both ears. Section 103 of the Compromise \nAgreement would allow VA to consider whether a veteran suffers from \npartial non-service-connected hearing loss in one ear when evaluating \ndisability caused by compensable service-connected hearing loss in the \nother ear. This would not only extend the same special consideration to \ndamage to the ears that VA gives to other paired organs, but would \nassist veterans whose hearing loss has been made even worse due to \nmilitary service.\n  This provision represents an important step for veterans with hearing \nloss, but other challenges remain. America's aging veterans suffer \nincreasingly from hearing loss and tinnitus, and the number of \ndisability claims for hearing disorders submitted to VA continues to \nclimb. Many veterans who left service decades ago received an \nineffective hearing examination at separation, or no evaluation at all, \nleaving VA with a legacy of incomplete records and uncertain clinical \nevidence. This affects not only veterans with hearing loss, but all \nveterans who must wait for VA to process a staggering burden of hearing \nloss claims without a clear scientific standard on past exposures.\n  Section 104 of the Compromise Agreement would require VA to contract \nwith the National Academy of Sciences to review evidence on hearing \ndamage suffered during military service from World War II to the \npresent. As part of this study, scientists would determine when the \naudiometric testing and hearing conservation programs initiated by the \nmilitary services became adequate for VA to assess whether an \nindividual veteran had hearing loss at or prior to separation. The \nCompromise Agreement would also require VA to review its own records on \nhearing loss or tinnitus in veterans, including the cost of \nadjudicating these claims under the current system and the cost of \ntreating hearing disorders. These reports together should provide VA's \nSecretary with critical tools to decide how to assist veterans whose \nhearing loss may have resulted from damage suffered years ago quickly \nand fairly.\n  Mr. President, Section 304 of the Compromise Agreement would increase \nthe special pension granted to recipients of the Medal of Honor as a \ntoken of recognition for their extraordinary heroism from $600 to \n$1000, and adjust this pension annually with inflation. The agreement \nwould also provide a one-time payment to Medal of Honor recipients \nwho--due to a time lag between the date of the act of valor and the \nactual awarding of the Medal of Honor--received this pension only after \na delay.\n  The next section of the Compromise Agreement grew from legislation \nintroduced by Senator Paul Wellstone, another example of his advocacy \non behalf of those who serve this Nation. The Soldiers' and Sailors' \nRelief Act of 1940 (SSCRA) applies to servicemembers, including \nNational Guard Members, who serve on active duty under title 10 of the \nUnited States code. It suspends enforcement of certain civil \nliabilities against servicemembers on active duty so that they can \ndevote their concentration to their duties.\n  National Guard members may also be called to active duty by their \nState Governors under title 32. National Guard missions under title 32 \nare funded by the federal government ``to perform training and other \nduty.'' However, if the National Guard members are called up under \ntitle 32, rather than title 10, they are not entitled to SSCRA \nprotections.\n\n[[Page S11334]]\n\n  In the days following September 11, 2001, under the direction of the \nPresident, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Secretary of \nDefense coordinated the use of National Guard members at commercial \nairports. These National Guard members, called to active duty from four \nto six months, clearly served a national mission. However, because they \nwere called up under title 32, they were not entitled to SSCRA \nprotections.\n  Section 305 of the Compromise Agreement would extend SSCRA \nprotections to include National Guard members called to active service \nfor more than 30 consecutive days in response to a national emergency \ndeclared by the President, even if they serve under title 32. This \nprovision is intended to protect members of the National Guard when \ncalled up under circumstances similar to those following last \nSeptember's terrorist attacks.\n  Mr. President, it is time to amend the Soldiers' and Sailors' Relief \nAct of 1940 to reflect the critical role that National Guard members \nnow play in protecting this Nation. These National Guard members have \nincreasingly been called onto active duty since September 11th. Like \nall active duty servicemembers, National Guard members deserve these \nrights and legal protections to allow them to concentrate on national \ndefense. Paul Wellstone recognized this, and took steps to make sure \nthat those who don the uniform to protect our freedoms--at home or \nabroad--have earned our protection.\n  The Compromise Agreement would also ensure that veterans receive a \nfull judicial review when appealing claims denied by VA. The ``benefit \nof the doubt'' rule, the standard applicable to proceedings before VA, \nstates that a veteran's claim is granted unless the preponderance of \nthe evidence is against the claimant. This rule, unique in \nadministrative law, recognizes the tremendous sacrifices made by the \nmen and women who have served in our Armed Forces. A number of veterans \nservice organizations have expressed concern that the current appellate \nprocess is overly deferential to VA findings of fact that are adverse \nto veteran claimants. Specifically, these groups argue that the \n``clearly erroneous'' standard applied by the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nVeterans Claims (CAVC) when reviewing Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA) \ncases results in veterans' claims receiving only cursory review on \nappeal, not allowing for full application of the ``benefit of the \ndoubt'' rule.\n  Section 401 of the Compromise Agreement would maintain the current \n``clearly erroneous'' standard of review, but modify the requirements \nof the review the court must perform when making determinations under \nsection 7261(a) of title 38. CAVC would be specifically required to \nexamine the record of proceedings--that is, the record on appeal--\nbefore the Secretary and BVA. Section 401 would also provide special \nemphasis during the judicial process to the ``benefit of the doubt'' \nprovisions of section 5107(b) as CAVC makes findings of fact in \nreviewing BVA decisions. The combination of these changes is intended \nto provide for more searching appellate review of BVA decisions, and \nthus give full force to the ``benefit of doubt'' provision. The \naddition of the words ``or reverse'' after ``and set aside'' in section \n7261(a)(4) is intended to emphasize that CAVC should reverse clearly \nerroneous findings when appropriate, rather than remand the case. This \nnew language in section 7261 would overrule the recent U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Federal Circuit decision of Hensley v. West, which \nemphasized that CAVC should perform only limited, deferential review of \nBVA decisions, and stated that BVA fact-finding ``is entitled on review \nto substantial deference.'' However, nothing in this new language is \ninconsistent with the existing section 7261(c), which precludes the \ncourt from conducting trial de novo when reviewing BVA decisions, that \nis, receiving evidence that is not part of the record before BVA.\n  Section 402 of the Compromise Agreement would also expand the Federal \nCircuit's authority to review CAVC decisions based on rules of law that \nare not derived from a specific statute or regulation. This change \nwould allow the Federal Circuit to review comprehensively any CAVC \ndecisions of law that adversely affect appellate reviews of veterans' \nclaims.\n  Currently, attorneys and non-attorney practitioners supervised by \nattorneys who represent certain claimants may receive compensation for \ntheir services under the Equal Access to Justice Act. Section 403 of \nthe Compromise Agreement would allow non-attorney practitioners \nadmitted to practice before the CAVC, such as veterans service \norganization representatives, to be awarded fees under this act without \nthe signature of a supervising attorney. This would make organizations \nthat provide invaluable assistance to veterans eligible for richly \ndeserved compensation.\n  The Joint Explanatory Statement contains language responding to the \nExecutive Branch's interpretation that the CAVC is part of the \nExecutive Branch, and subject to rescissions of budget pursuant to \nsection 1403 of Public Law 107-206. I wish to reiterate that it is the \nCommittees' intent to clarify that the CAVC is not part of the \nExecutive Branch. The Committees have previously stated as much, \nfinding in reports in both the House and Senate that the ``Court, \nestablished by the Congress under Article I of the Constitution to \nexercise judicial power, has unusual status as an independent tribunal \nthat is not subject to the control of the President or the executive \nbranch.'' It is my hope that the Committees will not have to address \nthis issue again through legislation or other means.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, I want to thank Senator Specter and his \nbenefits staff--Bill Tuerk, Jon Towers, David Goetz, and Chris \nMcNamee--for diligently working with me and my benefits staff--Mary \nSchoelen, Julie Fischer, Chris Reinard, and Dahlia Melendrez--to craft \nthis legislation during such an incredible year. I urge my colleagues \nto support this bipartisan commitment to our Nation's veterans, and to \nsend a strong message of support to the men and women who now serve in \nuniform by caring for those who served before.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the joint explanatory statement be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Explanatory Statement on House Amendment to Senate Bill, S. 2237\n\n       S. 2237, as amended, the ``Veterans Benefits Act of 2002,'' \n     reflects a Compromise Agreement the Senate and House \n     Committees on Veterans' Affairs have reached on the following \n     bills considered in the House and Senate during the 107th \n     Congress: S. 2237 (``Senate Bill''), H.R. 2561, H.R. 3423, \n     H.R. 4085, H.R. 4940, and H.R. 5055 (``House Bills''). S. \n     2237, as amended, passed the Senate on September 26, 2002; \n     H.R. 2561 and H.R. 3423, as amended, passed the House on \n     December 20, 2001; H.R. 4085, as amended, passed the House on \n     May 21, 2002; and H.R. 4940, as amended, and H.R. 5055 passed \n     the House on July 22, 2002.\n       The Senate and House Committees on Veterans' Affairs have \n     prepared the following explanation of S. 2237, as amended, \n     (``Compromise Agreement''). Differences between the \n     provisions contained in the Compromise Agreement and the \n     related provisions of S. 2237, H.R. 2561, H.R. 3423, H.R. \n     4085, H.R. 4940, H.R. 5055, are noted in this document, \n     except for clerical corrections, conforming changes made \n     necessary by the Compromise Agreement, and minor drafting, \n     technical, and clarifying changes.\n\n            TITLE I--COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS IMPROVEMENTS\n\n\n retention of civilian health and medical program of the department of \n     veterans affairs for surviving spouses remarrying after age 55\n\n                              Current law\n\n       Section 103(d) of title 38, United States Code, prohibits a \n     surviving spouse who has remarried from receiving dependency \n     and indemnity compensation (``DIC''), VA health insurance \n     under the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs (``CHAMPVA''), home loan, and \n     education benefits. These benefits may be reinstated in the \n     event the subsequent remarriage is terminated.\n\n                               House bill\n\n       Section 3 of H.R. 4085 would allow a surviving spouse who \n     remarries after attaining age 65 to retain DIC, CHAMPVA \n     health insurance, home loan, and education benefits. Spouses \n     who remarried at age 65 or older prior to enactment of the \n     bill would have one year from the date of enactment to apply \n     for reinstatement of DIC and related benefits. The amount of \n     DIC would be paid with no reduction of certain other benefits \n     to which the surviving spouse might be entitled.\n\n                              Senate Bill\n\n       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.\n\n[[Page S11335]]\n\n                          Compromise agreement\n\n       Section 101 of the Compromise Agreement would provide that \n     a surviving spouse, upon remarriage after attaining age 55, \n     would retain CHAMPVA eligibility. Surviving spouses who \n     remarried after attaining age 55 but prior to enactment of \n     this Act would have one year to apply for reinstatement of \n     this benefit. The Committees expect the Secretary will \n     maintain data concerning the number of surviving spouses who \n     become eligible or retain eligibility under this provision.\n       The Committees intend in the 108th Congress to consider \n     full restoration of benefits for surviving spouses who \n     remarry after attaining age 55.\n\n\nCLARIFICATION OF ENTITLEMENT TO SPECIAL MONTHLY COMPENSATION FOR WOMEN \n       VETERANS WHO HAVE SERVICE-CONNECTED LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE\n\n                              Current law\n\n       Section 1114(k) of title 38, United States Code, authorizes \n     the Department of Veterans Affairs (``VA'') to provide \n     special monthly compensation to any woman veteran who ``has \n     suffered the anatomical loss of one or both breasts \n     (including loss by mastectomy)'' as a result of military \n     service. Regulations published at section 4.116 of title 38, \n     Code of Federal Regulations, have limited this compensation \n     to ``Anatomical loss of a breast exists when there is \n     complete surgical removal of breast tissue (or the equivalent \n     loss of breast tissue due to injury). As defined under this \n     section, radical mastectomy, modified radical mastectomy, and \n     simple (or total) mastectomy result in anatomical loss of a \n     breast, but wide local excision, with or without significant \n     alteration of size or form, does not.''\n\n                              Senate bill\n\n       Section 101 of S. 2237 would amend section 1114(k) of title \n     38, United States Code, to specify that women veterans who \n     have suffered the anatomical loss of half of the tissue of \n     one or both breasts in or as a result of military service may \n     be eligible for special monthly compensation.\n\n                               House bill\n\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n\n                          Compromise agreement\n\n       Section 102 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language, and would amend it to extend eligibility to women \n     veterans who have suffered the anatomical loss of 25 percent \n     or more of tissue from one or both breasts (including loss by \n     mastectomy or partial mastectomy) or who received radiation \n     treatment of breast tissue. The Committees intend that this \n     change should extend eligibility for special monthly \n     compensation to women veterans whose medical treatments \n     (other than ``cosmetic surgery'') or injuries have resulted \n     in a significant change in size, form, function, or \n     appearance of one or both breasts.\n\n\n  SPECIFICATION OF HEARING LOSS REQUIRED FOR COMPENSATION FOR HEARING \n                         LOSS IN PAIRED ORGANS\n\n                              Current law\n\n       Under section 1160 of title 38, United States Code, special \n     consideration is extended to a veteran's service-connected \n     disabilities in ``paired organs or extremities,'' such as \n     kidneys, lungs, feet, or hands. For these paired organs or \n     extremities, VA is authorized when rating disability to \n     consider any degree of damage to both organs, even if only \n     one resulted from military service. Total impairment is not a \n     requirement for kidneys, hands, feet, or lungs. Proportional \n     impairment, such as ``the loss or loss of use of one kidney \n     as a result of service-connected disability and involvement \n     of the other kidney as a result of non-service-connected \n     disability,'' is specifically provided for in subsections \n     (2), (4), and (5) of section 1160(a) of title 38, United \n     States Code. However, total deafness in both ears is required \n     under section 1160(a)(3) of title 38, United States Code, for \n     special consideration of hearing loss.\n\n                              Senate bill\n\n       Section 102 of S. 2237 would eliminate the word ``total'' \n     from section 1160(a)(3) of title 38, United States Code, and \n     allow VA to consider partial non-service-connected hearing \n     loss in one ear when rating disability for veterans with \n     compensable service-connected hearing loss in the other ear.\n\n                               House bill\n\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n\n                          Compromise agreement\n\n       Section 103 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n\n  ASSESSMENT OF ACOUSTIC TRAUMA ASSOCIATED WITH MILITARY SERVICE FROM \n                        WORLD WAR II TO PRESENT\n\n                              Current law\n\n       There is no applicable current law.\n\n                              Senate bill\n\n       Section 103(a) of S. 2237 would authorize the Secretary to \n     establish a presumption of service connection for hearing \n     loss or tinnitus in veterans who served in certain military \n     occupational specialties during specific periods of time if \n     VA finds that evidence warrants such a presumption. Section \n     103(b) would extend presumption rebuttal provisions in title \n     38, United States Code, to cover service-connected hearing \n     loss, should such a presumption be established.\n       Section 103(c) of the Senate Bill would require VA to enter \n     into a contract with the National Academy of Sciences \n     (``NAS'') or an equivalent scientific organization to review \n     scientific evidence on forms of acoustic trauma that could \n     contribute to hearing disorders for personnel serving in \n     specific military occupational specialties. Section \n     103(c)(2)(B) of the Senate Bill would direct NAS to identify \n     forms of acoustic trauma likely to cause hearing damage in \n     servicemembers, and, in section 103(c)(2)(C), to determine \n     whether such damage would be immediate, cumulative, or \n     delayed. Section 103(c)(2)(D) of the Senate Bill would \n     require NAS to assess when audiometric data collected by the \n     military services became adequate to allow an objective \n     assessment of individual exposure by VA, examining a \n     representative sample of records from World War II to present \n     by period of service. Section 103(c)(2)(E) of the Senate Bill \n     would require NAS to identify military occupational \n     specialties in which servicemembers are likely to be exposed \n     to sufficient acoustic trauma to cause hearing disorders.\n       Section 103(d) of S. 2237 would require VA to report on \n     medical care provided to veterans for hearing disorders from \n     fiscal years 1999-2001; on the number of disability \n     compensation claims received and granted for hearing loss, \n     tinnitus, or both during those years; and an estimate of the \n     total cost to VA of adjudicating those claims in full-time \n     employee equivalents.\n\n                               House bill\n\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n\n                          Compromise agreement\n\n       Section 104 of the Compromise Agreement would strike \n     sections 103(a) and 103(b) of the Senate Bill authorizing a \n     presumption of service connection. The Compromise Agreement \n     follows the Senate language requiring VA to enter into a \n     contract with NAS, but would change the focus of the study to \n     assessment of acoustic trauma associated with military \n     service from World War II to present.\n       The Compromise Agreement would strike sections \n     103(c)(2)(B), 103(c)(2)(D), 103(c)(2)(E), and all references \n     to military occupational specialties. The Compromise \n     Agreement follows the Senate language requiring NAS to \n     determine how much exposure to acoustic trauma or noise \n     damage during military service might cause or contribute to \n     hearing loss, hearing threshold shift, or tinnitus, and \n     whether this damage may be immediate- or delayed-onset, \n     cumulative, progressive, or a combination of these.\n       The Compromise Agreement would preserve provisions \n     requiring NAS to assess when audiometric measures became \n     adequate to assess individual hearing threshold shift \n     reliably and when sufficiently protective hearing \n     conservation measures became available. It would also add a \n     third provision requiring NAS to identify age, occupational \n     history, and other factors which could contribute to an \n     individual's noise-induced hearing loss.\n       In assessing when audiometric data collected by the \n     military became adequate for VA to evaluate if a veteran's \n     hearing threshold shift could be detected at or prior to \n     separation, the Committees intend for NAS to review and \n     report on a representative sample of individual records. This \n     should reflect not only an appropriate distribution of \n     individuals among the various Armed Forces, but within each \n     military service branch so that these records represent \n     servicemembers who might reasonably be expected to have \n     different levels of noise exposure in the course of their \n     duties. The representative sample should also include records \n     of servicemembers discharged during or after distinct periods \n     of war or conflict and consider the environment in which they \n     served in order to gauge how adequately each branch collected \n     audiometric data following World War II, the Korean conflict, \n     the Vietnam era, and during and following the Persian Gulf \n     War.\n       The Compromise Agreement would generally follow the Senate \n     language requiring VA to report on hearing loss claims and \n     medical treatment for hearing disorders. The Compromise \n     Agreement would amend this language to refer to the number of \n     decisions issued and their results, rather than claims \n     submitted in fiscal years 2000 through 2002, and would remove \n     references to military occupational specialties.\n\n                       TITLE II--MEMORIAL AFFAIRS\n\n\n   PROHIBITION ON CERTAIN ADDITIONAL BENEFITS FOR PERSONS COMMITTING \n                             CAPITAL CRIMES\n\n                              Current law\n\n       Sections 2411 and 2408(d) of title 38, United States Code, \n     prohibit persons who are convicted of capital crimes from \n     interment or memorialization in National Cemetery \n     Administration cemeteries, Arlington National Cemetery \n     (``ANC''), or a State cemetery that receives VA grant \n     funding.

A hybrid ARM \n     combines features of fixed rate mortgages and adjustable rate \n     mortgages. A hybrid ARM has a fixed rate of interest for at \n     least the first 3 years of the loan, with an annual interest \n     rate adjustment after the fixed rate has expired.\n\n                              Senate bill\n\n       Section 301 of S. 2237 would authorize VA to establish a \n     three-year pilot program to guarantee hybrid ARMs and \n     reauthorize a fiscal year-1993 to 1995 pilot program to \n     guarantee conventional ARMs. This authority would begin in \n     fiscal year 2003 and expire at the end of fiscal year 2005.\n\n                               House bill\n\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n\n                          Compromise agreement\n\n       Section 303 of the Compromise Agreement would authorize VA \n     to guarantee hybrid ARMs for a period of two years.

Eligibility to receive the Medal of Honor special \n     pension is contingent upon having first been awarded the \n     Medal of Honor.\n\n                              Senate bill\n\n       Section 104 of S. 2237 would increase the Medal of Honor \n     special pension from $600 to $1,000 per month. Beginning in \n     January 2003, the pension amount would be adjusted annually \n     to maintain the value of the pension in the face of the \n     rising cost of living. The amount of this adjustment would \n     match the percentage of the cost-of-living adjustment paid to \n     Social Security recipients. The Senate Bill would also \n     provide for a one-time, lump-sum payment in the amount of \n     special pension the recipient would have received between the \n     date of the act of valor and the date that the recipient's \n     pension actually commenced.\n\n                               House bill\n\n       H.R. 2561 would increase the special pension payable to \n     Medal of Honor recipients from $600 to $1,000 per month, and \n     provide a lump sum payment for existing Medal of Honor \n     recipients in an amount equal to the total amount of special \n     pension that the person would have received had the person \n     received special pension during the period beginning the \n     first day of the month that began after the act giving rise \n     to the receipt of the Medal of Honor, and ending with the \n     last day of the month preceding the month that such person's \n     special compensation commenced. H.R. 2561 also would provide \n     criminal penalties for the unauthorized purchase or \n     possession of the Medal and for making a false representation \n     as a Medal recipient.\n\n                          Compromise agreement\n\n       Section 304 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language, but would modify the effective date of the \n     provision to September 1, 2003. It is the Committee's \n     understanding that the first month a Medal of Honor recipient \n     would receive special pension is October 2003.\n       It is the Committees' intent that the lump sum payment of \n     special pension be determined using the rates of special \n     pension and the laws of eligibility in effect (including \n     applicable age requirements) for months beginning after an \n     individual's act of gallantry.

Certain homeland security duties \n     performed under title 32, United States Code, such as \n     protecting the nation's airports, have been carried out at \n     the request and expense of the Federal government with \n     National Guard members under the command of their state \n     governors.\n\n                              Senate bill\n\n       Section 401 of S. 2237 would expand SSCRA protections to \n     include those National Guard members serving full-time, upon \n     an order of the Governor of a State at the request of the \n     head of a Federal law enforcement agency and with the \n     concurrence of the Secretary of Defense, under 502(f) of \n     title 32, United States Code for homeland security purposes.\n\n                               House bill\n\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n\n                          Compromise agreement\n\n       Section 305 of the Compromise Agreement would provide that \n     when members of the National Guard are called to active \n     service for more than 30 consecutive days under section \n     502(f) of title 32, United States Code, to respond to a \n     national emergency declared by the President, coverage under \n     the provisions of the SSCRA would be available. The \n     Committees note that this provision is intended to extend \n     protections of the SSCRA to members of the National Guard \n     when called to duty under circumstances similar to those \n     following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\n\n\n               EXTENSION OF INCOME VERIFICATION AUTHORITY\n\n                              Current law\n\n       Section 6103(l)(7)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code gives \n     the Internal Revenue Service (``IRS'') authority to furnish \n     income information to the VA from IRS records so that VA \n     might determine eligibility for VA need-based pension, \n     parents dependency and indemnity compensation, and priority \n     for VA health-care services. This provision currently expires \n     on September 30, 2003, pursuant to Public Law 105-33.\n       Section 5317 of title 38, United States Code, provides \n     parallel authority for VA to use IRS information and requires \n     VA to notify applicants for needs-based benefits that income \n     information furnished by the applicant may be compared with \n     the information obtained from the Departments of Health and \n     Human Services and Treasury under section 6103(l)(7)(D).

It has come to \n     the Committees' attention that the Administration has \n     disregarded Congressional intent in interpreting the CAVC to \n     be part of the Executive Branch and subject to rescissions of \n     Executive Branch agency budgets, pursuant to section 1403 of \n     Public Law 107-206. The Committees note that while the budget \n     for the Court is included in the President's budget, the \n     Executive Branch has no authority to review it. Public Law \n     100-687, section 4082(a). It is the Committees' intent to \n     clarify that the CAVC is not part of the Executive Branch. \n     The Committees have so stated on other occasions, e.g., ``The \n     Court, established by the Congress under Article I of the \n     Constitution to exercise judicial power, has unusual status \n     as an independent tribunal that is not subject to the control \n     of the President or the executive branch.''

The ``clearly \n     erroneous'' standard has been defined as requiring CAVC to \n     uphold BVA findings of fact if the findings are supported by \n     ``a plausible basis in the record . . . even if [CAVC] might \n     not have reached the same factual determinations.'' Wensch v. \n     Principi, 15 Vet. App. 362, 366-68 (2001). The recent U.S. \n     Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit decision of Hensley \n     v. West, 212 F.3d 1255 (Fed. Cir. 2000) emphasized that CAVC \n     should perform only limited, deferential review of BVA \n     decisions, and stated that BVA fact-finding ``is entitled on \n     review to substantial deference.'' Id. at 1263.\n       Section 5107(b) of title 38, United States Code, provides \n     that VA must find for the claimant when, in considering the \n     evidence of record, there is an approximate balance of \n     positive and negative evidence regarding any material issue \n     including the ultimate merits of the claim. This ``benefit of \n     the doubt'' standard applicable to proceedings before VA is \n     unique in administrative law. Under the benefit of the doubt \n     rule, unless the preponderance of the evidence is against the \n     claimant, the claim is granted. Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. \n     App. 49 (1990) and Forshey v. Principi, 284 F.3d 1335 \n     (Fed. Cir. 2002).\n\n                              Senate bill\n\n       Section 501 of S. 2237 would amend section 7261(a)(4) of \n     title 38 to change the standard of review CAVC applies to BVA \n     findings of fact from ``clearly erroneous'' to ``unsupported \n     by substantial evidence.'' Section 502 would also cross-\n     reference section 5107(b) in order to emphasize that the \n     Secretary's application of the ``benefit of the doubt'' to an \n     appellant's claim would be considered by CAVC on appeal.\n\n                               House bill\n\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n\n                          Compromise agreement\n\n       Section 401 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language with the following amendments.\n       The Compromise Agreement would modify the standard of \n     review in the Senate bill in subsection (a) by deleting the \n     change to a ``substantial evidence'' standard. It would \n     modify the requirements of the review the Court must perform \n     when it is making determinations under section 7261(a) of \n     title 38, United States Code. Since the Secretary is \n     precluded from seeking judicial review of decisions of the \n     Board of Veterans Appeals, the addition of the words \n     ``adverse to the claimant'' in subsection (a) is intended to \n     clarify that findings of fact favorable to the claimant may \n     not be reviewed by the Court. Further, the addition of the \n     words ``or reverse'' after ``and set aside'' is intended to \n     emphasize that the Committees expect the Court to reverse \n     clearly erroneous findings when appropriate, rather than \n     remand the case.\n       New subsection (b) would maintain language from the Senate \n     bill that would require the Court to examine the record of \n     proceedings before the Secretary and BVA and the special \n     emphasis during the judicial process on the benefit of the \n     doubt provisions of section 5107 (b) as it makes findings of \n     fact in reviewing BVA decisions. This would not alter the \n     formula of the standard of review on the Court, with the \n     uncertainty of interpretation of its application that would \n     accompany such a change. The combination of these changes is \n     intended to provide for more searching appellate review of \n     BVA decisions, and thus give full force to the ``benefit of \n     doubt'' provision.\n       The Compromise Agreement would also modify the effective \n     date of this provision to apply to cases that have not been \n     decided prior to the enactment of this Act. This provision \n     would not apply to cases in which a decision has been made, \n     but are not final because the time to request panel review or \n     to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal \n     Circuit (``Federal Circuit'') has not expired.\n\n\n REVIEW BY COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT OF DECISIONS OF LAW\n\n                              Current law\n\n       Under section 7292(a) of title 38, United States Code, the \n     Federal Circuit may only review CAVC decisions involving \n     questions of law ``with respect to the validity of any \n     statute or regulation.'' It does not explicitly have the \n     authority to hear appeals of CAVC decisions that are not \n     clearly legal interpretations of statutes or regulations.\n\n                              Senate bill\n\n       Section 502 of S. 2237 would amend sections 7292(a) and (c) \n     of title 38, United States Code, to specifically provide for \n     appellate review of a CAVC decision on any rule of law.\n\n                               House bill\n\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n\n                          Compromise agreement\n\n       Section 402 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n[[Page S11338]]\n\n AUTHORITY OF COURT OF APPEALS FOR VETERANS CLAIMS TO AWARD FEES UNDER \n       EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE ACT TO NON-ATTORNEY PRACTITIONERS\n\n                              Current law\n\n       Currently, section 2412(d) of title 28, United States Code, \n     the Equal Access to Justice Act (``EAJA''), shifts the burden \n     of attorney fees from the citizen to the government in cases \n     where the government's litigation position is not \n     substantially justified and the citizen qualifies under \n     certain income and asset criteria.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has, at long \nlast, taken up the Drug Competition Act of 1002, S. 754. Prescription \ndrug prices are rapidly increasing, and are a source of considerable \nconcern to many Americans, especially senior citizens and families. \nGeneric drug prices can be as much as 80 percent lower than the \ncomparable brand name version.\n  While the Drug Competition Act is a small bill in terms of length, it \nis a large one in terms of impact. It will ensure that law enforcement \nagencies can take quick and decisive action against companies that are \ndriven more by greed than by good sense. It gives the Federal Trade \nCommission and the Justice Department access to information about \nsecret deals between drug companies that keep generic drugs off the \nmarket. This is a practice that hurts American families, particularly \nsenior citizens, by denying them access to low-cost generic drugs, and \nfurther inflating medical costs.\n  This has been a genuine bipartisan effort, and I must thank all my \ncolleagues, including Senator Hatch who has a long-standing interest in \nthese issues, subcommittee Chairman Kohl who has worked with me from \nthe start on this effort, and particularly Senator Grassley, who has \nworked hard to reach consensus on this bill that will help protect \nconsumers.\n  The issue of drug companies paying generic companies not to compete \nwas exposed in recent years by the FTC, and by articles in major \nnewspapers, including an editorial in the July 26, 2000, the New York \nTimes, titled ``Driving Up Drug Prices.'' This editorial concluded that \nthe problem ``needs help from Congress to close loopholes in federal \nlaw.'' And while the FTC has sued pharmaceutical companies that have \nmade such secret and anticompetitive deals, as the then-Director of the \nBureau of Competition Molly Boast testified before the Judiciary \nCommittee in May 2001, the antitrust enforcement agencies are only \nfinding out about such deals by luck, or by accident. Most recently, \nthe FTC has issued a comprehensive study of the generic pharmaceutical \nindustry which explicitly supported passage of S. 754.\n  Under current law, the first generic manufacturer that gets \npermission to sell a generic drug before the patent on the brand-name \ndrug expires, enjoys protection from competition for 180 days--a \nheadstart on other generic companies. That was a good idea--but the \nunfortunate loophole exploited by a few is that secret deals can be \nmade that allow the manufacturer of the generic drug to claim the 180-\nday grace\n\n[[Page S11341]]\n\nperiod--to block other generic drugs from entering the market--while, \nat the same time, getting paid by the brand-name manufacturer to not \nsell the generic drug.\n  The bill closes this loophole for those who want to cheat the public, \nbut keeps the system the same for companies engaged in true \ncompetition. The deals would be reviewed only by those agencies--the \nagreements would not be available to the public. I think it is \nimportant for Congress not to overact and throw out the good with the \nbad. Most generic companies want to take advantage of this 180-day \nprovision and deliver quality generic drugs at much lower costs for \nconsumers. We should not eliminate the incentive for them. Instead, we \nshould let the FTC and Justice look at every deal that could lead to \nabuse, so that only the deals that are consistent with the intent of \nthat law will be allowed to stand.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Finance \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration and the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 4070.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4070) to amend the Social Security Act and the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide additional \n     safeguards for Social Security and Supplemental Security \n     Income beneficiaries with representative payees, to enhance \n     program protections, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Senate version of H.R. 4070, the ``Social Security Program \nProtection Act of 2002.'' H.R. 4070 is bipartisan legislation developed \nby Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee Chairman Shaw and \nranking member Matsui. H.R. 4070 passed the House unanimously by a vote \nof 425 to 0. In keeping with the bipartisan tradition of the Senate \nFinance Committee and with the bipartisan origins of this legislation, \nSenator Grassley and I have worked together to further refine this \nlegislation for Senate consideration.\n  The House-passed version of H.R. 4070 makes a number of important \nchanges to the Social Security and Supplemental Security Income, SSI, \nprograms. These changes will accomplish a number of important goals: \nthey will enhance the financial security of some of the most vulnerable \nbeneficiaries of these programs, increase protections to seniors from \ndeceptive practices by individuals in the private sector, improve \nprogram integrity, thereby saving money for the Social Security and \nMedicare Trust Funds and taxpayers, and reduce disincentives to \nemployment for disabled individuals.\n  One of the most important results of this legislation will be to \nenhance the financial security of the almost 7 million Social Security \nand SSI beneficiaries who are not capable of managing their own \nfinancial affairs due to advanced age or disability. The Social \nSecurity Administration, SSA, currently appoints individuals or \norganizations to act as ``representative payees'' for such \nbeneficiaries. Most of these representative payees perform their roles \nconscientiously. However, some do not. Indeed, there have even been \ninstances of terrible abuse in this program.\n  It is imperative that Congress take action to guard vulnerable \nseniors and disabled individuals from such abuse. This legislation \nincreases requirements for SSA to provide restitution to beneficiaries \nwhen representative payees defraud the beneficiaries of their benefits. \nThe legislation also tightens the qualifications for representative \npayees, increases oversight of the program, and imposes stricter \npenalties on those who violate their responsibilities.\n\n[[Page S11344]]\n\n  The legislation expands the protection to seniors and disabled \nindividuals by increasing the list of references to Social Security, \nMedicare and Medicaid which cannot be used by private-sector \nindividuals, companies and organizations to give a false impression of \nFederal endorsement. The legislation also protects seniors from those \nwho deceptively attempt to charge them for services that the seniors \ncould receive for free from SSA.\n  H.R. 4070 improves program integrity by expanding the current \nprohibition against paying benefits to fugitive felons. As part of the \n1996 welfare reform law, Congress banned the payment of SSI benefits to \nthese individuals. However, under current law, fugitive felons can \nstill receive Social Security benefits under title II. This legislation \nprohibits the payment of title II Social Security benefits to fugitive \nfelons.\n  H.R. 4070 also includes technical amendments to improve the \neffectiveness of the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement \nAct, legislation passed in 1999 to help beneficiaries with disabilities \nbecome employed and move toward self-sufficiency.\n  To these House-passed provisions, Senator Grassley and I have added \nsome new provisions that we feel are very important.\n  First, we added a program integrity provision which will give the SSA \nInspector General additional tools to pursue individuals who commit \nfraud by concealing work activity while they are receiving disability \nbenefits.\n  Second, we included a provision to make uniform an exemption to the \nGovernment Pension Offset. The Government Pension Offset, GPO, was \nenacted in order to equalize the treatment of workers in jobs not \ncovered by Social Security and workers in jobs covered by Social \nSecurity, with respect to spousal and survivors benefits. The GPO \nreduces the Social Security spousal or survivors benefit by an amount \nequal to two-thirds of the government pension. However, as a recent GAO \nreport highlighted, State and local government workers are exempt from \nthe GPO if their job on their last day of employment was covered by \nSocial Security. In contrast, Federal workers who switched from the \nCivil Service Retirement System, CSRS, a system that is not covered by \nSocial Security, to the Federal Employee Retirement System, FERS, a \nsystem that is covered by Social Security, must work for 5 years under \nFERS in order to be exempt from the GPO. Our Senate version of H.R. \n4070 makes the exemption to the Government Pension Offset the same for \nState and local government workers as for Federal Government workers.\n  Finally, we added four technical refinements to the Railroad \nRetirement and Survivors' Improvement Act of 2001. These changes will \nhelp to promote the efficient implementation of that important \nlegislation which became law last year.\n  I believe that each of the provisions of H.R. 4070, as passed by the \nHouse, and each of the provisions that Senator Grassley and I have \nadded deserve the support of the Senate. Moreover, in an attempt to \nexpedite congressional passage of this legislation, the changes that \nSenator Grassley and I want to make to the House-passed bill have \nalready been worked out with both the chairman and the ranking member \nof the Social Security Subcommittee of the House Ways and Means \nCommittee. Indeed, I have a statement that has been agreed to by the \nchairman and the ranking member of the Social Security Subcommittee, as \nwell as by the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Finance \nCommittee. This statement provides details about each of the provisions \nof the legislation, as well as the rationale behind each provision. I \nam submitting this full statement for the record.\n  I would also like to point out that the legislation as a whole has \nnet savings of more than $500 million over ten years for taxpayers, \naccording to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. As a result, \nthe Social Security and Medicare Trust Fund balances will increase by \nmore than $500 million over that period, excluding increases from \nincreased interest income. Moreover, over the next 75 years, this \nlegislation will decrease--not increase--the long-run actuarial deficit \nfor the Social Security Trust Funds, although by a negligible amount. \nThis information comes from Office of the Independent Chief Actuary for \nthe Social Security Administration. I am submitting the estimate from \nthe office of the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration \nfor the Record. I will submit the official written estimate from the \nCongressional Budget Office for the Record as soon as I receive it.\n  This legislation contains the types of improvements we can all agree \non, as demonstrated by the overwhelming bipartisan vote in the House, \nand the bipartisan, bicameral agreement of the chairman and ranking \nmembers of the committees of jurisdiction. I wholeheartedly urge my \ncolleagues in the Senate to approve these sensible and important \nchanges.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill and \na memorandum from the Social Security Administration be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     ``The Social Security Program Protection Act of 2002'' Summary\n\n                  TITLE I. PROTECTION OF BENEFICIARIES\n\n                   Subtitle A. Representative Payees\n\n\n Section 101. Authority to Reissue Benefits Misused by Organizational \n                         Representative Payees\n\n                              Present law\n\n       The Social Security Act requires the re-issuance of \n     benefits misused by any representative payee when the \n     Commissioner finds that the Social Security Administration \n     (SSA) negligently failed to investigate and monitor the \n     payee.\n\n                        Explanation of provision\n\n       The new provision eliminates the requirement that benefits \n     be reissued only upon a finding of SSA negligence in the case \n     of misuse by an organizational payee or an individual payee \n     representing 15 or more beneficiaries. Thus, the Commissioner \n     would re-issue benefits under Titles II, VIII and XVI in any \n     case in which a beneficiary's funds are misused by an \n     organizational payee or an individual payee representing 15 \n     or more beneficiaries.\n       The new provision defines misuse as any case in which a \n     representative payee converts the benefits entrusted to his \n     or her care for purposes other than the ``use and benefit'' \n     of the beneficiary, and authorizes the Commissioner to define \n     ``use and benefit'' in regulation.\n       In crafting a regulatory definition for ``use and \n     benefit,'' the Commissioner should take special care to \n     distinguish between the situation in which the representative \n     payee violates his or her trust responsibility by converting \n     the benefits to further the payee's own self interest, and \n     the situation in which the payee faithfully serves the \n     beneficiary by using the benefits in a way that principally \n     aids the beneficiary but which also incidentally aids the \n     payee or another individual. For instance, cases in which a \n     representative payee uses the benefits entrusted to his or \n     her care to help pay the rent on an apartment that he or she \n     and the beneficiary share should not be considered misuse.\n       This provision applies to benefit misuse by a \n     representative payee as determined by the Commissioner on or \n     after January 1, 1995.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       There have been a number of highly publicized cases \n     involving organizational representative payees that have \n     misused large sums of monies paid to them on behalf of the \n     Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) \n     beneficiaries they represented. In most instances, these \n     organizations operated as criminal enterprises, bent not only \n     on stealing funds from beneficiaries, but also on carefully \n     concealing the evidence of their wrongdoing. These illegal \n     activities went undetected until large sums had been stolen. \n     If the Social Security Administration is not shown to be \n     negligent for failing to investigate and monitor the payee, \n     affected beneficiaries may never be repaid or may be repaid \n     only when the representative payee committing misuse makes \n     restitution to SSA.\n       Requiring the SSA to reissue benefit payments to the \n     victims of misuse by organizational payees or individual \n     payees serving 15 or more beneficiaries protects \n     beneficiaries who are among the most vulnerable because they \n     may have no family members or friends who are willing or able \n     to manage their benefits for them. With respect to individual \n     representative payees, the provision applies only to \n     representative payees serving 15 or more beneficiaries. As \n     with many cases involving organizational representative \n     payees, these are cases which may be the hardest to detect. \n     Moreover, extending the provision to cases involving \n     individual payees serving fewer beneficiaries may lead to \n     fraudulent claims of misuse. These claims, which often turn \n     on information available only from close family members, \n     would be difficult to assess. Similarly, extension of this \n     provision to these cases could potentially encourage misuse \n     or poor money management by these individual representative \n     payees if they believed that the beneficiary could eventually \n     be paid a second time by SSA.\n       The effective date would protect the interests of \n     beneficiaries affected by these cases\n\n[[Page S11345]]\n\n     of egregious misuse that have been identified in recent \n     years.\n\n\n            Section 102. Oversight of Representative Payees\n\n                              Present law\n\n       Present law requires non-governmental fee-for-service \n     organizational representative payees to be licensed or \n     bonded. Periodic on-site reviews of representative payees by \n     SSA is not required.\n\n                        Explanation of provision\n\n       The new provision requires non-governmental fee-for-service \n     organizational representative payees to be both licensed and \n     bonded (provided that licensing is available in the State). \n     In addition, such representative payees must submit yearly \n     proof of bonding and licensing, as well as copies of any \n     available independent audits that were performed on the payee \n     in the past year.\n       The new provision also requires the Commissioner of Social \n     Security to conduct periodic onsite reviews of: (1) a person \n     who serves as a representative payee to 15 or more \n     beneficiaries, (2) non-governmental fee-for-service \n     representative payees (as defined in Titles II and XVI), and \n     (3) any agency that serves as the representative payee to 50 \n     or more beneficiaries. In addition, the Commissioner is \n     required to submit an annual report to the Committee on Ways \n     and Means of the House of Representatives and the Committee \n     on Finance of the Senate on the reviews conducted in the \n     prior fiscal year.\n       The bonding, licensing, and audit provisions are effective \n     on the first day of the 13th month following enactment of the \n     legislation. The periodic on-site review provision is \n     effective upon enactment.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       Strengthening the bonding and licensing requirements for \n     representative payees would add further safeguards to protect \n     beneficiaries' funds. State licensing provides for some \n     oversight by the State into the fee-for-service \n     organization's business practices, and bonding provides some \n     assurances that a surety company has investigated the \n     organization and approved it for the level of risk associated \n     with the bond for community-based non-profit social service \n     agencies serving as representative payees.\n       On-site periodic visits should be conducted regularly to \n     reduce misuse of funds. To the degree possible, appropriate \n     auditing and accounting standards should be utilized in \n     conducting such reviews.\n\n\n Section 103. Disqualification from Service as Representative Payee of \n Persons Convicted of Offenses Resulting in Imprisonment for More Than \n One Year, of Persons Fleeing Prosecution, Custody or Confinement, and \n                of Persons Violating Probation or Parole\n\n                              Present law\n\n       Sections 205, 807, and 1631 of the Social Security Act \n     disqualify individuals from being representative payees if \n     they have been convicted of fraud under the Social Security \n     Act.\n\n                        Explanation of provision\n\n       The new provision expands the scope of disqualification to \n     prohibit an individual from serving as a representative payee \n     if he or she: (1) has been convicted imprisonment for more \n     than one year; (2) is fleeing to avoid prosecution, or \n     custody or confinement after conviction; or (3) violated a \n     condiction of probation or parole. An exception applies if \n     the Commissioner of Social Security determines that a person \n     who has been convicted of any offense resulting in \n     imprisonment for more than one year would, notwithstanding \n     such conviction, be an appropriate representative payee.\n       The new provision requires the Commissioner to submit a \n     report to the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate \n     evaluating existing procedures and reviews conducted for \n     representative payees to determine whether they are \n     sufficient to protect benefits from being misused.\n       This provision is effective on the first day of the 13th \n     month beginning after the date of enactment, except that the \n     report to Congress is due no later than 270 days after the \n     date of enactment.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       Prohibiting persons convicted of offenses resulting in \n     imprisonment for more than one year, of persons fleeing \n     prosecution, custody or confinement, and of persons violating \n     probation or parole from serving as representative payees, \n     not just prohibiting those convicted of fraud under the \n     Social Security Act, decreases the likelihood of \n     mismanagement or abuse of beneficiaries' funds. Also, \n     allowing such person to serve as representative payees places \n     beneficiary payments in potential jeopardy and could raise \n     serious questions about the SSA's stewardship of taxpayer \n     funds. The agency's report to Congress will assist the \n     committees of jurisdiction in both the House and Senate in \n     their oversight of the representative payee program.\n       The criminal background information provided by those who \n     apply to be representative payees should be the same as the \n     information considered by the Commissioner to implement this \n     provision.\n\n\nSection 104. Fee Forfeiture in Case of Benefit Misuse by Representative \n                                 Payees\n\n                              Present law\n\n       Certain organizational representative payees are authorized \n     to collect a fee for their services. The fee, which is \n     determined by a statutory formula, is deducted from the \n     beneficiary's benefit payments.\n\n                        Explanation of provision\n\n       The new provision requires representative payees to forfeit \n     the fee for those months during which the representative \n     payee misused funds, as determined by the Commissioner of \n     Social Security or a court of competent jurisdiction. This \n     provision applies to any month involving benefit misuse by a \n     representative payee as determined by the Commissioner after \n     December 31, 2002.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       Payees who misuse their clients' funds are not properly \n     performing the service for which the fee was paid and \n     therefore such fees should be forfeited. Permitting the payee \n     to retain the fees is tantamount to rewarding the payee for \n     violating his or her responsibility to use the benefits for \n     the individual's needs.\n\n\n Section 105. Liabilities of Representative Payees for Misused Benefits\n\n                              Present law\n\n       Although the SSA has been provided with expanded authority \n     to recover overpayments (such as the use of tax refund \n     offsets, referral to contract collection agencies, \n     notification of credit bureaus, and administrative offsets of \n     future federal benefits payments), these tools cannot be used \n     to recoup benefits misused by a representative payee.\n\n                        Explanation of provision\n\n       The new provision treats benefits misused by a non-\n     governmental representative payee (including all individual \n     representative payees) as an overpayment to the \n     representative payee, rather than the beneficiary, thus \n     subjecting the representative payee to current overpayment \n     recovery authorities. Any recovered benefits not already \n     reissued to the beneficiary pursuant to section 101 of this \n     legislation would be reissued to either the beneficiary or \n     their alternate representative payee, up to the total amount \n     misused. This provision applies to benefit misuse by a \n     representative payee in any case where the Commissioner of \n     Social Security makes a determination of misuse after \n     December 31, 2002.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       Although the SSA has been provided with expanded authority \n     to recover overpayments, these tools cannot be used to recoup \n     benefits misused by a representative payee. Treating benefits \n     misused by non-governmental organization representative \n     payees and all individual payees as overpayments to the \n     representative payee would provide the SSA with additional \n     means for recovering misused payments.\n\n\nSection 106. Authority to Redirect Delivery of Benefit Payments When a \n       Representative Payee Fails to Provide Required Accounting\n\n                              Present law\n\n       The Social Security Act requires representative payees to \n     submit accounting reports to the Commissioner of Social \n     Security detailing how a beneficiary's benefit payments were \n     used. A report is required at least annually, but may be \n     requested by the Commissioner at any time if the Commissioner \n     has reason to believe the representative payee is misusing \n     benefits.\n\n                        Explanation of provision\n\n       The new provision authorizes the Commissioner of Social \n     Security to require a representative payee to receive any \n     benefits under Titles II, VIII, and XVI in person at a Social \n     Security field office if the representative payee fails to \n     provide an annual accounting of benefits report. The \n     Commissioner would be required to provide proper notice and \n     the opportunity for a hearing prior to redirecting benefits \n     to the field office. This provision is effective 180 days \n     after the date of enactment.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       Accounting reports are an important means of monitoring the \n     activities of representative payees to prevent fraud and \n     abuse. Redirecting benefit payments to the field office would \n     enable the agency to promptly address the failure of the \n     representative payee to file a report.\n\n                        Subtitle B: Enforcement\n\n\nSection 111. Civil Monetary Penalty Authority with Respect to Wrongful \n                  Conversions by Representative Payees\n\n                              Present law\n\n       The Social Security Act authorizes the Commissioner to \n     impose a civil monetary penalty (of up to $5,000 for each \n     violation) along with an assessment (of up to twice the \n     amount wrongly paid), upon any person who knowingly uses \n     false information or knowingly omits information to wrongly \n     obtain Title II, VIII or XVI benefits.\n\n                        Explanation of provision\n\n       The new provision expands the application of civil monetary \n     penalties to include misuse of Title II, VIII or XVI benefits \n     by representative payees. A civil monetary penalty of up to \n     $5,000 may be imposed for each violation, along with an \n     assessment of up to twice the amount of misused benefits. \n     This provision applies to violations occurring after the date \n     of enactment.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       Providing authority for SSA to impose civil monetary \n     penalties along with an assessment of up to twice the amount \n     of misused benefits, in addition to the SSA's\n\n[[Page S11346]]\n\n     present authority permitting recovery of misused funds, would \n     provide the SSA with an additional means of addressing misuse \n     by representative payees.\n\n                     TITLE II. PROGRAM PROTECTIONS\n\n\nSection 201. Issuance by Commissioner of Social Security of Receipts to \nAcknowledge Submission of Reports of Changes in Work or Earnings Status\n\n                              Present law\n\n       Changes in work or earnings status can affect a Title II \n     disability beneficiary's right to continued entitlement to \n     disability benefits. Changes in the amount of earned income \n     can also affect an SSI recipient's continued eligibility for \n     SSI benefits or his or her monthly benefit amount.\n       The Commissioner has promulgated regulations that require \n     Title II disability beneficiaries to report changes in work \n     or earnings status (20 CFR, 404.1588), and regulations that \n     require SSI recipients (or their representative payees) to \n     report any increase or decrease in income (20 CFR, 416.704--\n     416.714).\n\n                        Explanation of provision\n\n       The new provision requires the Commissioner to issue a \n     receipt to a disabled beneficiary (or representative of a \n     beneficiary) who reports a change in his or her work or \n     earnings status. The Commissioner is required to continue \n     issuing such receipts until the Commissioner has implemented \n     a centralized computer file that would record the date on \n     which the disabled beneficiary (or representative) reported \n     the change in work or earnings status.\n       This provision requires the Commissioner to begin issuing \n     receipts as soon as possible, but no later than one year \n     after the date of enactment. The Committees with jurisdiction \n     over the Social Security Administration, the House Committee \n     on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on Finance (the \n     Committees), are aware that SSA has developed software known \n     as the Modernized Return to Work System (MRTW). This software \n     will assist SSA employees in recording information about \n     changes in work and earnings status and in making \n     determinations of whether such changes affect continuing \n     entitlement to disability benefits. The software also has the \n     capability of automatically issuing receipts. SSA has \n     informed the Committees that this software is already in use \n     in some of the agency's approximately 1300 local field \n     offices, and that SSA expects to put it into operation in the \n     remainder of the field offices over the next year. The \n     Committees expect that SSA field offices that are already \n     using the MRTW system will immediately begin issuing receipts \n     to disabled beneficiaries who report changes in work or \n     earnings status, and that SSA will require the other field \n     offices to begin issuing receipts as these offices begin \n     using the MRTW system over the next year. For disabled Title \n     XVI beneficiaries, if SSA issues a notice to the beneficiary \n     immediately following the report of earnings that details the \n     effect of the change in income on the monthly benefit amount, \n     this notice would serve as a receipt.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       Witnesses have testified before the Social Security \n     Subcommittee and the Human Resources Subcommittee of the \n     House Ways and Means Committee that SSA does not currently \n     have an effective system in place for processing and \n     recording Title II and Title XVI disability beneficiaries' \n     reports of changes in work and earnings status. Issuing \n     receipts to disabled beneficiaries who make such reports \n     would provide them with proof that they had properly \n     fulfilled their obligation to report these changes.\n\n\n      Section 202. Denial of Title II Benefits to Persons Fleeing \n    Prosecution, Custody, or Confinement, and to Persons Violating \n                          Probation or Parole\n\n                              Present law\n\n       The welfare reform law (``Personal Responsibility and Work \n     Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996,'' P.L. 104-193) \n     included provisions making persons ineligible to receive SSI \n     benefits during any month in which they are fleeing to avoid \n     prosecution for a felony or to avoid custody or confinement \n     after conviction for a felony, or are in violation of a \n     condition of probation or parole. However, the same \n     prohibition does not apply to Social Security benefits under \n     Title II.\n\n                        Explanation of provision\n\n       The new provision makes persons ineligible to receive \n     Social Security benefits under Title II during any month in \n     which they are fleeing to avoid prosecution for a felony or \n     to avoid custody or confinement after conviction for a \n     felony, or are in violation of a condition of probation or \n     parole. However, the Commissioner may, for good cause, pay \n     withheld benefits to persons fleeing to avoid prosecution for \n     a felony or to avoid custody or confinement after conviction \n     for a felony. Finally, the Commissioner, upon written request \n     by law enforcement officials, shall assist such officials in \n     apprehending fugitives by providing them with the address, \n     Social Security number, and, if available to SSA, a \n     photograph of the fugitive.\n       This provision is effective on the first day of the first \n     month that begins on or after the date that is 9 months after \n     the date of enactment.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       The Inspector General has estimated that persons fleeing to \n     avoid prosecution for a felony or to avoid custody or \n     confinement after conviction for a felony, or in violation of \n     a condition of probation or parole, receive at least $39 \n     million in Title II Social Security benefits annually. The \n     Inspector General has recommended that the law be changed to \n     prohibit these individuals from receiving such benefits.\n       Under this provision, the Commissioner would be required to \n     develop regulations within one year of the date of enactment \n     with regard to the use of the ``good cause'' exception to \n     withholding Title II benefits from persons fleeing to avoid \n     prosecution for a felony or to avoid custody or confinement \n     after conviction for a felony. The good cause exception will \n     provide the Commissioner with the ability to pay benefits \n     under unusual circumstances in which the Commissioner deems \n     the withholding of benefits to be inappropriate. The \n     Committees expect that one of the uses to be made by the \n     Commissioner of this discretionary authority will be to deal \n     with situations that arise when Social Security beneficiaries \n     are found to be in flight from a warrant relating to a crime \n     for which the beneficiary is ultimately not convicted. In \n     such circumstances, it is expected that the absence of a \n     conviction should serve as a basis for paying any benefits \n     withheld from the beneficiary during a period of flight.\n       The Committees have been made aware of situations in which \n     the violation of a condition of probation or parole could \n     involve mitigating circumstances that may warrant further \n     examination regarding the denial of benefits created by this \n     section. The Committees plan to work with the Commissioner of \n     Social Security to further examine such situations in order \n     to evaluate whether the current good faith exception is \n     sufficient.\n\n\n  Section 203. Requirements Relating to Offers to Provide for a Fee a \n Product or Service Available Without Charge from the Social Security \n                             Administration\n\n                              Present law\n\n       Section 1140 of the Social Security Act prohibits or \n     restricts various activities involving the use of Social \n     Security and Medicare symbols, emblems, or references which \n     give a false impression that an item is approved, endorsed, \n     or authorized by the Social Security Administration, the \n     Health Care Financing Administration (now the Centers for \n     Medicare and Medicaid Services), or the Department of Health \n     and Human Services. It also provides for the imposition of \n     civil monetary penalties with respect to violations of the \n     section.\n\n                        Explanation of provision\n\n       Several individuals and companies offer Social Security \n     services for a fee even though the same services are \n     available directly from SSA free of charge. The new provision \n     requires persons or companies offering such services to \n     include in their solicitations a statement that the services \n     which they provide for a fee are available directly from SSA \n     free of charge. The statements would be required to comply \n     with standards promulgated through regulation by the \n     Commissioner of Social Security with respect to their \n     content, placement, visibility, and legibility. The amendment \n     applies to solicitations made after the 6th month following \n     the issuance of these standards. The new provision requires \n     that the Commissioner promulgate regulations within 1 year \n     after the date of enactment.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       Several individuals and companies offer Social Security \n     services for a fee even though the same services are \n     available directly from SSA free of charge. For example, \n     SSA's Inspector General has encountered business entities \n     that have offered assistance to individuals in changing their \n     names (upon marriage) or in obtaining a Social Security \n     number (upon the birth of a child) for a fee. These practices \n     can mislead and deceive senior citizens, newlyweds, new \n     parents, and other individuals seeking services who may not \n     be aware that SSA provides these services for free.\n\n\n   Section 204. Refusal to Recognize Certain Individuals as Claimant \n                            Representatives\n\n                              Present law\n\n       An attorney in good standing is entitled to represent \n     claimants before the Commissioner of Social Security. The \n     Commissioner may prescribe rules and regulations governing \n     the recognition of persons other than attorneys representing \n     claimants before the Commissioner. Under present law, \n     attorneys disbarred in one jurisdiction, but licensed to \n     practice in another jurisdiction, must be recognized as a \n     claimant's representative.\n\n                        Explanation of provision\n\n       The new provision authorizes the Commissioner to refuse to \n     recognize as a representative, or disqualify as a \n     representative, an attorney who has been disbarred or \n     suspended from any court or bar, or who has been disqualified \n     from participating in or appearing before any Federal program \n     or agency. Due process (i.e., notice and an opportunity for a \n     hearing) would be required before taking such action. Also, \n     if a representative has been disqualified or suspended as a \n     result of collecting an unauthorized fee, full restitution is \n     required before reinstatement can be considered. This \n     provision is effective upon the date of enactment.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       This provision would provide additional protections for \n     beneficiaries who may rely\n\n[[Page S11347]]\n\n     on representatives during all phases of their benefit \n     application process. As part their ongoing oversight of \n     claimant representatives, the Committees intend to review \n     whether options to establish protections for claimants \n     represented by non-attorneys should be considered.\n\n\n    Section 205. Penalty for Corrupt or Forcible Interference with \n               Administration of the Social Security Act\n\n                              Present law\n\n       No provision.\n\n                        Explanation of provision\n\n       The new provision imposes a fine of not more than $5,000, \n     and imprisonment of not more than 3 years, or both, for \n     attempting to intimidate or impede--corruptly or by using \n     force or threats of force--any Social Security Administration \n     (SSA) officer, employee or contractor (including State \n     employees of disability determination services and any \n     individuals designated by the Commissioner) while they are \n     acting in their official capacities under the Social Security \n     Act. If the offense is committed only by threats of force, \n     however, the offender is subject to a fine of not more than \n     $3,000 and/or no more than one year in prison. This provision \n     is effective upon enactment.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       This provision extends to SSA employees the same \n     protections provided to employees of the Internal Revenue \n     Service under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. These \n     protections will allow SSA employees to perform their work \n     with more confidence that they will be safe from harm.\n       The Internal Revenue Manual defines the term ``corruptly'' \n     as follows: ``'Corruptly' characterizes an attempt to \n     influence any official in his or her official capacity under \n     this title by any improper inducement. For example, an offer \n     of a bribe or a passing of a bribe to an Internal Revenue \n     employee for the purpose of influencing him or her in the \n     performance of his or her official duties is corrupt \n     interference with the administration of federal laws.'' \n     (Internal Revenue Manual, [9.5] 11.3.2.2, 4-09-1999).\n       The Committees expect that judgment will be used in \n     enforcing this section. Social Security and SSI disability \n     claimants and beneficiaries, in particular, are frequently \n     subject to multiple, severe life stressors, which may include \n     severe physical, psychological, or financial difficulties. In \n     addition, disability claimants or beneficiaries who encounter \n     delays in approval of initial benefit applications or in \n     post-entitlement actions may incur additional stress, \n     particularly if they have no other source of income. Under \n     such circumstances, claimants or beneficiaries may at times \n     express frustration in an angry manner, without truly \n     intending to threaten or intimidate SSA employees. In \n     addition, approximately 25% of Social Security disability \n     beneficiaries and 35% of disabled SSI recipients have mental \n     impairments, and such individuals may be less able to control \n     emotional outbursts. These factors should be taken into \n     account in enforcing this provision.\n\n\n Section 206. Use of Symbols, Emblems or Names in Reference to Social \n                          Security or Medicare\n\n                              Present law\n\n       Section 1140 of the Social Security Act prohibits (subject \n     to civil penalties) the use of Social Security or Medicare \n     symbols, emblems and references on any item in a manner that \n     conveys the false impression that such item is approved, \n     endorsed or authorized by the Social Security Administration, \n     the Health Care Financing Administration (now the Centers for \n     Medicare and Medicaid Services) or the Department of Health \n     and Human Services.\n\n                        Explanation of provision\n\n       The new provision expands the prohibition in present law to \n     several other references to Social Security and Medicare. \n     This provision applies to items sent after 180 days after the \n     date of enactment.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       Expansion of this list helps to ensure that individuals \n     receiving any type of mail, solicitations or flyers bearing \n     symbols, emblems or names in reference to Social Security or \n     Medicare are not misled into believing that these agencies \n     approved or endorsed the services or products depicted in the \n     solicitations.\n\n\n  Section 207. Disqualification from Payment During Trial Work Period \n       Upon Conviction of Fraudulent Concealment of Work Activity\n\n                              Present law\n\n       An individual entitled to disability benefits under Title \n     II is entitled to a ``trial work period'' to test his or her \n     ability to work. The trial work period allows beneficiaries \n     to work with earnings above the substantial gainful activity \n     level for up to 9 months (which need not be consecutive) \n     without any loss of benefits. A month counts as a trial work \n     period month if the individual earns above a level \n     established by regulation (in 2002, this amount is $560 a \n     month). If the individual does not use the full 9 months \n     within a 60 month period, he or she is entitled to another 9 \n     month trial work period.\n       SSA's Inspector General has pursued prosecution of Title II \n     disability beneficiaries who fraudulently conceal work \n     activity by applying several criminal statutes, including \n     section 208(a) of the Social Security Act and sections 371 \n     and 641 of Title 18 of the United States Code (Crimes and \n     Criminal Procedures).\n\n                        Explanation of provision\n\n       Under the new provision, an individual who is convicted of \n     fraudulently concealing work activity during the trial work \n     period would not be entitled to receive a disability benefit \n     for trial work period months that occur prior to the \n     conviction but within the same period of disability. If the \n     individual had already been paid benefits for these months, \n     he or she would be liable for repayment of these benefits, in \n     addition to any restitution, penalties, fines, or assessments \n     that were otherwise due.\n       In order to be considered to be fraudulently concealing \n     work activity under this provision, the individual must have: \n     (1) provided false information to SSA about his or her \n     earnings during that period; (2) worked under another \n     identity, including under the social security number of \n     another person or a false social security number; or (3) \n     taken other actions to conceal work activity with the \n     intent to fraudulently receive benefits that he or she was \n     not entitled to.\n       This provision is effective with respect to work activity \n     performed after the date of enactment.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       Under current law, if an individual is convicted of \n     fraudulently concealing work activity, the dollar loss to the \n     government is calculated based on the benefits that the \n     individual would have received had he or she not concealed \n     the work activity. During the trial work period, disability \n     beneficiaries continue to receive their monthly benefit \n     amount no matter how much they earn. Therefore, benefits \n     received during the trial work period are not included in \n     calculating the total dollar loss to the government.\n       Many United States Attorneys set dollar-loss thresholds \n     that they use in determining which fraud cases to prosecute. \n     As benefits received during the trial work period are not \n     included in the dollar-loss totals, the dollar loss to the \n     government may fall below the thresholds set by the United \n     States Attorneys in cases involving fraudulent concealment of \n     work by Title II disability beneficiaries. In such \n     situations, the case would not be prosecuted even if the \n     evidence of fraud was very clear.\n       This provision rectifies this situation by establishing \n     that individuals convicted of fraudulently concealing work \n     activity during the trial work period are not entitled to \n     receive a benefit for trial work period months prior to the \n     conviction (but within the same period of disability). As a \n     result, in such cases the total dollar loss to the government \n     that is calculated will be greater and more likely to meet \n     the United States Attorneys' thresholds for prosecution.\n\n   TITLE III--ATTORNEY REPRESENTATIVE FEE PAYMENT SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS\n\n\n        Section 301. Cap on Attorney Representative Assessments\n\n                              Present law\n\n       The Social Security Act allows the fees of claimant \n     representatives who are attorneys to be paid by the SSA \n     directly to the attorney out of the claimant's past-due \n     benefits for Title II claims. The SSA, by law, is permitted \n     to charge an assessment at a rate not to exceed 6.3% of \n     approved attorney fees, for the costs of determining, \n     processing, withholding and distributing attorney \n     representative fees for Title II claims.\n\n                        Explanation of provision\n\n       The new provision imposes a cap of $75 on the 6.3% \n     assessment on approved attorney representative fees for Title \n     II claims, and this cap is indexed for inflation. This \n     provision is effective 180 days after the date of enactment.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       Testimony was given at a House oversight hearing in May \n     2001 on Social Security's processing of attorney \n     representative's fees that the amount of the fee assessment \n     is unfair to these attorneys, who provide an important \n     service to claimants. The attorneys who receive fee payments \n     from the agency have their gross revenue reduced by 6.3%, \n     which is about a 20% reduction in the net revenue for most \n     attorneys. As a result of this revenue loss and the time it \n     takes for the SSA to issue the fee payments to attorneys, a \n     number of attorneys have decided to take fewer or none of \n     these cases. The cap on the amount of the assessment would \n     help ensure that enough attorneys remain available to \n     represent claimants before the Social Security \n     Administration.\n       The Committees continue to be concerned about the agency's \n     processing time for attorney representative fee payments and \n     expect the SSA to further automate the payment process as \n     soon as possible.\n       The Committee on Ways and Means of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate \n     will request the General Accounting Office to conduct a study \n     of claimant representation in the Social Security and \n     Supplemental Security Income programs. The study will include \n     an evaluation of the potential advantages and disadvantages \n     of extending the fee withholding process to non-attorney \n     representatives.\n\n[[Page S11348]]\n\n            TITLE IV: MISCELLANEOUS AND TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS\n\n    Subtitle A: Amendments Relating to the Ticket to Work and Work \n                   Incentives Improvement Act of 1999\n\n\nSection 401. Application of Demonstration Authority Sunset Date to New \n                                Projects\n\n                              Present law\n\n       Section 234 of the Social Security Act provides the \n     Commissioner with general authority to conduct demonstration \n     projects for the disability insurance program. These projects \n     can test: (1) alternative methods of treating work activity \n     of individuals entitled to disability benefits; (2) the \n     alteration of other limitations and conditions that apply to \n     such individuals (such as an increase in the length of the \n     trial work period); and (3) implementation of sliding scale \n     benefit offsets. To conduct the projects, the Commissioner \n     may waive compliance with the benefit requirements of Title \n     II and Section 1148, and the HHS Secretary may waive the \n     benefit requirements of Title XVIII. The Commissioner's \n     authority to conduct demonstration projects terminates on \n     December 17, 2004, five years after its enactment in the \n     ``Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of \n     1999''(P.L. 106-170, ``Ticket to Work Act'').\n\n                        Explanation of provision\n\n       The new provision clarifies that the Commissioner is \n     authorized to conduct demonstration projects that extend \n     beyond December 17, 2004, if such projects are initiated on \n     or before that date (i.e., initiated within the five-year \n     window after enactment of the Ticket to Work Act). This \n     provision is effective upon enactment.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       The current five-year limitation on waiver authority \n     restricts the options that may be tested to improve work \n     incentives and return to work initiatives, as several \n     potential options the Commissioner may test would extend past \n     the current five-year limit. As developing a well-designed \n     demonstration project can require several years, the current \n     five-year authority may in some cases not allow sufficient \n     time to both design the project and to conduct it long enough \n     to obtain reliable data.\n\n\nSection 402. Expansion of Waiver Authority Available in Connection with \nDemonstration Projects Providing for Reductions in Disability Insurance \n                       Benefits Based on Earnings\n\n                              Present law\n\n       Section 234 of the Social Security Act provides the \n     Commissioner with general authority to conduct demonstration \n     projects for the disability insurance program. In addition, \n     the Ticket to Work Act specifically directs the Commissioner \n     to conduct demonstration projects for the purpose of \n     evaluating a program for Title II disability beneficiaries \n     under which benefits are reduced by $1 for each $2 of the \n     beneficiary's earnings above a level determined by the \n     Commissioner. To permit a thorough evaluation of alternative \n     methods, section 302 of the Ticket to Work Act allows the \n     Commissioner to waive compliance with the benefit provisions \n     of Title II and allows the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services to waive compliance with the benefit requirements of \n     Title XVIII.\n\n                        Explanation of provision\n\n       The new provision allows the Commissioner to also waive \n     requirements in Section 1148 of the Social Security Act, \n     which governs the Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Program \n     (Ticket to Work Program), as they relate to Title II. This \n     provision is effective upon enactment.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       This additional waiver authority is needed to allow the \n     Commissioner to effectively test the $1-for-$2 benefit offset \n     in combination with return to work services under the Ticket \n     to Work Program. Under the $1-for-$2 benefit offset, earnings \n     of many beneficiaries may not be sufficient to completely \n     eliminate benefits. However, under section 1148 of the Social \n     Security Act, benefits must be completely eliminated before \n     employment networks participating in the Ticket to Work \n     Program are eligible to receive outcome payments. Therefore, \n     employment networks are likely to be reluctant to accept \n     tickets from beneficiaries participating in the $1-for-$2 \n     benefit offset demonstration, making it impossible for SSA to \n     effectively test the combination of the benefit offset and \n     these return to work services. Additionally, section 1148 \n     waiver authority was provided for the broad Title II \n     disability demonstration authority under section 234 of the \n     Social Security Act, but not for this mandated project.\n\n\nSection 403. Funding of Demonstration Projects Providing for Reductions \n           in Disability Insurance Benefits Based on Earnings\n\n                              Present law\n\n       The Ticket to Work Act provides that the benefits and \n     administrative expenses of conducting the $1-for-$2 \n     demonstration projects will be paid out of the Old-Age, \n     Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) and Federal \n     Hospital Insurance and Federal Supplementary Medical \n     Insurance (HI/SMI) trust funds, to the extent provided in \n     advance in appropriations acts.\n\n                        Explanation of provision\n\n       The new provision establishes that administrative expenses \n     for the $1-for-$2 demonstration project will be paid out of \n     otherwise available annually-appropriated funds, and that \n     benefits associated with the demonstration project will be \n     paid from the OASDI or HI/SMI trust funds. This provision is \n     effective upon enactment.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       For demonstration projects conducted under the broader \n     Title II demonstration project authority under section 234 of \n     the Social Security Act, administrative costs are paid out of \n     otherwise available annually-appropriated funds, and benefits \n     associated with the demonstration projects are paid from the \n     OASDI or HI/SMI trust funds. This provision would make \n     funding sources for the $1 for $2 demonstration project under \n     the Ticket to Work Act consistent with funding sources for \n     other Title II demonstration projects.\n\n\nSection 404. Availability of Federal and State Work Incentive Services \n                       to Additional Individuals\n\n                              Present law\n\n       Section 1149 of the Social Security Act (the Act), as added \n     by the Ticket to Work Act, directs SSA to establish a \n     community-based work incentives planning and assistance \n     program to provide benefits planning and assistance to \n     disabled beneficiaries. To establish this program, SSA is \n     required to award cooperative agreements (or grants or \n     contracts) to State or private entities. In fulfillment of \n     this requirement, SSA has established the Benefits Planning, \n     Assistance, and Outreach (BPAO) program. BPAO projects now \n     exist in every state.\n       Section 1150 of the Act authorizes SSA to award grants to \n     State protection and advocacy (P) systems so that they can \n     provide protection and advocacy services to disabled \n     beneficiaries. Under this section, services provided by \n     participating P systems may include: (1) information and \n     advice about obtaining vocational rehabilitation (VR) and \n     employment services; and (2) advocacy or other services that \n     a disabled beneficiary may need to secure or regain \n     employment. SSA has established the Protection and Advocacy \n     to Beneficiaries of Social Security (PABSS) Program pursuant \n     to this authorization.\n       To be eligible for services under either the BPAO or PABSS \n     programs, an individual must be a ``disabled beneficiary'' as \n     defined under section 1148(k) of the Act. Section 1148(k) \n     defines a disabled beneficiary as an individual entitled to \n     Title II benefits based on disability or an individual who is \n     eligible for federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) cash \n     benefits under Title XVI based on disability or blindness.\n\n                        Explanation of provision\n\n       The new provision expands eligibility for the BPAO and \n     PABSS programs under section 1149 and 1150 of the Act to \n     include not just individuals who are ``disabled \n     beneficiaries'' under section 1148(k) of the Act, but also \n     individuals who (1) are no longer eligible for SSI benefits \n     because of an increase in earnings, but remain eligible for \n     Medicaid; (2) receive only a State Supplementary payment (a \n     payment that some States provide as a supplement to the \n     federal SSI benefit); or (3) are in an extended period of \n     Medicare eligibility under Title XVIII after a period of \n     Title II disability has ended. The new provision also expands \n     the types of services a P system may provide under section \n     1150 of the Act. Currently P systems may provide ``advocacy \n     or other services that a disabled beneficiary may need to \n     secure or regain employment,'' while the new provision allows \n     them to provide ``advocacy or other services that a disabled \n     beneficiary may need to secure, maintain, or regain \n     employment.''\n       The amendment to section 1149, which affects the BPAO \n     program, is effective with respect to grants, cooperative \n     agreements or contracts entered into on or after the date of \n     enactment. The amendments to section 1150, which affect the \n     PABSS program, are effective for payments provided after the \n     date of the enactment.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       The Committees recognize that Social Security and SSI \n     beneficiaries with disabilities face a variety of barriers \n     and disincentives to becoming employed and staying in their \n     jobs. The intent of this provision, as with the Ticket to \n     Work Act, is to encourage disabled individuals to work.\n       The definition of ``disabled beneficiary'' under \n     section1148(k) of the Act does not include several groups of \n     beneficiaries, including individuals who are no longer \n     eligible for SSI benefits because of an earnings increase but \n     remain eligible for Medicaid; individuals receiving only a \n     State Supplementary payment; and individuals who are in an \n     extended period of Medicare eligibility. The Committees \n     believe that BPAO and PABSS services should be available to \n     all of these disabled beneficiaries regardless of Title II or \n     SSI payment status. Beneficiaries may have progressed beyond \n     eligibility for federal cash benefits but still be in need of \n     information about the effects of work on their benefits, or \n     in need of advocacy or other services to help them maintain \n     or regain employment. Extending eligibility for the BPAO and \n     PABSS programs to beneficiaries who are receiving State \n     Supplemental payments or are still eligible for Medicare or \n     Medicaid, but who are no longer eligible for federal cash \n     benefits, will help to prevent these beneficiaries from \n     returning to the federal cash benefit rolls and help them to \n     reach their optimum level of employment.\n       The Committees also intend that PABSS services be available \n     to provide assistance to\n\n[[Page S11349]]\n\n     beneficiaries who have successfully obtained employment but \n     who continue to encounter job-related difficulties. \n     Therefore, the new provision extends the current PABSS \n     assistance (which is available for securing and regaining \n     employment) to maintaining employment--thus providing a \n     continuity of services for disabled individuals throughout \n     the process of initially securing employment, the course of \n     their being employed and, if needed, their efforts to regain \n     employment. This provision would ensure that disabled \n     individuals would not face a situation in which they would \n     have to wait until they lost their employment in order to \n     once again be eligible to receive PABBS services. Payments \n     for services to maintain employment would be subject to \n     Section 1150(c) of the Social Security Act. The Committees \n     will continue to monitor the implementation of PABSS programs \n     to ensure that assistance is directed to all areas in which \n     beneficiaries face obstacles in securing, maintaining, or \n     regaining work.\n\n\n   Section 405. Technical Amendment Clarifying Treatment for Certain \n  Purposes of Individual Work Plans Under the Ticket to Work and Self-\n                          Sufficiency Program\n\n                              Present law\n\n       Under section 52 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), \n     employers may claim a Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) if \n     they hire, among other individuals, individuals with \n     disabilities who have been referred by a State vocational \n     rehabilitation (VR) agency. For an individual to qualify as a \n     vocational rehabilitation referral under section 51(d)(6)(B) \n     of the IRC, the individual must be receiving or have \n     completed vocational rehabilitation services pursuant to: (i) \n     ``an individualized written plan for employment under a State \n     plan for vocational rehabilitation services approved under \n     the Rehabilitation Act of 1973;'' or (ii) ``a program of \n     vocational rehabilitation carried out under chapter 31 of \n     title 38, United States Code.'' (IRC, section 51(d)(6)(B).\n       The WOTC is equal to 40% of the first $6,000 of wages paid \n     to newly hired employees during their first year of \n     employment when the employee is retained for at least 400 \n     work hours. As such, the maximum credit per employee is \n     $2,400, but the credit may be less depending on the \n     employer's tax bracket. A lesser credit rate of 25% is \n     provided to employers when the employee remains on the job \n     for 120-399 hours. The amount of the credit reduces the \n     company's deduction for the employee's wages.\n       The Ticket to Work Act established the Ticket to Work and \n     Self-Sufficiency Program (Ticket to Work Program) under \n     section 1148 of the Social Security Act. Under this program, \n     SSA provides a ``ticket'' to eligible Social Security \n     Disability Insurance beneficiaries and Supplemental Security \n     Income beneficiaries with disabilities that allows them to \n     obtain employment and other support services from an approved \n     ``employment network'' of their choice. Employment networks \n     may include State, local, or private entities that can \n     provide directly, or arrange for other organizations or \n     entities to provide, employment services, VR services, or \n     other support services. State VR agencies have the option of \n     participating in the Ticket to Work Program as employment \n     networks. Employment networks must work with each beneficiary \n     they serve to develop an individual work plan (IWP) for that \n     beneficiary that outlines his or her vocational goals, and \n     the services needed to achieve those goals. For VR agencies \n     that participate in the Ticket to Work Program, the \n     individualized written plan for employment (as specified \n     under (i) in paragraph one above) serves in lieu of the IWP.\n       Under current law, an employer hiring a disabled individual \n     referred by an employment network does not qualify for the \n     WOTC unless the employment network is a State VR agency.\n\n                        Explanation of provision\n\n       The new provision allows employers who hire disabled \n     workers through referrals by employment networks under \n     section 1148 of the Social Security Act to qualify for the \n     WOTC. Specifically, it provides that, for purposes of section \n     51(d)(6)(B)(i) of the IRC of 1986, an IWP under section 1148 \n     of the Social Security Act shall be treated as an \n     individualized written plan for employment under a State plan \n     for vocational rehabilitation services approved under the \n     Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\n       This provision is effective as if it were included in \n     section 505 of the Ticket to Work Act.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       The Ticket to Work Program was designed to increase choice \n     available to beneficiaries when they select providers of \n     employment services. Employers hiring individuals with \n     disabilities should be able to qualify for the WOTC \n     regardless of whether the employment referral is made by a \n     public or private service provider. This amendment updates \n     eligibility criteria for the WOTC to conform to the expansion \n     of employment services and the increase in number and range \n     of VR providers as a result of the enactment of the Ticket to \n     Work Act.\n\n                  Subtitle B. Miscellaneous Amendments\n\n\n  Section 411. Elimination of Transcript Requirement in Remand Cases \n                    Fully Favorable to the Claimant\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       The Social Security Act requires SSA to file a hearing \n     transcript with the District Court for any SSA hearing that \n     follows a court remand of an SSA decision.\n\n                        Explanation of provision\n\n       The new provision clarifies that SSA is not required to \n     file a transcript with the court when SSA, on remand, issues \n     a decision fully favorable to the claimant. This provision is \n     effective upon enactment.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       A claimant whose benefits have been denied is provided a \n     transcript of a hearing to be used when the claimant appeals \n     his case in Federal District court. If the Administrative Law \n     Judge issues a fully favorable decision, then transcribing \n     the hearing is unnecessary since the claimant would not \n     appeal this decision.\n\n\nSection 412. Nonpayment of Benefits Upon Removal From the United States\n\n                              Present law\n\n       In most cases, the Social Security Act prohibits the \n     payment of Social Security benefits to non-citizens who are \n     deported from the United States. However, the Act does not \n     prohibit the payment of Social Security benefits to non-\n     citizens who are deported for smuggling other non-citizens \n     into the United States.\n\n                        Explanation of provision\n\n       The new provision requires SSA to suspend benefits of \n     beneficiaries who are removed from the United States for \n     smuggling aliens. This provision applies to individuals for \n     whom the Commissioner receives a removal notice from the \n     Attorney General after the date of enactment.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       Individuals who are removed from the United States for \n     smuggling aliens have committed an act that should prohibit \n     them from receiving Social Security benefits.\n\n\n      Section 413. Reinstatement of Certain Reporting Requirements\n\n                              Present law\n\n       The Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 \n     ``sunsetted'' most annual or periodic reports from agencies \n     to Congress that were listed in a 1993 House inventory of \n     congressional reports.\n\n                        Explanation of provision\n\n       The new provision reinstates the requirements for several \n     periodic reports to Congress that were subject to the 1995 \n     ``sunset'' Act, including annual reports on the financial \n     solvency of the Social Security and Medicare programs (the \n     Board of Trustees' reports on the OASDI, HI, and SMI trust \n     funds) and annual reports on certain aspects of the \n     administration of the Title II disability program (the SSA \n     Commissioner's reports on pre-effectuation reviews of \n     disability determinations and continuing disability reviews). \n     The provision is effective upon enactment.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       The reports to be reinstated provide Congress with \n     important information needed to evaluate and oversee the \n     Social Security and Medicare programs.\n\n\n Section 414. Clarification of Definitions Regarding Certain Survivor \n                                Benefits\n\n                              Present law\n\n       Under the definitions of ``widow'' and ``widower'' in \n     Section 216 of the Social Security Act, a widow or widower \n     must have been married to the deceased spouse for at least \n     nine months before his or her death in order to be eligible \n     for survivor benefits.\n\n                        Explanation of provision\n\n       The new provision creates an exception to the nine-month \n     requirement for cases in which the Commissioner finds that \n     the claimant and the deceased spouse would have been married \n     for longer than nine months but for the fact that the \n     deceased spouse was legally prohibited from divorcing a prior \n     spouse who was in a mental institution. The provision is \n     effective for benefit applications filed after the date of \n     enactment.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       This provision allows the Commissioner to issue benefits in \n     certain unusual cases in which the duration of marriage \n     requirement could not be met due to a legal impediment over \n     which the individual had no control and the individual would \n     have met the legal requirements were it not for the legal \n     impediment.\n\n\nSection 415. Clarification Respecting the FICA and SECA Tax Exemptions \n     for an Individual Whose Earnings are Subject to the Laws of a \n                     Totalization Agreement Partner\n\n                              Present law\n\n       In cases where there is an agreement with a foreign country \n     (i.e., a totalization agreement), a worker's earnings are \n     exempt from United States Social Security payroll taxes when \n     those earnings are subject to the foreign country's \n     retirement system.\n\n                        Explanation of provision\n\n       The new provision clarifies the legal authority to exempt a \n     worker's earnings from United States Social Security tax in \n     cases where the earnings were subject to a foreign country's \n     retirement system in accordance with a U.S. totalization \n     agreement, but the foreign country's law does not require \n     compulsory contributions on those earnings. The provision \n     establishes that such earnings are exempt from United States \n     Social Security tax whether or not the worker elected to make \n     contributions to the foreign country's retirement system.\n\n[[Page S11350]]\n\n       The provision is effective upon enactment.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       In U.S. totalization agreements, a person's work is \n     generally subject to the Social Security laws of the country \n     in which the work is performed. In most cases the worker, \n     whether subject to the laws of the United States or the other \n     country, is compulsorily covered and required to pay \n     contributions in accordance with the laws of that country. In \n     some instances, however, work that would be compulsorily \n     covered in the U.S. is excluded from compulsory coverage in \n     the other country (such as Germany). In such cases, the IRS \n     has questioned the exemption from U.S. Social Security tax \n     for workers who elect not to make contributions to the \n     foreign country's retirement system. This provision would \n     remove any question regarding the exemption and would be \n     consistent with the general philosophy behind the coverage \n     rules of totalization agreements.\n\n\n   Section 416. Coverage Under Divided Retirement System for Public \n                         Employees in Kentucky\n\n                              Present law\n\n       Under Section 218 of the Social Security Act, a State may \n     choose whether or not its State and local government \n     employees who are covered by an employer-sponsored pension \n     plan may also participate in the Social Security Old-Age, \n     Survivors, and Disability Insurance program. (In this \n     context, the term ``employer-sponsored pension plan'' refers \n     to a pension, annuity, retirement, or similar fund or system \n     established by a State or a political subdivision of a State \n     such as a town. Under current law, State or local government \n     employees not covered by an employer-sponsored pension plan \n     already are, with a few exceptions, mandatorily covered by \n     Social Security.)\n       Social Security coverage for employees covered under a \n     State or local government employer-sponsored pension plan is \n     established through an agreement between the State and the \n     federal government. In most States, before the agreement can \n     be made, employees who are members of the employer-sponsored \n     pension plan must agree to Social Security coverage by \n     majority vote in referendum. If the majority vote is in favor \n     of Social Security coverage, then the entire group, including \n     those voting against such coverage, will be covered by Social \n     Security. If the majority vote is against Social Security \n     coverage, then the entire group, including those voting in \n     favor of such coverage and employees hired after the \n     referendum, will not be covered by Social Security.\n       In certain States, however, if employees who already are \n     covered in an employer-sponsored pension plan are not in \n     agreement about whether to participate in the Social Security \n     system, coverage can be extended only to those who choose it, \n     provided that all newly hired employees of the system are \n     mandatorily covered under Social Security. To establish such \n     a divided retirement system, the state must conduct a \n     referendum among members of the employer-sponsored pension \n     plan. After the referendum, the retirement system is divided \n     into two groups, one composed of members who elected Social \n     Security coverage and those hired after the referendum, and \n     the other composed of the remaining members of the employer-\n     sponsored pension plan. Under Section 218(d)(6)(c) of the \n     Social Security Act, 21 states currently have authority to \n     operate a divided retirement system.\n\n                        Explanation of provision\n\n       The new provision permits the state of Kentucky to join the \n     21 other states in being able to offer a divided retirement \n     system. This system would permit current state and local \n     government workers in an employer-sponsored pension plan to \n     elect Social Security coverage on an individual basis. Those \n     who do not wish to be covered by Social Security would \n     continue to participate exclusively in the employer-sponsored \n     pension plan.\n       The governments of the City of Louisville and Jefferson \n     County will be merged in January 2003 and a new retirement \n     system will be formed. Under the new provision, each employee \n     under the new system could choose whether or not to \n     participate in the Social Security system in addition to \n     their employer-sponsored pension plan. As under current law, \n     all employees newly hired to the system after the divided \n     system is in place would be covered automatically under \n     Social Security.\n       This provision is effective on January 1, 2003.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       The governments of the City of Louisville and Jefferson \n     County, Kentucky will merge in January, 2003. Currently, some \n     officers and firefighters in employer-sponsored pension plans \n     provided by these governments are covered by Social Security, \n     while others are not. In order to provide fair and equitable \n     coverage to all officers and firefighters, a divided \n     retirement system, such as that currently authorized in 21 \n     other states, was seen as the best solution. Otherwise, upon \n     creation of the new retirement system, a referendum would be \n     held to determine by majority vote whether or not the group \n     would participate in Social Security. As the number of non-\n     covered employees will exceed the number of Social Security-\n     covered employees under the new retirement system, in the \n     absence of this new provision, those employees covered by \n     Social Security could lose that coverage. The Kentucky \n     General Assembly has adopted a bill that will allow the new \n     divided retirement system to go forward following enactment \n     of this provision.\n\n\n    Section 417. Compensation for the Social Security Advisory Board\n\n                              Present law\n\n       The Social Security Advisory Board is an independent, \n     bipartisan Board established by the Congress under section \n     703 of the Social Security Act. The 7-member Board is \n     appointed by the President and the Congress to advise the \n     President, the Congress and the Commissioner of Social \n     Security on matters related to the Social Security and \n     Supplemental Security Income programs. Section 703(f) of the \n     Social Security Act provides that members of the Board serve \n     without compensation, except that, while engaged in Board \n     business away from their homes or regular places of business, \n     members may be allowed travel expenses, including per diem in \n     lieu of subsistence, as authorized by section 5703 of title \n     5, United States Code for persons in the Government who are \n     employed intermittently.\n\n                        Explanation of provision\n\n       The new provision establishes that compensation for Social \n     Security Advisory Board members will be provided, at the \n     daily rate of basic pay for level IV of the Executive \n     Schedule, for each day (including travel time) during which \n     the member is engaged in performing a function of the Board. \n     This provision is effective on January 1, 2002.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       Other government advisory boards--such as the Employee \n     Retirement Income Security Act Advisory Council, the Pension \n     Benefit Guaranty Corporation Advisory Committee and the \n     Thrift Savings Plan Board--provide compensation for their \n     members. This provision allows for similar treatment of \n     Social Security Advisory Board members with respect to \n     compensation.\n\n\nSection 418. 60-Month Period of Employment Requirement for Application \n                 of Government Pension Offset Exemption\n\n                              Present law\n\n       The Government Pension Offset (GPO) was enacted in order to \n     equalize treatment of workers in jobs not covered by Social \n     Security and workers in jobs covered by Social Security, with \n     respect to spousal and survivors benefits. The GPO reduces \n     the Social Security spousal or survivors benefit by two-\n     thirds of the government pension.\n       However, under what's known as the ``last day rule,'' State \n     and local government workers are exempt from the GPO if their \n     job on their last day of employment was covered by Social \n     Security. In contrast, Federal workers who switched from the \n     Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS), a system that is not \n     covered by Social Security, to the Federal Employee \n     Retirement System (FERS), a system that is covered by Social \n     Security, must work for 5 years under FERS in order to be \n     exempt from the GPO.\n\n                        Explanation of provision\n\n       The new provision requires that State and local government \n     workers be covered by Social Security during their last 5 \n     years of employment in order to be exempt from the GPO. The \n     provision is effective for applications filed after the month \n     of enactment. However, the provision would not apply to \n     individuals whose last day of employment for the State or \n     local governmental entity was covered by Social Security and \n     occurs on or before June 30, 2003, provided that such period \n     of covered employment began on or before December 31, 2002.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       The change will establish uniform application of the GPO \n     exemption for all local, State, and federal government \n     workers.\n\n                    Subtitle C. Technical Amendments\n\n\n Section 421. Technical Correction Relating to Responsible Agency Head\n\n                              Present law\n\n       Section 1143 of the Social Security Act directs ``the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services'' to send periodic \n     Social Security Statements to individuals.\n\n                        Explanation of provision\n\n       The new provision makes a technical correction to this \n     section by inserting a reference to the Commissioner of \n     Social Security in place of the reference to the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services. This provision is effective upon \n     enactment.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       The ``Social Security Independence and Program Improvements \n     Act of 1994'' (P.L. 103-296) made the Social Security \n     Administration an independent agency separate from the \n     Department of Health and Human Services. This provision \n     updates Section 1143 to reflect that change.\n\n\n Section 422. Technical Correction Relating to Retirement Benefits of \n                               Ministers\n\n                              Present law\n\n       Section 1456 of the ``Small Business Job Protection Act of \n     1996'' (P.L. 104-188) established that certain retirement \n     benefits received by ministers and members of religious \n     orders (such as the rental value of a parsonage or parsonage \n     allowance) are not subject to Social Security payroll taxes \n     under the Internal Revenue Code. However, under Section 211 \n     of the Social Security Act, these retirement benefits are \n     treated as net earnings from self-employment for the purpose \n     of acquiring insured status and calculating Social Security \n     benefit amounts.\n\n[[Page S11351]]\n\n                        Explanation of provision\n\n       The new provision makes a conforming change to exclude \n     these benefits received by retired clergy from Social \n     Security-covered earnings for the purpose of acquiring \n     insured status and calculating Social Security benefit \n     amounts. This provision is effective for years beginning \n     before, on, or after December 31, 1994. This effective date \n     is the same as the effective date of Section 1456 of P.L. \n     104-188.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       P.L. 104-188 provided that certain retirement benefits \n     received by ministers and members of religious orders are not \n     subject to payroll taxes. However, a conforming change was \n     not made to the Social Security Act to exclude these benefits \n     from being counted as wages for the purpose of acquiring \n     insured status and calculating Social Security benefit \n     amounts. This income is therefore not treated in a uniform \n     manner. This provision would conform the Social Security Act \n     to the Internal Revenue Code with respect to such income.\n\n\n   Section 423. Technical Correction Relating to Domestic Employment\n\n                              Present law\n\n       Present law is ambiguous concerning the Social Security \n     coverage and tax treatment of domestic service performed on a \n     farm. Domestic employment on a farm appears to be subject to \n     two separate coverage thresholds (one for agricultural labor \n     and another for domestic employees).\n\n                        Explanation of provision\n\n       The new provision clarifies that domestic service on a farm \n     is treated as domestic employment, rather than agricultural \n     labor, for Social Security coverage and tax purposes. This \n     provision is effective upon enactment.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       Prior to 1994, domestic service on a farm was treated as \n     agricultural labor and was subject to the coverage threshold \n     for agricultural labor. According to SSA, in 1994, when \n     Congress amended the law with respect to domestic employment, \n     the intent was that domestic employment on a farm would be \n     subject to the coverage threshold for domestic employees \n     instead of the threshold for agricultural labor. However, the \n     current language is unclear, making it appear as if farm \n     domestics are subject to both thresholds.\n\n\n        Section 424. Technical Correction of Outdated References\n\n                              Present law\n\n       Section 202(n) and 211(a)(15) of the Social Security Act \n     and Section 3102(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 each \n     contain outdated references that relate to the Social \n     Security program.\n\n                        Explanation of provision\n\n       The new provision corrects outdated references in the \n     Social Security Act and the Internal Revenue Code by: (1) in \n     Section 202(n) of the Social Security Act, updating \n     references respecting removal from the United States; (2) in \n     Section 211(a)(15) of the Social Security Act, correcting a \n     citation respecting a tax deduction related to health \n     insurance costs of self-employed individuals; and (3) in \n     Section 3102(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, \n     eliminating a reference to an obsolete 20-day agricultural \n     work test. This provision is effective upon enactment.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       Over the years, provisions in the Social Security Act, the \n     Internal Revenue Code and other related laws have been \n     deleted, re-designated or amended. However, necessary \n     conforming changes have not always been made. Consequently, \n     Social Security law contains some outdated references.\n\n\nSection 425. Technical Correction Respecting Self-Employment Income in \n                       Community Property States\n\n                              Present law\n\n       The Social Security Act and the Internal Revenue Code \n     provide that, in the absence of a partnership, all self-\n     employment income from a trade or business operated by a \n     married person in a community property State is deemed to be \n     the husband's unless the wife exercises substantially all of \n     the management and control of the trade or business.\n\n                        Explanation of provision\n\n       Under the new provision, self-employment income from a \n     trade or business that is not a partnership, and that is \n     operated by a married person in a community property State, \n     is taxed and credited to the spouse who is carrying on the \n     trade or business. If the trade or business is jointly \n     operated, the self-employment income is taxed and credited to \n     each spouse based on their distributive share of gross \n     earnings. This provision is effective upon enactment.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       Present law was found to be unconstitutional in several \n     court cases in 1980. Since then, income from a trade or \n     business that is not a partnership in a community property \n     State has been treated the same as income from a trade or \n     business that is not a partnership in a non-community \n     property State--it is taxed and credited to the spouse who is \n     found to be carrying on the business.\n       This change will conform the provisions in the Social \n     Security Act and the Internal Revenue Code to current \n     practice in both community property and non-community \n     property States.\n\n\n     Section 426. Technical Changes to the Railroad Retirement and \n                   Survivors' Improvement Act of 2001\n\n                              Present law\n\n       See Public Law 107-90.\n\n                       Explanation of provisions\n\n     Quorum rules\n       This technical change clarifies that, under Section 105 of \n     the Act, a vacancy on the Board of National Railroad \n     Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT) does not preclude the \n     Board from making changes in the Investment Guidelines with \n     the unanimous vote of all remaining Trustees.\n     Transfers\n       This technical change clarifies that under Section 107 of \n     the Act, the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) can require the \n     NRRIT to transfer amounts necessary to pay benefits to the \n     Railroad Retirement Account (RRA) and that excess Social \n     Security Equivalent Benefits (SSEB) Account assets can be \n     transferred to the RRA for investment in federal securities \n     until used to pay benefits.\n     Investment authority\n       This technical change clarifies that, under Section 105 of \n     the Act, the Board of the NRRIT has the authority to invest \n     the assets with the assistance of its own professional staff \n     or by retaining outside advisors and managers.\n\n                            Clerical changes\n\n       This provision makes a number of grammatical and \n     typographical corrections to the Act.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       All four changes are purely technical in nature and are \n     needed to promote the efficient implementation of the \n     Railroad Retirement and Survivors' Improvement Act of 2001.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                            Social Security\n\n\n                               memorandum\n\n     Date: November 18, 2002\n     To: Stephen C. Goss, Chief Actuary\n     From: Chris Chaplain, Actuary, Alice H. Wade, Deputy Chief \n         Actuary\n     Subject: Estimated Long-Range OASDI Financial Effects of the \n         Social Security Program Protection Act of 2002, as \n         Amended by the Senate Finance Committee--Information.\n       This memorandum provides long-range estimates of the \n     financial effect on the Social Security (OASDI) program for \n     enactment of the Social Security Program Protection Act of \n     2002 (H.R. 4070), as passed by the House on June 26, 2002 and \n     amended by the Senate Finance Committee. This legislation \n     contains 35 provisions, including the following:\n       Provide additional safeguards for Social Security \n     beneficiaries with representative payees, such as requiring \n     periodic onsite reviews, holding payees liable or assessing \n     penalties for misused benefits.\n       Grant the authority to assess civil monetary penalties for \n     corrupt or forcible interference with the administration of \n     the Social Security Act, and wrongful conversion by \n     representative payees.\n       Deny title II benefits to fugitive felons, persons fleeing \n     prosecution, and probation or parole violators.\n       Limit the amount of attorney fee assessments to the lower \n     of 6.3% of the fee or $75. The $75 threshold would be indexed \n     annually by cumulative changes in the Social Security cost-\n     of-living adjustment (COLA), but future threshold amounts \n     would be rounded to the next lower multiple of $10. However, \n     the threshold amount would never go below $75.\n       Make several amendments to demonstration projects under the \n     Ticket to Work Act.\n       Extend the right to have a divided retirement system for \n     public employees in the state of Kentucky.\n       Replace the ``last day'' requirement for exemption from the \n     Government Pension Offset with a ``last 5 years'' \n     requirement--that is, the beneficiary would have to work in a \n     position covered by Social Security and by the government \n     pension plan for the last 5 years of such employment, rather \n     than the last day.\n       Make miscellaneous technical amendments.\n       The estimated long-range OASDI financial effect of each \n     provision of the legislation is either no change or a change \n     in the actuarial balance that is negligible (less than 0.0005 \n     percent of taxable payroll). Taken as a whole, the \n     legislation would result in an increase in the OASDI \n     actuarial balance that is estimated to be negligible. In \n     addition, enactment of this legislation would change neither \n     the first year that annual costs are expected to exceed tax \n     income (2017) nor the year that the combined OASI and DI \n     Trust Funds are expected to become exhausted (2041). The \n     provisions in the legislation are generally effective with \n     the date of enactment of the legislation, which we assume to \n     be January 1, 2003. All estimates included in this memorandum \n     are based on the intermediate assumptions of the 2002 \n     Trustees Report.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, in his absence, I want to share some \nthoughts I have about Judge Dennis Shedd, who has been nominated for \nthe Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Shedd is a superb nominee. \nHe served 12 years on the Federal bench as a Federal district trial \njudge, hearing some 5,000 cases. He was rated by the American Bar \nAssociation, which goes around and interviews fellow judges, State \ncourt judges, and lawyers on both sides of cases. They get their \nopinions about how the judge has performed and they issue an \nindependent rating.\n  We conservatives have sometimes complained about their ratings, \nsaying they tend to be more favorable to more liberal-type judges. But \nin this case, they rated Judge Shedd the highest possible rating, well-\nqualified. They have about a 15-member committee that actually votes on \nall the paperwork that has been put together, and the ABA investigation \nis quite a deal.\n  Frankly, I believe it is very valuable to this process. I always \nhave. I was talking recently to Senator-elect Lindsey Graham from South \nCarolina, who will be replacing Senator Thurmond. We were talking about \nDennis Shedd. Lindsey has been a practicing attorney for many years and \nhad been in court a lot. What he said to me was exactly the way I feel \nabout these things. He said: You know, when a person has been on the \nbench 12 years, everybody knows whether they are any good or not. In a \nState like South Carolina, there are not that many Federal judges. \nLawyers go into their courts all the time. The fact is, after a few \nyears, everybody knows whether they are any good or not. These lawyers \nsupport Judge Shedd. The American Bar Association has supported Judge \nShedd.\n  I have looked at some of the complaints that have been made about his \nrecord. I find them not only wrong, but in fact he should have been \ncommended for the rulings he has made. I would like to share a few \nthoughts on that.\n  One is that he has served the Judicial Conference of the United \nStates during his tenure, 12 years as a Federal judge, serving on the \nJudicial Branch Committee and the Subcommittee on Judicial \nIndependence. It is a mark of respect for a trial judge in the United \nStates to be chosen to serve on key committees of the Judicial \nConference. Most judges are not on these committees.\n  From 1978 through 1988, he served on the Senate Judiciary Committee \nstaff in this body. He is known by many of the Senators. He served as \nchief counsel and staff director for the Senate Judiciary Committee for \nSenator Strom Thurmond. According to the Almanac of Federal Judiciary, \nthe attorneys rate judges and make comments about judges. You go before \na judge and want to know something about them. Lawyers have books on \nthem. This is what they say about him. They say he has outstanding \nlegal skills and excellent judicial temperament. A few comments from \nSouth Carolinians were included: ``You are not going to find a better \njudge on the bench or one who works harder.'' ``He is the best Federal \njudge we have,'' said one attorney. ``He gets an A all around,'' said \nanother. ``It is a great experience trying cases before him,'' said an \nattorney.\n  I like that. I tried a lot of cases and some cases you go to trial \nbefore a judge and it is miserable. A good judge can make the practice \nof law a pleasure.\n  ``He is bright in business,'' said another. Everyone knows that is \ntrue. Plaintiff lawyers who seem to be stirring this opposition up have \ncommended him for being evenhanded. ``He has always been fair.'' \nAnother plaintiffs lawyer says: ``I have no complaints about him. He is \nnothing if not fair.''\n  Judge Shedd will bring experience to the bench, having tried 4,000 to \n5,000 cases as a district judge. That will be more trial experience \nthan any of the other Federal judges on the Fourth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. Trial experience is the crucible for training an appellate \njudge. Some can do well without it.\n  As a practicing lawyer trying cases in Federal court full time as a \nU.S. attorney, and in private practice, as an assistant U.S. attorney, \nI understand Federal judges. I respect Federal judges. I know they \nlearn from that trial bench. That will help them better when they read \na written record to see if a judge made a mistake or not. Trial \nexperience is helpful.\n  They say this is some sort of a circuit that is too conservative. I \ndon't believe this circuit is at all that way. I note the last five \njudges appointed to the Fourth Circuit have been Democrats. Some people \nhave forgotten what President Bush did. Judge Gregory, who had been \nnominated for the circuit and who was not confirmed by this Senate \nbefore President Clinton left office was renominated. President Bush, \nin extending his hand of bipartisanship, reached out and took this \nAfrican-American jurist and renominated him to the court as an act of \nbipartisanship. Judge Gregory was a Democrat, a Clinton nominee, and \nhad not been confirmed. President Bush, shortly after he took office, \nrenominated him. Of course, he was confirmed just like that.\n  The other judges who were nominated at the same time have not moved \nso well.\n  But there are 11 cases that Judge Shedd has ruled on that have been \nreviewed by Judge Gregory. He has affirmed all 11 of them. It is unfair \nto suggest this is somehow a radical judge who is out of step. One \ncase, Crosby v. South Carolina Department of Health, has been raised, \nthat somehow he made a bad decision on that case. I don't think he did. \nBut regardless of that, people could have a different opinion. That was \none of the cases that went to Judge Gregory, President Clinton's \nnominee. Many members of the Democratic Party were most aggrieved he \nhad not been confirmed by the time President Clinton left office. Judge \nGregory agreed with Judge Shedd. He affirmed Judge Shedd's opinion.\n  That is just typical. Do 5,000 cases and somebody will find something \nwith which to disagree. But, as Lindsey Graham said: Judges have \nreputations. And to me that means a lot. And this judge, through this \ncareer and background, has a good reputation of capability, experience, \nhonesty, and a superb demeanor, making it a pleasure to practice before \nhim.\n\n  I just want to say this. I attended the hearings in which Judge Shedd \ntestified, and he was there as long as they wanted him to testify. They \nsubmitted all these questions to him, demanding that he explain \neverything he has ever done. And I heard the complaints, and I read the \ncomplaints. I am just going to tell you: They do not hold up.\n  He was criticized for doing the right thing. He didn't do wrong \nthings. He\n\n[[Page S11353]]\n\nwas written up in those reports put out by special interest advocacy \ngroups, the ones Senator Hatch calls the usual suspects, and they have \nabused him and twisted his rulings. I am going to go through a few of \nthem, and we are going to talk about them. It ought to be an \nembarrassment for any group to have submitted the smear sheets they \nsubmitted when allegation after allegation just gets knocked down.\n  But how does it work around here? Unfortunately these attack groups \nfile these sheets, and they make these allegations, and the press picks \nthem up. By the time somebody gets the case and reads it and shows it \nis not true, they don't get nearly as much attention. The allegations \nget the attention first. It is really sad. I have watched this for many \nyears. This is an absolute pattern.\n  Judge Shedd has a very low reversal rate by the court of appeals for \nthe thousands of cases he has handled. But I will tell you one thing: \nIf these advocacy groups, these usual suspects, if their smear sheets \nwere brought out in the light of day and they were graded on them, they \nwould get a big fat F. It would come back off that court of appeals \nlike a rubber ball off that wall.\n  I am amazed that someone we know, who has such a sound record, who \nhas served as a staffer in this Senate, has been put in the kind of \ngrinder he has. Not one of the allegations, once you look at them in \nthe slightest way, would serve as the basis for rejecting this superior \njudge.\n  One of the things they said--and it was repeated earlier on the floor \ntoday--was that the judge acted sua sponte to throw out cases against \nplaintiffs. Oh, this is awful, they say. Sua sponte meaning he acts on \nhis own motion, meaning without anybody having filed a motion. And this \nmeans he is anti-plaintiff.\n  Have these people never been to court? They don't know what happens? \nYou can tell one thing, I submit. They scoured his record. If they are \ndigging up this kind of stuff, they have looked at everything he has \never done. So if they found anything of real substance, we would have \nheard about it.\n  Let's look at these sua sponte rulings that are supposed to be so bad \nand represent a view that he is hostile to plaintiffs.\n  One of them is Coker v. Wal-Mart. In that case, the defendant removed \nthe case--Wal-Mart has the right, within certain rules and procedures, \nto remove the case to Federal court from State court. Judge Shedd, sua \nsponte, questioned whether the removal was appropriate as it appeared \nthe motion for removal had been filed outside the 30-day time \nlimitation established by 28 U.S.C. 1446(b). There was a time \nlimitation. If you are sued in State court and you want to remove it \nout of State court, you have a time limitation to do so. Doubting \nwhether he had the authority to remand the case sua sponte, Judge Shedd \nstated he would permit the defendant to file a brief addressing whether \nremoval was timely and whether the court had the authority to remain. \nHe had a duty to raise the issue of removal because it was \njurisdictional. Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. The \ngeneral courts of jurisdiction are our State courts. Federal courts \nhave limited jurisdiction. So a good judge, the first thing he does is \nlooks at a case that comes before him and he wants to know whether or \nnot it even ought to be in Federal court, and that is all he was \nsaying.\n\n  He is saying: I looked at the case here, counsel, and it looks like \nit is outside the 30 days. Send me a brief on why I ought not to remand \nit back to State court. You waited too long to bring it to Federal \ncourt. All he asked for was a brief on the law. So that is what Federal \njudges are supposed to do.\n  Here is another one. Gilmore v. Ford is a product liability case. \nJudge Shedd sanctioned the plaintiff for failure to prosecute the case \nby dismissing the case. He dismissed the case for failure to prosecute. \nHe evaluated that decision and tested it by each of the factors \nestablished by the Fourth Circuit in Ballard v. Carson, a 1989 case. \nIndeed, the plaintiff failed to respond to this motion to dismiss and \nfor failure to prosecute, after earlier failing to respond to the \ndefendant's motion to compel discovery.\n  You are not entitled to go to court and file lawsuits and continue \nlawsuits if you don't abide by the rules of the court. If you don't \nanswer discovery, and if the judge sends you a warning that, I am going \nto dismiss the case and we are going to have a hearing, and you fail to \nrespond--and the plaintiff doesn't even respond to that motion--the \njudge did the right thing, which was, remove the case from the court. \nThat is not something he did wrong, it is something he did right.\n  Here is another one: Lowery v. Seamless Sensations. The defendant \nraised the defense that the plaintiff failed to file a timely charge of \ndiscrimination with the EEOC--this is a defendant being sued over a \ndiscrimination charge--and he defended, saying the plaintiff did not \nfile as required by law with the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission, the Federal agency that is supposed to deal with that; and \nhe failed to file a timely lawsuit and the jurisdictional prerequisites \nto any Federal court action since that defense called into question the \ncourt's subject matter jurisdiction.\n  The court has no authority and jurisdiction over the case if the \nplaintiff hadn't filed his claim and had a hearing before the EEOC.\n  So the judge expedited consideration of those offenses as it would \nhave served no purpose to proceed to the merits of a case in which \nthere is no jurisdiction.\n  So you have to figure that out first. If the court does not have \njurisdiction, it should not consider the case.\n  To expedite consideration of the issues, he ordered the defendant to \nfile a motion to dismiss based on the defenses and that the motion be \nfiled with the judge. Ultimately, the defendant was granted summary \njudgment on the grounds that the plaintiff could not establish a prima \nfacie case. So it appears the motion to dismiss was not eventually \ngranted. But the case failed on other motions.\n  Let me just say this. I am a lawyer. I love to practice law. I \nbelieve in the rule of law. I believe in the right of people to go to \ncourt and to litigate. But there is a growing concern in this country \nabout the expense and delay and time extensions of litigation. It is \ncosting large amounts of money. Lawyers--maybe a half dozen of them--\nare charging $200 an hour fiddling around with a case. One of the good \ngovernment reforms that virtually every judge I know of who amounts to \nanything has bought into it. If the case fails on jurisdiction or has \nsome other defect, it ought to be promptly ruled on and ended. We ought \nnot to have six months of depositions and expenses when the case never \nhad a basis to go to trial, anyway.\n  So that is what Judge Shedd was doing here. He was simply carrying \nout good government and a good legal basis. If you do not meet the \nstandard for jurisdiction, you don't go to Federal court, and the \nclients don't expend thousands and thousands of dollars eaten up by \nlawyers and end up later with the case being thrown out when it should \nhave been thrown out to begin with.\n  In McCarter v. RHNB, an age and sex discrimination case, Judge Shedd \ninitially granted summary judgment--this has been complained of right \nhere on the floor today--on the grounds that the plaintiff was unable \nto provide any evidence of age and sex discrimination.\n  Following the entry of that judgment, the plaintiff filed a motion to \nalter or amend that judgment since it was based on grounds not raised, \nit was asserted, in the defendant's motion. The judge reconsidered it.\n  Judge Shedd reconsidered his order, agreed with the plaintiff, and \nreinstated the motion. He wrote:\n\n       Although the Court believes that the defendant's motion for \n     summary judgment and supporting memorandum may be fairly read \n     as raising the issue upon which the motion was granted, the \n     Court will nevertheless give the plaintiff the benefit of the \n     doubt and grant the motion to alter or to amend and deny \n     defendant's motion for summary judgment.\n\n  So he says right there that he was going to give the plaintiff the \nbenefit of the doubt and allow the case to continue.\n  That is what a good judge does. He rules. If somebody shows he has \nmade a mistake, or it is doubtful, he may reconsider his ruling.\n  That, to me, shows again good behavior, that he is thoughtful; that \nif someone raises something he didn't fully understand, he will \nreconsider his decision and go forward.\n\n[[Page S11354]]\n\n  In Shults v. Denny's Restaurant, a disabilities and slander case, \nJudge Shedd sua sponte considered summary judgment, and ordered the \nplaintiff to file a memorandum in opposition to the court's motion for \nsummary judgment.\n\n  This action by Judge Shedd was again based on jurisdictional defenses \nraised in the defendant's answer. The allegation was that the plaintiff \nhad failed to file within the 2-year statute of limitations, and he had \nfailed to exhaust administrative equal opportunity commission review \nprocedures.\n  In the order requesting the plaintiff to file a memorandum, Judge \nShedd wrote that:\n\n       . . . although the express language of Rule 56 provides \n     only for the parties to move for summary judgment, Federal \n     district judges possess the inherent power to raise sua \n     sponte an issue for possible resolution by summary judgment.\n\n  He cited appropriate authority of the United States Supreme Court in \nCelotex Corporation v. Catrett.\n  That is absolutely the law of America. If a judge spots something \nthat goes to the very nature of the jurisdiction, he can assert a \nsummary judgment motion and ask the plaintiff to respond.\n  This is really not adversarial. Some people in this country think \nthat judges decide cases on the length of their foot; that they decide \ncases on how they feel that day; or they look at the plaintiff and they \nlook at the defendant, they don't like Celotex, but they like the \nplaintiff, and so they rule for them.\n  That is not what happens in America. We have rules, and judges follow \nthe rules. They get the case to the jury, and the jury decides it, or \nthe lawyers settle.\n  I would point out that he acted within the law, and he raised those \ntwo fundamental questions. They were simple but very important. Had the \n2-year statute of limitations been violated? If it had, the case cannot \nbe brought. Had they failed to seek the EEOC review required by the \nprocedures? If so, the case could not be brought.\n  The sooner that is determined, the better off everybody is going to \nbe.\n  Simmons v. Coastal Contractors was a discrimination and retaliation-\nin-employment case in which both parties were pro se.\n  Both parties, the plaintiff and defendant, were representing \nthemselves; that is, both had fools for clients, as they say.\n  Judge Shedd sua sponte brought the parties before the court. \nTraditionally you would not do this, perhaps. But he knew he had two \nnonlawyers. He ordered the plaintiff to cure specific deficiencies in \nhis complaint or face dismissal.\n  The decision really was an attempt to aid the plaintiff in properly \ndrafting his complaint and should not be viewed as anti-plaintiff, \ngiven the pro se nature of both parties.\n  Basically he said, Plaintiff, you cannot recover. If you recover on \nthis complaint, the court of appeals will throw it out. You have to \namend your complaint and file it in the right fashion.\n  I think that is an advantage to the plaintiff. That was helping the \nplaintiff.\n  Yet, these groups--these attack organizations argue that Judge Shedd \nin his rulings show hostility to the plaintiffs before him.\n  That is one of the examples they cite.\n  Smith v. Beck was a section 1983 gender discrimination case in which \nseveral women alleged discrimination when they were not admitted \nwithout male escorts to a nightclub featuring nude female dancers.\n  Judge Shedd sua sponte questioned whether the plaintiffs' allegations \nsufficed to establish the defendant's private club's actions were under \ncolor of State law.\n  It is a complex legal question. He raised that on his own. He says if \nit is not under color of State law, this is a private club, and you \ncan't recover.\n  So the question dealt with whether or not merely operating an \nestablishment that has a liquor license does or does not transform the \nclub into a State action. After consideration of the brief, he \nconcluded that merely holding a liquor license does not make it a State \naction when they said you couldn't have in the strip club women coming \nin without male escorts.\n  We do have some interesting cases in Federal court, as you can well \nsee.\n  I think that was a correct ruling, and apparently was not appealed \nand not reversed.\n  Should he have allowed that case to go on? Should he allow \ndepositions to be taken for months? Should he allow expenses to be run \nup? Insurance companies pay, people say. Well, you know, there is \nnothing wrong with that. The insurance company is going to pay the \nlawyer. Who pays the insurance companies? We pay the insurance \ncompanies. It is a cost of doing business in America. There is no free \nlunch and there is no free legal work in America. Somebody pays.\n\n  In Tessman v. Island Ford-Lincoln-Mercury, Inc., this Title VII \naction, Judge Shedd sua sponte challenged the court's subject matter \njurisdiction given the plaintiff's apparent failure to allege she had \nfirst presented her claim to the EEOC and received a right-to-sue \nletter.\n  The way this works, as I understand it, if you have a complaint about \ndiscrimination in the workforce, you have to go and file your complaint \nwith the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission. When you do that, \nthey evaluate it, and you can settle it at that stage. Businesses, \nrecognizing they made a mistake or many times the complaint is shown to \nbe worthless, and it is settled right there, and it ends right there.\n  But if the complaint is valid, and if the business or defendant does \nnot respond to the satisfaction of the plaintiff, the plaintiff can ask \nthe EEOC to give them a right-to-sue letter. That allows them to get \ntheir attorney to sue the defendant and take it to Federal court, to \nmake a Federal case out of it.\n  So the judge ordered the case dismissed unless the plaintiff could \nshow cause why that action should not be taken. I think that is what a \njudge should do. That is the way he ought to rule. When you have 5,000 \ncases, and you go through these, I am not aware that any of them have \nbeen reversed on appeal. And I think it is the right thing.\n  On the right of a judge to issue sua sponte actions, this is the law \nof the United States. This is a Supreme Court case, the authoritative \ndecision on the matter issued in 1986. The Supreme Court said:\n\n       [D]istrict courts are widely acknowledged to possess the \n     power to enter summary judgment sua sponte, so long as the \n     losing party was on notice that she had to come forward with \n     all of her evidence.\n\n  In each of these cases, the judge told the other party that was in \ntrouble their complaint was being questioned for jurisdiction matters, \nthat they had an opportunity to file a brief, and any other evidence as \nto why the case ought not to be dismissed. And that is the right way to \nhandle it.\n  The ninth circuit--this California circuit that strikes down the \nPledge of Allegiance--has declared:\n\n       District courts unquestionably have the power [to grant \n     summary judgment sua sponte].\n\n  That was in 1995.\n  The fourth circuit, of which District Court Judge Shedd is a part, \nruled:\n\n       It is a fundamental precept that federal courts are courts \n     of limited jurisdiction, constrained to exercise only the \n     authority conferred by Article III of the Constitution and \n     affirmatively granted by federal statute.\n\n  Many Federal judges forget that, but that is the law of this country. \nFederal courts have limited jurisdiction, and they are empowered by the \nConstitution and Federal statutes to do certain things, and only those \nthings.\n  Continuing to quote the court:\n\n       A primary incident of that precept is our duty to inquire, \n     sue sponte, whether a valid basis for jurisdiction exists, \n     and to dismiss the action if no such ground appears.\n\n  The fourth circuit further said:\n\n       We have long held that receipt of, or at least entitlement \n     to, a right-to-sue letter is a jurisdictional prerequisite \n     that must be alleged in a plaintiff's complaint. Thus, where \n     neither the complaint nor the amended complaint alleges \n     that the plaintiff has complied with these prerequisites, \n     the plaintiff has not properly invoked the court's \n     jurisdiction under Title VII.\n\n  So in each of the cases I have cited, and those that have been \ncomplained of by these scurrilous attack groups, Judge Shedd acted sua \nsponte, but he provided proper notice and an opportunity to the \nplaintiff to respond, as the law requires.\n  None of these cases were reversed on appeal. Trust me, had they been \nin\n\n[[Page S11355]]\n\nerror, it would have been taken up and been reversed. I think this \ncourt is a great circuit.\n  Several years ago, we had hearings to address the caseloads of the \nfederal courts. Senator Grassley as chairman of the Courts Subcommittee \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which I am a member, called the \nhearings. He had the chief judge of the fourth circuit appear and talk \nabout his caseload. They have one of the highest caseloads in America. \nActually, not one of the highest, I think their caseload, per circuit, \nbased on the cases per circuit for judges, was the highest in America. \nThey had worked extremely hard, and they had a good procedure for \nmanaging their cases. It was really a good example for the rest of the \ncourts around the country.\n  So I think this allegation--that this circuit is out of line--is \nsomething not healthy about the fourth circuit. It is just wrong. It is \na great circuit, doing superb work, and the taxpayers are benefitting \nfrom it greatly.\n  There have been suggestions, although not anything of substance \nreally, but allegations that somehow Judge Shedd is a white Southern \nmale, and he is insensitive on the matters of race. Those are serious \nmatters. I think if somebody had something to say about that, they \nwould come forward, and we would see it, and we would know about it. \nBut vague allegations of that kind are not good.\n  We ought to take very seriously any thought that someone would have \nacted without a commitment to equal justice. That would be wrong, and \nthey ought not be on the Federal bench if they do not treat people \nequally.\n  I would like to say, his record shows just the opposite. One of the \nthings that Judge Shedd did as a district judge--and district judges \nplay a significant role in the hiring of United States magistrates, who \nmake about $1,000 less than they do per year. They do not have quite \nthe lifetime appointment, but it is a good appointment. And magistrate \njudge positions are becoming highly sought after. A lot of good \napplications are made. There are a lot of superb lawyers who are acting \nas United States magistrate judges in America.\n  He led the effort in his district to recruit an African American \nmagistrate for that district, Margaret Seymour. She did a fine job as \nthat magistrate. Later on, President Clinton, a Democratic President, \nappointed her to the Federal bench in that district. Margaret Seymour \nis now a sitting Federal district judge. One of the main reasons that \noccurred is because, years before, Judge Shedd had gone out and sought \nher, and worked to have her selected as that United States Federal \nmagistrate.\n  He has worked actively to seek out minority and female candidates for \nother magistrate judge positions, and has directed the selection \ncommission in South Carolina to consider diversity in selecting \ncandidates for those positions.\n  In addition, he has recommended an African American female to serve \nas chief of the Pretrial Services Division in that district. Pretrial \nServices handles all the arrest matters involving defendants who are \narrested: whether or not they should be allowed bail, whether they are \non drugs, whether they ought to be locked up, how they ought to be \ntreated, supervising them pretrial if they are released on bail. They \ndo a lot of work. It is a pretty big deal. For the State of South \nCarolina, with one district, that is a big appointment. I just point \nthose things out. His critics didn't raise those issues.\n\n  Judge Shedd has bipartisan support from both his home State Senators. \nOf course, Senator Thurmond admires Judge Shedd immensely. He has \nobserved his career for many years. He has observed with great pleasure \nJudge Shedd's success on the bench. And he is extremely proud, as he \nnears 100 years of age, about to complete the longest term any Senator \nhas ever served in this body, that his former chief counsel, when he \nwas chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is now in a position to \nbe elevated to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. That is not too \nmuch to ask, I submit. It is the kind of thing we ought not to deny \nunless there is a real basis to do so.\n  He has both the support of Senator Thurmond and Senator Fritz \nHollings from South Carolina. Before coming to this body, Senator \nHollings was a real lawyer, a real litigator, a plaintiff's lawyer, a \nformer national president of the American Trial Lawyers Association. He \ngives no quarter in protecting the rights of plaintiffs on this floor.\n  When somebody complained one time about the plaintiffs trial lawyers \ngetting so much money in these tobacco cases, he said they did so much \ngood, as far as he was concerned, they could have more. He supports \nJudge Shedd. He and his friends in the Trial Lawyers Association--and I \nam sure he shares confidences with them--have agreed that this is a \ngood nomination.\n  I don't understand where we are with this problem. Judge Shedd has \nbeen completely forthcoming with the Senate Judiciary Committee's \nrequests, many of them, for information.\n  Earlier this year Judge Shedd sent nearly 1,000 unpublished opinions \nfor review immediately after Chairman Leahy requested them. They wanted \nto plow through all his cases, the unpublished opinions, thinking they \nmight find a nugget there. Apparently they haven't because they haven't \nraised any of them. We would be hearing about it. They would be blown \nup in charts.\n  He continued to provide additional unpublished opinions as well as \nother information the committee has requested regarding his rulings, \nopinions, and judicial record generally. He has been absolutely \nforthcoming.\n  Finally, I will just repeat, how do you know about all this? You hear \nthese things and some person says this and some person says that, and \nwhat do you believe?\n  The Democrats have tenaciously adhered to the view that the ABA \nrating is the gold standard, Democrats on our committee. They really \ninsisted on that and placed the ABA review at the center of our \nconfirmation process. Of course, it is an unofficial thing. It is \nnothing in the official process, but they have asserted it as the gold \nstandard for determining whether or not a judge should be confirmed. \nThis gold standard review process has been conducted by the American \nBar Association. Their team of lawyers and investigators have talked to \nall the people down there who have practiced before his court. They \ntalked to civil rights groups. They talked to plaintiffs lawyers. They \ntalked to defense lawyers. They talked to the community and fellow \njudges. They have come back with the highest possible rating they \ngive--well qualified--for Judge Shedd.\n  He absolutely is well qualified for this office. He ought to be \nconfirmed. It was a real disappointment to me to see a number of \nSenators in committee suggest that they might not be for him or were \nnot for him, even though we never had an official roll call vote. I \ndon't see where they are coming from.\n  This is a man we know. This is a man with a record of integrity, \njudgment, good demeanor, experienced now to a large degree, the kind of \ncapabilities that make for a great judge.\n  He is going to be a great judge on the Fourth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. I am proud to support him. I believe the complaints against \nhim are baseless and that he should be confirmed.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/18/senate-section/article/S11355-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
