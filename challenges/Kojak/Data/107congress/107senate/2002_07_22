I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 306, H.R. 3487.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The bill (H.R. 3487) to amend the Public Health Service Act \n     with respect to health professions programs regarding the \n     field of nursing.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to rise in support of final \npassage of the Nurse Reinvestment Act. This bill addresses the critical \nnursing shortage in our country by getting behind the nurses who take \ncare of us every day. It provides incentives to encourage people to \nenter the nursing profession and make it a career. This legislation is \nbased on the Nurse Reinvestment Act, S. 1864, that I sponsored with \nSenators Tim Hutchinson, John Kerry, and Jim Jeffords.\n  Since the Senate passed the Nurse Reinvestment Act in December of \nlast year, there is new information showing that the nursing shortage \nhas become even more severe. In Maryland, almost 16 percent of nursing \njobs are unfilled, up from 3.3 percent in 1997. There are over 2,000 \nregistered nurse vacancies in Maryland hospitals. Since the average age \nof a Maryland nurse is 47 years, we face the possibility that the \nshortage will soon get worse if young nurses do not enter and stay in \nthe profession.\n  The nursing shortage is not unique to Maryland. It is nationwide. In \n2001, the average American hospital vacancy rate was 13 percent for \nregistered nurses. The average age of an American nurse is 44 years, \nwith many retiring in their fifties or working part time due to the \nphysical demands of the job. At the same time, the labor force is \nshrinking and baby boomers will soon retire and place additional \ndemands on our health care system.\n  The nursing shortage can have grave consequences on patient care. A \nrecent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found \nthat nursing shortages in hospitals are associated with a higher risk \nof complications and even death. It is our duty to take steps to make \nsure our health care system is staffed with enough qualified nurses.\n  Nurses care for Americans from the cradle to the grave. We depend on \nthem to care for our parents, our children,\n\n[[Page S7128]]\n\nour siblings and sometimes ourselves. We turn to them in hospitals, \nnursing homes, community health centers, hospices, and for home health. \nThese organizations truly could not exist without nurses.\n  This bill is a significant step in addressing the nursing shortage. \nIt helps men and women obtain the education they need to become nurses, \nprovides training and career ladder programs to help nurses advance in \nthe profession, and helps ensure that there are enough nursing faculty \nto teach more nursing students. Highlights of this bill include:\n  National Nurse Service Corps To Serve in Areas With Critical Nurse \nShortages:\n  The bill creates a scholarship program, which provides scholarships \nfor nursing education in exchange for at least two years of full time \nservice, or the equivalent amount of part time service, in a facility \nwith a critical shortage of nurses; and\n  The bill extends the Loan Repayment Program for nurses: nurses have \ntheir nursing education loans paid back in exchange serving as a nurse \nfor at least two years in a facility with a critical shortage of \nnurses.\n  Public Service Announcements To Recruit Nurses and Promote Nursing:\n  The legislation creates State and national public service \nannouncements to promote nursing, encourage people to enter the nursing \nprofession, and inform the public of financial assistance for nursing \neducation programs.\n  Building Career Ladders and Retaining Quality Nurses:\n  The bill provides grants to improve nurse education, practice, and \nretention including:\n  Career ladder programs with schools of nursing and health care \nfacilities to encourage individuals to pursue additional education and \ntraining to enter and advance within the nursing profession, including \ncertified nurse assistants, CNAs;\n  Internship and residency programs that encourage mentoring and the \ndevelopment of specialties;\n  Retention programs that enhance collaboration among nurses and other \nhealth care professionals and promote nurse involvement in \norganizational and clinical decisionmaking.\n  Geriatric Education To Train Individuals To Care for the Elderly:\n  The bill creates a program to award grants to train and educate \nindividuals in providing geriatric care to the elderly.\n  Financial Help to Recruit Faculty To Teach in Nursing Schools:\n  The legislation provides loans for graduate-level education in \nnursing--cancels up to 85 percent of the loan and interest, in exchange \nfor teaching at a school of nursing, to help ensure that we have enough \nfaculty at our nursing schools.\n  This bill is about nursing education, but it is also about \nempowerment. We can empower people to improve their lives and go into a \ncareer that saves lives.\n  The bill will empower the single mom stuck in a dead end retail job \nto get a nursing degree at the local community college to forge a \nbetter life for herself and her family. She can receive a scholarship \nthat enables her to work around the needs of her family by going to \nnursing school either full or part-time. She would also have the \nopportunity to receive additional training or assistance in getting her \nbachelor's degree in nursing. A mentoring program could help her \nadvance in her profession and help keep her in the profession. She \ncould even get a master's degree and teach nursing at her local \ncommunity college, while most of her loans for her advanced degree are \ncancelled.\n  This bill also addresses the health care needs of a growing \npopulation in our country: the elderly. This bill provides training for \nindividuals involved in caring for the elderly by funding schools of \nnursing, health care facilities, programs leading to CNA certification, \nand partnerships of these to provide education and training in \ngeriatric care for the elderly. Our population is aging--more than 70 \nmillion Americans will be over age 65 by 2030. Their care will be \nimproved by nurses and other health care professionals who are \nspecifically trained to care for the unique health needs of older \nAmericans.\n  As a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, I will fight for \nfunding for the Nurse Reinvestment Act. We are putting these important \nprograms on our law books to address the nursing shortage. We must put \nthese same priorities in our federal checkbook.\n  This bill gets behind our Nation's nurses. It will improve patient \ncare by bringing more nurses to communities across the country. I thank \nmy colleagues for their support of this important legislation. I also \nwant to acknowledge and thank Senators Kennedy, Gregg, Hutchinson, \nKerry, Jeffords, Frist, and Clinton for their hard work in moving this \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying statement of \nmanagers be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The following is a statement of congressional intent with \n     respect to the Nurse Reinvestment Act.\n\n\n                         I. funding methodology\n\n       During the last reauthorization of Title VIII in 1998, \n     Congress required the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     to determine a funding methodology to be used for fiscal year \n     2003 and thereafter to determine the appropriate amounts to \n     be allocated to three important programs within the Nursing \n     Workforce Development activities--advanced nursing education, \n     workforce diversity, and nurse education and practice. In \n     developing this methodology, Congress outlined a series of \n     factors that should be considered and required a report \n     describing the new methodology as well as the effects of the \n     new methodology on the current allocations between those \n     three important programs.\n       Given that the new funding methodology was to take effect \n     in fiscal year 2003, Congress requested that the contract for \n     the funding methodology be completed by February 1, 2002, and \n     that the report to Congress regarding that methodology arrive \n     no later than 30 days after the completion of the development \n     of the methodology. Although Congress has not yet received \n     the report, George Mason University has been working on this \n     contract, and they have described the new funding methodology \n     on their website. This methodology states that advanced \n     nursing education should receive 31.5 percent of the funds (a \n     46 percent decrease from fiscal year 2001 allocations), \n     workforce diversity should receive 31.5 percent of the funds \n     (a 25% increase over fiscal year 2001 allocations), and nurse \n     education and practice should receive 37 percent of the funds \n     (a 20 percent increase over fiscal year 2001 allocations).\n       Because Congress expected the funding methodology to be \n     completed by the beginning of fiscal year 2003, current law \n     does not state how the funds should be allocated if no \n     funding methodology was available. Therefore, the discretion \n     is left to the Secretary. Due to that discretion, it is the \n     Congress' intent that the Secretary allocate funds in a \n     manner that would most appropriately address any current or \n     impending nursing shortage while minimizing disruption and \n     report such allocations to the appropriate committees of \n     Congress, along with a justification for those allocations. \n     Further, given that Congress has requested a new funding \n     methodology for fiscal year 2003, the Secretary is now \n     requested to provide an update on the development of that \n     methodology and the expected timeline for implementation.\n\n\n          ii. authorizations under the nurse reinvestment act\n\n       Throughout the bill, the legislation authorizes the \n     appropriation of such sums as may be necessary to accomplish \n     the objective of the legislation. It is Congress' belief that \n     the current nursing shortage is a significant national \n     problem that has a major negative impact on the delivery of \n     high-quality health care in the United States. It is \n     Congress' belief that funds should be appropriated for the \n     initiatives authorized by this legislation at a lever that is \n     commensurate with the significance of this problem.\n       The legislation authorizes the appropriation of such sums \n     as may be necessary in order to accomplish the objectives of \n     the legislation to allow flexibility in providing funding to \n     respond to the ongoing needs of the programs authorized by \n     the legislation. Although the legislation does not \n     authorize the appropriation of specific dollar amounts, it \n     is Congress' belief that the investment of significant new \n     resources, beyond those already provided under Title VIII \n     of the Public Health Service Act, will be required in \n     order to alleviate the current nursing shortage.\n\n\n                  iii. loan repayment and scholarships\n\n       The Congress intends that nurses fulfilling their service \n     requirement under the Loan Repayment Program or the \n     Scholarship Program under section 846 be able to fulfill \n     their service requirement in a nurse-managed health center \n     with a critical shortage of nurses.\n       The Congress further intends that, in determining the \n     placement of nurses under section 103 of the bill, the Health \n     Resources and Services Administration is not expected to \n     follow the placement requirements outlined under the National \n     Health Service Corps.\n\n[[Page S7129]]\n\n          iv. nurse education, practice, and retention grants\n\n                        A. Intent of Legislation\n\n       The legislation adds a number of new programs to section \n     831, and it is Congress' intent to ensure that these programs \n     are actually funded and implemented. Therefore, Congress \n     expects that the Secretary will seek to fund worthy \n     applications received under the Section 831 authorities that \n     have been added, while assuring the existing priorities \n     indicated under section 831 also continue.\n       Congress anticipates that the use of funds under 831(c)(2) \n     will directly affect nurses in their workplaces and will be \n     monitored for demonstrable improvement in the areas of nurse \n     retention and patient care.\n\n                             B. Background\n\n       In authorizing section 831(c)(2), Congress did so with the \n     evidence of the efficacy of magnet hospitals in mind. The \n     concept of magnet hospitals dates back to the country's last \n     nursing shortage in the 1980's. At the time, nursing \n     professional organizations and other experts noticed that \n     despite the nationwide nurse shortage, certain hospitals were \n     able to successfully attract and retain professional nurses, \n     behaving as nursing ``magnets.'' A study of these hospitals \n     showed that they shared a number of characteristics, each of \n     which contributed to making these ``magnet hospitals'' \n     attractive workplaces for nurses. Many of these attributes \n     have been mentioned in section 831(c)(2). Currently hospitals \n     can receive a magnet designation from the American Nurse \n     Credentialing Center, and extensive research on magnet-\n     designated facilities shows that nurses in these hospitals \n     show an average length of employment twice that of nurses in \n     non-magnet hospitals, and magnet hospital nurses consistently \n     report greater job satisfaction. Research has demonstrated \n     that magnet hospitals also show lower mortality rates, \n     shorter lengths of stay, and higher patient satisfaction.\n\n\n                     v. nurse faculty loan program\n\n       The purpose of the nurse faculty loan program is to \n     encourage individuals to pursue a master's or doctoral degree \n     to teach at a school of nursing in exchange for cancellation \n     of educational loans to these individuals.\n         Michael Bilirakis, Lois Capps, Billy J. Tauzin, John D. \n           Dingell, Richard Burr, Sherrod Brown, Ed Whitfield, \n           Eliot L. Engel, Robert L. Ehrlich, Henry A. Waxman, \n           Barbara A. Mikulski, Tim Hutchinson, John F. Kerry, \n           James M. Jeffords, Judd Gregg, Bill Frist, M.D., Edward \n           M. Kennedy, Susan M. Collins, Hilliary Rodham Clinton.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today the Senate considers long-needed \nlegislation to address the worsening crisis in nursing care across the \ncountry. We all know the importance of nurses in delivering good health \ncare. A nurse is often the first person that patients see after waking \nin the morning and the last person they see at night. Nurses are the \nbackbone of an effective health care system--yet the nation now faces a \ncrisis in nursing due to the shortages of trained nurses. The Nurse \nReinvestment Act we are considering today takes significant steps to \naddress the shortage by improving nurse training, reducing the barriers \nto a nursing education through loan repayment programs and \nscholarships, and improving working conditions.\n  The bill we consider today owes much to the skill and dedication of \nmany of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle and on both sides of \nthe Capitol. The legislation contains major provisions to improve nurse \ntraining sponsored by our colleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, \nwho has been tireless in her support for nurses. Her energy and skill \nwere indispensable in the Senate's approval of this important \nlegislation earlier this year. She is a champion for nurses, and this \nbill is a fitting tribute to her dedication.\n  The legislation we consider today also owes a great deal to the \ncommitment of our colleagues, Senator Kerry and Senator Jeffords. In \nthe legislation they introduced in the Senate last year, they outlined \na vision for a National Nurse Service Corps to serve in areas with a \nnursing shortage. This proposal is part of the legislation we are \nconsidering today. The provisions on the National Nurse Service Corps \nwill provide scholarships and loan repayment agreements for nursing \nstudents who agree to practice nursing in areas with a critical \nshortage of nurses. This corps of nurses can be effective in easing the \nmost critical shortages that exist in so many communities.\n  The challenge we face is clear. It is becoming increasingly difficult \nfor hospitals and other health facilities to obtain the nurses they \nneed to properly care for patients. Today, about 125,000 nurse \npositions remain vacant. This shortage will become more severe in the \nyears ahead as nurses reach retirement and as the demand for nursing \ncare increases because of the nation's aging population. A major part \nof the problem is that nurses often leave the practice of nursing \nbecause of poor working conditions.\n  Senator Clinton has sponsored important provisions in the bill to \nimprove working conditions for nurses and improve the retention of \ntrained nurses. Her proposals will provide effective incentives for \nhospitals to involve nurses in clinical decision-making and to improve \ncommunication among nurses and other health professionals. A clear \nexample of the benefits of these programs is shown by the success of \nhospitals designated as ``magnets'' for quality nurses. These leading \ninstitutions provide higher quality patient care because they are \nsuccessful in retaining trained nurses. The source of their success is \nvery clear--they value the professional role of nurses in patient care.\n  I also commend the distinguished ranking member of our committee, \nSenator Gregg, and the distinguished ranking member of our \nsubcommittee, Senator Frist, as well as many other members of our \ncommittee for their contributions to this legislation. This legislation \nwill also attract more students to the practice of nursing through \npublic service announcements, advertisements and outreach programs to \ndemonstrate the value of a career in nursing to young persons in all \nparts of the country.\n  Nurses have an indispensable role in our health care system. They are \nthe ones who provide much of the direct care to patients and monitor \nhow patients are recovering. Studies confirm that nursing care is \ncritical to improving patient outcomes, and that a shortage of nurses \ncan hurt patient care.\n  We cannot have a quality health care system without quality care by \nnurses. The legislation the Senate considers today will alleviate the \nsevere shortage the nation faces in trained nurses. It will improve the \nquality of care for millions of patients in communities throughout the \nNation. I thank my colleagues for their dedication to this important \nissue, and I urge the Senate to approve this needed legislation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased that the Senate is \nconsidering final passage of the Nurse Reinvestment Act, a bill I \noriginally introduced with my colleague, Senator Jeffords, in April of \n2001. I commend the chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee, my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, \nfor his efforts in seeing this legislation through the Senate. In \naddition, I wish to recognize the invaluable contributions Senators \nMikulski, Hutchinson, Frist, Gregg and Clinton made to the final \nversion of the legislation that is before us today. This legislation is \nimportant for nurses and patients, and essential to ensuring that our \nhealth care system can function at its best. Upon passage, the Nurse \nReinvestment Act will increase the number of nurses in our country, and \nalso ensure that every nurse in the field has the skills he or she \nneeds to provide the quality care patients deserve. I congratulate all \nof my colleagues for their work on this measure and for the \ncontribution it will inevitably make to the health our nation.\n  The Nurse Reinvestment Act is long overdue. Our country is facing a \nsevere nursing workforce shortage. Every type of community--urban, \nsuburban and rural--is touched by it. No sector of our health care \nsystem is immune to it. Across the country, hospitals, nursing homes, \nhome health care agencies and hospices are struggling to find nurses to \ncare for their patients. Patients seeking care have been denied \nadmission to facilities and told that there were ``no beds'' for them. \nOften there are beds, just not the nurses to care for the patients who \nwould occupy them.\n  Our nation has suffered from nursing shortages in the past. However, \nthis shortage is particularly severe because we are losing nurses at \nboth ends of the pipeline. Over the past five years, enrollment in \nentry-level nursing programs has declined by 20 percent. Lured to the \nlucrative jobs of the new economy, high school graduates are not \npursuing careers in nursing in the numbers they once had. Consequently, \nnurses under the age of 30 represent only 10 percent of the current \nworkforce. By 2010, 40 percent of the nursing\n\n[[Page S7130]]\n\nworkforce will be over the age of 50, and nearing retirement. If these \ntrends are not reversed, we stand to lose vast numbers of nurses at the \nsame time that they will be needed to care for the millions of baby \nboomers enrolling in Medicare.\n  The Nurse Reinvestment Act will support the recruitment of new \nstudents into America's nursing programs by funding national and local \npublic service announcements to enhance the profile of the nursing \nprofession and encourage students to commit to a career in nursing. In \naddition to recruiting new nurses, our legislation will reinvest in \nnurses who are already practicing by providing them with education and \ntraining at every step of the career ladder and at every health care \nfacility in which they work. It will ensure that nurses can obtain \nadvanced degrees, from a B.S. in Nursing to a PhD in Nursing. It will \nplace nurses in internships and residencies where they can receive the \nspecialized clinical training they need to respond to the complex \nhealth care needs of today's patients. Our bill will also help train \nnurses in geriatrics to ensure that our health care providers are \nprepared to care for the needs of our nation's growing senior \npopulation.\n  Finally, the Nurse Reinvestment Act will create, for the first time \nin history, a National Nurse Service Corps. Like the National Health \nService Corps, the NNSC will administer scholarships to and repay the \nloans of students who commit to working in a health care facility that \nis experiencing a shortage of nurses. In urban, suburban and rural \ncommunities across the country, where facilities turn away patients due \nto staff shortages, the NNSC will send qualified nurses to serve and \nprovide the care that patients deserve.\n  Our country boasts the best health care system in the world. But, \nthat health care system is being jeopardized by the shortage plaguing \nour nursing workforce. Indeed, state-of-the-art medical facilities are \nno use if their beds go unfilled and their floors remain empty because \nthe nurses needed to staff them are not available. The Nurse \nReinvestment Act will not only increase the numbers of new nurses in \nour country, but also ensure that every nurse has the skills he or she \nneeds to provide the high quality care that makes our health care \nsystem the best in the world. I urge my colleagues to join me and the \nbill's cosponsors in supporting final passage of this important \nlegislation.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am especially pleased on this day that \nwe are considering final passage of a long-awaited Nurse Reinvestment \nAct. When we pass this measure, it will represent a good day for the \nfuture of the nursing profession in America and an equally good day for \nthe future of quality patient care. I want to take this opportunity to \nspeak about this legislation, and to congratulate and complement my \nfellow Members of Congress who worked so hard to see this effort \nthrough. Back in April of 2001, together with my good friend from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kerry, I was proud to sponsor the innovative set \nof solutions to the nursing shortage set out in our Nurse Reinvestment \nAct. Since that time, with extraordinary contributions on behalf of \nSenator Hutchinson and Senator Mikulski, as well as the cooperative \nspirit of our colleagues in the House, I believe that we have produced \na piece of legislation that we can all be proud of. Today we have \nbefore us a measure that represents a truly bipartisan and bicameral \neffort to address a very serious nursing shortage in the United States.\n  As I have stated before, we are facing a looming crisis in this \ncountry. The size of our nursing workforce remains stagnant, while the \naverage age of the American nurse is on the rise. Over the past 5 \nyears, enrollment in entry-level nursing programs has declined by 20 \npercent. Nurses under the age of 30 represent only 10 percent of the \ncurrent workforce. By 2010, 40 percent of the nursing workforce will be \nover the age of 50, and nearing retirement. In Vermont, we are facing \nan even greater crisis. Only 28 percent of nurses are under the age of \n40 and Vermont schools and colleges are producing 31 percent fewer \nnurses today than they did just 5 years ago.\n  We have a compelling need to encourage more Americans to enter the \nnursing profession and to strengthen it so that more nurses choose to \nstay in the profession. All facets of the health care system will have \na role to play in ensuring a strong nursing workforce. Nurses, \nphysicians, hospitals, nursing homes, academia, community organizations \nand State and Federal Governments all must accept responsibility and \nwork towards a solution. Part of the responsibility to launch that \neffort begins with us today as we vote affirmatively for this \nlegislation.\n  The Nurse Reinvestment Act expands and improves the Federal \nGovernment's support of ``pipeline'' programs, which will maintain a \nstrong talent pool and develop a nursing workforce that can address the \nincreasingly diverse needs of America's population. The Nurse \nReinvestment Act provides for a comprehensive public awareness and \neducation campaign on a national, State and local level. The campaign \nwill help to bolster the image of the profession and highlight the \nadvantages and rewards of nursing, attract more nurses to the \nworkforce, and lead current nurses to take advantage of career \ndevelopment opportunities.\n  This legislation creates a National Nursing Service Corps Scholarship \nProgram that will provide scholarships to individuals to attend schools \nof nursing in exchange for a commitment to serve 2 years in a health \ncare facility determined to have a critical shortage of nurses. This \nscholarship program is designed to recruit both full-time and part-time \nnursing students, and to complement the existing loan repayment \nprogram.\n  The Nurse Reinvestment Act also provides for nurse education, \npractice, and retention grants. Specifically, the grants will be \nfocused on internship and residency programs that encourage mentoring, \ndevelopment of specialties, and increased education in the area of new \ntechnologies like distance learning. It provides for career ladder \ngrants to promote advancement for nursing personnel, including \nprofessional nurses, advanced education nurses, licensed practical \nnurses, certified nurse assistants, and home health aides. In addition, \nthese grants aim to improve retention by enhancing collaboration among \nnurses and other health care professionals and by promoting nurse \ninvolvement in organizational and clinical decision-making.\n  The legislation before us today goes even further by emphasizing \npreparation for the aging baby boomer population. With this \nlegislation, we create a new program that provides for grants to train \nand educate individuals in providing geriatric care for the elderly. We \nalso create a nurse faculty loan program in order to ensure that we \nhave enough faculty to teach the nurses that we will so direly need in \nthe years to come. The faculty loan program will allow for up to 85 \npercent loan cancellation for students in advanced degree programs who \nagree to serve as a faculty member at a school of nursing.\n  Once again, I want to applaud my colleagues Senator Kerry, Senator \nMikulski and Senator Hutchinson for their tireless work on the Nurse \nReinvestment Act and for the work of their staffs. In particular, I \nwant to recognize the efforts of Kelly Bovio in Senator Kerry's office, \nKate Hull in Senator Hutchinson's office and Rhonda Richards with \nSenator Mikulski. This effort was also advanced with the help of Sarah \nBianchi, Jackie Gran, Brian Hickey, and David Bowen who are members of \nSenator Kennedy's staff, Christina Ho of Senator Clinton's staff, Steve \nIrizarry with Senator Gregg and Shana Christrup with Senator Frist. \nFinally, in my own office, I want to note the efforts of Philo Hall, \nAngela Mattie, Eric Silva and Sean Donohue for their work throughout \nthis process.\n  Adequate health care services cannot survive any further diminishing \nof the nursing workforce. Today, we are taking a positive step forward \nto address the problem before us. I urge my colleagues to join me and \nthe bill's cosponsors in support of this measure, and I trust that this \nNurse Reinvestment Act will be given top priority when it comes time to \nadequately fund the programs set out in it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, today is a day of great significance \nand a turning point for the future of nursing in our country. We are \nabout to\n\n[[Page S7131]]\n\npass the final version of the Nurse Reinvestment Act, after months of \nnegotiations between the House of Representatives and the Senate. \nEighteen months ago, I held the first hearings in the Senate examining \nthe severity of the nursing shortage and its impact on our health care \ndelivery system. I subsequently worked with Senator Mikulski to \nintroduce S. 721, the Nurse Education and Employment Development Act, \nwhich served as a basis for the legislation the Senate is about to pass \ntoday.\n  Nurses are the foundation of our Nation's health care system. Our \nnation has one of the best health care systems in the world the quality \nof health care that we have come to expect is a direct result of the \nhard work and commitment of nurses. However, the profession as a whole \nis shrinking. Nurses and nurse faculty are retiring or leaving the \nprofession, perhaps for a better paying job, and fewer new nurses are \nthere to replace them. According to recent surveys, working nurses are \non average 45 years old. Less than 10 percent of the nurse workforce is \nunder age 30, and just about 5 percent of the workforce consists of \nmen.\n  The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that over 560,000 new nursing \njobs will be created in the next decade due to continued demand for \nhealth care services and the retirement of the Baby Boomers. During \nthis same time period, over 440,000 nursing jobs will open due to \nnurses retiring from the profession. Despite this incredible need, \noverall enrollments in Registered Nurse programs reached a high of \nnearly 270,000 in 1993, and have declined by over 50,000 by 1999. In \nArkansas, nursing enrollments have declined by over 40 percent over the \nlast decade. Unless this trend is reversed by encouraging more people \nto enter the field of nursing and developing a diverse workforce, \nstudies indicate that by the year 2020, 20 percent of nursing needs \nwill go unmet.\n  The provisions of the Nurse Reinvestment Act, all of which reflect \nthose contained in the original legislation introduced by Senator \nMikulski and myself, aim to attract and retain more nurses and to \nensure quality care.\n  First, the legislation establishes a National Nurse Service Corps, \nwhich consists of scholarships and expanded loan repayments for nurses \nwho agree to serve for at least two years in a health care facility \nwith a critical shortage of nurses. Hospitals, nursing homes, home \nhealth agencies, and health centers are all experiencing shortages of \nqualified health care personnel. Up to 168,000 hospital positions are \nunfilled today, and 75 percent, or 126,000, of those vacancies are \nRegistered Nurse positions. Of the 106,982 direct care nursing \npositions now vacant in nursing homes, 16,196 are Registered Nurse \njobs. The goal of the National Nurse Service Corps is to inspire \nindividuals to obtain nursing education at all levels and to fill the \nneed.\n  Compassion, intellect and courage are all terms that come to mind \nwhen I think of the nursing profession. Unfortunately, negative \nstereotypes, that nursing is only for women, or that nursing just \ninvolves changing bedpans, have invaded our culture. The Nurse \nReinvestment Act provides for a national awareness campaign, through \npublic service announcements, to show all Americans, men, women, and \nyoung children, how rewarding and noble a career in nursing can be and \nabout opportunities for assistance in obtaining a nursing education.\n  In the areas of training and recruitment, the Nurse Reinvestment Act \ncompromise retains the Senate provision relating to geriatric training \nfor nurses, a critical provision in light of the growing number of \nolder patients with complex medical histories and multiple chronic \nconditions. Provisions to encourage mentoring and specialty training \nthrough internships and residencies, career ladder programs to \nencourage nursing professionals of all levels to seek further education \nand professional development, and grants for nurse retention \nactivities, all have been incorporated into the existing structure of \nTitle VIII in the Public Health Service Act.\n  With all of the new measures in the Nurse Reinvestment Act to recruit \nand train nurses, it is essential to have adequate nurse faculty to \nteach these students. The shortage of nurse faculty is especially \nevident in my home state of Arkansas and the surrounding southern \nregion. In 1999, 153 eligible nursing students in Arkansas were turned \naway because of inadequate faculty to teach them. Eighty-six schools of \nnursing in the southern region have reported insufficient faculty. \nCompounding this problem is the increasing number of nurse faculty \nretirements. In the 2000, 2001 academic year, 144 nurse educators \nretired in the southern region alone, 784 more nurse educators are \nexpected to retire in this region between 2002 and 2006.\n  Our schools of nursing must have the capacity to teach new nurses in \norder to overcome the nursing shortage. I am therefore extremely \npleased that the Nurse Reinvestment Act final compromise includes a \nmodified nurse faculty development provision which provides loans to \nnurses pursuing their masters and doctoral degrees and provides for \nloan cancellation up to 85 percent upon service as a nurse educator at \na school of nursing.\n  In all, the Nurse Reinvestment Act is a solid step forward in \naddressing the nursing shortage in our country. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation, so we can send it to President Bush for \nsignature.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the passage of the \n``Nurse Reinvestment Act''--the culmination of work to directly address \nthe nursing shortage. This bill, which has combined portions of S. \n726--the ``Nursing Employment and Education Development, NEED, Act'' \nand S. 706--the ``Nurse Reinvestment Act'' outlines a comprehensive \napproach to the nursing shortage by focusing on recruitment, education \nand retention of nurses. I want to thank Senators Hutchinson, Kerry, \nJeffords, and Mikulski for their leadership in this issue.\n  This crucial legislation provides for public service announcements at \nboth the State and Federal level to educate the public about the \nadvantages and rewards of nursing. Additionally, this important \nlegislation assists us with training future nurses and future nursing \nneeds by establishing a focus on geriatric nursing, establishing a \nfaculty loan program, and focusing on nursing mobility through the \ndevelopment of career ladders. Finally, this bill focus as new \nresources on retaining nurses to the profession by establishing a \nNational Nurse Service Corps and by increasing the emphasis on \nretention within basic nurse education grants.\n  We are in the midst of a nursing shortage. Not only are fewer people \nentering and staying in the nursing profession, but we are losing \nexperienced nurses at a time of growing need. Today, nurses are needed \nin a greater number of settings, such as nursing homes, extended care \nfacilities, community and public health centers, professional \neducation, and ambulatory care centers. Nationwide, health care \nproviders, ranging from hospitals and nursing homes to home health \nagencies and public health departments, are struggling to find \nqualified nurses to provide safe, efficient, quality care for their \npatients.\n  Though we have faced nursing shortages in the past, this looming \nshortage is particularly troublesome because it reflects two trends \nthat are occurring simultaneously: (1) a shortage of people entering \nthe profession and (2) the retirement of nurses who have been working \nin the profession for many years. Over the past 5 years, enrollment in \nentry-level nursing programs has declined by 20 percent, mirroring the \ndeclining awareness of the nursing profession among high school \ngraduates. Consequently, nurses under the age of 30 represent only 10% \nof the current workforce. By 2010, 40 percent of the nursing workforce \nwill be older than 50 and nearing retirement. If these trends are not \nreversed, we stand to lose vast numbers of nurses at the very time they \nwill be needed to care for the millions of baby boomers reaching \nretirement age. Therefore, we need to focus on both recruitment to and \nretention within the nursing profession.\n  Further, greater efforts must be made to recruit more men and \nminorities to this noble profession. Currently, only 10 percent of the \nregistered nurses in the United States are from racial or ethnic \nminority backgrounds, even though these individuals comprise 28 percent \nof the total United States population. In 2000, only 5.9 percent of the \nregistered nurses were men. We must\n\n[[Page S7132]]\n\nwork to promote diversity in the workforce, not only to increase the \nnumber of individuals within the profession, but also to promote \nculturally competent and relevant care.\n  Even if nursing schools could recruit more students to deal with the \nshortage, many schools could not accommodate higher enrollments because \nof faculty shortages. There are nearly 400 faculty vacancies at nursing \nschools in this country. And, an even greater faculty shortage looms in \nthe next 10-15 years as many current nursing faculty approach \nretirement and fewer nursing students pursue academic careers. \nTherefore, the faculty develop piece within this legislation is crucial \nto dealing with this shortage.\n  Further, in examining any nursing shortage, we must recognize the \npotential effects of this looming shortage on patient outcomes. A \nrecent study by Jack Needleman, Peter Buerhaus, and others, found a \ndirect link between nurse staffing levels and five inpatient outcomes--\nurinary tract infections, pneumonia, length of stay, upper \ngastrointestinal bleeding, and shock. To provide an appropriate \nemphasis on patient outcomes, we have increased the emphasis on \nexamining patient outcomes within this legislation.\n  Additionally, shortages of nurse aides parallel the trends seen in \nrelationship to nurses. Nurse aides are primarily employed in nursing \nhome settings, and some studies have suggested that the average \nturnover rate for nurse aides is 100 percent. This high turnover rate \ndirectly affects both health care costs and patient care quality. \nProvider costs related to high turnover include recruitment, selection, \nand training of new staff; use of temporary staff; overtime for current \nstaff; initial reduction of efficiency of new staff; and decrease in \nnurse aide moral and group productivity. A recent report from the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services found a direct relationship \nbetween nurse aid staffing levels and quality of resident care. To \nensure the appropriate emphasis on nurse aides, we ensured that, where \nfeasible, these facilities and providers were covered within the bill.\n  It has been an honor and a pleasure to work closely with my \ndistinguished colleagues in both the House and Senate, and I look \nforward to continuing to working with them as we advocate for funding \nfor these particular provisions and ensure that they are appropriately \nimplemented.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am proud that the House and the Senate \nhave worked out the differences between the two versions of the Nurse \nReinvestment Act that we passed last year. I am also proud that today, \nthe Senate will pass this agreed-upon legislation with unanimous \nsupport, and I look forward to subsequent action by the House so that \nthis bill can be swiftly signed into law. I thank Senators Mikulski, \nHutchinson, Kerry, Jeffords, and Kennedy for their leadership. Many on \nthe House side have also worked hard on this legislation, including \nRepresentatives Bilirakis, Capps, and others.\n  We have all heard a great deal about the workforce shortage from \nnurses in New York and across the Nation. Around the country, nurses \nare facing an emergency of their own.\n  The number of undergraduate nursing program graduates in New York \nState has dropped each academic year since 1996, and this pattern is \nevident everywhere.\n  The Nurse Reinvestment Act we are passing today contains \nscholarships, public service announcements, and other provisions to \nencourage people to enter the profession, as well as nurse faculty \nprovisions too, so that colleges of nursing have the personnel equipped \nto help train new nurses entering the pipeline.\n  But the current nursing shortage problem exists not only because \nfewer individuals are entering the nursing profession, but also because \nthe healthcare industry is having trouble retaining the nurses already \non staff. Fifty percent of nurses say that they have recently \nconsidered leaving their jobs for reasons other than retirement, and \napproximately half a million licenses nurses are not currently \npracticing nursing. Many of the nurses who have considered leaving the \nprofession cite their low level of overall job satisfaction.\n  But there are some health care facilities that are taking action and \nhaving an effect on retention and nurse satisfaction.\n  During the last nursing shortage, researchers found some hospitals \nexperienced low turnover and low vacancies. They found these hospitals \nshared certain characteristics. They were structured along \nparticipatory, collaborative, and patient-centered lines and, as a \nresult, act as ``magnets'' that attract and retain nurses.\n  The American Nurse Credentialing Center developed a credentialing \nprogram to designate facilities as magnet facilities if they met \ncertain criteria. And over the years, these magnet facilities have \ncontinued to demonstrate results. The average length of employment for \nregistered nurses in magnet hospitals is 8.35 years, which is twice the \nlength of employment in hospitals generally, and magnet hospital nurses \nconsistently report greater job satisfaction, fewer needlestick \ninjuries, and lower burnout rates than other nurses.\n  But the beneficiaries of this legislation are not just hospitals and \nnurses, but patients as well. Magnet hospitals report lower mortality \nrates, higher patient satisfaction, and greater cost-efficiency, with \npatients experiencing shorter stays in hospitals and intensive care \nunits.\n  That is why last year I introduced the bipartisan Nurse Retention and \nQuality Care Act with my colleague, Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon, to \nprovides grants to health care organizations to implement these magnet \nhospital principles that improve nurse retention.\n  The Nurse Reinvestment Act, which we are passing today, adds for the \nfirst time some recognition of the importance of retention in \naddressing nursing issues, as well, and specifically mentions the \nmagnet principles of collaboration, nurse involvement in \ndecisionmaking, and orientation toward patient outcomes. I look forward \nto action by the House and the President to assure that this bill \nbecomes law.\n  On September 11, and since, our nurses have been on the front lines \nof the battle against terrorism and bioterrorism. Today, they continue \nto defend America. I am pleased to be celebrating our work together to \nhelp hospitals, nurses, and patients, through this bill, which we will \nwork together to fund.\n  Mr. REID. Senators Mikulski, Hutchinson of Arkansas, and others have \na substitute amendment at the desk, and I ask that the amendment be \nconsidered and agreed to; the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable; the bill, as amended, be read the third time and passed; the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table; and that any statements be \nprinted in the Record, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4312) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The bill (H.R. 3487), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/22/senate-section/article/S7132-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7132-S7134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CORPORATE AMERICA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, flying back here last night from Nevada, I \nspoke with two flight attendants. Usually they talk to me about working \nconditions, air marshals, or something dealing with their job. But they \nwere concerned about corporate America. They talked to me two separate \ntimes. In effect, they said: This is a disgrace. I hope, Senator, you \nare doing something about it.\n  This morning when I was at the doctor's office, I had another \nconversation about the problems in corporate America. Because of my \nlight complexion and having been raised in the desert sun, I on \noccasion have had a dermatologist take little things off my face, and \ntoday was one of those occasions. While I was waiting for the \nphysician, a nurse approached me, and said: Senator, I hope you do \nsomething about what is going on in America today. These scandals in \nthe corporations are outrageous.\n  Everyone in America is concerned. I was in Nevada this weekend, and \nfive or six different people came to me on different occasions, talking \nnot about the things I would normally expect upon returning to Nevada, \nbut about corporate America and what is going on.\n\n[[Page S7133]]\n\n  We are debating a bill that directly deals significantly with \ncorporate America: Pharmaceutical companies. We have been told in the \ndebate the average CEO of a pharmaceutical company in America makes $27 \nmillion a year. Pretty good change.\n  This debate deals with generics, it deals with prescription drugs, it \ndeals with patents on medicines, but it also deals with corporate \nAmerica.\n  In response to the crisis of confidence that has plagued American \ninvestors, the Senate has responded forcefully. The majority, the \nDemocrats, have led the way by drafting important legislation to close \nloopholes and bring about more corporate accountability. The Senate \nunanimously passed an accounting reform bill that protects investors \nand punishes corporate criminals. The Republican leadership in the \nHouse led an effort to pass a watered-down version that does not go \nnearly far enough. I am encouraged by reports that many in the House \nsupport the stronger policies the Senate passed, and I hope the \nlegislation that comes out of the conference is one that has the \nSenate's mark on it. I am looking for the President to come forward and \nsupport our position.\n  Over the weekend, again, he said, please, give us a bill before the \nAugust recess. What bill does he want? Does he want the nothing bill \nthe House has, or is he willing to come forward and talk about the \nSarbanes version of the legislation, which is strong legislation, which \nwould restore confidence, so that flight attendants and nurses are not \nworried about corporate America?\n  Nevadans are significantly impacted by the downturn in the financial \nmarkets. People in Nevada count on their investments to help meet their \ncurrent daily expenses and plan for the future. That is the way it is \nall over America. Nevada's high quality of life has attracted many \nretirees. But many have seen their life savings evaporate as stock \nprices fall. As accounts have dwindled in the last 4 or 5 days we have \nheard people saying they wished they had never gone into the stock \nmarket. They are checking out. Nevada workers nearing retirement face \nuncertainty about their ability to stop working because they no longer \ncan afford to do so.\n  We have seen the cartoons around the country asking why this person \nis working so long, and the cartoons indicate: I invested in the stock \nmarket, and I have to work until I'm in my nineties.\n  College plans for students in Nevada are now in jeopardy because \nfamily savings have disappeared.\n  The collapse of Enron--taking just that one scandal, because there \nare many others--has had a ripple effect that has caused economic \ndifficulties and threatened the health of Nevada generally. The State \npublic employees retirement pension fund lost almost $23 million \ninvested in Enron. That is a lot of money for a small State such as \nNevada. Thousands of Nevada's dedicated public servants who worked hard \nand saved and invested responsibly have seen their investments erode to \nsatisfy the greed of corporate fat cats.\n\n  In addition, look at the trauma center at the University Medical \nCenter in Las Vegas. Las Vegas is now a major metropolitan area. About \n1.5 million or 1.6 million people live and work in that area. The one \ntrauma center where they took care of the accident cases and took care \nof the indigent patients, basically, in Nevada--it serves a huge number \nof people; it is one of the busiest in the country--has been forced to \nclose temporarily and faces a very unsure future.\n  Why? Because of corporate America. This is linked to the Enron \nscandal because the Medical Center's insurer, St. Paul, lost $108 \nmillion invested in Enron. That is five times as much as the total cost \nfor medical malpractice payouts in Nevada. As a result, St. Paul has \nraised premiums for malpractice insurance to such an extent that many \ndoctors have elected simply to leave the State.\n  We have one physician who is going into long-haul truck driving. And \nmany doctors have elected not to work at the trauma center.\n  Going to a little different subject, it is hard to comprehend that \nthese insurance companies get away with as much as they do. There is no \nother business in America that can meet--not secretly--and fix prices. \nBecause of the McCarran-Fergusson legislation passed during the \nDepression, insurance companies are not bound by the Sherman Antitrust \nAct. They can meet to set prices to run people out of business. It is \nnot against the law, civilly or criminally.\n  I am deeply concerned about the problems caused by scandals in \ncorporate America and their far-reaching effects. I want to make sure \nthe President responds appropriately, or tries to. Unfortunately, the \nadministration so far has not provided the reassurance the public \nseeks. It fails to demonstrate leadership on this issue.\n  Let me be clear, the crisis in investor confidence is in danger of \nspreading. I don't know what is going to happen today, but I saw an \nhour ago the Dow was down 258 points again today. Maybe it will have a \nrally in the next hour or 2 and be fine, but that is what I saw.\n  The crisis in investor confidence is in danger of spreading, \npotentially crushing consumer confidence and reducing consumer \nspending, and that is all we have going. If we reduce consumer \nspending, that would be devastating in the country. The climate of \nscandal is linked to the administration in this way. I think how the \nPresident responds also is important. I do not think he has responded \nappropriately.\n  He has given a speech. You could see the stock market dropping as he \nwas speaking. That is what the TV stations did. As he is speaking about \nconsumer confidence, the stock market is reeling backwards.\n  Among the steps the President must take to resolve the crisis in the \nfinancial markets and to restore confidence is to replace, in my \nopinion, key members of his administrative team who cannot be effective \nin bringing about necessary changes. In Government, we not only have to \ndo what is right but what looks right. We have to not only do what is \nright, but what appears to be right.\n  The Securities and Exchange Commission is the main regulator of \nAmerica's financial markets. The President chose Harvey Pitt, who \naggressively defended the big accounting firms and corporate America \nand represented the lobbying group for the big accounting firms, while \nhe being confirmed as Chairman of the SEC, the agency that is charged \nwith investigating the same accounting firms involved in the scandals \nthat rocked the stock market and hurt millions of America's investors. \nIt is trite, but it seems to me it is installing the fox to protect the \nhen house.\n\n  Mr. Pitt set the wrong tone from the beginning, suggesting he would \nhave the SEC be ``kinder and gentler.'' Kinder and gentler? One of his \nformer clients is Arthur Andersen, a firm implicated in so many \nunfolding scandals that major magazines have reported they no longer \nhave anyone working there.\n  Is Mr. Pitt really the right person to investigate Andersen, \nimplement charges, oversee them and enforce regulations? Those flight \nattendants I met last night, and the nurse today, I think would say: He \nwants a kinder, more gentle SEC? I don't think so.\n  He has already had to recuse himself from more than two dozen SEC \ninvestigations, but he did not see anything wrong with meeting \nprivately with the incoming chairman of KPMG, another former client, \nwhen his firm was under investigation for its accounting work with \nXerox.\n  The SEC needs a new leader, somebody free from conflict of interest, \nwho recognizes how damaging even the appearance of conflict of interest \nis at this sensitive time for America's financial well-being. Neither \nthe American public nor responsible business leaders have confidence in \nMr. Pitt's ability to serve effectively.\n  The Wall Street Journal, among other respected voices in the \nfinancial community, has expressed the need for a replacement. You \ncannot say the Wall Street Journal is some left-leaning, left-wing \norganization opposed to business. Quite the contrary. But they say he \nshould be replaced.\n  A growing number of my colleagues in Congress, both Democrats and \nRepublicans, have indicated it is time for him to go. So I join with \nthem in calling on Mr. Pitt to resign or for President Bush to replace \nhim. It would send a strong message to Wall Street, to the people who \nwork for the corporations in Wall Street, the people who\n\n[[Page S7134]]\n\nearn a living making that stock as valuable as it is.\n  I am also troubled by the Secretary of the Army, Thomas White, who \ntestified before the Commerce Committee last week about his role as \nvice chairman of Enron Energy Services. Those who observed his \ntestimony can only be disturbed by his performance. Memos written by \nEnron lawyers in the year 2000 suggest that the division of Enron led \nby Secretary White at the time overstated the demand for power so that \nanother division could benefit from artificially higher prices. As a \nresult, Enron raked in obscene profits while consumers paid billions of \ndollars in excess.\n  It was all phony accounting, a manipulation, by an organization led \nby the Secretary of the Army.\n  Enron's manipulation of California's energy markets affected the \nentire western United States. It affected Nevada adversely, driving \nNevada's utilities to the brink of bankruptcy and forcing consumers to \npay skyrocketing rates.\n  Secretary White received approximately $50 million while at Enron--\nhe, personally--and he made an additional $12 million after he joined \nthe Bush administration by selling Enron stock following 77 phone calls \nto his former colleagues at the company.\n  During the questioning by Senator Boxer and others he claimed: Well, \nI was just seeing how my friends were doing.\n  He made $12 million, made 77 phone calls. It just doesn't look right.\n  The New York Times reported that last December the Army, which of \ncourse reports to Secretary White, granted a sweetheart deal to KBR, a \ndivision of Vice President Cheney's former employer Halliburton, \n``despite being a reputed bill-padder and the target of a criminal \ninvestigation.''\n  I don't know what Secretary White's total involvement in these \ndealings might be. I hope neither he nor any of the administration \nofficials being investigated is guilty of any criminal wrongdoing. But \nit is obvious that he cannot be an effective leader if he doesn't have \nthe confidence of the American public, the airline steward or \nstewardess or the nurse. It would be in the best interests of our \ncountry and the administration if he resigned.\n  We in Government not only have to avoid what is wrong but also what \nlooks wrong. With the Secretary of Army it looks wrong. With the head \nof the SEC, Harvey Pitt, it just doesn't look right.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, \nis recognized.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been listening to the assistant \nmajority leader. I was very interested in his remarks. This President \nhas been in office less than a year and a half. It does seem to me that \nthe problems we have in America are problems for everybody--not one \nparty and not one President. They are problems for all of us.\n  I have to say I think this President is doing everything he possibly \ncan to try to stabilize this economy and get us through these \ndifficulties. Certainly the economy is doing well. We have 3-percent \nproductivity growth, which is better than the whole time between 1980 \nand 1995. There are a number of other things which show that we have a \nstrong economy.\n  But this underlying illness that afflicts the stock market is hurting \neverybody. I suspect part of that comes from what has gone on over the \nlast 10 years or so and not just in the last year and a half. There has \nbeen a lack of confidence in our business community because of those \nwho have been committing these heinous acts of misrepresentation and \nfraud in some of these major corporations in America. There have been \nrelatively few. And I see that other corporations are scrupulously \ngoing over their books to make sure they are toeing the line in meeting \nthe needs of the American stock market.\n  I suspect we are going to come through this within the next couple of \nweeks, and when people start to realize that our economy is good and \nthat we are going to come through this, we will be OK. But I think it \nmay be a little unfair to suggest that it is basically all this \nPresident's fault or that it is all one party's fault. We all have \nthings we could have done better. We all have some responsibility.\n  I believe our current President is doing an excellent job. As \neverybody knows, I stood up for the prior President when I thought he \nwas right.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/22/senate-section/article/S7134-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7134-S7158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      GREATER ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE PHARMACEUTICALS ACT--Continued\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today we are discussing the Medicare \nprescription drug bill, which is basically the two bills we will be \nvoting on tomorrow.\n  I rise this afternoon to take the opportunity to share my thoughts on \nMedicare drug coverage. Today and tomorrow, we will be debating two \nMedicare prescription drug bills--the Medicare Outpatient Prescription \nDrug Act of 2002, introduced by Senators Graham, Miller, Kennedy and \nCorzine, and the 21st Century Medicare Act introduced by the Senate \ntripartisan group which includes Senators Grassley, Jeffords, Breaux, \nSnowe, and myself.\n  There is no question that all of us have the same goal in mind--to \nprovide beneficiaries with Medicare prescription drug coverage, this \nyear. But, unfortunately, we do not agree on how this coverage should \nbe provided. Senators Graham and Miller believe it should be provided \nthrough the Federal Government. On the other hand, the Senate \ntripartisan members believe drug coverage should be provided through \nthe private market.\n  During the next day and a half, you will hear about the merits of \nboth bills. You will also hear criticisms of both bills. While these \nmatters certainly need to be debated by the Senate, both of these \nbills, which will impact the lives of millions of Americans, should \nhave been considered by the Senate Finance Committee before being \ndebated on the Senate floor. I have heard my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle saying that the Senate Finance Committee has debated \nthis issue for the last 5 years and the American people are tired of \nwaiting for the Senate Finance Committee to act. I take issue with that \nargument. Actually, we have had 37 years to fix Medicare. We just \ncelebrated its 37th birthday. And don't forget what happened when we \npassed a Medicare prescription drug benefit the last time. We repealed \nit the very next year. So we need to proceed with caution and consider \nany prescription drug bill very carefully before passing such a measure \nby the U.S. Senate. We do not want to make the same mistake twice.\n  Let me just say that making any changes to the Medicare program is \nnot an easy task. I have been in the Senate for over 26 years and I \nfind the Medicare program to be one of the most complicated programs in \nthe Federal Government. There was a recent quote by former Secretary of \nState Madeleine Albright in the Washington Post, July 20, 2002, where \nshe said, ``being Secretary of State is the best job in the world. \nBetter than being President, because you don't have to deal with \nMedicare.''\n  I think she may have hit the nail right on the head.\n  The point I am trying to make is simple. We need to spend quality \ntime drafting and debating a Medicare prescription drug benefit. We \nshould not be considering such important legislation on the Senate \nfloor without the Senate Finance Committee having a mark-up. That is \njust not right and it is downright irresponsible.\n  We should have let the Finance Committee do its job. But as I said \nall last week, politics is dictating policy. So here we are, debating \none of the most important issues of the 107th Congress without even a \nFinance Committee hearing on the legislation being considered by the \nSenate today and tomorrow.\n  I am extremely disappointed in the way this has been handled by the \nDemocratic leadership. I believe that the Finance Committee members \ncould have approved a bill out in the Committee. It just wasn't the \nbill that the Democratic leadership wanted to have passed out of \nCommittee.\n  On that point, I truly believe that we could have reached a consensus \nin the Finance Committee if we had been given a chance. When Senator \nKennedy and I authored the Children's Health Insurance Program in 1997, \nthere were not more different Members of the Congress. But we did it, \nand we got the bill\n\n[[Page S7135]]\n\nthrough the Congress and had our CHIP bill signed into law in 1997 as \npart of the Balanced Budget Act.\n\n  In fact, it was the glue that held the first balanced budget act in \nover 40 years. It was the glue that got that CHIP bill signed into law \nas part of that particular act.\n  Senator Kennedy and I reached consensus. Where there is a will, there \nis a way.\n  The same thing could happen with the Medicare prescription drug \nlegislation. But there must be a willingness to get something done this \nyear. And I am sensing that there is a lot of political game playing on \nthis issue which says to me that there is not a willingness to get \nsomething signed into law this year.\n  Our tripartisan bill has the votes to pass both the Senate Finance \nCommittee and the Senate. But we will not be given the opportunity to \nbring our bill before the Senate Finance Committee because, in my \nopinion, the majority leader does not want our bill to pass the Senate \nFinance Committee. Again, that is just a shame that we have to resort \nto such political game playing on an issue so important to our seniors \nand to our country. We finally have a bill that can be approved by the \nCommittee and the majority leader refuses to have it go through the \nproper channels. Let me just say that I am extremely disappointed by \nhis decision. I, for one, am still willing to do the work to get a \nMedicare prescription drug bill signed into law this year. I only hope \nthat the majority leader is willing to work with us.\n  We have talked a lot about both bills in the last week and, at this \ntime, I would like to talk about the tripartisan Medicare prescription \nbill. It is the only bill with support of both Democrats and \nRepublicans being considered in the Senate. It provides Medicare \nbeneficiaries three key elements--affordable drug coverage, choice in \nhealth coverage, and quality health care. All three elements are \nimportant and all three elements are included in this bill.\n  According to CBO, spending on drugs for seniors over the next decade \nwill grow at an astronomical rate. CBO says that the only way to \ncontain the cost of a drug benefit is to ensure that drugs are \ndelivered efficiently. In turn, CBO says that the only way to have \ndrugs delivered efficiently is to have true competition.\n  True competition, according to CBO, requires two things:\n  No. 1. Private plans that assume at least a limited degree of risk--\nthat is, if they are efficient, they will make money, and if not, they \nwill lose money.\n  No. 2. That those plans be able to compete by varying the premium \nthey charge, and varying the benefits they offer. The tripartisan bill \nallows plans to vary both premiums and benefits.\n  CBO says that if all plans offer the same premium and same benefits, \nas under the Democratic leadership bill, that is simply not true \ncompetition. Accordingly, the CBO score of any such approach will be \nextraordinarily high.\n  Some have suggested a dual system, with competitive and non-\ncompetitive plans operating side-by-side. Unfortunately, CBO has made \nit clear that it would give such dual systems the same high score as a \ntotally non-competitive system, because all plans would choose to be \nnon-competitive. A dual system simply doesn't achieve cost containment \nand is also flawed because it is government run.\n  Our tripartisan drug plan is a voluntary and permanent program. It \ndoes not sunset like the Graham bill. In addition, all Medicare \nbeneficiaries may participate--those in traditional Medicare, \nMedicare+Choice or the new enhanced Medicare fee-for-service program.\n  The monthly premiums are $24 per month, which is the lowest premium \namount of any drug plan that has been introduced in the Congress, and \none that I think would be more acceptable to our people out there \nrather than causing us to run into the difficulties we had when we had \nto repeal the catastrophic bill a number of years ago.\n  The deductible will be $250 and the beneficiary coinsurance, except \nfor the low-income seniors, is 50 percent once they reach the \ndeductible and up to $3450 in drug expenditures. Our drug plans are \nbased on actuarial equivalence, which means that we permit Medicare \ndrug coverage to respond to consumers' demands. These actuarial \nequivalent plans will meet consumers' needs. The Government will \ndetermine which plans are actuarially equivalent, and, CBO has \ndetermined that the five standards that the plans must meet in order to \nbe actuarial equivalent reduces a lot of variation between the standard \nbenefit.\n  The five standards for actuarial equivalence are:\n  No. 1, the Medicare benefits administrator must approve any \nactuarially equivalent coverage, and may terminate or disapprove any \nbenefit design intended to discourage enrollment of high risk \nindividuals.\n  No. 2, the actuarial coverage value of the total alternate coverage \nfor the entire benefit must be equal to the standard benefit.\n  No. 3, the unsubsidized value of alternate coverage must equal the \nunsubsidized value--that is, 35 percent which is subsidized--of the \nstandard coverage.\n  No. 4, the alternate coverage must be based on actuarially \nrepresentative patterns of utilization to provide payment, with respect \nto costs incurred that are equal to the initial coverage limit under \nthe standard benefit.\n  No. 5, catastrophic protection must equal the precise dollar amount, \nwhich is $3,700, the same as the standard benefit package.\n  So the arguments that our bill allows plans to raise the deductible \nto $500 or that our premium would be significantly higher than $24 per \nmonth are just wrong.\n  In 2005, when the drug plan is first established, Medicare \nbeneficiaries have a 7-month open enrollment period from April 1 \nthrough November 30.\n  Every senior would have a choice between two prescription drug plans, \nand that includes rural areas across the country. This is required by \nthe legislation, and the Congressional Budget Office agrees that there \nwill be two plans in each coverage area. These coverage areas could be \nnationwide but they must be, at minimum, at least the size of a State. \nBefore being offered to seniors, the drug plans must be certified by \nthe Department of Health and Human Services. Seniors will receive \ninformation about the available prescription drug plans each year \nbefore selecting their coverage.\n  The drug benefit begins in January 2005. CBO estimates that 93 \npercent of Medicare beneficiaries will participate in the Medicare \nprescription drug program, 6 percent will keep their current \nprescription drug coverage and 1 percent will not be eligible because \nthey do not participate in Medicare Part A and/or Part B.\n  An actuarially sound penalty would be imposed on seniors who decide \nto participate in the drug plan once the enrollment period is over. \nThis is almost identical to Senator Bob Graham's late enrollment \npenalty.\n  The Government will be covering 75 percent of the value of the \nMedicare drug benefit equaling $340 billion over the next 10 years, \nproviding a tremendous incentive for plans to participate. The \ntripartisan bill allows private sources of drug coverage to supplement \nthe new Government coverage by providing a strong base benefit--50 \npercent drug coverage after a $250 deductible up to $3,450 and price \ndiscounts on all drug purchases. The result is that 80 percent of \nbeneficiaries in 2005 will not have drug spending beyond that basic \nbenefit.\n\n  We also include low-income protections in our legislation by \nproviding low-income seniors with additional subsidies so they, too, \ncan afford to pay for their drugs. The tripartisan group's goal was to \nput an end to people having to choose between buying food and buying \ntheir medicine by providing additional help to those seniors who need \nit.\n  For example, the 10 million beneficiaries with incomes below 135 \npercent of poverty will have 80 to 95 percent of their prescription \ndrug costs covered by this plan with no monthly premiums. These seniors \nare exempt from the deductible and will pay well under $5 for their \nbrand name prescriptions and/or their generic prescriptions. And \nbeneficiaries at this income level who reach the catastrophic coverage \nlimit will have full protection against all drug costs with no \ncoinsurance.\n\n[[Page S7136]]\n\n  The 11.7 million lower income beneficiaries with incomes below 150 \npercent of the poverty level are also exempt from the $3,450 benefit \nlimit. Those beneficiaries between 135 percent and 150 percent of the \nFederal poverty level will also receive a more generous Federal subsidy \nthat, on average, lowers their monthly premium to anywhere between zero \nand $24 a month on a sliding scale. This also reduces their annual drug \nexpenses by more than half.\n  All other Medicare beneficiaries will have access to discounted \nprescriptions after reaching the $3,450 benefit limit, and the \ncritically important $3,700 catastrophic benefit, which protects \nseniors from high, out-of-pocket drug costs.\n  I now want to take some time to discuss the Medicare coverage \nprovisions in the tripartisan legislation.\n  Under our bill, we offer two choices for Medicare coverage, \ntraditional Medicare and a new, enhanced fee-for-service plan which \noffers benefits similar to those provided in private health insurance. \nMedicare beneficiaries may choose one or the other. If a beneficiary \nwishes to remain in traditional Medicare, he or she may do so. If a \nbeneficiary opts for the enhanced fee-for-service plan, then changes \nhis or her mind and wants to go back to traditional Medicare, that is \nfine, too. For the first year, beneficiaries may go back to traditional \nMedicare without a penalty. Afterward, an actuarially fair penalty will \nbe imposed on them for switching back and forth. This is similar to the \npenalties for late enrollment into the Medicare Part B program under \ncurrent law. But no one is stuck in one coverage plan. Beneficiaries \nmay change their minds and switch back to traditional Medicare if they \nare not happy with the enhanced fee-for-service plan.\n  Now, I would like to take just a few minutes to discuss the details \nof the new, enhanced fee-for-service option with my colleagues.\n  As far as enrollment is concerned, the rules for the enhanced fee-\nfor-service benefit, Medicare Part E, are modeled on current Medicare \nenrollment policies. Those who are already enrolled in Medicare Part A \nand Part B as of 2005 will stay in traditional Medicare unless they \ndecide to enroll in the enhanced fee-for-service option. Those who \nbecome eligible for Medicare in 2005 or later will automatically be \nenrolled in the enhanced fee-for-service option unless they indicate \nthat they want to be enrolled in the traditional Medicare program. All \nbeneficiaries will have a 7-month period to make their initial coverage \ndecision. This is similar to Medicare Part B.\n  In addition, beneficiaries will be given information about the \ncoverage options included under the enhanced fee-for-service option. \nThis information will compare the benefits under the traditional \nMedicare program to the benefits provided under the enhanced fee-for-\nservice option. That way, Medicare beneficiaries will be able to make a \ncoverage decision that really is best for them.\n  Benefits covered under the Medicare enhanced fee-for-service option \ninclude better hospital inpatient cost-sharing. Instead of the current \nextremely high Medicare Part A hospital deductible, which will be $920 \nin the year 2005, and high copayments for long hospital stays, the \nMedicare enhanced fee-for-service option offers a single hospital \ncopayment of $400 per admission. This is similar to the benefits \nprovided to individuals through private health insurance. In addition, \nit avoids penalizing those who are ill enough to have long hospital \nstays. It is also simpler and more rational than the current system and \nall other plans on the table, including the Graham plan. The enhanced \nfee-for-service option also replaces the current limits on hospital \ncoverage with 365 days per year, lifetime coverage.\n  I would like to give you an example of how this would work.\n  Beneficiaries who are hospitalized have to pay an extraordinarily \nhigh Part A deductible of $812 in 2002, rising to $920 in 2005. Unlike \nprivate health plans, Medicare today imposes its Part A cost-sharing \nper spell of illness, not per year. As a result, beneficiaries could be \nexposed to the deductible, copayments and coverage limits repeatedly in \na single year. I just don't think that is fair to the beneficiary who \nis a victim of frequent hospitalizations within a year.\n  Under current law, after the Part A deductible, $812 in 2002 per \nspell of illness, is satisfied, there are copayments for those who have \nlong hospital stays. In 2002, $0 for days 1 through 60; $203 per day \nfor days 61-90; $406 per day for days 91-150 this specific coverage, \nfor days 91 through 150, is available only once per lifetime.\n  In other words, Medicare provides no coverage at all for inpatient \ncare beyond 150 days per spell of illness. And, for additional \nhospitalizations after the first one per lifetime, inpatient hospital \ncoverage ends after the 90th day. Our enhanced fee for service option \nwould change that, once and for all. The $400 copayment per hospital \nadmission would replace both the Part A per spell of illness deductible \nand the copayments imposed on beneficiaries after being hospitalized \nlonger than 60 days.\n  As far as preventive benefits are concerned, for those who choose the \nenhanced fee-for-service option, preventive benefits would not be \nsubject to any deductibles or coinsurance. Currently, Medicare imposes \ndeductibles and coinsurance, usually around 20 percent, on most \npreventive benefits. We in the tripartisan group believe that the \ncurrent Medicare policy on preventive benefits makes beneficiaries \nreluctant to seek out preventive services that may identify health \nproblems and prevent more expensive care later.\n  Therefore, the enhanced fee-for-service option eliminates all \ncopayments and deductibles on Medicare preventive benefits.\n  The enhanced fee-for-service option also includes a unified \ndeductible of $300 per year for all services. Today, in the current \nMedicare program, the Part A deductible in 2002 is $812 per spell of \nillness. In 2005, it will be much higher, $920 per spell of illness, \nwhile the Medicare Part B deductible will still be only $100 per year.\n  The enhanced fee-for-service option offers seniors a choice: their \ncurrent coverage that emphasizes protection against relatively \npredictable and routine Part B costs, or new coverage that emphasizes \nprotection against unpredictable but potentially devastating Part A \ncosts in the event of serious illness. Seniors would have a choice, \nwhich they do not have today.\n  Medicare's irrational, two-deductible system is unheard of in private \ninsurance. Beneficiaries are used to a single deductible from their \nprior employer-based plans. It is true that in a given year, relatively \nfew beneficiaries use Part A hospital services.\n  However, the picture changes if one looks across multiple years. A \nrecent survey found that 17 percent of beneficiaries were hospitalized \neach year. Over a 6-year period, more than half, 56.4 percent, were \nhospitalized and 36 percent were hospitalized more than once. These \nhospitalizations may result in ruinously high out-of-pocket costs for \nseniors, and the enhanced fee-for-service option offers protection \nagainst such costs for those who choose this coverage plan.\n  In addition, the enhanced fee-for-service option would protect \nseniors with serious illness. Today, Medicare has no limit on a \nbeneficiary's out-of-pocket expenses in a year, creating the potential \nfor crippling costs in the event of serious illness. Our tripartisan \nbill would limit beneficiaries' exposure to out-of-pocket costs for \nMedicare-covered services, other than prescription drugs, to $6000 per \nyear. Beyond $6000, Medicare would pay 100 percent of any costs \nincurred by the beneficiary.\n\n  In a given year, it is estimated that 2 to 3 percent of Medicare \nbeneficiaries may have costs that reach $6000. If beneficiaries want \npeace of mind that would come from such catastrophic protections \nincluded in the enhanced fee-for-service option, they should have that \nchoice.\n  Contrary to popular belief, Medicare supplemental policies do not \noffer catastrophic protection. The standardized Medigap plans fill in \nthe cost-sharing in the existing Medicare benefit package, but they do \nnot offer serious illness protection. Since virtually all employer-\nsponsored health plans offer serious illness protection, it is \nsomething that many beneficiaries have come to expect.\n\n[[Page S7137]]\n\n  In addition to those with serious illnesses, this protection would \nalso benefit those with severe, chronic conditions, which are \ninadequately covered by Medicare today. All spending by or on behalf of \nthe beneficiary, including by third parties, such as Medicaid, \nemployers, or Medigap plans would count toward the serious illness \nthreshold of $6000. This differs from the drug benefit stop-loss \nbecause CBO indicated that counting only a beneficiary's own spending \ntoward the Part E limit would reduce participation in the enhanced fee \nfor service option a concern that CBO did not have about the drug \nbenefit in the tripartisan bill.\n  As far as home health benefits and skilled nursing facilities are \nconcerned, those who choose the enhanced fee for service option would \nhave to make home health copayments of $10 per visit, on only the first \nfive visits of a 60-day episode. A Medicare beneficiary would only have \nto pay $300 in home health copayments per year. Home health care is one \nof the only Medicare benefits for which there is no beneficiary cost-\nsharing. Medicare's average payment per home health care episode is \n$2300, so a maximum total copayment of $50 per episode would cover only \nabout 2 percent of the program costs, in contrast to the typical 20 \npercent cost-sharing on Medicare Part B benefits.\n  Both CBO and Med PAC indicate that even a modest copayment is \ncritical to making beneficiaries consider cost when deciding whether or \nnot to use home health care. CMS projects a 12 percent growth in home \nhealth care spending in 2003, even if the 15 percent cut scheduled in \ncurrent law takes place. Beneficiaries with serious enough conditions \nto need more than five visits per episode receive those additional \nvisits without additional cost-sharing. Those who cannot afford these \nmodest copayments are protected, because current law includes cost-\nsharing protections for the low-income beneficiaries, Medicaid eligible \nand QMBs are maintained.\n  For skilled nursing facilities, the enhanced fee for service option \nwould include a copayment of $60 per day for the first 100 days. Under \nMedicare today, beneficiaries currently pay copayments beginning on day \n21 of a skilled nursing facility stay. Medicare imposes no cost-sharing \nfor the early days of a skilled nursing facility stay, days 1 through \n20, and then Medicare imposes very high beneficiary cost-sharing for \nlonger stays. In 2005, when our bill goes into effect, those copayments \nwill be $115 per day for days 21 through 100.\n  As a result, Medicare's current skilled nursing facility cost-sharing \nunfairly penalizes those who are sick enough to need a longer stay, \nwhile allowing those who aren't as sick to have free days of care, with \nno incentive to consider costs. Influenced by the 20 days of free care, \nthen prohibitive cost-sharing policy, the average length of stay in a \nskilled nursing facility is approximately 24 to 26 days, according to \nCMS.\n  We believe that since skilled nursing facilities already collect \ncopayments beginning on day 21 of the beneficiary's stay, these \nfacilities will already have administrative structures for cost sharing \nin place.\n  To be honest, I am not enthusiastic about imposing home health or \nskilled nursing facilities copayments on Medicare beneficiaries. But, \nas I said earlier, this legislation required a lot of give and take \nfrom all of us. If Medicare beneficiaries do not want to make home \nhealth or skilled nursing facility copayments, they may stay in the \ntraditional Medicare program. If they go into the enhanced fee for \nservice option and don't like the coverage because they end up having \nto make copayments for home health care or skilled nursing facilities, \nthey may switch back to traditional Medicare. It is that simple. We are \nnot imposing copayments on anyone who does not want them. The enhanced \nfee for service option is just that a coverage option.\n  These are some of the key elements of the new, Medicare enhanced fee \nfor service option that our bill will provide to Medicare \nbeneficiaries. I hope that my explanation cleared up any questions that \nmy colleagues may have had on this component of the tripartisan bill.\n  Our tripartisan bill also includes provisions concerning the \nMedicare+Choice program. In 2005, our legislation takes modest steps to \nimprove Medicare+Choice plan participation by introducing a competitive \nbidding system under which the plans will compete with each other, but \nnot with the government-run, fee-for-service program, for \nbeneficiaries. This competitive approach to Medicare+Choice payments, \nbased on a bipartisan model supported by the Clinton administration, \nwill result in fairer and more accurate payments to plans. Today's \nbureaucratic pricing system sets arbitrary and inaccurate rates that \ndiscourage plan participation.\n  At this point, I would like to take a few minutes to rebut some of \nthe arguments my friend and colleague Senator Kennedy made against our \nbill last week on the Senate floor. He obviously has not read our bill \nvery carefully. I wish he had taken the time to read the tripartisan \nlegislation before making statements that were not completely true on \nthe Senate floor about our bill. Now, there is some confusion about our \nbill and I would like to set the record straight, once and for all.\n  First, Senator Kennedy criticized our plan's assets test for low-\nincome beneficiaries. Our tripartisan plan provides additional \nsubsidies for low-income seniors which everyone agrees is only fair. I \nbelieve I am correct in saying that everyone, on both sides of the \naisle, believes that additional subsides for our low-income seniors is \ncompletely justified. My good friend is trying to make it appear that \nwe are picking and choosing which seniors would be eligible for this \nadditional assistance. Nothing is further from the truth.\n  I want to be clear that we have done nothing different on this issue \nthan what has been the accepted practice and policy for many years when \nit comes to programs that provide assistance to those with lesser \nmeans. In fact, the tripartisan bill adopted an assets test similar to \nthe Medicare bill proposed by President Clinton in 1999.\n  Under current law, Medicaid includes an assets test. States have the \nflexibility to waive the assets test at their discretion.\n  Our tripartisan proposal ensures that the flexibility found in \ncurrent law is retained in the Medicare drug benefit program. The \nassets test ensures the seniors who need the most assistance are \nprovided with the most protection. We want to provide the most generous \nassistance to those who truly need it.\n  Also, let me clarify that current law specifically excludes from the \nassets test an individual's home and its land; household goods; \npersonal effects, including automobiles; the value of any burial space; \nand other essential property. So I hope this clarifies any questions \nthat Senators may have had on the tripartisan proposal's assets test. \nHopefully, I have made it clear to my colleagues that the tripartisan \nbill adopted a widely accept and common practice for determining which \nlower income seniors are eligible for higher subsidy for their \nprescription drug benefits.\n  Another issue raised by my good friend, Senator Kennedy, is the \ndesign of the tripartisan proposal's prescription drug benefit. He \nwanted to know how our prescription drug benefit design permits \ncreation of competitive plans that would provide quality coverage to \nall Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Let me explain why we took this approach. First, we believe that \nMedicare beneficiaries deserve a quality drug benefit that meets their \nindividual needs. The Graham-Miller proposal does not allow any \nvariation in cost-sharing or premiums and is a ``one-size-fits-all'' \nplan which, in my opinion, will fail to address the individual \nprescription drug needs of seniors.\n  So, with that in mind, it is important that Medicare beneficiaries \nare provided a quality drug benefit at an affordable price. Our \ntripartisan plan strikes the right balance to give Medicare \nbeneficiaries access to prescription drugs they need at the lowest \npossible price. Any plan that wants to offer a Medicare drug benefit \nwill be required to receive the approval of HHS according to strict \nstandards specified in law. This approval process will be an \ninteraction between any prospective plan and the Federal Government to \nensure that Medicare enrollees receive the best quality coverage \npossible at an affordable price.\n  There are five strict standards of actuarial equivalence in our bill \nwhich\n\n[[Page S7138]]\n\nthe CMS Administrator is required to certify that a plan meets before \nthe plan is offered to Medicare beneficiaries. The plans themselves \nwill not be determining what is actuarially equivalent; only the \nFederal Government will make that determination. If the Government \ndetermines that a plan is not equivalent to the standard benefit, its \nproposal will be rejected and it will not be permitted to participate \nin the Medicare drug benefit. End of Story. In fact, CBO has told us \nthat our standards of equivalence are strict enough that Medicare Drug \nPlans will have little room to vary premiums or cost-sharing. That \nlittle room to allow some variation, however, is critical to the \nsuccess of a Medicare prescription drug benefit.\n  Under the Graham-Miller bill, Medicare drug plans operating in the \nsame area will be forced to charge the same monthly premium and the \nsame cost-sharing. While Senator Graham claims that his proposal \nincludes competition, I do not understand how Medicare plans will \ncompete if they are required to offer identical premiums and identical \ncost-sharing across the country. If drug plans wanted to lower their \ncost-sharing or lower their premium in order to attract Medicare \nenrollees, Congress would have to pass legislation.\n  On the other hand, the tripartisan bill ensures that the innovation \nof the private sector is not stifled by a micromanaged, ``one-size-\nfits-all'' drug benefit run by the Federal Government.\n  Another issue raised by my friend Senator Kennedy is whether or not \nthe prescription drug benefit under our proposal guarantees that \nseniors will have access to benefits. Let me assure you that if this \nwere not true, I would not be standing here today, speaking in favor of \nthis legislation.\n  Let me clarify that the tripartisan bill guarantees two Medicare \nprescription drug plans to every Medicare beneficiary. If the \nbeneficiary lives in an area where there are Medicare+Choice plans, \nthen even more choice will be available as the presence of drug \ncoverage under Medicare+Choice does not count as one of the two choices \nthat would be guaranteed in law under our plan.\n  The Medicare prescription drug plans are not determining their own \nservice areas. The Federal Government will make that determination. And \nlet me emphasize that the service areas must be--at a minimum--the size \nof a state. The government will be covering 75 percent of the value of \nthe Medicare drug benefit equaling $340 billion over the next 10 years.\n  The last issue that my good friend from Massachusetts raised is \nwhether or not employers will be encouraged to continue to provide \nretiree health benefits with prescription drug coverage. I believe that \nwe have worked hard to protect both employers and retirees on this \nissue. The tripartisan bill provides employers the same full subsidy to \noffer drug benefits to their retirees as any other qualified provider \nof prescription drug benefits.\n  The Graham-Miller legislation provides a disincentive for employers \nto continue offering retiree health coverage for prescription drugs by \ngiving employers only two-thirds of the value of the government drug \nbenefit to retain their retiree coverage. So in other words, the \nGraham-Miller plan would encourage employers to end their coverage of \nprescription drugs in order to encourage their retirees to enroll in \nthe Government plan and receive the full Government subsidy.\n  I do not understand how my friend can make the argument that our plan \nis bad for employers. Currently, employers receive no assistance \nwhatsoever in paying for drug costs for their retirees. Employers today \nare paying the full price and taking all of the risk for covering \nretiree prescription drug costs.\n  The subsidy policy in the tripartisan proposal will allow employers \nwho are offering a drug--benefit at least as generous as the standard \nbenefit--to receive the full value of the standard benefit.\n  Again, our policy targets dollars where they might do the most good, \nand our employer subsidies recognize the value of employer-sponsored \nretiree drug coverage.\n  I would like to take some time to share my thoughts on the Graham-\nMiller Medicare outpatient prescription drug amendment which was \noffered at the end of last week.\n  As I have said throughout this debate, Senator Graham deserves a lot \nof credit for his hard work and dedication to this issue. His staff, \ntoo, has worked long and hard on this issue. Senator Graham, like those \nof us in the Senate tripartisan group, has the same goal--to pass \nMedicare prescription drug legislation into law this year.\n  I have had a chance to review Senator Graham's amendment over the \nweekend and I would like to raise some issues regarding his new \nlegislation. I understand that the Congressional Budget Office has \nscored his legislation as costing close to $600 billion over 10 years. \nWhile Graham says that any potential saving from the underlying \nlegislation should be counted against the cost of his amendment, I \ndisagree. We do not know whether or not the underlying bill will be \napproved as proposed, amended or defeated altogether. Therefore, we \nobviously cannot assume any savings from that bill when discussing \neither Medicare prescription drug amendment--the Graham amendment or \nthe tripartisan amendment.\n  Quite honestly, I am still extremely worried about the expense of the \nGraham-Miller legislation. In fact, I believe that the true 10 year \ncost of the Graham-Miller drug benefit could be closer to $1 trillion.\n  Another concern is that this bill is not a permanent program. It \nsunsets after 2010 and, quite frankly, I believe that having a sunset \nin such an important bill just to get a decent score from CBO is \nfiscally irresponsible. The way I read the Graham-Miller bill, it is a \ntemporary benefit, which lasts for 6 years. On page 78 and 79 of the \nGraham-Miller amendment, it states that ``no obligations shall be \nincurred . . . and no amounts expended, for expenses incurred for \nproviding coverage of covered outpatient drugs after December 31, \n2010.'' That is a mouthful to read. But the translation from \nGovernment-speak is simple: no funding at all, zero, for the Medicare \ndrug benefit after 2010.\n  I also read in the Graham-Miller bill that there is an attempt to \nprovide prescription drug coverage after the Medicare prescription drug \nprogram sunsets. On page 79, the amendment states that ``the Secretary \nshall make payments on or after January 1, 2001, for expenses incurred \nto the extent such expenses were incurred for providing coverage of \ncovered outpatient drugs prior to such date.''\n  I think what the sponsor of this legislation is attempting to do, \nalthough I am really not sure, is say if there is additional, left-over \nmoney from the drug benefit, that money may be used to provide drug \ncoverage after December 31, 2010. That language is very confusing to \nme. Like I said the other night, it seems more like window dressing to \nme than an actual extension of the sunset.\n  I am interested in Senator Graham's comments on this specific \nprovision and the broader issue of why he and his bill cosponsors \nbelieve that a sunset is necessary in the first place. I just think it \nis plain wrong to give Medicare beneficiaries a Medicare drug benefit \nand then take it away six years later. I cannot believe that the AARP \nwould actually tell its members to call their members of Congress to \nexpress support for this bill. I cannot figure out how a temporary \nMedicare drug benefit helps seniors in the long run.\n\n  Another serious concern I have about the Graham-Miller legislation is \nthat the drug benefit is run by the Federal Government. I do not think \nit is a good idea to let the Government set the price for drugs which \nis exactly what will happen if the Graham-Miller bill becomes law. And \nthat will be catastrophic, in my opinion.\n  The Graham-Miller bill has a one-size-fits-all drug plan that is \noffered to Medicare beneficiaries. That approach will lead us down a \ndangerous path. I have said this more than once but I am going to say \nit again, before you know it, the Federal Government, not the private \nmarket, will be setting drug prices, mark my words. And I do not \nbelieve it is a good idea for the federal government to be making \ncoverage decisions for seniors--I trust senior citizens to make their \nown decisions about their health coverage. Apparently, the authors of \nthe Graham-Miller bill do not agree and that is why they put the \nGovernment in charge.\n\n[[Page S7139]]\n\n  If you do not believe me, read the language on page 41 of the bill. \nIt states that if only one drug plan meets all the conditions set by \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Secretary can set \nany conditions he pleases, then the Secretary can simply decide that \nMedicare beneficiaries will get coverage through that one prescription \ndrug plan. Period.\n  And while there are laws to protect Medicare beneficiaries, and in \nfact all Americans, against the government doing something that \narbitrary, the bill waives all of those laws. Let me summarize for my \ncolleagues what is included in the Graham-Miller legislation on this \ntopic.\n  Page 42, line 18 through 21 reads as follows:\n\n       In awarding contracts under this part, the Secretary may \n     waive conflict of interest laws generally applicable to \n     federal acquisitions * * * \n\n  In other words, not only is there no judicial or administrative \nreview of the Secretary's decisions allowed at all, but even the \nGovernment's conflict of interest laws are waived.\n  The other primary difference between the Graham-Miller bill and our \ntripartisan bill is that we include reforms to the Medicare program and \nthey do not. Keep in mind our bill is $370 billion in contrast to their \nproposed $600 billion bill. The current Medicare benefit package was \nestablished in 1965. While the benefits package has been modified \noccasionally, it now differs significantly from the benefits offered to \nthose in private health plans.\n  We need to give seniors choices concerning their health care \ncoverage. It is extremely unfortunate that the Graham-Miller bill does \nnot recognize that the Medicare program needs to be improved so seniors \ncan have similar benefits offered by private health insurance. There is \nnothing in the Graham-Miller bill to improve the Medicare program. It \njust tacks on a prescription drug program and ignores the larger \nproblem--the overall Medicare benefits package which is outdated and \ninefficient. Medicare beneficiaries, in my opinion, deserve better. We \ndo not shove the larger issue under the rug in our bill.\n  Another serious concern I have about the Graham-Miller legislation is \nthat only two brand-name drugs are covered in each therapeutic drug \nclass, and, plans are permitted to cover just one drug.\n  For all other drugs, ``the beneficiary shall be responsible for the \nnegotiated price of the treatment'' which means in plain English, no \ncoverage at all.\n  Let me give an example.\n  Let's say Bob, a Medicare beneficiary in his early 70s, takes Mevacor \nto lower his cholesterol. His new Government prescription drug plan \nonly covers Lipitor.\n  Bob's wife, Bev, takes Celebrex for her arthritis. Her Government \ndrug plan only covers prescription strength Advil.\n  What happens to Bob and Bev? They are both out of luck because their \nGovernment drug plan does not cover the prescription drugs that they \nhave been taking for their chronic health conditions.\n  Even worse, according to CBO, the Graham bill does not lower drug \nprices for drugs that are not covered. Unless a beneficiary is awfully \nlucky to be on the one or at most two brand name drugs that the \ngovernment plan decides to cover, he or she will get nothing.\n  I think of people suffering from depression. There are a number of \nantidepressant drugs, and they all work in just a little bit different \nway. Where Prozac may not work, Zoloft might, or Paxil might work, or \nsome other antidepressant drug. Why should they be limited to only two \ndrugs when the two they are limited to might not be helpful to them? It \njust does not make sense to me.\n  If a Medicare beneficiary believes that he or she needs a specific \nprescription drug, not the one or two drugs that the Government plan \ndecides to cover, the beneficiary may be able to get coverage if the \nbeneficiary and his or her physician go through a ``medical necessity'' \ncertification process. This certification process is then followed by \nan internal and external appeals process--and guess what--all run by \nthe Government.\n  I simply do not believe that Medicare beneficiaries want the \nGovernment to make drug coverage decisions for them. Supporters of the \nGraham-Miller legislation say, ``Don't worry, trust the Government, you \nwill have choices of drug coverage.'' Tell that to Bob and Bev who will \nnot have their prescriptions covered through this Government-run plan \nor to somebody suffering from depressive illness where the two drugs \nthat are in the Government plan are not the ones that help them. Or in \nany number of other illustrations where you have a whole variety of \ndrugs but you are limited to two. When the Government says ``trust \nus,'' it is time to pay attention.\n  In addition, the way I read the Graham-Miller legislation, the \nSecretary of HHS is given the authority not only to decide what \nconstitutes therapeutic classes but also the ability to determine when \nsuch a drug fits into such a class. I do not understand why the \nsponsors of this legislation believe the Secretary of HHS should be \nmaking such important decisions. In addition, why should the Secretary \nof HHS, instead of physicians and pharmacists, be given authority to \ndecide what constitutes preferred and non-preferred classes of drugs \nand, on top of that, determine when a particular brand name drug fits \ninto such a class? It does not make any sense.\n  Because the Graham-Miller amendment now does not cover non-preferred \ndrugs, at all, I am deeply concerned about the impact this could have \non Medicare beneficiaries with cancer or AIDS or other chronic \nillnesses that require many prescriptions. I have a feeling that people \nwith chronic or terminal illnesses will be getting the short end of the \nstick if the Graham-Miller bill is signed into law.\n  Furthermore, how are the doctors, who may know that one drug may be \nmuch more beneficial than another drug, protected? How are the doctors \nprotected from medical liability under those circumstances? Already we \nare finding that obstetricians in Nevada can no longer get insurance \ncoverage for medical malpractice, and that is going to happen all over \nthe country if they do not watch it because litigation is driving these \ncosts higher and higher.\n  If a doctor cannot prescribe what is necessary for the patient, that \ndoctor is subject to medical liability even though the Government is \nthe one dictating what two drugs should be provided. By the way, that \nis under the Graham-Miller bill.\n  These issues that I have raised about the Graham-Miller should have \nbeen debated by the Finance Committee. Who knows, maybe we could have \ncome to the same resolution, but I doubt it. We could have come to some \nresolution and it would be better than what is in the Graham-Miller \nbill. Maybe the authors of the tripartisan bill and the Graham-Miller \nbill could have come to the same agreement through the committee markup \nprocess. Maybe not. Sadly, we will never know because politics, not \npolicy, is more important.\n  Last Thursday night, I asked what happened to the bipartisan spirit \nthat we all talked about at the beginning of the Congress. This \nlegislation is not being considered in a bipartisan manner and, in \nfact, the way this entire debate has been handled has really created \nsome hard feelings, especially among members of the Senate Finance \nCommittee. Why are we on the floor debating a bill that will affect the \nlives of millions of Medicare beneficiaries and millions of future \nbeneficiaries without a Finance Committee markup? I do not understand \nwhy members of the Finance Committee were completely excluded from the \nprocess other than whatever little they can do on the Senate floor.\n  I want to do everything I can to pass a Medicare prescription drug \nbill into law this year. But it appears that election year politics are \nmore important than passing a well-thought out prescription drug bill.\n  I stand ready to work with my colleagues, like Senator Bob Graham, so \nthat we pass an affordable prescription drug benefit for our Medicare \nbeneficiaries this year. I think he and Senator Miller are trying to \nthe best they can, and I have respect for both of them, but I believe \ntheir bill falls far short of the tripartisan bill and has a lot less \nchance of bringing us together than the tripartisan bill does. I truly \nbelieve that we can work something out that will be approved by the \nSenate before we adjourn in the fall. This is an\n\n[[Page S7140]]\n\nimportant issue, too important to politicize so we should stop playing \npolitics, once and for all. Let the Finance Committee do its work so \nthe Senate can pass a Medicare prescription drug bill which can be \nsigned into law this year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The Senator from Hawaii is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Akaka pertaining to the introduction of S. 2767 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nMedicare Prescription Drug Discount and Security Act of 2002, \ncoauthored by myself and Senator Hagel with the help of Senator Gramm. \nThis legislation provides an overdue and much needed prescription drug \nbenefit to the Medicare Program.\n  We are going to be voting on two different bills tomorrow; following \nthat, we will be taking up our legislation. We bring this legislation \nto the attention of our colleagues. We need to offer a responsible \nsolution to make medicine more affordable for those seniors who need it \nthe most. This offers immediate help to our Nation's seniors in the \nform of a bill that is voluntary, reliable, and it gives seniors \noptions. It complements, rather than replaces, the private prescription \ndrug coverage that two-thirds of retirees have now.\n  Many seniors like their current prescription drug plans and should \nnot be forced to abandon them. The cost of prescription drugs is a \nmajor concern for many of my constituents, especially those who rely on \nonly their Social Security benefits for their total income.\n  Let's look at a typical senior. We will call her Mary. Mary has \nworked hard her entire life, makes $55,000 a year, and is about to \nretire in 2004--coincidentally, the same time our program goes into \neffect.\n  Mary has never been much of a saver, so she will be relying almost \nsolely on her monthly Social Security check to make ends meet. She can \nexpect to get about $1,300 per month in benefits. Mary has diabetes and \nhas to take six different prescription drugs every day to keep her \nhealthy. The total cost of these drugs per month comes to about $475, \nabout one-third of her income. Considering her other expenses, such as \nrent, food, and other monthly bills, Mary needs some help paying for \nher prescription drugs. The bottom line is Mary should never have to \ncompromise her health by having to choose between buying prescription \ndrugs or buying food for her table.\n  Our legislation provides immediate, affordable, and permanent help so \nthat seniors like Mary never have to make that choice. This legislation \nhas two parts:\n  First, all seniors would be protected from unlimited out-of-pocket \ndrug expenses by instituting caps on their private expenditures. Once \nthose caps are reached, the Federal Government would step in and cover \nthe rest of the cost, minus a small copayment.\n  Second, all non-Medicaid seniors could enroll in a discount drug card \nprogram that would give them access to privately negotiated discounts \non prescription drugs.\n  Let me now focus on the heart of our plan which protects seniors from \nunlimited out-of-pocket expenses, with the greatest protection going to \nthose who need it most. Negotiated discounts on prescription drugs \nwould be worked out through the private market, while Medicare would \npay for drug costs after out-of-pocket expenditure caps have been met. \nThis means, to our friend Mary, saving hundreds, possibly thousands, of \ndollars every year on prescription drug costs.\n  In this chart, we see how our plan works as far as the various income \ncategories are concerned. Mary fits in the category below 200 percent \nof poverty. For an individual who makes less than $17,720 a year, which \nis about 50 percent of the senior population today, we cap their out-\nof-pocket expenses at $1,500. After they have paid $1,500 out-of-\npocket, the Government will then pay for the rest of their prescription \ndrug expenses.\n  Now remember, before they even start paying toward that cap, they \nhave the prescription drug discount card. That saves them money, as \nwell, on their prescriptions.\n  Continuing with the catastrophic coverage, if an individual's income \nis between 200 percent and 400 percent of poverty, they are capped at \n$3,500. If their income is between 400 percent and 600 percent of \npoverty, they are capped at $5,500. For seniors above 600 percent of \npoverty, individuals would be covered after they pay what is equal to \n20 percent of their annual income.\n  The Hagel-Ensign plan has no monthly premium. It was said earlier \nthat the tripartisan plan has the lowest monthly premium of any of the \nplans out there. Well, our plan has no monthly premium. What we do \nrequire is a $25 annual fee which is waived for those below 200 percent \nof poverty. Our $25 premium is used strictly for administrative costs.\n\n  Additionally, participants would also pay a small copayment of no \nmore than 10% per prescription after they reach their out-of-pocket \nlimit. We believe the copayment system is important because it not only \nkeeps costs low by forcing pharmaceutical benefit managers to compete \nfor business, but more importantly to the consumer, in this case the \nsenior buying prescription drugs, back into the accountability loop.\n  The second part of our plan, the discount drug card program, works \naccording to practical principles. According to a study conducted by \nthe Lewin Group, one of the country's most respected health care \nactuaries, this approach would achieve significant discounts from full \nretail price between 30 percent and 39 percent. Here is how it works:\n  First of all, the card is completely voluntary, for both seniors and \ndrug manufacturers. Drug manufacturers, through pharmacy benefit \nmanagers, would compete for business on the basis of their discounts \nand services, ultimately offering seniors the lowest price for their \nprescriptions. Seniors could choose from among any number of competing \ndrug card plans. If they became dissatisfied with their plan, they \ncould enroll in a different plan the following year. The Federal \nGovernment would not be fixing or negotiating prices for prescription \ndrugs. The program simply allows seniors, such as Mary, to receive the \nsame kind of privately negotiated discounts on drugs that are available \nto those enrolled in private health insurance plans.\n  Our plan also encourages the use of generic drugs whenever possible, \nin a couple of different ways. It requires the drug discount card \nissuer to include incentives in its program to use generic drugs \nwhenever possible.\n  Mr. President, could you remind me when there is about 3 minutes to \ngo?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. It also requires that each beneficiary who buys a drug \nthrough the discount card program be made aware of generic drug \nalternatives at the time they purchase the drug.\n  It is crucial to make prescription drugs affordable for seniors, \nwhich our program clearly does. However, it is also important to make \nsure Medicare's prescription drug program is affordable to the American \ntaxpayer, which our plan also does.\n  According to actuarial analysis, our proposal would cost \napproximately $150 billion over ten years. We are waiting for the final \nscore from CBO, but that is where we believe our plan will come in. \nThis is markedly less than any of the other plans out there, even the \ntripartisan plan. It is less than half of what the tripartisan plan \nwould be.\n  We must not only enact a responsible outpatient prescription drug \nprogram for our seniors, we must also do so without bankrupting the \noverall Medicare system.\n  Another reason our program is the best fit for seniors is that it \ntakes effect at the earliest date. Our program takes effect on January \n1, 2004, a full year earlier than any of the other plans. Our program \nis also permanent, unlike some of the other proposals which sunset \nafter a period of time. So, our plan is an immediate step that can be \ntaken to help seniors until comprehensive Medicare reform can be \nenacted.\n  I want to now compare our plan to the tripartisan plan and to the \nmajor\n\n[[Page S7141]]\n\nDemocrat plan that Senators Miller and Graham have proposed. These are \nreal life examples.\n  James is a 68-year-old, has an income of $16,000 per year, and is \nbeing treated for diabetes. He is taking these six different \nmedications. His total monthly costs for these prescription drugs are \naround $478. His total annual costs are more than $5,700. Under the \nGraham-Miller approach, James would pay $2,940 out of his pocket. Under \nthe tripartisan plan, he would pay $2,341.65 per year. Under the Hagel-\nEnsign plan, he would pay about $1,923.65 per year.\n\n  As you can see, the Hagel-Ensign proposal would save James over \n$1,000 annually when compared to the Graham-Miller proposal, and over \n$400 annually when compared to the tripartisan proposal.\n  Example No. 2: Doris is a 75-year-old, has an income of $17,000 per \nyear, and is being treated for diabetes, hypertension, and high \ncholesterol. She takes Lipitor, Glucophage, Insulin, Coumadin, and \nMonopril every day. Her monthly cost is about $300, or about $3,650 per \nyear.\n  Under the Graham-Miller proposal, her out-of-pocket expenses would be \n$2,220.00; under the tripartisan plan, $2,086.36; and under our plan, \nabout $1,714.84.\n  The Hagel-Ensign proposal would save Doris over $500 annually when \ncompared to the Graham-Miller proposal, and over $300 annually when \ncompared to the tripartisan proposal. For those who are the sickest, \nwho need the help the most, the Hagel-Ensign plan actually benefits \nthem more than any other plan.\n  In comparing our plan to others--just to point out what other people \nmay point out as a supposed weakness of our plan--for those who pay \n$1,000 or $1,200 per year for drug costs, the other plans will help \nthem more, and we readily admit that. But for a majority of the senior \npopulation who has high drug costs and needs help paying those costs, \nwe think our plan works best.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Betty is 66 years old, has an annual income of $15,500, \nand is being treated for breast cancer. She is still receiving low-dose \nradiation therapy and taking the following 6 medications: morphine \nsulfate, Paxil, Dexamethasone, Aciphex, Trimethobenzamide and Nolvadex. \nHer total monthly cost comes to around $670 and annually to about \n$8,000. Once again, to compare the plans with real life examples: under \nthe Graham-Miller approach, she will pay $3,180.00 per year; under the \ntripartisan plan, she will pay $2,570.00 per year; under our plan, she \nwill pay $2,152.00. So our plan is less, once again, than either of the \nother two major competing plans.\n  Under our bill, those who need it the most will get the most help. \nFor those moderate- and low-income seniors, our plan will benefit them \nthe most, and--we cannot emphasize this enough--our plan is the most \nresponsible to the taxpayer. We cannot afford to say to the young \npeople in America, you are going to be paying for this huge \nprescription drug program that probably will not be there for you in \nthe future, but you have to pay for it anyway. We have to think about \nthe next generation, so we must enact a plan that is fiscally \nresponsible.\n  Our proposal says that we are going to give seniors--those who truly \nneed it--the help that they need and ultimately deserve. But to the \ntaxpayer, we are also saying we are going to be responsible to you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time--how much time remains \nbetween now and 6 o'clock?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 92 minutes, the minority has \n50 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We have 90 minutes. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, tomorrow in the early afternoon the Senate will have \nan opportunity to vote on which vision is the best vision for our \nseniors and for others who need prescription drugs. This will be the \nfirst opportunity we have had in the Senate to take that vote.\n  The absence of a prescription drug benefit from the Medicare Program \nis a glaring failure of the Medicare Program that every family \nunderstands in America today. It is not the fact that we have not had \nprescription drug programs that have been advanced to the Senate--we \nhave. But they have been kept bottled up in the committees over the \nperiod of recent years.\n  I introduced, more than 5 years ago, prescription drug coverage into \nthe committee. It was referred to the Committee on Finance, and it \nnever saw the light of day.\n  We heard last week, and have heard now that somehow the majority \nleader has circumvented the Finance Committee and now we have the \nlegislation out here. I applaud his efforts. So should all seniors \napplaud those efforts. We hear now the committee was prepared to move--\nbut we waited and waited.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle had control of the Senate \nfor 4 of the last 5 years. They controlled the Finance Committee for 4 \nof the last 5 years, and we never had an opportunity to have a debate \non the issue of prescription drugs. Now we do. Now we will have a vote.\n\n  I think it is important for the American people to understand that we \nhave been denied that opportunity for the past 5 years. Now we will \nhave that opportunity. It is a tribute to leadership of Senator \nDaschle, who understands the importance of this issue to families in \nthis country. We are enormously grateful to him for his leadership, and \nwe are extremely hopeful that we will have a strong vote tomorrow that \nwill reflect what is in the best interests of our seniors.\n  I was here in 1965 when we actually passed Medicare. We passed \nphysicians' services and hospitalization but not prescription drugs. \nNow we all know that if the Medicare Program had been considered on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate, we would have included prescription drugs. It \nis as important as physicians' services and hospitalization. It is \nperhaps even more important in a number of different instances.\n  The fact remains that this is going to become even more important \nbecause we are now in the life sciences century. We are going to see \nextraordinary breakthroughs. We now see the mapping of the human genome \nand progress in so many important areas of research. It is virtually \nunlimited in what we will be able to achieve over a period of years.\n  It should be important to find ways of taking the progress being made \nin the labs and getting it to the patients who need it. They need it \ntoday. And we have a program that will do it.\n  I have listened with interest to those who support the Republican \nproposal, as they outlined at least what they consider to be the \nadvantages of the Republic proposal and the disadvantages of our \nproposal. I hope in the 50 minutes they have remaining today or in the \ntime prior to the vote tomorrow they will cite at least one, two, \nthree, or four senior citizen groups that support their program. \nBecause there are not any. Do we understand that? There are not any. \nThe senior citizen groups that know the importance of prescription \ndrugs have gone through these various programs in careful detail for \nthose they are representing. And do you know what? They endorse the \nGraham-Miller proposal. They are behind the Graham-Miller proposal. \nThey support it completely and wholeheartedly.\n  They appreciate the fact that our Republican friends over here are at \nleast giving lip service to a prescription drug program. But if we are \ntalking about which particular version is best for senior citizens, \nthere is no competition. There is no question about it. You never heard \nin the earlier claims this afternoon the senior citizen groups that \nsupport their program because they are not there. This is one of the \nkey reasons this is so important, and--I am hopeful--what this tomorrow \nvote is about.\n  I listened to my friend and colleague from Utah talk about premiums. \nOn page 26 of the Graham-Miller proposal, our premium is listed at $24; \nfor 2005, $25. I searched all weekend to find out where the $24 premium \nwas in their bill that they have been talking about for the past few \ndays. You can't find it in there. It is an estimate.\n\n[[Page S7142]]\n\n  Ours is printed right here. Every senior citizen knows what that \npremium is going to be.\n  Theirs is an estimate. They all say: We have one that is $24--lower \nthan the Miller program. But that is an estimate of what they are going \nto charge the insurance companies over a period of time. That is the \ndifference.\n  I want to take just a few minutes to review with our colleagues what \nthis program does not do and why the seniors have been so distressed \nabout their program.\n\n  Actually, between 2005 and 2012 the seniors in this country are going \nto spend $1.6 trillion on prescription drugs. Their program is $330 or \n$340 billion. It is a lot of money. But if you figure that out, that is \nonly about 20 cents on the dollar.\n  They are trying to say they are really going to be able to do \nsomething for the seniors. It just doesn't measure up.\n  I want to take a few moments of the Senate's time to go through the \nfacts of the program itself. This chart over here is the Republican \nprogram, and this line is the percent of seniors. The next line is the \ndrug costs; beneficiary payments; Medicare benefits; and then the \npercent of costs paid by the senior citizen. That is what we are \nconcerned about.\n  The fact is, to address the extraordinary escalation of the costs of \nprescription drugs, we have an underlying proposal which will create \nmomentum to get a handle on that escalation of prescription drugs--the \nexcellent proposal introduced by our colleagues, Senators Schumer and \nMcCain. It was reported out of our committee with bipartisan support, \nwhich we welcome.\n  But 18 percent of seniors spend $250; the beneficiary payments will \nbe $538. That is what they are going to pay in terms of their premium \nand their deductible in order to sign up for this program. For 18 \npercent of our senior citizens, they turn out to be losers, because 100 \npercent is going to be paid by senior citizens.\n  We take what the premiums are going to be, estimated by the \nRepublicans, and also add the deductibles and the copays. You have \nanother 18 percent that spend $1,000. Again, you add up the premium, \ndeductibles, and copays. It will be $913 and beneficiary payments of \n$87. The senior citizen, 91 percent--some help and assistance.\n  Together, 36 percent of all the seniors, and one part of them, are \ngoing to pay 100 percent. They are not going to get any help, and the \nother group will pay 91 percent of the cost.\n  You come down here to the $2,000. This is where you really begin to \nget some help. The seniors are still going to spend 71 percent. If you \ncome into the $3,000 to $4,000 range, 23 percent, they are going to be \nspending 67 percent.\n  Finally, 7 percent at the very high end. They will still be paying 74 \npercent.\n  These are the figures that are the expression of the program advanced \nby the Republicans. If you are a senior citizen and are hard-pressed \ntoday, you will find that your help and assistance in this program is a \nlot of rhetoric and very little action. That is what the result will \nbe.\n  This is why, perhaps more than any other reason, seniors do not \nsupport the Republican proposal. And there are features in the \nRepublican proposal that we find absolutely extraordinary.\n  I have heard a great deal from those on the Republican side talking \nabout how this is going to help really the poorest of the poor of the \nseniors. We know the extraordinary average income is maybe $14,000. You \ncan mention the handful of people who we read about who are \nbillionaires. But the fact is, when you are talking about a group of \nour fellow citizens, the people who fought in the wars and brought us \nthrough the Depression, you are talking about this group here--\nbasically, about $14,000 in income.\n  What is really in the Republican program are assets tests for the \nvery, very poor. We heard from the other side, well, if they really \nfall down to 135 percent of poverty, they are going to have their \npremiums taken care of, and they won't have to worry about anything \nelse. Right? Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. They will get them taken care of, if \nthey don't have anything more than $4,000 in savings because we have an \nassets test, a pauperization test, for our seniors.\n\n  If they have more than $2,000 in furniture and personal property--\nmaybe a wedding ring, an heirloom, something that has been passed on--\nif it is worth more than $2,000, they are in real trouble. If they have \nburial assets of more than $1,500, it counts against them, and if they \nhave a car worth more than $4,500.\n  What do we have for $4,500 for our seniors in our part of the world, \nthe Northeast, where it is cold in the wintertime; or how about in \nother parts of the country, where it is steaming hot in the summertime? \nDo we want them to risk their car breaking down, as they are trying to \nget their prescription drugs?\n  Go down to most of the car lots and find out what you can get for \n$4,500 and how dependable that car would be, whether you would want \nyour mother or grandmother riding around in it in the cold of the \nwinter or the heat of the summer, wondering if they can get to their \ndestination.\n  If there are any more of those values, it adds up. And when it hits \n$4,000, they are excluded from the program.\n  Think of the demeaning aspects of this for our senior citizens, who \nare part of the greatest generation, who fought in World War II and \nlifted this country out of the Depression. They are in their golden \nyears and have a few bucks--not very many--and they have to go down and \nfill out that form in order to qualify. It seems to me that is such a \ndemeaning requirement.\n  I am surprised. I am surprised that our Republican friends have \nincluded that--saving the few bucks that it would--in their particular \nprogram. I am deeply surprised.\n  Our seniors deserve much better treatment. There are ways of making \nan evaluation as to what the assets are. No one is talking about \ntrimming on this. We do not want people to trim--and they should not \ntrim--but there are better ways of doing it than this particular way.\n  Finally, because of the time, I will mention one other feature that I \nam very perplexed about. I do not understand why they developed this \nkind of program. Their program is going to effectively take 3.5 million \nsenior citizens who are now receiving a good drug program through their \nemployers and drop them back to this program, which will provide a \nlesser benefit than they are now receiving, by and large, from their \nemployers. This aspect of their program is very different from the \nGraham-Miller which would help and assist the small businesses and the \nmedium-sized businesses continue to fund a good program.\n  I yield myself 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. According to the CBO--this isn't our estimate; it is a \nCBO estimate--3.5 million seniors who are getting decent drug coverage \nthrough employers will be dropped from the list.\n  They wonder why the senior groups are not in support of this.\n  This is an enormously important debate and discussion that we will \nhave. We will have an opportunity to have an expression on the \nproposal. As Senator Graham and Senator Miller have pointed out, we \nhave what is called the first-dollar coverage. We do not have the \ndoughnut, the loophole, that exists there. It will be within the \nability of our seniors. It will be dependable. It will be affordable. \nIt will be reliable. And it will be built upon existing programs, \nprograms which have the confidence of our seniors and on which they can \nrely. It will be a very effective program. It will meet the kind of \nhuman needs that we believe our seniors need and deserve.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, before I yield to Senator Domenici, let me \nsay, I do not know where he is getting his figures. But we take care of \nlow-income senior citizens. We have 100 percent of subsidy for those \nunder 135 percent of poverty or less. For those up to 150 percent, that \nsubsidy ranges from 100 percent down to 75 percent. And everybody above \n150 percent has a subsidy of 75 percent.\n  On the assets test, they are not quite accurate. I will not go into \nthe differences right now. But we will go into them later.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. HATCH. No. I yield to the distinguished Senator from New Mexico.\n\n[[Page S7143]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. He does not choose to yield--on my time--to explain it?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to.\n  First of all, let's take the car benefit of $4,500. If it is \nnecessary for medicine or for daily use or for their job, they could \nown a Rolls Royce according to our bill. But the fact of the matter is, \nno car would be taken from them. Now, if it isn't essential for that, \nthen it would be limited to $4,500.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We are not talking about taking the car from them. We \nare talking about disqualifying them for all of the funds over $4,500.\n  Mr. HATCH. They would not be disqualified.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Excuse me, Senator. Excuse me, Senator. For money over \nthe $4,500--up to $4,000--the value of the car and above that, it works \nto disqualify them from the coverage.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the car is necessary for daily use, if it is necessary \nfor their job or if it is necessary for a medical purpose----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. What about personal property?\n  Mr. HATCH. For personal property, we have----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will go back. You yielded the time. I will go back. \nAnd I hope you have read your book because----\n  Mr. HATCH. I have read it. And you are misrepresenting what is in our \nbill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. You included the assets test. And it is just as I \nidentified it.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield? Senator Hatch, will you yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me----\n  Mr. GRAMM. Just 1 minute.\n  Mr. HATCH. One minute.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am a little bit perplexed. Senator Kennedy is going on \nand on about the assets test for Medicaid, when he helped write the \nbill.\n  I would say, Senator, if you are so unhappy about it, why did you \nwrite it that way?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Senator, I am trying to get it out.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Hold it. I am on my 1 minute.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. OK.\n  Mr. GRAMM. We are not talking about Medicaid here. The Senator is \ntalking about the assets test under Medicaid. I was not here when all \nthat happened. It seems to me that it is an interesting point to make, \nbut to suggest that has something to do with the Republican plan--it is \na wonderful speech, and I am sure everybody enjoyed it, but it has \nlittle to do with the subject we are talking about. It has little to do \nwith the Senator's plan. I am not for his plan, but I think to try to \nsay that somehow it is responsible for the assets test in Medicaid just \ndoesn't make any sense.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 1 minute.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it has everything to do with the Social \nSecurity Act, which none of us on the floor, except for Senator \nKennedy, I guess, had anything to do with.\n  Now, it is nice to moan and grown about these figures, but he is \nwrong.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on my time?\n  Mr. HATCH. On your time, I am happy to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator would refer to page 71, line 14, and I \nwould ask the Senator from Texas to refer to those as well: ``Meets the \nresource requirements described in 1905.'' That is the assets test, \nincluded in the prescription drug program which we will be voting on \ntomorrow.\n  Thankfully, we dropped that from the Graham proposal. It is in the \nRepublican proposal, that provision, on page 71, lines 14 and 15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I can see why some seniors would want a \ntrillion-dollar program--no question about it--as long as they think it \nis free. But it isn't going to be free. Neither is their program going \nto be free. We have to face some realities around here. Ours is $370 \nbillion. That is a lot of money. We do more with ours than they do with \ntheirs in their alleged $600 billion price tag. The fact of the matter \nis, that 75 percent of everybody's prescription drug coverage will be \ncovered by our bill.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator. If I can get through sooner, I \nwill.\n  First, I want to make sure everybody knows what bill I am talking \nabout. I hear the word ``Republican.'' I am for a bill that has as \ncosponsors Senator Breaux, who is a Democrat, Senator Jeffords, who is \nan Independent, and Senators Snowe, Hatch, and Grassley, who are \nRepublicans. That is the bill I am for, and that is the bill I am going \nto be talking about.\n  I rise as a cosponsor of the bill that is being called the 21st \nCentury Medicare Act, a bill which will provide our Nation's seniors \nwith a much needed prescription benefit. I believe this bill is the \nbest hope we have for enacting a prescription drug benefit into law \nthis year.\n  If there are those who do not want a law, because they do not think \nthey are going to get what they want this year, that is another \nstory. Either of the other two might suffice, but it won't become law.\n\n  This bill has a chance because it is similar yet less funding than \nthe House bill, similar in the way it is structured and the like. I \nbelieve it could get out of conference, and the seniors could have \nsomething that would be worthwhile.\n  It isn't the highest benefit, and certainly, if you are expressing a \nwish, you would like the highest benefit. But I would like to discuss \nwith you the fact that the seniors of this country are somewhat worried \nabout the young people who are going to be paying the bills for a long \ntime. They are somewhat concerned about whether we can afford at this \nparticular time the benefit that one party is talking about versus \nanother.\n  If we pass the bill I am talking about, I believe it will reach \nagreement in conference with the House and we can send it to the \nPresident. Then finally, after years of talking, our seniors will get a \nprescription drug benefit they need.\n  The tripartisan bill provides a generous prescription drug benefit \nthat will help all of our seniors with their drug costs. It does so in \na responsible manner. In the budget resolution I put together with \nother Members of the Senate last year, the only budget resolution \ncurrently in effect in the Senate--in other words, that is the budget \nresolution that assumes we can afford the things that are enumerated in \nit, Senators Grassley, Snowe, Gordon Smith, and others on that \ncommittee called the Committee of the Budget--set aside $300 billion \nover a 10-year period for Medicare modernization and a prescription \ndrug benefit. This $300 billion was to cover the period from 2002 until \n2011.\n  The tripartisan bill is estimated to cost about $370 billion over a \n10-year period from 2003 to 2012.\n  We are debating a prescription drug amendment with costs based on the \nCongressional Budget Office current projections. Yet we are enforcing \npoints of order from a budget resolution that is based on the \nCongressional Budget Office projections for last year.\n  Now, as we are all aware, the budget situation has changed \ndramatically over the past year. As a matter of fact, when we said it \nwill be prudent and good for America to spend $300 billion, we were in \nthe black. It was one of those years when we actually had money in the \nbank, were applying money to the debt, and it looked as if the American \neconomy and our fiscal policy would be sound and strong.\n  As I stand here and speak, we have gone from that position to a debt \nin the budget of $165 billion. It will be there for anywhere from 3 to \n5--maximum 8 or 9 years--if we do things right.\n  The attacks on our Nation, the war on terror, the economic slowdown \nhave all resulted in a reduction of these surplus projections. Yet the \nSenate leadership has been unwilling or unable to produce a budget \nresolution for this year; that is, the Democrats will have us operate, \nincluding passing a Medicare Program, without a budget.\n  We don't know, with an official stamp of approval, what the budget is \ngoing to look like for the next 8 or 10 years, but here we are passing \na Medicare Program that in one instance is two and a half times the \namount we said was fiscally prudent for all Americans, not just the \nseniors, just 2 years ago when we were running a budget that was in the \nblack.\n\n[[Page S7144]]\n\n  An updated budget resolution could have an update on our spending \nestimates, and we would be debating these prescription drug amendments \nto the current Medicare Program in a more honest and transparent way.\n  Last year during the debate on the budget resolution, every Senator \nin this Chamber voted for funding of either $300 billion or $311 \nbillion over 10 years. Those were the two chances to vote. They voted \non them, every single one. They said, with a better American fiscal \npolicy, they were more concerned about the future than they are now \nwith a debt, and they all voted on between 300 and 311. The Democrat \nproposal, I believe, is up around $600 billion.\n  I don't believe, had we been voting on a budget instead of saying we \ndon't need a budget, let's don't vote on one, had we been voting on \none, the Senate would have put a budget before us on Medicare that \nwould have been far less than $600 billion, if you are required to get \na majority of the Senators as you would on a budget.\n  Here again, it has worked to the American people's disadvantage. By \nnot having a budget resolution, we are probably going to overspend or \nwe are going to kill the chance to get a Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit package out of both Houses and before the President to sign.\n  From my standpoint, we can continue to argue and make like we are \ngoing to give the seniors the best program; that is, the most costly \none, not the middle of the road one which we can really afford, and \nthen we say, of course, the seniors want it. But if you presented to \nthe seniors of America all the other problems we have in the next \ndecade and asked them which they would want--do you want to say the one \njust for us or do you want to say one that would be good for everybody, \nI believe the triparty one before us will be good for everyone. But \nmost importantly, from the practical, not political standpoint, you \nwill get a prescription drug benefit program this year, effective next \nyear, under the plan that is before you that is called triparty. You \nwon't, if you proceed with the idea that the Democrats have the best \nplan and the bipartisan, triparty one should not be considered because \nit doesn't provide as much money.\n\n  I believe the seniors of this country want a plan that will pass, \nthat can become law now. I believe they want one that is good for \nAmerica, not just good for them. I believe they want one that is \nfiscally sound.\n  We are all worried about the American economy. The man who knows most \nabout it says the one thing we ought to be frightened about is spending \ntoo much money while we are in this rather fragile situation. Yet we \nare here arguing that the plan we ought to vote on is the one that \nspends the most money. It seems to me that the House will stand in the \nway of that program. The President won't have to pass on it, and we \nwill get nothing. We will have a vote. Those who are for the Democratic \nplan can go home and say: We voted for the most expensive one, the one \nwe think will give the seniors the most. Whether it ever becomes law or \nnot, we voted for it. We will put that up on a television screen. We \nvoted for it.\n  Somebody is going to be asking: What happened to the law? Well, it \nnever passed. Why didn't it pass? Because the House wouldn't approve \nit, because many Republicans and some Democrats wouldn't approve it. \nYou got nothing.\n  That is what I think the end product is going to be--nothing. We \nought to sit down and think about which plan would be adequate and \nwhich plan might, in fact, become law this coming year for the seniors.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  I remind my colleagues that the best chance we have had to give \nprescription drug benefits to seniors occurred on March 16, 1999. We \nhad a Bipartisan Commission on Medicare. John Breaux was the chairman \nof that Commission. We had set the Commission up by law. The leadership \nin the House and the Senate appointed members, and President Clinton \nappointed members. We met that day to vote on a plan that would have \nreformed Medicare.\n  One of the incentives to induce people to move out of the current \nMedicare system, where there are no incentives to contain cost, where \nMedicare pays for a walker three times as much as the Veterans \nAdministration pays--not an agency especially noted for its efficiency, \nwas to give them prescription drugs.\n  When the roll was called, the four Clinton appointees--Altman, Tyson, \nVladeck, and Watson--all voted no. And while we had a majority, 10 of \n17, to make an official recommendation, we had to have 11. On that day, \nMarch 16, our chance of modernizing Medicare and providing prescription \ndrugs died on a straight vote, where every Clinton appointee voted no.\n\n  Then we started a process of bidding. I really believe much of this \nis more about the next election than it is about Medicare and the next \ngeneration. I want to remind people of this bidding. I say to Senator \nHatch that the bill he supports would have outbid the Democrats last \nyear, but it will not outbid them this year.\n  In 1999, Bill Clinton said that if you gave him $168 billion, he \nwould provide a Medicare prescription drug program second to none. \nThen, in the year 2000, Senator Robb's bill bid that up to $242 \nbillion, and last year, the Baucus amendment to the budget called for \n$311 billion. I have quotes that go on for 4 pages, where every member \nof the Democrat leadership says: If you will give us $311 billion, we \ncan provide a fine prescription drug benefit. Now, this year, they are \nsaying that $370 billion--which we do not have--will not do it and that \nwhat is being offered by this tripartisan group is chintzy, when, in \nfact, it provides more money than the Democrats were asking for last \nyear.\n  This year, the Democrat's budget proposal provided $500 billion, and \nthe Graham-Kennedy plan--which doesn't start until 2004 and ends 7 \nyears later to try to hold down costs--costs up to $600 million. If you \nfunded it for the whole 10 years, it would almost certainly cost a \ntrillion dollars.\n  How did this cost explode? Well, it exploded because each year the \ntwo political parties bid against each other for votes, and the \nDemocrats are never outbid. As Senator Kennedy said, groups are for his \nplan because whatever it takes to get them to be for it is what he is \ngoing to offer. The current offer, on a 10-year basis, is really about \na trillion dollars. There is only one problem: We don't have any money.\n  Let me say this about the plan that has been offered by the \nDemocrats. Let me make it clear that this is Graham from Florida, not \nGramm from Texas. Currently, we are spending about 2 percent of gross \ndomestic product on Medicare. Because we have not reformed and \nmodernized Medicare and because its costs are exploding, by 2030 that \nnumber is going to be 4 percent. Under current law, we will have to \ndouble the payroll tax, from 15 percent of income to 30 percent of \nincome in 2030, to pay for Medicare and Social Security.\n  The Graham-Kennedy plan, which Senator Kennedy was talking about, \nwould raise that to 6 percent of gross domestic product and raise that \npayroll tax to a figure approaching 45 cents out of every dollar earned \nby every working American making a moderate income level. Does anybody \nreally believe that people can pay those taxes? I don't think so. But \nwhen Senator Kennedy is touting endorsements, those are not \nendorsements from people who are going to be paying for the program; \nthey are from organized groups that claim to represent people who are \ngoing to be benefitting from the program.\n  The Kennedy bill, when you have it for 10 years, is a trillion \ndollars. We don't have a penny, much less a trillion dollars, in terms \nof funding this new benefit. We are going to have to double the payroll \ntax to pay for the program we have right now. The tripartisan plan is \nsuperior to that program because the Kennedy plan relies on the same \ninefficient Medicare Program run by a bureaucracy that tries to hold \ndown cost with Government regulation. At least the tripartisan \nplan tries to bring in competition and efficiency.\n\n  The problem is, when you fill up this so-called donut in the \ntripartisan plan--where the government provides a\n\n[[Page S7145]]\n\nbenefit up to a point, and then there is a gap where you pay $1,850 \nalone, before you get the Government benefit again. When you fill all \nthat up, the tripartisan bill costs somewhere between $700 billion and \n$800 billion over a 10-year period. I think, in the end, that is \nunaffordable.\n  I am supporting the Hagel-Ensign bill for two reasons: One, we can \nafford it. It is within the budget we have, which is $300 billion. It \nis the only plan that is going to be offered where a budget point of \norder cannot be raised against it because it spends too much money. On \nthe other two plans, a budget point of order can and will be raised.\n  There is another point of order because it didn't come through the \nFinance Committee, but that was a decision made by the Democrat \nleadership to not bring it through the Finance Committee.\n  The second advantage of the Hagel-Ensign plan is it is efficient. It \nhelps the people who need the help most; that is, people with moderate \nincomes and very high drug bills. What the Hagel-Ensign bill basically \nsays is, after you spend roughly $100 a month, and you have a moderate \nincome, you are going to get Government help in buying your \npharmaceuticals, and you are going to then pay only a very nominal \ncopayment. That is help that people can understand. It doesn't start in \n2005; it starts sooner in 2004 and doesn't end in 2012, it goes on \nforever.\n  As your income goes up and you are able to pay more for \npharmaceuticals, the amount you have to spend before you get Government \nassistance goes up. That is a perfectly rational policy because what is \na crisis to one family is not a crisis to another.\n  Finally, immediately, under the Hagel-Ensign plan, you have a choice \namong companies with which you will contract that will go out and try \nto buy your pharmaceuticals at the lowest possible cost. Estimates have \nbeen made by outside groups that this, by itself, could cut \nprescription drug costs by as much as 40 percent.\n  So under the Hagel-Ensign plan, you have a plan that, A, is within \nbudget, costing less than $300 billion; and B, gives a lot of help to \nlow or moderate income people who have high drug bills. If you have \nhigher income and low drug bills, you don't get any help.\n  Senator Kennedy would say: But it doesn't help all Americans. That is \ntrue, it doesn't; it doesn't help all Americans. It will not help Gates \nor Perot, but they don't need help. It will help people with moderate \nincomes and very high drug bills, and those are the people we need to \nhelp.\n  Is the Chair telling me my time is up?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kennedy). Regrettably.\n  Mr. GRAMM. We are going to be in session next year, and we can build \non this beginning. I urge my colleagues, if the Kennedy bill does not \nget the budget point of order waived, and if the tripartisan bill \ndoesn't get the budget point of order waived, please look at the Hagel-\nEnsign bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Graham-Miller \nlegislation that is on the floor today. I note that Senator Daschle \ndeserves great credit. For years, many of us have been trying to bring \na prescription drug bill to the floor of the Senate, and we have been \nblocked. We would be blocked year after year if Senator Daschle had not \nbecome majority leader in the Senate this past year. We have an \nopportunity for a bipartisan debate and hopefully the successful \npassage of legislation will at last break the blockade that has been \nimposed against us for so long relative to providing prescription drugs \nunder Medicare.\n  I believe the contrast is absolutely stark between what we have an \nopportunity to pass in the Graham-Miller legislation versus what our \nfriends on the Republican side have been proposing as an alternative.\n  I think it profoundly says a great deal when we find out who are the \nsupporters of the legislation on our side versus who supports the \nlegislation of the other side of the aisle.\n  We are talking about an expansion of Medicare. We are not talking on \nour side about some form of privatization of the Medicare Program, some \nform of taxpayer subsidy to the insurance industry in the hopes that \nsomehow the insurance industry will come up with stand-alone \nprescription drug policies which they will then offer and somehow \npeople will find ways, then, to buy those policies.\n  We are talking about an actual strengthening of the Medicare system, \nan effort that is supported by AARP, by the National Committee for the \nPreservation of Social Security and Medicare, and by Families USA. \nSenior citizen groups across the board are in support of our \nlegislation.\n  Who supports the alternative? The pharmaceutical industry. What does \nthat tell you? What does that tell you about price control? What does \nthat tell you about who is going to benefit by these alternative pieces \nof legislation?\n  On our side, we are talking about a Medicare prescription drug \ncoverage with a defined benefit. Every American of Medicare eligibility \nage will know precisely what the premium is in a voluntary program. If \nthey choose to undertake this program--they certainly do not have to, \nbut if they choose to take this program, they will know precisely what \nthe premium is, they will know precisely what the benefit is, they will \nknow precisely how the program works, and it will not depend on whether \nthey live in Sioux Falls, SD, or Los Angeles or New York or anywhere \nelse.\n  Every American will have the same program, and it will not be \ndependent upon whether the insurance industry happened to decide to \ncome into their State or into their community. In my home State of \nSouth Dakota, the insurance companies increasingly are leaving the \nState and leaving people in very rural areas with too few options. That \nis not where we want to be with prescription drugs.\n  Every American deserves to have a strong Medicare Program, and I know \nthere are those on the other side who have ideological qualms. They do \nnot like the idea of more Government, so they would rather privatize \nMedicare and rather go in the direction of taxpayer subsidies to the \ninsurance industry to the applause of the pharmaceutical industry but \nnot to the applause of American seniors who want a stronger Medicare \nProgram as the underlying basis for prescription drug coverage.\n  We talk about whether this would contain prescription drug costs. In \nour underlying bill, we have the generic incentives and promotion which \nwill be enormously helpful. We have also passed by a large margin a \nvery closely monitored and controlled reimportation provision. Also \nwithin the underlying Graham-Miller bill under Medicare, there would be \nopportunities to negotiate and use the leverage of that huge population \nbase for negotiated prices, keeping in mind that the citizens of no \nother industrialized nation pay anything close to what American \ncitizens pay for the cost of prescription drugs.\n\n  If you go to Canada, Mexico, Britain, France, Scandinavia, or \nGermany, it does not matter, you pay less than half what American \ncitizens are expected to pay.\n  It is long overdue that we have a component in this prescription drug \nbill that not only affords every Medicare-eligible individual a cost-\neffective, efficient way of gaining prescription drugs, but it holds \nthose costs down and that, in fact, is why the pharmaceutical industry \nhas objected so much to what we are trying to do and is so supportive \nof what the other side is trying to do because they know that the \neffective way of cutting costs, which indeed comes from massive \nprofiteering that has been going on in recent years, will take place in \nour version. It will not take place in the version coming from the \nother side.\n  It always stuns me somewhat, I have to say, that those who talk about \nthe cost of these programs and who preach the loudest about fiscal \nresponsibility when it comes time to figure out how we can best serve \nthe Medicare-eligible citizens of our nation in the most effective and \nefficient way, do not seem to be bothered when it comes time to propose \nfollow-on tax cuts, primarily for the billionaires of this society, to \ncost in excess of what we are talking about for a Medicare drug \ncoverage program.\n\n[[Page S7146]]\n\n  It seems to me we have some priorities we need to sort out in this \ninstitution. We need to talk about how to effectively make sure that \nevery senior gets the drugs they need.\n  I talk to many, far too many, people as I go across my State of South \nDakota--one of the lowest per capita income States in the America--who \nliterally are choosing between groceries and prescription drugs. They \nare cutting pills in half and not renewing their prescriptions, and \nthen they show up in emergency rooms with an acute illness and the \ntaxpayer picks up the cost.\n  How much better for the long-term cost, how much better for the \ndignity of these people to keep them healthy in the first place with a \nprescription drug regime that they and their physician have chosen \nwhich can be secured through Medicare and not at the whim of the \ninsurance industry and not to the applause of the pharmaceutical \nindustry but to the applause of the senior citizens organizations. How \nmuch better would it be to follow that road in terms of the reforms we \nneed to be doing this week.\n  I know this is going to be a difficult debate because of the \nparliamentary rules that may require 60 votes to pass legislation. I do \nnot know if we have the 60 votes or not. It is certainly my hope that \nwe will because the problems this Nation faces, the problems that my \nsenior citizens in South Dakota face are not Republican or Democrat \nproblems. They transcend that. They are the problems of our entire \nsociety in my State and across this Nation. They deserve to be dealt \nwith aggressively and effectively, and we have that opportunity with \nthe Graham-Miller legislation and the underlying generic legislation \nbefore the Senate today.\n  Mr. President, there will be few more important votes in terms of \ndomestic policy that this Senate will take anytime during the 107th \nCongress. It is my hope that politics can be laid aside, that \nideological qualms about opposition to Medicare and Social Security \nthat some have can be set aside, and recognize that Medicare is, \nindeed, the commonsense vehicle for trying to address cost containment \nand access to prescription drugs in a uniform, consistent way across \nthis Nation; that opposition can be set aside, and we will, in fact, \nhave the bipartisan support this legislation deserves to have and that \nat long last the gridlock, the obstructionism that has gone on for so \nmany years can be broken and we can go home to our respective States at \nthe conclusion of this debate knowing that we have done the right \nthing; we have done the good thing.\n  I have always believed the best politics is good government; that is, \ndoing the right thing for people. If this body supports this underlying \nlegislation, it will be a cause of great celebration. Everyone can get \nwhatever credit they choose to have, but it will be the right thing for \nAmerica and the right thing for our seniors.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been listening to the comments of \nthe distinguished Senator from Massachusetts earlier and the \ndistinguished Senator from South Dakota. I mentioned in the early \ndebate, on the first day of debating these matters, the book ``The \nSystem,'' written by Haynes Johnson and David S. Broder. It is a \nfailure of the Clinton health care program in part.\n  It is very interesting what they say in this book. Neither Haynes \nJohnson nor David Broder would be considered leading conservative \nspokespeople.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator yielding himself time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, I am.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Such time as he may consume?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am.\n  Neither of them would be considered conservative journalists. This is \nwhat they wrote on page 90 of ``The System,'' which was published in \n1996:\n\n       In the campaign period, Fried recalled, Clinton's political \n     advisers focused mainly on the message that for ``the plain \n     folks, it's greed--greedy hospitals, greedy doctors, greedy \n     insurance companies. It was an us-versus-them issue, which \n     Clinton was extremely good at exploiting.''\n       Clinton's political consultants, Carville, Begala, \n     Grunwald, Greenberg, all thought ``there had to be \n     villains.'' Anne Wexler remembered, ``It was a very alarming \n     prospect for those of us looking long term at how to deal \n     with this issue. But at that point, the insurance companies \n     and the pharmaceutical companies became the enemy.\n\n  That is what is being done here today.\n  The main difference between the two programs is that ours lives \nwithin at least some budget constraints. It is more than what the \nDemocrats would have taken last year, $311 billion. This is $370 \nbillion. No. 2, we provide some element of private sector competition \nso there will be competition in this matter. That is driving costs \ndown. No. 3, we provide there will be a system that will work because \none can have more than one program instead of a one-size-fits-all \nprogram. No. 4, we are not going to get to price controls by the \nFederal Government, which would destabilize research and development of \npharmaceuticals in this country. To hear some people on the other side, \nit is the big bad pharmaceutical companies that are causing these \nproblems.\n  Actually, I think if we look at our system, both the generic and the \npioneer companies, the research companies, we have a pretty great \nsystem that is producing the greatest therapeutic drugs in the world \ntoday. The reason we do is that we do not have price controls.\n  Where is the pharmaceutical system in Canada? Where is it in many \nother parts of the world where they have price controls? They do not \nhave it. We do. We have the greatest system in the world.\n  I think Haynes Johnson and David Broder are right on: ``When you \ncannot win the debate, start knocking the big companies; speak for \n``the little people,'' as they have said. And this has been the tenor \nof this debate so far.\n  I frankly think we ought to talk about living within the budget, \ndoing the best we can, having a system that works, that has some \nelement of competition in it, that does not set price controls over \ndrugs so that it ruins our domestic companies and research and \ndevelopment plans, so we can ultimately get drugs into generic form so \nthat we can save money. That is what is really involved.\n  I yield such time as she may consume to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Maine, Ms. Snowe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. How much time is remaining, Mr. President, on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-two and a half minutes.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, first, I express my appreciation to the \nSenator from Utah, who has done a yeoman's effort on behalf of this \nlegislation, working in this past year to develop what has been known \nas the tripartisan legislation to develop a prescription drug benefit \nprogram.\n  I am pleased we are able to finally begin the debate on this most \ncritical issue. It is obviously a significant issue to seniors. I hope \neverybody understands that we, in attempts to draft this tripartisan \nlegislation, had hoped to avoid developing a polarizing and \npoliticizing of this issue before the Senate. I regret that the regular \nprocess of the committee has been bypassed because I think in so doing \nthere was an obvious attempt to try to avoid building the consensus \nthat is essential to passing this kind of legislation.\n  Obviously, through the disruption of this process, we are here today, \nand I hope this process does not give anybody the excuse or the \nrationale to vote against a prescription drug bill because I think in \nthe final analysis each of us will be accountable for our failure to do \nso in this institution.\n  We have a chance--just maybe this is our year--to pass a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit after all. There is only one plan thus far \nthat has bipartisan and tripartisan support. Senator Breaux, Senator \nJeffords, Senator Grassley, Senator Hatch, members of the Finance \nCommittee, and I began this effort more than a year ago in an attempt \nto draft a compromise proposal that bridges the differences between two \nsides in this debate, hoping to avoid the kind of scenario that has now \nunfolded on the floor. That is why we undertook this effort to craft \nthis tripartisan solution, when partisan differences threaten to \nundermine any possibility of enacting a prescription drug benefit. We \nbelieved then, as we do now, that as seniors cannot afford to put off \ntheir illnesses, we cannot put off a solution to this problem. So we\n\n[[Page S7147]]\n\ncrossed the political divide to develop an innovative program that \ncould become the basis for action.\n  As I said, we had hoped we could start that process within the \ncommittee that could give us the best hope for developing and forging a \nconsensus on this issue. We worked closely with the Congressional \nBudget Office for forecasting an accurate estimate of the cost of our \nlegislation, working hand in hand with them up until the final days in \nintroducing this legislation, to ensure that we had a stable, \nefficient, competitive program that would provide choices to the \nseniors in this country and at the same time give them the maximum \nbenefits under any kind of prescription drug benefit that we could \ninclude as part of the Medicare Program.\n  I have personally been working on this issue for the last 4 or 5 \nyears, imploring Members of this Senate to pass a prescription drug \nbenefit. It has been 4 long years. We have made some progress certainly \nin terms of estimating the cost and providing the type of \nappropriations that would be essential to supporting a generous \nprescription drug benefit.\n  In 1999, as a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I worked with \nSenator Domenici, Senator Wyden, and Senator Smith of Oregon to include \na reserve fund. At that time, then-President Clinton provided $28 \nbillion in his budget. We went further and provided $40 billion to set \naside for a prescription drug benefit over 5 years. Then we decided \nlast year we would go to $300 billion because the prescription drug \ncosts go up each and every year, as we well know. So on both sides of \nthe political aisle, there was agreement again and the Budget Committee \nset aside $300 billion for a reserve fund. It was also acknowledged \ntime and again in floor debate that $300 billion was where we needed to \nbe to provide strong coverage for seniors in Medicare for a \nprescription drug benefit.\n  So now we are at the stage of $370 billion, the tripartisan proposal, \nand approximately $600 billion in the proposal offered by Senator \nGraham from Florida.\n  Everybody recognizes we need to enact a prescription drug program as \npart of Medicare. It is long overdue. Frankly, I do not think there is \nany difficulty in developing the policy, if there is the political will \nto do it. That is the big question--whether we have the desire to enact \nthis kind of coverage for seniors in this country.\n  We have two competing plans. I hope we can avoid a process that is \ndesigned to create a political showdown. I hope we are not going to go \ndown that path this week, irrespective of the fact we have two votes \ntomorrow, one on each plan. Is that where it is going to end or is that \nwhere it is going to begin?\n  I hope this is not about this election. I hope it is for the \ndetermination to do what we ought to do, and that is to design a \nprogram for prescription drug benefit coverage. It will not happen \nwithout bipartisanship and tripartisanship. That is what we did through \nthe legislation we introduced and have been working on for more than a \nyear.\n  I would rather not spend my time talking about process. The process \nbecomes important when we bypass the conventional means of \nconsideration: Draft and amend legislation in order to create a \nconsensus on a bill before it reaches the floor; at least it attempts \nto do what was done on the tax bill last year. No one could have \npredicted what the outcome would be in the committee, let alone on the \nfloor, but it was through the amendment process, through debate and \ndeliberation that we finally reached a consensus that yielded the 62-38 \nvote.\n  We are in danger of not completing prescription drugs because of the \nprocess of cloaking political motives. We are looking at the procedural \ngymnastics that have occurred in this legislation. We could almost \nwrite the headlines: The Senate fails to muster 60 votes for a \nprescription drug plan; issue put off for another year.\n  Is that what Members want? I do not want the Senate described in \nthose terms. I do not want this issue put off another year. We have \nbeen putting it off year after year after year. I want to make headway, \nnot headlines. That is why it is important people understand what is \ngoing on. I am the last person who wants to talk about inside the \nbeltway gobbledygook, about the process. I am interested in talking \nabout the truth and what deserves our attention in terms of policy \ndifferences, not designing the next political stroke.\n  It is a disservice to the more than 40 million Medicare beneficiaries \nthat see their prescription drug costs rise every year to the tune of \n17 and 18 percent in annual costs just over the last 4 years. That is \nwhy we try to work on developing a middle ground approach and analyzing \nwhat could be the best plan, under the circumstances, to maximize the \nbenefit, particularly those in the low-income scale, from all ranges of \nthe political spectrum that could offer a comprehensive drug benefit \nthat is affordable, comprehensive and available to all seniors, that \nprovides the most in terms of benefits to low-income seniors and those \nespecially without drug coverage.\n  It must be a fully funded, permanent part of Medicare that does not \nthreaten the stability or the solvency of the Medicare Program for \nfuture generations. We offer in our plan the lowest premium of any plan \nintroduced, $24 a month. It provides a 75 percent Federal subsidy. That \nis more than Federal employees have under their current health care \ncoverage. That yields $340 billion in Federal support over the next 10 \nyears.\n  People suggest the private sector will not be engaged in this process \nwhen the Federal Government provides an overall 75 percent Federal \nsubsidy.\n  Seniors above 150 percent will see an annual savings on their \nprescription drugs of more than $1,600, which is a 53 percent savings. \nThose below 135 percent will see 98 percent savings on their \nprescription drugs. Ninety-nine percent of Medicare beneficiaries will \nbe covered under our program; 93 percent estimated by CBO will \nparticipate in this program, and 6 percent will remain with their \ncurrent coverage. That is extraordinary. Eighty percent will not even \nhit our benefit limit of $3,450.\n\n  We eliminate the so-called doughnut, the gap in coverage between the \n$3,450 benefit limit and catastrophic coverage of $3,700; 11.7 million \nbeneficiaries with incomes below 150 percent are exempt from the \nbenefit limit of $3,450. There are 10 million Medicare beneficiaries \nwith incomes under 135 percent who will see 80 to 98 percent of \nprescription drug costs covered by this plan with no monthly premium, \nno deductible, and have average coinsurance of $1 to $2 per \nprescription and will have no cost beyond the catastrophic level. All \nother enrollees above 150 percent of the income level will have access \nto discounted prescription drugs after reaching the $3,450 benefit \nlimit.\n  Everybody under Medicare will be protected against catastrophic \ncosts. The drug benefit will be offered by the private drug plans. They \naccept part of the risk for managing this prescription drug program \nwith the Federal Government accepting most of the risk. Seniors will \nhave clout. They can vote with their feet. If they do not like the \nplan, they can select another plan. We believe, and CBO agrees, that \nthe real competition will hold down drug costs and make this benefit \nmore affordable for seniors and taxpayers.\n  Creating a new prescription drug benefit is absolutely essential to \nbe part of our Medicare Program. AARP said in their testimony before \nthe Senate Finance Committee, we need to have a dependable drug plan. \nThat is exactly what we are providing. It is permanent and it is fully \nfunded. That is a big difference from a plan that is sunsetted. I do \nnot know how you explain to seniors in this country that the good news \nis you will have a prescription drug program starting in 2005, but the \nbad news is it expires in 2010. That is exactly the scenario \nestablished by the Graham-Daschle-Kennedy bill, which simply rides off \ninto the sunset. It certainly will not be a happy new year on December \n31, 2010 for any senior citizen who uses prescription drug coverage to \nlearn their benefit has disappeared over the horizon--it is gone.\n  Is that the kind of stability, certainty, and predictability we want \nto give our seniors when it comes to one of the most vital benefits we \ncould provide and need to provide?\n  You might wonder why it sunsets under the Graham legislation in 2010. \nThat is a very good question. The answer is because they ran out of \nmoney. They knew if they continued, the sticker shock of their plan and \nthe impact of their program, already facing\n\n[[Page S7148]]\n\nserious financial concerns, would cause more than a few to raise \nstrenuous objections because of the ultimate impact it could have on \nthe solvency of the Medicare Program.\n  Seniors have said they have two major priorities. One, they want to \nmake sure the program is universal; two, it has the lowest monthly \npremium and at the same time it does not affect the financial stability \nof the future for Medicare.\n  That is a question about the choice we have tomorrow. Are we serious \nabout providing a prescription drug benefit to seniors that will be \nsunsetted in 2010? That is a significant question that each Member must \naddress in casting his or her vote in the Senate with the two competing \nplans. The plan we have offered was consistent with the priorities of \nseniors in this country, indeed the priorities of AARP, the major \nrepresentative of seniors in America, that they wanted a dependable \nprescription drug benefit as part of Medicare. We offer it. It is fully \nfunded, and it is part of Medicare in perpetuity.\n\n  There are other problems we have to address when we are looking at \nthe Graham proposal. One is the issue of the nonpreferred drugs. In the \noriginal plan that was offered by Senator Graham, there were the \npreferred drugs and the nonpreferred drugs. In fact, the copayments are \nlower under our plan. For the top 50 preferred drugs, we have lower \ncopays under 39.\n  To put it the other way around the Graham proposal is higher on all \nbut 11 of the top 50 preferred drugs--higher in copayments.\n  In the original Graham plan, there were the nonpreferred drugs. \nAgain, we were lower in copayments in all categories except 1 out of \nthe top 50.\n  Now, under the newly revised plan, none of the nonpreferred drugs is \neven covered--none, not one.\n  You might ask, what does that mean? That means it won't be available \nfor seniors. That means, by virtue of the fact that the nonpreferred \ndrugs are not covered under the Graham-Daschle-Kennedy plan, they are \nnot going to be available to seniors. They will not have choices in the \ntypes of plans that include both the preferred and the nonpreferred. It \nmeans if your doctor prescribes a different brand prescription and it \nis not on the preferred list, you are out of luck because under Senator \nGraham's proposal they will cover generics and only two brand names in \nevery therapeutic category.\n  So here are a few examples of how the Government's strict limits on \ndrug coverage under the Graham-Daschle-Kennedy plan would interfere \nwith the drugs your doctor prescribes. The examples are taken from drug \nclasses in the ``Physicians Desk Reference'' explicitly described in \nthe bill as a model for determining the therapeutic classes in which \nonly one or, at most, two drugs will be covered.\n  Let's take high cholesterol as an example. If you take Advicor, \nBaycol, Colestid, Lipitor, Mevacor, Pravachol, Tricor, WelChol, Zocor, \nor other drugs to lower cholesterol, and the Government plan says \nLescol, you get no coverage at all. And even if you take Lescol XL, the \nmore convenient extended-release form, then you get no coverage at all.\n  What about treatment for arthritis? Well, if you take Bextra, \nCataflam, Celebrex, Clinoril, Feldene, Lodine, Lodine XL, Relafen, \nTolectin, Tolectin SR, Trilisate, Vioxx, Voltaren, or Voltaren-SR for \nyour arthritis, and the Government plan covers prescription-strength \nAdvil, then you get no coverage at all, none.\n  You have high blood pressure? Well, if you take Accupril, Adalat, \nAldoclor, Aldomet, Altace, Captopril, Cardizem, Cardura, Catapres, \nCorzide, Cozaar, Diovan, Diuril, Hyzaar, Lotensin, Maxzide, Minipress, \nNorvasc, Procardia, Tenormin, Toprol-XL, Univasc, Vasotec, Zebeta, \nZestril, or any of dozens of other effective medications for high blood \npressure that work best for you, and the Government plan covers \nAccuretic, then you get no coverage at all.\n  So it is far more restrictive than what the private sector offers \ntoday. Most private sector plans and the Federal employees plan would \nnever consider being so restrictive as to provide no coverage at all \nfor nonpreferred or off-formulary drugs. Moreover, to restrict covered \ndrugs to no more than two in each class of drugs--generally these plans \ndo the opposite, by providing some coverage for off-formulary drugs \nthrough tiered copays or off-formulary incentives.\n  What happens if I really need it? What happens if the doctor thinks \nthat is the only option, the only drug that is going to be best for \nyour treatment? It would require an explicit review and approval from \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services, right here in the plan that \nis offered by Senator Graham, in order for the Government plan to offer \na lower copayment or to provide coverage on additional drugs. Beyond \nthese strict limits, the Secretary must determine that it will not \nresult in an increase in expenditures by the Government.\n  Since when do we essentially decide we would rather have the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services writing prescriptions for \nAmerican seniors? But that is what this comes down to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Ms. SNOWE. I am delighted to yield to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator saying that they claim for $600 billion, \neven in a bill that is sunsetted so they can keep the cost that low, \nthat all of those drugs indicated on your chart in red letters ``not \ncovered'' are drugs they do not cover?\n  Ms. SNOWE. That is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. Yet in this $370 billion program that we have devised, all \nof those in yellow are covered?\n  Ms. SNOWE. That is correct. In fact, in our copays, on those that are \ncovered, the top 50, we are lower or, the converse, in Senator Graham's \nlegislation their copays will be higher in 39 out of the 50 categories \nin terms of copayments. Then in the nonpreferred drugs, they are not \neven covered, and they are covered under our legislation because plans \nwill be designed to include choices.\n  Mr. HATCH. I take it they are spending $600 billion or more--almost \ndouble what we spend--and not getting nearly the delivery of the drug \nas in the system we would give to the seniors. It seems to me it is \npretty tough to be for the $600 billion program under those \ncircumstances.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I would say to the Senator, that is correct. Obviously, \nthe Government is going to make the determinations in terms of the \ntypes of drugs to be used, but the legislation already starts off in a \nvery restrictive fashion. As a result, it will deny seniors their \nchoices--not to mention that the whole program sunsets in 2010.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to take a moment this afternoon to \nshare a part of a letter I received from an 84-year-old gentleman in my \nhome State of Washington. He writes to me:\n\n       My income is limited to Social Security and a small amount \n     of interest generated from the proceeds of the sale of my \n     home. That doesn't leave much for anything but the basics. \n     The highest of my monthly bills is for prescription drugs, \n     the cost of which has skyrocketed for the past few years. \n     Because Medicare provides nothing towards the exorbitant cost \n     of these drugs--which are mostly for my heart--I pay upwards \n     of $250 a month out of pocket.\n       If Congress does nothing else this coming session, please \n     let it be relief from the expense of the drugs I have to take \n     to survive.\n\n  That is why I rise today in support of Medicare prescription drug \nbenefits. This is an issue that Congress has talked about for years. It \nis a major challenge for seniors and the disabled every time they have \nto fill a prescription. And everyone agrees that we need to do \nsomething about it.\n  We have a bill that will address this problem in a responsible way, \nand I am in the Chamber today to help move it forward. I am very proud \nto be a cosponsor of the Graham-Miller-Kennedy bill, the Medicare \nOutpatient Prescription Drug Act of 2002.\n  This is not a new issue for me or for the people of my home State of \nWashington. Over the years, I have held many roundtable discussions in \nmy home State where I have listened to doctors, seniors, the disabled, \nindustry leaders, and health care providers. Like many people in my \nState, I am frustrated that it has taken us this long to finally reach \nthis point in this critical debate.\n\n[[Page S7149]]\n\n  Unfortunately, as we all know, the attacks of September 11 and the \nproblems in our economy have delayed this critical discussion until \nnow. During my time in the Senate, I have been very proud to work on \nprescription drug coverage, from helping to draft the MEND Act in the \n106th Congress to working on the Budget Committee over the past 3 years \nto provide funding for prescription drugs.\n  In this Congress, I have been very proud to work with my Democratic \ncolleagues to help ensure that the Graham-Miller-Kennedy bill meets our \npriorities of providing an affordable, voluntary, comprehensive, \nreliable benefit that is part of Medicare.\n  Health care has changed dramatically since Medicare was created, and \nit is time we update the Medicare Program to meet today's needs.\n  Decades ago, there was no big prescription drug issue. Back then, it \nwas because prescription drugs played much less of a role in our health \ncare. Today, prescription drugs are a key part of our health care. They \nhelp to prevent disease, and they help patients live longer.\n  As a result of these changes in health care, seniors now rely on \nprescription drugs more than ever. The average Medicare beneficiary \nfills 19 to 24 prescriptions each year.\n  Clearly, prescription drugs are more effective--and coverage is more \nneeded--than ever before.\n  Unfortunately, it is getting more expensive--and more difficult--for \nseniors to get the medicine they need. Some seniors have drug coverage \nthrough their employers, but that number is shrinking. As costs rise, \nemployers are cutting back on coverage.\n  In 1994, 40 percent of firms offered health benefits to their \nretirees. But by 2001, only 23 percent offered health benefits to their \nretirees.\n  Of those on Medicare, 38 percent have no drug coverage throughout the \nyear. And even those seniors who are lucky enough to have coverage have \nseen increased premiums, deductibles, co-pays and greater restrictions. \nFor those on Medicare, out-of-pocket payments for prescriptions--in \njust a two-year period from 2000-2002--have grown from an average of \n$813 to more than $1,000.\n  The lack of coverage--and the growing costs--are impacting health \ncare today. Right now, an estimated 10-13 million seniors not have any \nprescription drug coverage.\n  To meet this need it has become critical that we update the program \nthat seniors and the disabled rely on for their medical care. Updating \nMedicare is something we need to do very carefully. Back in 1997--when \nI first joined the Senate's HELP Committee--we faced the challenge of \nreforming and revitalizing the Food and Drug Administration's drug and \ndevice approval process. There were several competing demands we had to \nbalance. On one hand, patients want new drugs and devices approved and \navailable as soon as possible. On the other hand, the FDA has a \nresponsibility to protect the public's health. We had to balance those \ntwo competing demands. And I am pleased that in the end--after months \nof debate--we passed a good bill that struck the right balance.\n  I mention that example to remind us that there are several competing \ndemands when it comes to prescription drugs for seniors.\n  The first consideration is affordability. We can have the best \nprescription drugs in the world, but if seniors can't afford them, they \nare of little use. So affordability is key. But price is not the only \nconsideration.\n  A second concern is safety and effectiveness.\n  We have worked hard over the years to make sure that our drug supply \nis safe. It is one of the FDA's most important responsibilities. I am \nproud of the way generic drugs have lowered the cost and improved \naccess for so many Americans. But I also recognize that, if the drug \nisn't safe, or if it's not the medicine a patient needs, the cost \nsavings are meaningless.\n  Another concern is innovation. Here in the United States, we have \naccess to the most innovative, cutting-edge medicines. We don't want \nartificial limits on drug distribution that would delay innovations.\n  Finally, I believe that a prescription drug benefit must be a \nseamless part of Medicare. Just like care from a doctor or a hospital \nvisit, prescription drugs are one of the key ways we provide health \ncare today, and it should be treated like that under Medicare.\n  With all those considerations in mind, I am proud to support the \nGraham-Miller-Kennedy bill. It is the only plan that strikes the right \nbalance. It is the only plan that delivers on the promise of a real \nprescription drug benefit for everyone on Medicare. It provides a \ncomprehensive, affordable, and reliable prescription drug benefit. It \nprovides coverage for every prescription without any deductible or \ncoverage gap. It offers predictable, affordable co-payments, and it \nprotects seniors from catastrophic expenses.\n  Second, it's affordable. It has a fixed monthly premium of just $25. \nIt covers all drug expenses after a senior has spent $4,000 in out-of-\npocket expenses. And because there is no deductible, it will help \nseniors with their very first prescription.\n  I am also proud that this bill goes to great lengths to help those \nwith low incomes. For example, there is no premium or cost-sharing for \nbeneficiaries with incomes below 135 percent of poverty. For those \nbetween 135-150 percent of poverty, there are reduced premiums. That \nwill make a difference for the 168,000 Washington seniors who are below \n150 percent of poverty.\n  Finally, this drug benefit is reliable. It will give seniors the \nsecurity that comes from knowing that they can get the medicine they \nneed. Seniors will know they are getting the same coverage--for the \nsame price--no matter how sick they are, and no matter where they live.\n  The Graham-Miller-Kennedy bill is comprehensive, affordable and \nreliable. The other bills would leave a lot of Washington State seniors \nbehind. Low-income seniors would in fact do far worse under the House \nand Senate Republican bills.\n  The Senate Republican bill has a $250 deductible. Our bill has no \ndeductible. Under the Senate Republican bill, there is a big ``benefit \nhole'' for seniors who spend--out of their own pocket--between $3,451 \nto $5,300 on prescription drugs.\n  In Washington State, 212,000 people will fall into that benefit \nhole--paying premiums and high drug costs--without receiving any \nbenefits. Under the House Republican plan, that benefit hole affects \neven more people--340,000 in Washington state alone.\n  There are many other problems with the House and Senate Republican \nbills--from the very limited stop-loss to the asset tests. And both \nthese plans rely on private insurance companies to provide the benefit. \nIf private insurance companies are not willing to participate, there is \nno coverage.\n  Those of us in Washington state have seen the private insurance \nmarket shrink in recent years, so that does not give us a lot of \nconfidence in trusting the private sector to solve the problem.\n  Before I close, I want to mention that we have other parts of \nMedicare we need to fix. Over the past few months, I have worked with a \nnumber of my colleagues to address the regional inequities in Medicare. \nEven though all seniors pay the same rate into the Medicare system, \ntheir access to health care depends on where they live. If they live in \nWashington state, they have fare less access to healthcare. That is \nbecause Washington state ranks 42nd in the Nation in Medicare \nreimbursements per beneficiary. I have been working with leaders in my \nstate on the issue, and I'm continuing to raise the ideas and the \nMediFair proposal with my colleagues here in the Senate.\n  I am proud that the Graham-Miller-Kennedy bill does not base benefits \non the same flawed formula that has created regional inequities in \nMedicare reimbursements. I hope we can move forward on both issues--\naddressing the fairness sin Medicare payments and providing \nprescription drugs.\n  Today, we have the opportunity to help the more than 700,000 people \nin Washington state whoa re enrolled in Medicare. We know that \nprescription drugs are more effective--and more important for good \nhealth care--than ever before. But seniors don't have access to them \nbecause of rising costs and shrinking coverage.\n  The Graham-Miller-Kennedy bill will provide a prescription drug \nbenefit that's part of Medicare and that is comprehensive, affordable \nand reliable. I urge my colleagues to help us pass this critical \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S7150]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to join my colleagues \nand the growing chorus requesting that the Senate move expeditiously to \npass a universal, voluntary, and affordable prescription benefit plan \nunder Medicare.\n  I am a proud cosponsor of the Graham-Miller-Kennedy proposal, which I \nthink is the right approach to provide a voluntary, universal, and \naffordable prescription drug benefit for our seniors.\n  In 1964, Congress took the bold step to enact a health insurance \nprogram that guaranteed coverage for all seniors and disabled persons \nin the country. That boldness has been justified over the last decade \nbecause it has improved materially the health of seniors, and, indeed, \nthis development has improved their economic standing as well. But it \nis time for their Congress to bring that Medicare Program into the 21st \ncentury.\n  Back in 1964, the key elements of health care for seniors and for all \nAmericans was access to hospitals and access to doctors. Medicare \nprovided for both.\n  Today, there is a third critical element. That element is \npharmaceutical benefits. Thus, we must bring the Medicare Program that \nhas served us so well over these last several decades into this new \ncentury by providing a prescription drug benefit for our seniors.\n  Today, Medicare beneficiaries account for 14 percent of the \npopulation, but they account for 43 percent of the Nation's spending on \nprescription drugs.\n  You can see that the population most affected by the use of \npharmaceuticals and the rising costs of pharmaceuticals is seniors. \nAnother reason why we have to move quickly and expeditiously to provide \nassistance under the Medicare Program.\n  Today, the Medicare Program covers approximately 39 million \nAmericans, about 170,000 of my fellow Rhode Islanders. It is a program \nthat is integral to the health and economic security of our seniors and \nto all of our families. For this system to go forward, it has to be \nstrengthened by pharmaceutical benefits.\n  I would like to talk briefly about some of the trends we have seen \nwith respect to prescription drug benefits, to highlight the strengths \nof the Graham-Miller-Kennedy proposal, and to contrast this proposal \nwith competing proposals: the House version and the tripartite package \nthat is before us in the Senate.\n  Before I do that, I want to commend majority leader Daschle for \nbringing this matter to the floor. This is an issue which every senior \nand every family in this country is acutely aware of and who have \ncalled for our attention to it for many, many years.\n  This is not something new. There was at least rhetorical consensus in \nthe last election when both sides claimed they were for the inclusion \nof a prescription drug benefit under Medicare. We have reached the \npoint where words have led to action on this floor. I thank the \nmajority leader for forging that action as we debate this issue today.\n\n  I think it is also appropriate that this legislation has been brought \ntogether with another bill, the Schumer-McCain legislation that was \nmodified in the HELP Committee by Senators Collins and Edwards, which \nprovides benefits, we hope, to the entire population of this country \nwhen they purchase pharmaceuticals, because it will hasten the \nintroduction of generic drugs into the marketplace while preserving the \nintegrity of our intellectual property system.\n  These two bills together--a prescription drug benefit for seniors \nfrom the Medicare system, and strengthening and speeding access to \ngeneric drugs in the country--I think are appropriate responses to the \nlegitimate, persistent, and long-standing demands of the American \npublic.\n  Last year--if we look at the spending on pharmaceuticals--out-of-\npocket spending on prescription drugs was estimated to be $848 a year \namong Medicare beneficiaries. Nine percent of them, however, spent more \nthan $2,500 a year. This is an extraordinary amount of money for people \nwho are living on fixed incomes. You do not have to talk to too many \nseniors before you hear their legitimate complaints, that they often \nhave to choose between buying their prescriptions or paying their rent.\n  Today, we had an event in Providence, RI, where we had seniors and \nphysicians talk about that issue. A physician who joined us was very \neloquent on this subject, pointing out that often his patients will \ntell him the choice they face is either filling their prescriptions or \npaying the telephone bill that month. That is a choice many seniors \nhave to make. Frankly, many of them will choose to have the telephone--\nfor an emergency, for a lifeline, for communication with their \nfamilies--and they will forgo the prescriptions.\n  The doctor spoke of one case--one among many--where he was treating \nan elderly person, a woman, for high blood pressure, and she could not \nafford the full range of drugs he prescribed. So he tried to make do \nwith whatever was in his supply cabinet: the samples he got from \npharmaceutical companies. This caused, of course, a situation where \nthey were frequently changing prescriptions; and even then she could \nnot fill all the prescriptions because of her economic circumstances.\n  The high blood pressure was treated on an ad hoc basis. Sometimes she \ncould take her medicine because she could afford it; sometimes she \ncould not. And what happened? The lady suffered a devastating stroke. \nIronically, today that doctor can prescribe and ensure she gets the \nfull complement of pharmaceuticals because she is disabled and her \nhealth care is paid for through the Medicaid Program as a disabled \ncitizen. That is not right, and it does not make any sense. If that \nwoman had been covered by the provisions of the Graham-Miller-Kennedy \nbill, she could have purchased those medicines that would have, \nhopefully, prevented her stroke.\n  That is just one example, but we see it time and time again. Seniors \nare under tremendous financial and economic strain, as prescription \ndrug costs go up and up and up.\n  I spoke to another senior this morning: 70 years old, still working, \nand working primarily to pay for her prescriptions. She said she went \nback to a druggist the other day and was told her drug cost over $100. \nShe cannot afford it.\n  These are the realities that seniors face throughout the country. The \nbill Senators Graham, Miller and their colleagues have proposed--and \none I proudly support--will address those concerns. They will provide a \nprescription drug benefit that is voluntary, a benefit that will \nrequire a $25 monthly premium, and no deductible. It will require the \nsenior to pay $10 for generic prescriptions, $40 for a preferred brand \nname prescription, and $60 for a nonpreferred brand name prescription--\nsimple, direct, well defined, the essence of what I believe we should \ndo to help seniors.\n\n  The bill sets forth a clearly defined framework for what a Medicare \nrecipient would expect to receive in benefits. The assistance is there \nfrom the very first prescription. There is no deductible. There are no \ngaps or limits in coverage. There is a catastrophic cap on out-of-\npocket expenditures above $4,000. And there are additional subsidies \nfor individuals with incomes below 150 percent of poverty--simple, \ndirect, well defined, the essence of what we should do.\n  It is a program that will not be administered at the discretion of \nprivate health insurance. It will be a Medicare program, available to \nevery American, no matter where they live, something I think should be \ninherent in any drug proposal we make here on the floor of the Senate.\n  In contrast, the House bill and other Senate proposals do not provide \nreliable drug coverage as part of Medicare's defined benefit package. \nThese alternative bills have no defined benefit, no guaranteed \npremiums, no standard copayments or cost-sharing. And because the plans \nrely on private insurance companies and HMOs, the actual benefit a \nperson receives could vary, depending on where that person lives.\n  As we have experienced with the Medigap and the Medicare HMO market, \nprivate insurers are not capable, often, of providing stable, \npredictable coverage that older Americans and the disabled need and \ndeserve. I hear regularly from constituents who are confused and upset \nby the constant\n\n[[Page S7151]]\n\nchanges in premiums, copayments, and benefits under these plans. And I \nsuspect the same confusion will result if these pharmaceutical plans \nare administered exclusively by private insurers.\n  So I believe we should move forward, very deliberately and very \nquickly, to adopt the version proposed by my colleague from Florida, \nSenator Graham.\n  Again, in contrast to the Graham bill, the House-passed bill would \nrequire a monthly premium of $34, but the first $250 in drug costs must \nbe assumed entirely by the beneficiary. You would be paying a premium, \nand yet you would be getting nothing for the first $250 in costs.\n  For the next level, from $251 to $1,000, you would only pay 20 \npercent. But then, if you went over $1,000, you, the beneficiary, would \nhave to pay 50 percent of the cost. And what, to me, is the most \nastounding aspect of this House proposal is, once a patient spends up \nabove $2,000, they would have to pay the entire cost of their \nprescriptions until $4,800. Just at the point where these \npharmaceutical costs were accumulating, a beneficiary would have to pay \nall of the costs and still the premium.\n  This bill and its counterpart, the tripartisan bill in the Senate, I \nthink, are not sufficient to meet the task before us. I urge my \ncolleagues--all of my colleagues--to support strenuously the Graham-\nMiller-Kennedy bill and provide seniors and the disabled with a real \npharmaceutical benefit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I will ask that we have a brief quorum \ncall and that the time not be charged to either side. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Murray). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, if I could inquire about the parliamentary \nsituation or the time situation, how much time is left on this side of \nthe aisle on this debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No time remains on that side.\n  Mr. LOTT. How much time on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-two minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I yield myself time that I might need \nunder leader time. But for the information of the Senators who are \nhere, I don't believe it will exceed more than about 10 minutes or so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I know there has already been a good \ndebate on this very important issue today. I do sincerely hope that we \ncan produce a result that will provide prescription drug coverage for \nour low-income elderly, sick people who need this help. Certainly, from \npersonal experience, I know of low-income elderly who need the help. My \nconcern, though, is we do it in such a way that the costs are not so \nextreme that they wind up causing serious problems with our Medicare \nfunds. In short, we don't want to blow a hole in the Medicare fund and \ncause all kinds of problems as a result of our good intentions. That is \nmy first concern with the Graham-Kennedy proposal.\n  I know it has been difficult to get a cost analysis. I am still not \nquite sure exactly what the cost has been estimated on this proposal, \nalthough I understand it is in the range of $600 billion over a 10-year \nperiod. I understand the plan perhaps may be defined as only covering 8 \nyears, which doesn't begin until 2004, so it is pretty hard to match \napples and apples. But over a 10-year period, I think it would probably \nwind up being at least $600 billion.\n  The cost factor is something we have to be aware of in all these \ndifferent plans.\n  The other thing that bothers me is the universal coverage aspects. \nRegardless of income, you are going to get subsidized prescription \ndrugs if you are, I guess, in a certain age category. That is my \nunderstanding. That is one of the fundamental differences. I have \nalways said we should target sick low-income elderly or certainly, low-\nincome elderly. But even using those three words produces a different \nnumber of people. We would have to think about that very carefully.\n  But the idea that we would be providing subsidized prescription drugs \nto people who have income in retirement of $50,000, $60,000, I guess \nany amount, is a major concern I have.\n  I am also disturbed about new revelations that I have discovered in \nthe Graham-Kennedy amendment over the weekend. We had an earlier \nversion that has been changed. Everybody is entitled to do that up \nuntil the time the different proposals were offered. But there are some \ncritical changes that have been made, I presume, to reduce, at least to \nsome degree, the cost estimates on this proposal. There are some \ndetails embedded in this plan that will have critical repercussions on \nthe lives and health of 40 million seniors if the amendment were ever \nto become law.\n  There are two critical differences that I want to point out today \nbetween the Graham-Kennedy amendment and Senator Graham's original \nbill, S. 2625. When you look at what those two apparently small changes \nactually mean in the operation of the prescription drug benefit, I \nbelieve you will want to oppose the Graham amendment in its current \nform.\n  In the first change, which is on page 30 of the amendment, it has to \ndo with copayments for brand name drugs that are not on the health \nplan's approved list. First, it would help if we review the original \nlanguage in the Graham bill and what it had to say about the \ncopayments. The original Graham bill said if you used a generic drug, \nyou would face a copayment of $10 per prescription; that is, if you use \na generic drug.\n  If you use a brand name drug that was part of the so-called \nformulary--I will call it the approved list--you would face a copayment \nof $40 per prescription. And if you used, under diagnosis by a doctor, \na brand name drug that was not part of your plan's formulary or \napproved list, you would face a copayment of $60 per prescription. So \nwe had copayments for prescriptions of $10, $40, and $60.\n  The current language, which has been changed in the Graham-Kennedy \namendment, changes the last part. It changes the copayment for the \nbrand name drug, which is not part of your health plan's approved list. \nThe amendment now says that your prescription drug plan will not cover \nany brand name drug that is not on your health plan's approved list. In \nthat case, you have to pay the full price of the drug. Here is the key \nlanguage on page 30 of the amendment. We have it blown up here so \nMembers can see it, even though they don't have it available to them to \nread out of the bill:\n  Beneficiary responsible for negotiated price of nonformulary drugs: \nIn the case of a covered outpatient drug that is dispensed to an \neligible beneficiary and that is not included in the formulary \nestablished by the eligible entity for the plan, the beneficiary shall \nbe responsible for negotiated price for the drug.\n  Now, you got it right. The new plan does not cover brand name drugs, \nunless they are on your drug plan's approved list. You, the Medicare \nrecipient, would have to pay for the drug out of your own pocket. Well, \nyou might say that should not be too big a problem. But let's get into \nit a little deeper and you will see what is a further change in the \nbill and how the two of them tie together and cause problems.\n  The other shoe drops on pages 61 and 62 of the Graham-Kennedy \namendment. Let's look at the legislative language in this case:\n  The eligible entity (health plan) shall include at least one, but not \nmore than 2, brand name covered outpatient drugs for each therapeutic \nclass as a preferred brand name drug in the formulary [or the approved \nlist].\n  That means that under the current plan in the Democrat proposal, your \nhealth plan cannot include more than two name brand drugs for \narthritis. Your plan cannot include more than two brand name broad \nantibiotic drugs, or not more than two brand name narcotic pain \nkillers, or antiseizure drugs, or diabetic drugs, or hypertension \ndrugs. In any case, it is no more than two.\n\n[[Page S7152]]\n\n  So look at what happens when you combine what you see on page 30 with \nwhat you see on page 62. If you need a name brand drug and if that \nbrand name drug is not on the list of two on your approved list, then \nyou are out of luck. Your new wonder drug plan here from the Democrats \ndoesn't cover that drug. You would have to pay the full cost out of \nyour pocket. So here is what that would lead to. Suppose you use an \nantihistamine every day and your health plan chooses to cover Allegra \nor Zyrtec, but not Claritin because it is limited to only two brand \nname antihistamine drugs. If you prefer Claritin because it clears up \nyour symptoms better--just today, I was talking to an elderly person \nwho was having problems, and I asked that person what they were taking \nbecause it obviously wasn't working. They told me it was one of the two \nthat I mentioned here. I suggested maybe he try a Claritin D, since it \nseems to work better for me; certain drugs may work differently on \ndifferent people, and doctors prescribe different brand name drugs. If \nthe one you need the most is Claritin, which is not on the list, but \nthese other two are--and you also have the Claritin reditabs--then you \nwould have to pay $68 more per prescription to get the drug that has \nbeen prescribed to you, which is your choice, or the one you need.\n\n  Now, that, of course, is a concern if you are in that category. It \ngets even worse if you look at other examples. For instance, \nantiarthritics. Suppose you need Celebrex but your health plan, limited \nto only two drugs, chooses Vioxx or Enbrel. As many seniors with \narthritis know, arthritis drugs are very particular. What works for one \nsenior citizen doesn't necessarily work for another. The Graham \namendment limits your health plan to two of these four drugs. So if you \nneed Celebrex, you could be out of luck, and you would then have to pay \nabout $90 per prescription out of your pocket in order to get this \nparticular arthritis drug.\n  And then it can go into other areas, too; for instance, \nantidepressants. Under the Graham amendment, only two antidepressants \nwould be covered. If you needed one not on the list, you would have to \npay the cost out of your own pocket. It could be--in the case of \nProzac--$110 to get the particular drug that you might need.\n  Madam President, that is the plan we have before us. One thing that \nbothers me about it, too, is who decides exactly what two would be on \nthis approved list? Is it going to be a board? What would be the \ncriteria in deciding what two drugs would be on the list? This is a \nsolution that I think causes a real problem. Some people say just take \na generic. Substitute in a different brand name drug, they will argue. \nBut sometimes you just cannot do it. Many times, drugs have specific \neffects on different people. So I think this is a major flaw that has \nbeen created by limiting or dropping out the $60 copayment per \nprescription, and then coming up with the two-drug limit.\n  I was going over this information this afternoon and I wanted \nSenators to know about this change. I know that everybody is trying to \nwork toward the right end result and with good intentions. But I do \nthink that what is happening is you have limited choices and you \nguarantee that many seniors who need these specific drugs--Prozac is as \ngood an example as you are going to find, where you would have to come \nup with a significant cost--$110--for the drugs.\n  Before you vote tomorrow afternoon, I urge my colleagues to look at \nthe changes that have been made. I presume they were made because of \nthe cost impact. But you need to also look at what the medical impact \nis--the result of the decision that has been made. I urge my colleagues \nto vote against it on this basis, as well as on many others.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield 30 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida, and I think I still have 12 minutes or so remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I hope the minority leader might be able \nto stay on the floor so he would not run the risk of being unable to \nsleep tonight, as he tosses and turns, concerned about the fact that we \nhave provided, as almost every private health care plan does provide, \nfor a specific formulary as to what will get the benefit of the \npreferred $40 deductibles.\n  At an appropriate time in my remarks, I am going to go into this in \nmore detail, and I will also direct the Senator's attention to other \nlanguage in the pages from which he was quoting, which indicates that \nwe are sensitive to exactly the concerns he has expressed; we have, in \nfact, provided a means by which other drugs that are found to be \nclinically necessary would be added to the list of those which could be \nsecured at the $40 copayment level.\n  I think the Senator from Mississippi will find many of the remarks I \nam about to make to be informative, insightful, possibly requiring a \nreassessment of position and hopefully tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. to see him \nmarch proudly to the front of the Chamber and cast a vote in favor of \nthe Graham-Miller-Kennedy bill. We would be honored to have that vote \nand would even keep the list of potential cosponsors open for his \npossible signature.\n  One of our colleagues has specifically asked that I request unanimous \nconsent that he be added as a cosponsor: Senator Akaka. I make such a \nrequest on his behalf.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  Last Thursday, the 18th of July, Senators Kennedy, Miller, Corzine, \nand I offered this amendment to provide affordable, comprehensive, and \nreliable prescription drug coverage for the 39 million older Americans \nand disabled citizens who are currently covered by Medicare.\n  I have an interest in all Americans who will benefit by the adoption \nof this proposal. I have a particular interest in the 2,750,000 of \nthese Americans who call their home Florida.\n  I do not wish to repeat the remarks I made last Thursday, so let me \njust recap some of the principles that we think are important and \nshould be the touchstone in evaluating any plan that is proposed for \nprescription drugs.\n  We believe these principles include: a modernization of the Medicare \nProgram; providing beneficiaries with real benefit; giving to the \nbeneficiaries real choices; using a delivery system that seniors can \nrely upon and is affordable for the beneficiaries; and a program which \nis fiscally prudent.\n  I also outlined last Thursday our specific proposal and indicated how \nit complied with those principles of a prescription drug program for \nMedicare.\n  What does our proposal provide? We guarantee a universal benefit to \nall seniors, no matter where they live; that if they determine it is in \ntheir interest to voluntarily elect to participate in the prescription \ndrug plan, they would pay $25 per month for that participation. Having \ndone so, assistance would begin with the very first prescription. There \nis no deductible. They would pay a predictable copayment. For the year \n2005, the first year that this program would be operational, the \nseniors would never pay more than $10 for a generic drug and $40 for a \nmedically necessary brand-name drug.\n  Medicare beneficiaries can also rest easy knowing that they would \nnever pay more than $4,000 in a year for their prescriptions. Seniors \nwith incomes below $13,290 for an individual and for couples below \n$17,910 annual, if that is your income, then you would receive \nadditional assistance, including the waiver of copayments for those who \nare below 135 percent of poverty.\n  We would also be able to guarantee that this benefit would be \navailable to all seniors because we use a system to deliver the drug \nbenefit that is as tried and true as the 37-year-old Medicare Program \nitself. It is the same system that you and I and all Members of the \nU.S. Congress use to receive their prescription drugs through the \nFederal Employees Health Benefits Program.\n  We rely on pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, to deliver and manage \nour drug benefit. PBMs are private commercial companies that negotiate \nwith the pharmaceutical companies to get discounted prices. These \ncompanies are currently providing drug benefits through public and \nprivate employer plans in every zip code in America, and they would \nwork as well for our seniors\n\n[[Page S7153]]\n\nas they do for Federal employees, private sector employees, and Members \nof Congress.\n\n  What I wish to do this afternoon is focus first on what I think are \nsome of the key concerns raised by the Republican plan and then respond \nto some of the questions which have been raised, such as the questions \nraised by the Senator from Maine, who is in the Chamber now, and the \nSenator from Mississippi.\n  These key problems raised about the Republican plan include its \nreliance on a yet-to-be-created delivery system, the gaps in coverage, \nand their test of beneficiaries' assets, which will make it difficult, \nif not impossible, for many of our low-income seniors to get the drugs \nthey need because even though they will qualify for special assistance \nbased on their income, they will be rejected because they have too many \nassets.\n  Let me discuss each of these principal flaws in some detail.\n  Our Republican colleagues have criticized our proposal for being an \nintegral part of the Medicare Program. Instead, they would use the \nprescription drug benefit to begin privatizing the Medicare Program; \nthey would give the important task of delivering prescription drugs to \nprivate drug HMOs.\n  I have grave doubts about the private insurance model for \nprescription drugs for the very basic reason that it has never been \ndone this way. There is no place we can turn to say: How has a private \ninsurance subsidized plan for only prescription drugs worked? If there \nis such a plan, if there is someplace that we can turn to inform our \njudgment on this, I would ask for the name of the company, its address, \nand its telephone number so we might call and ask some of the questions \nthat concern us about how such a plan would work.\n  I am afraid we will find there is no name, there is no address, and \nthere is no telephone number. Private insurance plans have had every \nopportunity to offer drug-only insurance plans, and yet not one has \nstepped forward to do so.\n  Private insurers simply have no interest in providing drug-only \nbenefits. Why are they not interested in drug-only benefits? Let me use \nan analogy to the private insurance market as it relates to casualty \ninsurance.\n  Most of us who own a home have insurance on that home to cover risks, \nsuch as fire or windstorm damage. You can call State Farm and ask \nwhether it would offer a kitchen-only casualty insurance policy, or \nwould it offer a policy that would only cover that back room which is \nnext door to an old and frail tree that might blow over in a storm and \nfall on the rear of the house. The answer to that is obviously no. \nState Farm and any other casualty insurance company would consider \ninsuring your whole house, but they are not going to insure a specific \nroom and particularly a room that is probably more vulnerable than \nother parts of the house.\n  This is exactly what is being asked of insurance companies as it \nrelates to offering a prescription drug-only plan. Prescription drugs \nhappen to be the fastest growing segment of total health care costs in \nAmerica. When Medicare was established in 1965, the average older \nAmerican spent $65 on prescription drugs. I am not talking about $65 a \nweek or $65 a month. I am saying $65 a year was the average amount that \nseniors spent on prescription drugs.\n  That number has increased by a factor of 35 in the history of \nMedicare, the fastest growing segment of health care in America. That \nis why insurance companies have been unwilling to offer a prescription \ndrug-only private insurance policy.\n  This is what we are going to require as the model for delivery under \nthe Republican proposal.\n  About a year ago, I invited a group of chief executive officers of \npharmaceutical companies to come into my office to talk about the \nvarious plans and specifically the method of distributing prescription \ndrugs. I asked these executives a fairly simple question: How do your \nemployees get their prescription drugs? Do they get them through a \ndrug-only private insurance plan? Do you rely on drug HMOs for your \nemployees, for you and your family to get these drug benefits?\n  The answer from each of the CEOs was the same. No.\n  Why not, I asked.\n  The answer was: No such plan exists.\n  So I asked this question: Why do we want to impose this untried \nsystem on our Nation's seniors? Why should they be the guinea pigs in \nsome vast theoretical laboratory experiment of a plan that has never \nbeen tried?\n  I am particularly concerned about how the Republican HMO drug plan \nwill work in rural areas of which, in my State, in the State of the \nPresiding Officer, in virtually every State, is a significant amount of \nour population. We have to look no further than the Medicare+Choice \nsystem--these are the full Medicare HMOs--to see how rural areas would \nlikely fair.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, 94 percent of \nMedicare beneficiaries in rural areas have no access to Medicare HMOs. \nWhy is this the case? In significant part, it is because rural \nbeneficiaries on the whole tend to be older and sicker than other \nsenior Americans. Therefore, it is more difficult for a private \ninsurance plan to spread its risk. Most of the beneficiaries served in \nrural areas are considered high-risk beneficiaries. A likely result of \nthe prescription drug model that relies on drug HMOs is that seniors in \nrural areas will pay higher premiums than beneficiaries in urban areas, \nif they are able to get any coverage at all.\n  In addition to questioning whether a drug benefit would actually be \navailable if we rely on drug HMOs as proposed by our Republican \ncolleagues, I have great doubts about the affordability of any benefit \nthat is offered. Why is that? Because the drug HMOs get all the choices \nwhen it comes to the benefit they would offer.\n  We cannot tell our seniors what the Republican prescription drug \nbenefit is. No place in their bill does it tell us what premium the \nseniors will be charged. It does not say what the deductibles and \ncoinsurance levels will be. They are only ``suggestions.''\n  My Republican colleagues talk about providing choices. What they do \nnot tell us is they give all the choices to the private insurance \ncompanies. Under the Republican plan, our seniors will pay different \npremiums depending on where they live. Under the Republican plan, the \ndrug HMOs determine what the premiums will be, not the Medicare \nProgram.\n  If it is not troubling enough that the insurance industry would be \nmaking these choices about what the premium is, what the deductible is, \nwhat the cost sharing will be, consider this: The Republican plan would \nspend precious resources to lure private insurers into the market. \nInstead of using these resources, Federal dollars, Federal taxpayer \ndollars, to ensure an affordable drug benefit for all seniors, they \nwould use them to induce private drug HMOs to participate in the \nsystem.\n  My concerns about the Republican plan are not based on speculation \nbut on lessons learned in Nevada, which began offering seniors a drug \nbenefit. The Nevada plan, while it has significant differences, is the \nclosest example we have to the Republican plan that will be voted on \ntomorrow. We know from Nevada's experience that what seniors want is an \naffordable drug benefit, not a requirement that they analyze multiple \nand confusing plans with different premiums, deductibles, and cost \nsharing.\n\n  Let me give this piece of history: When the State of Nevada \noriginally offered seniors a multiple choice plan of drug benefits, how \nmany seniors in Nevada signed up for the plan? The answer is 124. That \nwas the total number of seniors in a relatively large State in our \nNation who wanted to sign up for this multiple benefit plan. When the \nprogram was restructured and seniors were given one defined benefit \nplan, when they knew what they were going to get, how many people \nenrolled? Over 6,000.\n  We also know from Nevada's experience that private insurers will not \nparticipate in the Republican model unless there are high profits to be \nmade, dollars that could have been used to make the benefit more \ncomprehensive or more affordable. In order to get a private insurer to \nparticipate, the State of Nevada had to pay the plan $106.54 per member \nper month, even though the member's actual drug cost averaged only \n$37.64 per month. That is a difference of nearly $69 per member per \nmonth, $69 that could have been\n\n[[Page S7154]]\n\nused to offer a better benefit, cover more seniors, give an earlier \ncatastrophic benefit.\n  Even after adjusting for administrative and other costs, the State \ncalculated that the private plan had a profit of $1 million over a 6-\nmonth period to serve a mere 3,000 beneficiaries.\n  My Republican colleagues would repeat this mistake but on a massive \nscale. Rather than assuring that the money is spent on a drug benefit \nand is used to maximize drug coverage for seniors, the Republican bill \nwould allow the money to be siphoned off to induce insurance companies \nto participate when they have indicated by their past behavior they do \nnot want to participate.\n  I also have grave doubts that seniors would get the drugs they need \nif they were to adopt the Republican proposal. Under their approach, \nthe fewer drugs used by seniors, the higher the profits for private \ninsurers.\n  We hear a lot about the idea of transferring risk, insurance risk, to \nthe private insurance companies, and because they will be responsible \nfor this risk, therefore they will be more aggressive in containing \ncosts. I find it a little disingenuous that this plan, which is \nsupported by almost all the major pharmaceutical companies, has as one \nof its recommendations to be adopted that it is going to be more \neffective in containing costs.\n  We have all heard the argument of the fox in the chicken coup. I \nthink we have an example of that with the pharmaceutical company saying \nthey support the plan with the principal benefit being its capacity to \nreduce pharmaceutical costs.\n  Private insurance companies, in my judgment, have exactly the \nopposite goal. They are likely to want to restrict the drugs that the \nsenior wants and needs because that is the way they can maximize their \nown profits. We need to listen to what our seniors have to say about \nprivatizing Medicare before we go down this path.\n  In 2001, a senior lady from Cincinnati, speaking before one of our \nmajor senior groups, said the problem with privatizing Medicare is \nthese insurance companies will make the rules and you will live by the \nrules. You will not have any representative if you go to an insurance \ncompany and tell them you do not like the way they are doing something. \nDo you think they are really going to care?\n  It is not just the delivery model, however, which worries me. It is \nalso the benefit design in the Republican plan. In fact, the phrase \n``truth in advertising'' should apply. If we are going to pass the \nRepublican bill, we better be prepared to tell the truth. We better be \nprepared to tell seniors that they will face an enormous gap in the \nbenefit, a gap which some people have referred to as the doughnut hole.\n  This is Freda and Coleman Moss of Tampa, Florida. Freda is 80 years \nold. Coleman is 84. Freda has had serious health problems. She spends, \non average, $7,800 on prescription drugs every year. Under the \nRepublican plan, from about mid-June until the end of September, \nroughly a third of the year, she will be getting no help at all. The \nreason is that the Republican plan has this gaping gap in coverage. \nDuring that period when she is getting no benefits at all, however, her \nmonthly premiums are not suspended; she continues to write that check \nout every month for monthly premiums. But while she is in the gap, the \ndoughnut hole, she will get no benefit. How could this be?\n\n  The Republicans insist the doughnut hole is so small, they would like \nto call it a bagel hole. Let's call it what it is: It is a gimmick. It \nis a gimmick which helps to lower the cost of their bill at the expense \nof seniors getting the drugs they need.\n  It is important to understand what is really going on in the gap. \nThey say this little bagel hole of a gap is only between $3,450 and \n$3,700, or $250. Is that really the size of the gap?\n  Madam President, we will now talk a little arithmetic. If anyone \nwould like to settle back and relax, this is a good time. Let's look at \nhow the Republican plan works.\n  Beneficiaries have to reach a point where the total spending--the \nspending of you, as the beneficiary, the Federal Government, and any \nother source--reaches a level of $3,450. Once you reach that point, you \nreceive no assistance for your prescription drugs until you spend, out \nof your own pocket, $3,700.\n  How does the math work? To get to the $3,450 level, the out-of-pocket \nexpenditures by the beneficiary will be, first, a $250 deductible. You \nhave to pay that before you get any assistance. Then, between $250 and \n$3,450, you pay half and the Federal Government pays half. You pay \n$1,600 and the Federal Government also pays $1,600. By the time the \ncombined expenditures reach $3,450, you pay $1,850 out of your pocket--\nthe deductible plus the $1,600.\n  In order to get out of this doughnut hole, you have to have total \nexpenditures out of your pocket of $3,700 or an additional $1,850 \nbeyond the $1,600 you already paid. So you will have to pay a total of \n$3,700 before you escape what is not a bagel hole, what is not even a \ndoughnut hole, what is really a Grand Canyon of a gap. That is \ndevastating.\n  Let us consider the case of Freda. After spending $250 for the \ndeductible, she would pay 50 percent for each prescription drug \nprescription until the total drug cost was $3,450. Freda would spend \n$1,600 in addition to the deductible, for a total of $1,850 from her \nown pocket. Freda already spent a lot of money. But guess what is \ncoming. While she is in the gap, she pays 100 percent for every \nprescription to get her from a total of $1,850 that she has already \nspent to the $3,700 she needs to get to cross the Grand Canyon and \nremove herself from the gap. That means she will have to spend $1,850.\n  During this period of time, she is paying for all of her prescription \ndrug costs, paying her monthly premiums. The gap is confusing. But one \nthing is certain: It is no small amount. Most years, Freda would pay 50 \npercent of her prescription until about June 15. This is out of the \n$7,800 which is her average annual prescription drug cost. Then for 3 \nmonths--assuming she could, in fact, afford to pay 100 percent for the \ndrugs she needs and would not have to cut down on prescription drugs in \norder to afford food, rent, and the other necessities of life--she \nwould be paying that next $1,850 out of her pocket. It is a big \nassumption that she will be able to do that.\n\n  Freda and Coleman Moss have a monthly income of $1,038. Freda would \nhave to spend 65 percent of the total income she and her husband share \nduring these 3 months she is in the gap in order to pay for \nprescription drugs alone. It is not hard to imagine Freda would not be \nable to get the drugs she needed during the time she was in the gap.\n  This gap is bad medicine for Freda Moss. It is bad medicine for \nAmerica's seniors. The gap is a gimmick that lowers the cost of the \nRepublican plan at Freda Moss's expense. I am not going to inflict this \ngap on Freda Moss, on Coleman Moss, or any of the other 816,000 \nFloridians who would fall every year into this benefit gap.\n  To my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I say, let's be \ntruthful about what we are doing to our seniors. If you think it is too \nexpensive to offer the plan you are offering, be honest. Raise the \nmonthly premiums. Increase the $250 deductible. Increase the percentage \nof coinsurance that the senior has to pay. But do not hide it in the \nmiddle of the benefit program to tell Freda Moss: From June 15 until \nthe end of September, you have to pay 100 percent of your prescription \ndrug costs. The fact is, she cannot afford to pay 100 percent of her \nprescription drug costs.\n  The third key fault in the Republican plan is the assets test.\n  I ask Senator Kennedy for an additional 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We will do 20 minutes evenly divided.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Senator Kennedy has talked extensively about the assets \ntest, so I mention it briefly.\n  It is a mirage to tell low-income seniors they are going to get \naccess to the benefits of reduced or, in some cases, no copayments \nbecause of their limited income when we then impose, for the first time \nin the history of Medicare, an assets test that says if you own \nsomething as basic as a $1,500 burial fund, so she might be buried next \nto your loving spouse, that makes you ineligible to get any of the low-\nincome benefits.\n  It has been estimated that one-third of the 11 million seniors who \nwould otherwise qualify for some special assistance because of their \nlow income\n\n[[Page S7155]]\n\nwould be denied that assistance because they would not comply with the \nassets test.\n  I will briefly touch on some of the criticisms the Republicans have \nmade about our plan: First, the plan is too costly; that we cannot in \nour rich society afford to provide to our older citizens what is now a \nfundamental part of a comprehensive health care program. I do not \nbelieve that is the America we live in today.\n\n  The Republicans have thrown around some numbers as to what our bill \nwill cost. Let me say that we have a CBO number, a Congressional Budget \nOffice number, which they do not have in their plan. It is that, \nassuming that the underlying generic drug bill is passed, which will \nencourage generic drug use, our plan for the first 8 years will cost \n$407 billion and for the full 10 years will cost $576 billion. Is this \na cheap proposal? The answer is: No. A cheap proposal means meager \nbenefits, less than universal coverage, less than comprehensive \ncoverage. That will not do for America's seniors.\n  But rather than looking at the cost of our drug proposal in \nisolation, let's put it in context. What are we currently paying? What \npercentage of the cost are we paying for all the other health care \nbenefits that seniors receive through Medicare? The answer is \napproximately 77 percent. That is what we are paying for doctor care, \nhospitalization, all the things that Medicare covers. If we were to \ncover 77 percent of prescription drugs, this plan would not be costing \n$594 billion over the next 10 years. It would cost more than $1 \ntrillion over the next 10 years.\n  We also maybe should look at ourselves. We are all participants in \nthe Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. If we were to give seniors \nthe same benefits that we get as Members of the Senate, with an average \nincome that is 10 times what the average income of senior Americans is \ntoday, this plan would cost $750 billion. We are talking about, over 10 \nyears, $596 billion.\n  The reality is that the benefits of prescription drugs do not come \ncheap. The cost of prescription drugs is the fastest growing component \nof every health care plan, the private sector, the public sector, and \nit will be a significant part of any decent Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit. That is what the debate that we had last week was all about.\n  Are we going to pass generic drug, patent reform, reimportation, \nState group purchasing--all of which are designed to give to all \nAmericans, including senior Americans, greater access and affordability \nto a very expensive part of our national budget today, prescription \ndrugs? The reality is the plan that our Republican colleagues have \noffered will cover less than 25 percent of seniors' drug costs. That is \nbased on the latest estimate that their plan will cost, in the range \nfor prescription drugs, of $330 billion to $340 billion. And the total \ndrug expenditures by seniors over the next 10 years will be $1.3 \ntrillion.\n  Our plan would provide almost twice the amount of coverage as the \nRepublican proposal. It would provide $594 billion of the $1.3 trillion \nthat seniors are going to spend on prescription drugs in the next 10 \nyears.\n  In my opinion, as costly as this is, it is not an extravagant \nbenefit. It is far less than the 77 percent that we are covering for \nother medical services, and it will provide critical assistance to our \nseniors.\n  It has been argued that seniors would pay more in copayments. The \nreality is seniors prefer to have their drugs acquired through a known \namount per prescription, rather than through the unknown of a \npercentage of an unknown actual amount.\n  If seniors go to the doctor and get a prescription, they are unlikely \nto know what that prescription is going to cost. But they do know if it \nis a generic drug it is going to cost them $10, and if it is a brand \ndrug it will cost them $40. They like that degree of reliability and \nsecurity.\n  It has been said that this is a Government-run price control system. \nThis is not a new argument. It is not an argument about prescription \ndrugs through Medicare. This goes to the heart of whether America \nshould have a Medicare Program at all. This debate was ongoing before \nMedicare was adopted. It was an argument which kept Medicare from being \nadopted for many years. And it has been an argument that has continued \nsince Medicare was established in 1965. We should not forget that \nRepublicans voted against the creation of the Medicare Program in 1965, \nand they have made their thoughts about Medicare very clear since then.\n  Just listen to some quotes by prominent Republican leaders. In 1995, \nthen-majority leader of the Senate, Senator Bob Dole, said:\n\n       I was there fighting the fight, voting against Medicare in \n     1965 because we knew it wouldn't work.\n\n  Former Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich, speaking on Medicare in \n1995, said:\n\n       Now we didn't get rid of it in round 1 because we don't \n     think that it's politically smart and we don't think that's \n     the right way to go through a transition. But we believe it \n     is going to wither on the vine because we think people are \n     voluntarily going to leave it.\n\n  Republican House majority leader Dick Army said Medicare was ``a \nprogram I would have no part of in a free world.''\n  He deeply resents the fact that ``when I am 65 I must enroll in \nMedicare.''\n  Somebody should tell him that Part B of Medicare, as well as this \ndrug benefit, are voluntary. If he chooses not to enroll, that is his \nelection.\n  I have news for my Republican colleagues. The Medicare program, as it \nis administered, has worked. Let me tell you a few of the successes.\n  Since its creation, Medicare has provided health care coverage for \nmore than 93 million elderly and disabled. Medicare has made a dramatic \ndifference in the number of seniors with health insurance. In 1964, the \nyear before Medicare, half the seniors were uninsured.\n  Today, 97 percent of seniors have health insurance. Medicare has \nlifted countless seniors out of poverty, has expanded access to high-\nquality care for minority seniors, has improved the quality of life for \nseniors by providing access to procedures such as cataract surgery, hip \nreplacement, cardiac bypass surgery, and organ transplant.\n  We have the Medicare Program in part to thank for increasing the \naverage life expectancy available to Americans. A 65-year-old woman who \nis entering Medicare today will live 20 percent longer than her \ncounterpart who became 65 in 1960.\n  It is Medicaid, making the miracles of modern medicine accessible and \naffordable, not private insurance, that made these advances possible. \nIt wasn't private insurance plans that stepped to the plate in 1965 to \nprovide health insurance coverage for seniors. In fact, they didn't \nwant to cover seniors. That was why Medicare was established.\n  I wish I had time to go into more detail on some of the reactions of \nseniors toward these plans and why virtually every major senior group \nhas supported our plan. I wish I had greater opportunity to respond \nspecifically to the concerns of the Senator from Mississippi, and hope \nI will have such an opportunity before we vote. But let me just \nconclude.\n  This debate is not about programs. This is not about charts. This \nplan is about human beings, our parents and our grandparents. It is \nabout working Americans who are paying the cost for their elderly \nfamily members' prescription.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate your indulgence and my \ncolleagues' indulgence. I hope tomorrow we will grasp the rare \nopportunity we have to give greater security and comfort to our senior \ncitizens by their knowledge that they will now have affordable and \naccessible opportunities to experience the miracles that prescription \ndrugs make available, and that they will be there for them in a \nreliable manner, in a manner with which they are familiar--tried, \ntested, and assured.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I believe I have 12 minutes remaining. I \nwelcome the opportunity to inquire of my friend and colleague. I have a \nquestion or two about the legislation and some of the points that were \nraised earlier this evening.\n\n[[Page S7156]]\n\n  I believe all of us who have listened to the Senator from Florida \ncommend him for a superb presentation. I particularly welcome the final \ncomments he made with regard to what this debate is really all about: \nIt is about real people. It is about a great generation. It is about \nseniors who have made a difference in building this Nation, who fought \nin the wars, who fought in World War II, who brought us out of the \nDepression, and who really made this country great. The Senator brought \nus back to that element. I certainly welcome it.\n  All of us will be voting tomorrow, and hopefully we will keep that in \nmind.\n  We heard earlier in the debate and the discussion that the proposal \nof the Senators from Florida and Georgia misleads the seniors of this \ncountry because it is going to sunset in several years. Therefore, we \nare misleading our seniors by promising them one thing today that after \na period of years, by 2010, will not be available to them.\n  I am wondering if the Senator would agree with me that if we had an \nauthorization on Medicare back in 1965--say it was 6 or 7 years, and we \ncame back to debate that--we certainly would have gotten a prescription \ndrug benefit for seniors in this country much earlier than we are now \nable to, if we hopefully can get this passed. Does the Senator not \nagree with me that we would have assured some action? Will the Senator \nnot agree with me that in 7 or 8 years we will have the opportunity to \nfind out what needs to be done with this program to make it fairer and \nmore effective for the seniors, and that this would be a welcome \nopportunity to do so?\n  We should embrace this concept rather than retreat from it. I would \nbe interested in the Senator's reaction.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, one of the enigmas about Medicare and why \nit has fallen so far behind other major health care plans, such as the \none that the Senator and the Senator from Maine and I participate in, \nalong with Federal employees--one of the reasons is the system was \nestablished in 1965 and has not been forced to defend itself by making \nthose changes which are required to continue to be a modern health care \nsystem.\n  It is not only the absence of prescription drugs but the whole array \nof preventive measures. You would be shocked and appalled to know that, \nfor instance, illnesses such as prostate and various forms of cancer \nfor females, as well as colon cancer, have only in the last few years \nbeen added to the list of preventive services available through \nMedicare, and that a long, long list of items continue to be uncovered.\n  If we had had a requirement that forced us to periodically look at \nthis program as we, for instance, are now looking at Welfare to Work, \nwhich in 1996 said after 6 years it had to be reexamined and \nreauthorized--we are going to do so, and I think it will be a better \nprogram because it wasn't on autopilot. It had some real thoughtful \nconsiderations, analyses and improvements.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I couldn't agree with the Senator more.\n  Let me get to the issue of cost of the program. I have listened with \ngreat interest to the debate from the other side about their $24 \nmonthly premium. Yet, I have great difficulty in reviewing their \nproposal and finding where that $24 is even mentioned. Of course, it is \nnot mentioned, because it is an estimate, as they indicated. But the \npremium is written right into the law on page 26 of the Senator's bill. \nThen on page 28, the cost of generics, $10, is listed and then the cost \nfor the preferred, $40, is listed. It is written right into that bill.\n\n  Has the Senator, in his examination of the alternative, seen any \nstatement or indication of that kind of precision reflected in the \nRepublican bill?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The answer is no. It is because they start from a \nfundamentally different position. Our bill is what would be described \nas a ``defined benefit.'' You know what you are going to get, and you \ncan rely on it.\n  The Republican bill is a defined contribution. The Federal Government \nwill subsidize private insurance companies, if some can be found that \nwould be willing to provide a prescription drug-only benefit. \nTherefore, it is going to be up to the insurance companies to say what \nthe monthly premium and the deductible will be.\n  This is a chart which talks about what the costs would be for some of \nthe major brand-name drugs. We can tell you with precision what they \nwill be under our plan. A whole period of question marks are under the \nRepublican plan because the insurance company can say we may cover 50 \npercent of the cost, or we may only cover 40 percent of the cost, or we \nmay only cover 25 percent of the cost. It is up to the insurance plan.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So they have no idea today. It will be left up to the \ninsurance companies. They will make that decision.\n  This is an estimate--and a favorable estimate--that they are making \non this side; whereas under the Graham proposal, it is explicit.\n  I would like to move on to another area that was talked about by the \nSenator from Mississippi and others regarding the formulary issue.\n  Let me see if I understand what is in the Graham proposal. In the \nGraham proposal, it says that all generics included in the therapeutic \nclass must be on the formulary, and at least one brand-name drug but no \nmore than two in the therapeutic class must be in the formulary. It is \ndesigned, obviously, to obtain the deepest discounts. That is obvious. \nBut if you need a drug that is not in the therapeutic class, you can \nstill get it at a formulary price, as I read on page 29 of the Graham \nbill.\n  I thought the Senator from Mississippi missed this element. It says: \nThe eligible entity shall treat a nonformulary drug as a preferred \nbrand-name drug, if such nonformulary drug is determined to be \nmedically necessary. The cost of that drug would then be $40. If it is \nmedically necessary under the Graham proposal, seniors will be able to \nget it.\n  This is what was missing from the debate and discussion with our \nfriend from Mississippi earlier.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. There are two rates. One is what I would call the retail \nrate, and the second is the wholesale rate. Insofar as the overall \nexpenditures for individuals, if it is determined that individual \nrequires a specific drug, which is not on the formulary, and it is \nmedically necessary for that individual, then that particular drug will \nbe treated as a preferred drug. Therefore, the maximum amount of \ncopayment would be $40.\n  But, on the wholesale level, if you would turn to page 62 of our \nlegislation, it says that at least one but no more than two brand-name \ndrugs shall be included for each therapeutic class unless--this is line \n2 through 4--the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human \nServices determines that such limitation is clinically inappropriate \nfor a given therapeutic class.\n  If the Secretary of HHS determines that, let us say in the area of \nantidepressants, there needs to be more than two in order to be \nclinically appropriate, he or she has the authority to order that there \nwill be whatever number of drugs within that therapeutic class are \nrequired.\n  Let me point out, as the Senator already knows, that because of the \ndefined contribution nature of the Republican plan, there is no \nassurance that even two drugs in any therapeutic class will be offered \nunder their plan. As I understand it, the insurance companies, rather \nthan the Department of Health and Human Services, will determine what \nthe therapeutic classes will be.\n  So one insurance company may say, we will use a very broad definition \nof therapeutic class, another may use a narrower definition, and, \ntherefore, affect the number of drugs that are realistically available.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Does the Senator agree with me that there is no \nrequirement for a generic formulary in their proposal whatsoever?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Again, it is a leap of faith as to what you are going to \nhave, whereas ours is a defined benefit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We had additional time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Both times? I had 22 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. May I have 2 more minutes, just on this point. I ask \nunanimous consent for that, and the same additional time for the other \nside.\n\n[[Page S7157]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Just so we understand this, on page 37 of the \ntripartisan bill, in the formulary determinations, they say:\n  An individual who is enrolled in a Medicare Prescription Drug plan \noffered by an eligible entity may appeal to obtain coverage for a \ncovered drug that is not on a formulary of the eligible entity if the \nprescribing physician determines that the formulary drug for treatment \nof the same condition is not as effective for the individual or has \nadverse effects for the individual.\n  But there is no price limit on this, as I understand it. There is no \nprice mentioned in here, in contrast to the Senator's provisions that \nhave been included in his legislation.\n  His legislation provides what is medically necessary and then goes on \nto indicate what the costs will be, to ensure that they are reasonable. \nIn the other bill, seniors may have the ability to get what is \nmedically necessary, but there is no indication about what the cost \nwould be, as I understand it.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That is true, I say to the Senator. What you have just \nsaid contributes to a recent poll, done by the Kaiser Family Foundation \nin May of this year, which asked Americans: Which kind of plan did they \nwant?\n  For Republicans in America, 58 percent said they wanted a defined \nbenefit plan; only 33 percent wanted the Republican plan as is offered \ntoday. Among Democrats, 71 percent wanted a defined benefit and 23 \npercent preferred the Republican plan. Among Independents, 72 percent--\neven more than Democrats--wanted to have a defined benefit plan \ndelivered by Medicare as a means by which they would get their \nprescription drug benefit.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  That is why I agree with the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is why we have such strong support from seniors and \nwhy it is justified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank my friend and colleague from Maine.\n  Mr. President, I ask that she be entitled to whatever additional time \nshe needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I just want to make several comments in \nresponse to some of the issues we have discussed today regarding the \ntwo competing plans.\n  What is most important about this debate is that we have the ability \nto discuss the programmatic differences in policies that each of our \napproaches have taken with respect to delivering this prescription drug \nbenefit plan.\n  First and foremost, I should say that the plan we are offering is a \ntripartisan plan. It was crafted by Senators Breaux, Jeffords, Hatch, \nGrassley, and myself as members of the Senate Finance Committee, \nprimarily designed to overcome many of the partisan differences that \nmight exist on this issue and, hopefully, to bridge the gap so that we \nhave the opportunity to pass a prescription drug benefit this year.\n  I heard mention the issue about a doughnut that exists in our bill; \nthat is, the gap between the benefit limit of $3,450 and $3,700.\n  First of all, 80 percent of those seniors who would be participating \nin this program--80 percent of the Medicare beneficiaries--would not \neven reach the benefit limit of $3,450.\n  In fact, I recall back in 1999, President Clinton proposed a drug \nbenefit that provided for an initial benefit of $2,000. We are at \n$3,450. He had a much greater gap in coverage between that initial \ncoverage of $2,000 and a catastrophic benefit, which was about a $3,000 \ngap. We are talking about $3,450, and a catastrophic benefit threshold \nof $3,700. But what could be a greater gap than having this most \ncritical benefit to seniors sunset in the year 2010? In 2010 it \nexpires. According to the legislation: No obligation shall be incurred, \nno amounts shall be appropriated, no amounts expended for expenses \nincurred for providing coverage of covered outpatient drugs after \nDecember 31, 2010.\n\n  The legislation goes on to say, provided, of course, the actual \nspending does not incur, so there is leftover you can use for a \nprescription drug benefit or the program itself results in lower \nexpenditures. Nevertheless, it would require, in order to extend that \nmost important benefit of prescription drug coverage, additional action \nby the Congress, obviously, to provide for the funding of that program. \nSo it expires.\n  The second gap in coverage provided in this legislation offered by \nSenator Graham is the fact there is a major omission of coverage for \nbrand-name prescription drugs. There are more than 2,400 that exist. \nThe Senator's legislation is limiting to, at most, two brand-name drugs \nin each therapeutic class.\n  So it is going to be very limiting at best because it will deny a \nsenior the ability to have access to an alternative medication if it is \nnot called for under this legislation. It either has to be generic or \none of the two prescribed brand names.\n  As I mentioned earlier, there are many alternatives in a brand name \ncategory. Whether it is for arthritis or cholesterol or blood pressure, \nthere are many options.\n  I heard it suggested, if it is defined as medically necessary, then \nit goes through a major process. It has to go through the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services. There has to be an internal/external appeals \nprocess, so there will be a review process underway.\n  I can imagine there would be quite a lineup if there were a number of \nviews that would be required of the Secretary to make exceptions to \nthis legislation.\n  So there will be a whole process that would be required in order to \nallow somebody to take a prescribed medication that has not already \nbeen stipulated under law, according to this legislation. That is very \nexplicit in this particular proposal. I think we want to provide \ncoverage similar to what Members of Congress and Federal employees \ncurrently enjoy: options, choices, competition, variation.\n  Frankly, the preference of variation is important because it then \nallows a plan, for example, to use innovation, providing for a certain \ntype of drug or all generics, providing lower premiums than what we \nstipulate into law.\n  In our proposal we do have a standard benefit package described.\n  But what we also say is, we allow flexibility to design plans that \ncan offer even a lower deductible than $250, even a lower premium than \n$24 a month. We want to vest that type of flexibility into the design \nof a plan that could provide the maximum amount of benefits to those \nseniors who need this type of coverage. There is no such thing as a \none-size-fits-all.\n  The point is, in the proposal we have crafted, there is a standard \nbenefit. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office has indicated that \nour standards of equivalence are strict enough that the Medicare drug \nplans will have very little room to vary from premiums of cost sharing. \nBut they have the flexibility to design an even lower benefit in terms \nof deductibles or premiums. And don't we want to allow seniors to have \nthe benefit of that reduced price? That is a result of competition.\n  That is why the Congressional Budget Office has indicated that prices \nfor prescription drugs could actually increase under the Graham \nproposal, upwards of as much as 8 percent, if not higher, because there \nis no competition. As a result, there is no drive, no incentive to \nallowing for lower cost, because there are no competing plans. In a \nsense, the Government is delivering the plan through a pharmacy benefit \nmanager, so restrictive that it does not allow for competing prices, \nand there is no incentive for keeping the prices of prescription drugs \ndown. That is a major difference between our two plans. We want to \noffer the most choices, the most comprehensive, because we have \npreferred and nonpreferred drugs, lower copays in most all of the \ncategories.\n  We have the lowest premium per month. We have the maximum amount of \nbenefits to low-income seniors. We cover the donor for under 150 \npercent of the poverty level or below for seniors. We provide \ncatastrophic at $3,700 a month. It is a permanent, fully funded part of \nthe Medicare Program.\n  I hope Members of the Senate will consider very carefully the policy \nand programmatic differences that do exist between our two plans. They \nare very distinct.\n\n[[Page S7158]]\n\n  I know it has been suggested that our system is untried. That is not \ntrue. We benefit from a system that is comparable to what we have \ndesigned in the tripartisan proposal, and it offers the maximum choices \nto our seniors. We think it is important to create as a permanent part \nof the Medicare Program.\n  To provide for any limitation of that type is doing a disservice to \nour seniors. It is giving them a false hope to say that your benefit \nexpires in 7 years, unless, of course, future Congresses decide to make \na change. So we are predicating their future, their health care, on \nwhether or not a future Congress might decide to extend that program. I \nreally don't think that is the type of precedent we want to take. We \nhave never created a temporary benefit under the Medicare Program--\nnever. We have never created a temporary benefit, and we should not \nstart now.\n  I know there has been some question about the assets test included in \nthe tripartisan proposal. First of all, this assets test was not \nsomething that was newly created. It is included in the Medicaid \nProgram. Yes, this assets test is used for some Medicare beneficiaries, \nthe dual eligibles, the qualified Medicare beneficiaries, QMBs, and \nspecified low-income Medicare beneficiaries. So an assets test was \nincluded in our legislation that is the equivalent of the assets test \nin the Medicaid Program that was supported by this Senate back in 1987 \nand 1986 with overwhelming support. So this is not unprecedented. It is \nnot unusual. It includes the same type of waivers that are included in \nthe current Medicaid Program.\n\n  I welcome the debate that has developed between the two competing \nproposals regarding prescription drugs. It is my sincere hope that we \nwill have the ability to work through our differences beyond the \nthreshold of tomorrow, the 60 votes. I hope, again, that this system \nand this process are not designed for failure, that neither side gets \nthe 60 votes and, therefore, we move on to other issues and we defer \nthis to another year. It has happened far too often.\n  This benefit is long overdue for our Nation's seniors. We negotiated \nthis compromise in good faith, in the hopes that we could have worked \nthrough with our colleague from Florida, who I know has worked very \nhard, who is very genuine in his interest in developing a prescription \ndrug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries--I would have hoped we could \nhave worked through the process in committee, but that was not to be. \nSo we are at a point now of whether we can reconcile our differences to \nmove beyond the 60 votes and be able to work through the various \namendments and reach a conclusion.\n  The seniors of this country deserve that. I honestly don't understand \nwhy we can't at this point in time agree to pass a prescription drug \nbenefit program for Medicare beneficiaries. Our compromise wasn't \ndesigned to be an all or nothing or lines drawn in the sand. It was \nreally an attempt in good faith, in the spirit of consensus building \nand compromise, because you can't do it without the other side of the \naisle; there is no way you can possibly do it. That is why we started \nmore than a year ago to develop this tripartisan proposal with the hope \nthat we could have made this a reality for our Nation's seniors.\n  I urge my colleagues to give very serious consideration to what we \nhave provided in this particular proposal for our seniors. Hopefully, \nwe can come together and pass this legislation that is such an urgent \nneed for the more than 44 million Medicare beneficiaries.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I offer my congratulations \nand state my full support for the actions taken this week by the \nKetchikan Gateway Borough in acquiring the idle veneer plant at Ward \nCove. At a time when the regional economy is reeling from a long series \nof blows that go back to 1993 when the first pulp mill closed, the \nKetchikan Borough showed exceptional leadership by stepping to the \nplate to retain this vital manufacturing facility in the community.\n  The importance of encouraging an increase in healthy wood products \nmanufacturing facilities in Southeast Alaska cannot be overemphasized. \nSuch plants are vital necessities for Southeast Alaska to have good, \nyear-round, family wage jobs providing the economic backbone to its \ncommunities. Proof of this is readily seen in the current jobs picture. \nAs a consequence of the Clinton Administration's actions, Alaska's 2 \npulp mills and several sawmills were forced to cease operation, costing \nthe region more than 3,500 direct timber jobs in the last 10 years. Add \nto that the loss of countless indirect jobs and you have a formula for \neconomic disaster.\n  With Ketchikan's action, we now enter a new era. Its leadership will \nhelp Southeast Alaska embark on a much-needed recovery phase in which \nreal jobs for real people can bring new life back to litigation-weary \ncommunities. I congratulate Ketchikan and pledge to help in any way I \ncan.\n  A critical component of making the veneer plant a viable operation \nwill be economic timber supply. A spate of lawsuits by environmental \ngroups has artificially driven down the supply of timber and has even \nstopped timber sale planning on the Tongass. As quickly as possible, \nthe Borough needs to conclude an agreement with a company to operate \nthe veneer mill and together we must address the supply issue with the \nU.S. Forest Service.\n  To that end, I am calling today for the Alaska Regional Forester, \nDenny Bschor, to meet in a timely manner with Borough officials to \nreach an agreement to ensure a stable and sufficient supply of economic \ntimber to enable the veneer plant and the sawmills of Southeast Alaska \nto succeed. The new Bush Administration owes Ketchikan a commitment to \nbargain in good faith to help the community succeed in rejuvenating its \neconomy.\n  The Regional Forester has the statutory authority to offer timber \nunder 10 year contracts, and I urge the Forest Service to conclude \nagreements using that authority. Furthermore, I call on all Alaskans to \njoin me in supporting a 10 year sale for Ketchikan in recognition of \nthe community's substantial leadership in restoring the regional \neconomy.\n  The biggest impediment to making timber available is the plethora of \nlawsuits that have been systematically leveled against the agency. \nThose lawsuits, if not resolved soon, will result in more mill closures \nand further unemployment. The recent court injunctions on timber sales \nthat have already passed environmental review highlight the need for \nlonger term agreements.\n  The Tongass National Forest is fully capable of supporting the level \nof harvest needed to supply the region's mills without affecting the \nother legitimate uses of the forest. Less than 400,000 acres, only 2.4 \npercent of the Tongass, have been harvested since industrial harvest \nbegan in the 1950s. Moreover, each year about 800 million board feet of \ntimber is lost to natural tree mortality on the Tongass. That is nearly \n4 times the maximum annual harvest under the current management plan \nand 16 times the amount cut last year.\n  Under the Tongass plan, an average of less than one-half of 1 percent \nof the Tongass can be harvested in any given year. If offered in \neconomic packages, that small part of the available resource can be \nsufficient for the needs of the existing industry. There is simply no \nreason the Forest Service should not make sufficient economic volume \navailable to run a veneer mill and provide logs to the sawmills of \nSouth East Alaska. This action is essential to the\n\n[[Page S7159]]\n\noperation of the veneer mill and sawmills, providing jobs and \nprotecting families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/22/senate-section/article/S7159-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING MONTANA'S LOCAL BROADCASTERS\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nimportant role that Montana's local broadcast stations play in \ninforming and serving their communities.\n  Local broadcast stations across the country serve their communities \nin as many different ways as there are communities. A recent study by \nthe National Association of Broadcasters found that American local \nbroadcast stations gave almost 10 billion dollars in community service \nlast year. In Montana, it is estimated that local radio and television \nstations contributed 78 million dollars. These impressive numbers \nrepresented stations' Public Service Announcements, donated airtime, \nmoney raised for local and national charities and non-profits, and \nother community work. Montanans are fortunate to be served by stations \nthat are so dedicated to their communities.\n  Today, I would like to recognize two of those stations for their \noutstanding service.\n  In Helena, KMTX-FM provided more than $15,000 to the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency's ``Project Impact.'' This program works to \npromote local, grassroots initiatives that make American communities \nmore disaster resistant. KMTX was so supportive that the station's \ngeneral manager, Kevin Shaalure, was awarded the Outstanding Project \nImpact Media Individual. The local manager for Project Impact said, and \nI quote: ``Kevin and KMTX embraced Project Impact from the start, \nworking to give preparedness a high profile.''\n  Montanans have a long tradition of helping those who are less \nfortunate and Montana broadcast stations exemplify this effort. KDBM-AM \nin Dillon, MT, collected 600 coats for area students in 2001 through \nits annual Coats for Kids drive. With collection boxes placed \nthroughout Dillon and in neighboring Twin Bridges, the station \nencouraged its listeners to drop off coats, gloves, hats, and anything \nelse to help keep local children warm. The coats were then distributed \nby school teachers to students and by the local Women's Resource \nCenter, the Pioneer Youth Home and the food pantry.\n  I am proud of my local Montana stations. The United States system of \nfree, over-the-air local broadcasting is the envy of the world and \nthese stations show why. To them I offer my sincere \ncongratulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/22/senate-section/article/S7159-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO COL. GERARD W. SCHWARTZ\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to recognize and pay tribute \nto Col. Gerard W. Schwartz, former Chief of Staff of the Army Review \nBoard Agency, who will retire on October 1. Colonel Schwartz's career \nspans three decades in which he distinguished himself as an outstanding \nsoldier and leader.\n  A Utah native, Colonel Schwartz graduated from Weber State College \nand began his career in the Army as an enlisted soldier. Working his \nway up through the ranks, he earned his commission as a lieutenant of \nthe Ordnance Corps through Officer Candidate School. During his career, \nhe served in positions of increasingly greater responsibility, from \nbattalion level through the Secretary of the Army. He has successfully \ntrained and led America's soldiers at home and overseas.\n  Colonel Schwartz served in the Army during our operations in Grenada, \nPanama, Somalia, Haiti, Iraq and Afghanistan. His contributions during \nthis period contributed immeasurably to the successes achieved by our \nforces and will have a lasting effect on the Army in the years to come. \nMost recently, he served the Secretary of the Army as the Director of \nthe Military Review Board that administers a number of boards available \nto current and former members of the Army. He made sure that each board \nwas administered with justice, equity and compassion as expected by the \nCongress. His character, mature judgment, wisdom, and amiable demeanor \nhave earned him the respect and confidence of his subordinates, fellow \nofficers and the General Officers he served with during his illustrious \ncareer.\n  Throughout his career, Col. Gerard Schwartz has demonstrated his \nprofound commitment to our nation, his selfless service to the Army, a \ndeep concern for soldiers and their families, and a relentless \ncommitment to excellence. Colonel Schwartz is a consummate professional \nwhose performance, in over three decades of service, has exemplified \nthe courage, competency, and integrity that our nation expects from its \nArmy officers.\n  I ask my Colleagues to join me in thanking Colonel Schwartz for his \nhonorable service to the people and the U.S. Army. We wish the Colonel \nand his family Godspeed and all the best in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/22/senate-section/article/S7159-3", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CONGRATULATIONS ODYSSEY OF THE MIND FROM YARDLEY, PA\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \naccomplishments of a very bright and focused group of students: the \nWilliam Penn Middle School Odyssey of the Mind Team from Yardley, PA. \nThis team of seven children has returned from competition boasting \nfirst place out of nearly 700 teams from across the country and around \nthe world. Their perfect score reflects their top performance in all \ncategories of competition, and their exhibition of exceptional \ncreativity has earned them the Ranatra Fusca Award for which the team's \nname will be placed on a trophy at the Smithsonian Institute.\n  Odyssey of the Mind is a creative problem-solving program for \nchildren of all ages, from kindergarten through college. Through \nregional, State, country, and international competition, participant \ngroups spend the better part of a year working on a solution to one of \nfive problems as devised by the program. Contestants compete with \nstudents of similar age and must meet a number of criteria which \ninclude: limiting expenses to a strict budget, building mechanical \ncreations to accomplish specific tasks, writing and staging an original \nperformance, and earning points from the judges based on their solution \nto the problem they have chosen, style in solving the problem, and \ntheir ability to spontaneously answer a problem on the day of \ncompetition.\n  Recycling trash and other discarded materials to build a set and \ncostumes for their performance and to engineer a vaccuuming contraption \nand a water quality enhancer, the Yardley team focused on the issue of \nenvironmental preservation. With a theme based on ``The Wizard of Oz,'' \nthe characters of the team's sketch worked on cleaning up an imaginary \nenvironment found under a child's bed. The vision of Katie Barberides, \nColleen Considine, Andrew Ettenger, Jamie Hale, Greg Plumb, Brianna \nPollock, and Evan Verdini was awarded a perfect score from the judges \non the three scored fronts. These seven critical thinkers clinched \nfirst place at the World Finals in their division, participants under \n15 years of age.\n  I invite my Senate colleagues to join me in congratulating these \nyoung intellectuals on their enthusiasm for creative learning and the \nhard work they put into this problem-solving program. They represent \nthe American spirit of ingenuity and should be very proud of their \nindividual and team accomplishments. I wish them the best of luck in \ntheir future endeavors, and I hope they continue to enjoy learning \nskills through other innovative opportunities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/22/senate-section/article/S7159-4", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7159-S7160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, I rise to call attention to the 28th \nanniversary of the Turkish invasion and occupation in the Republic of \nCyprus.\n  In 1974, the Turkish Government sent 35,000 Turkish troops in two \nseparate actions into Cyprus, obstensibly to put down a coup attempt \nagainst Cyprus President Makarios and to protect Turkish Cypriots. \nHowever, after taking over 36 percent of the northern part of the \nisland, Turkish troops remained. This led to the Turkish Cypriots \ndeclaring their own government, the Turkish Republic of Northern \nCyprus; a government only Turkey recognizes.\n  Since then, the United Nations has maintained a buffer zone between \nthe two land areas. The U.N. Secretary General has called Cyprus ``one \nof the most militarized regions of the world.'' Despite the U.N.'s \npresence and numerous attempts at settlement, there have been many \ntragic results of the Turkish intervention: nearly 200,000 Greek \nCypriots have been displaced, over 1,000 Greek Cypriots and 4 Americans \nremain unaccounted for, over 400 Greek Cypriots remain enclaved in the \noccupied area, and the Turkish troop presence continues. For this and \nother reasons, I was proud to cosponsor S.C.R. 28, calling for a U.S. \neffort to end restrictions on the freedoms and human rights of the \nenclaved people in the occupied area of Cyprus.\n  We should be heartened that it appears that the settlement process \nmay be making some progress. Talks between Cyprus President Clerides \nand Turkish Cypriot Leader Denktash began in January of 2002 under the \nauspices of the U.N., and although they missed the June deadline for \nsettlement, they have continued their dialog.\n  The U.S. must remain committed to the settlement process. A durable, \ncomprehensive settlement that addresses the legitimate concerns of both \nsides and promotes regional stability would benefit Cypress, the \nregion, and U.S. interests. Cypress is an important partner and friend \nof the U.S. Most recently Cypress has cooperated in the fight against \nterrorism since September 11 and was of enormous help when it agreed to \nallow the 13 Palestians in Bethlehem to stopover temporarily on their \nfinal destination in the EU.\n  On the anniversary of the day Cyprus was divided we must renew our \nefforts to promote measures aimed at reunification and designed to \nreduce tensions and promote peace between the two communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/22/senate-section/article/S7160-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO ALPHA COMPANY, 1ST BATTALION, 141ST INFANTRY\n\n Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, it is my distinct honor and \nprivilege to recognize the Texans from San Antonio. Alpha Company, 1st \nBattalion, 141st Infantry, commanded by CPT Scott M. Mac Leod, \ndistinguished themselves as a premier force protection unit in \nproviding flawless security for one of the U.S. Army's chemical \nmunitions stockpiles. Captain Mac Leod's Texas Army National Guard Unit \nwas federalized in October 2001 and has provided force protection to a \nhomeland security mission at Pine Bluff Arsenal, the only active Army \ninstallation within the State of Arkansas.\n  Soldiers of Alpha Company, 1st Battalion, 141st Infantry \nheadquartered in San Antonio, TX, along with other elements of the \n141st Infantry Brigade were mobilized as part of President Bush's \nhomeland defense initiative and the war on terrorism. Under the \nprofessional and effective leadership of CPT Scott Mac Leod, First \nLieutenant Joaquin Campos and First Sergeant Jose Villarreal, the \nChemical Site Defense Force surpassed their mission requirements from \npredeployment, through deployment, to postdeployment. During \npredeployment, these citizens quickly and selflessly assumed their role \nas full-time soldiers, and while deployed these soldiers braved the \nelements 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. All the while, the unit's \nmorale remained high, and after 1 year, several soldiers volunteered \nfor another year. This impressive accomplishment is particularly \nnoteworthy since these citizen-soldiers were given a critical and \nextremely grueling assignment that kept them away from home for an \nentire year. When called on by their Commander in Chief, this proud \ngroup of Texans came to Arkansas, carved out defensive positions in the \nArkansas wilderness, and put forth an inexhaustible effort toward the \ndefense of our homeland. They literally have lived up to their motto, \n``Remember the Alamo.''\n  It is with great pride that I have risen today to pay tribute to the \nmore than 130 soldiers who make up the Texans from the Alamo. They have \nselflessly put their private lives on hold to answer the call of duty. \nTheir presence at the Pine Bluff Arsenal has been a powerful deterrent \nto domestic terrorism and contributed immeasurably toward the domestic \nassurance of peace. The people of Arkansas are grateful for each \nsoldier's dedication, and we are extremely proud to have had these \ngreat Americans as guests in our State over the last year. Alpha \nCompany's remarkable performance in this critically important mission \nreflects great credit on the State of Texas and the U.S. Army.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/22/senate-section/article/S7160-3", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/22/senate-section/article/S7160-4", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/22/senate-section/article/S7160-5", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nPERIODIC REPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO SIERRA LEONE \n       AND LIBERIA FROM JANUARY 18, THROUGH JULY 17, 2002--PM 105\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 \nU.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) of the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c), I am providing herewith a 6-\nmonth periodic report prepared by my Administration on the national \nemergency with respect to Sierra Leone and Liberia that was declared in \nExecutive Order 13194 of January 18, 2001, and expanded in scope in \nExecutive Order 13213 of May 22, 2001.\n                                                      George W.

RES. 41. A joint resolution calling for Congress to consider and \nvote on a resolution for the use of force by the United States Armed \nForces against Iraq before such force is deployed; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe joint resolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n\n calling for congress to consider and vote on a resolution for the use \n  of force by the united states armed forces against Iraq before such \n                           force is deployed\n\n       Whereas Iraq has consistently breached its cease-fire \n     agreement between Iraq and the United States, entered into on \n     March 3, 1991, by failing to dismantle its weapons of mass \n     destruction program, and refusing to permit monitoring and \n     verification by United Nations inspections;\n       Whereas Iraq has developed weapons of mass destruction, \n     including chemical and biological capabilities, and has made \n     positive progress toward developing nuclear weapons \n     capabilities;\n       Whereas in his January 29, 2002 ``State of the Union'' \n     address the President characterized Iraq, Iran and North \n     Korea as an ``axis of evil'';\n       Whereas the Secretary of State distinguished Iraq from Iran \n     and North Korea in his testimony before the Senate Budget \n     Committee on February 12, 2002, stating that ``for several \n     years now [it has been] a policy of the United States \n     government that a regime change would be in the best interest \n     of the region, [and] the best interest of the Iraqi people'';\n       Whereas in his February 12, 2002 testimony, the Secretary \n     of State specifically stated, ``With respect to Iran and with \n     respect to North Korea, there is no plan to start a war with \n     these nations'', raising the implication that the United \n     States had a plan to start a war with Iraq;\n       Whereas, there have been repeated reports in the news media \n     on U.S. plans to use force against Iraq and statements by the \n     President and the Vice President on the intention of the \n     United States to use force against Iraq:\n       (a) The New York Times February 16, 2002, quoting Vice \n     President Cheney saying, ``The President is determined to \n     press on and stop Iraq . . . from continuing to develop \n     weapons of mass destruction'' and intends to use ``the means \n     at our disposal--including military, diplomatic and \n     intelligence to address these concerns'';\n       (b) New York Times on July 9, 2002 quoting President Bush \n     on Iraq: ``It's the stated policy of this government to have \n     regime change and it hasn't changed. And we'll use all tools \n     at our disposal to do so.''\n       Whereas Congress has the exclusive authority to declare war \n     under Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution;\n       Whereas, the President has authority under Article II, \n     Section 2, of the United States Constitution as Commander-in-\n     Chief, which authorizes him to take military action in an \n     emergency when Congress does not have time to deliberate and \n     decide on a declaration of war or the equivalent \n     authorization for the use of force;\n\n[[Page S7166]]\n\n       Whereas, within the past half century, Presidents have \n     unilaterally initiated military actions in Korea, Vietnam, \n     Grenada, Lebanon, Panama, Somalia and Kosovo;\n       Whereas, President George H.W. Bush, although initially \n     stating publicly that he did not need congressional action, \n     ultimately requested authorization from Congress, which was \n     granted in January 1991, to use force against Iraq under \n     circumstances similar to the present situation;\n       Whereas, there is adequate time for the Congress to \n     deliberate and decide on the authorization to initiate \n     military action against Iraq;\n       Whereas, if Congress takes no action in the current \n     situation where there is adequate time to deliberate and \n     decide, there will be a significant further, if not virtually \n     complete, erosion of congressional authority under Article I, \n     Section 8 of the United States Constitution.\n       Whereas, this resolution takes no position on whether such \n     authorization should or should not be granted by Congress;\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress \n     consider and vote on a Resolution authorizing the use of \n     force by the United States Armed Forces against Iraq before \n     such force is deployed against Iraq.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH:\n  S. 2765.

A bill to enhance agricultural biosecurity in the United \nStates through increased prevention, preparation, and response \nplanning; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to address the threat of \nbioterrorist attacks on American agriculture. Agricultural activity \naccounts for approximately 13 percent of the U.S. gross domestic \nproduct and nearly 17 percent of domestic employment.\n  Agriculture is vital to the health and well-being of citizens in \nHawaii and every State of the Union. Hawaii generates more than $1.9 \nbillion in agricultural sales, and agriculture directly or indirectly \nemploys 38,000 people who provide Hawaiian agricultural products to \ndomestic and foreign markets, especially to our trading partners in \nCanada and Japan.\n  While Hawaii's agricultural economy was once dominated by sugarcane \nand pineapple, Hawaiian exports now include specialty exotic fruits, \ncoffee macadamia nuts, vegetables, flowers, and nursery products. \nVirtually all of these crops are vulnerable to pests and diseases that \nare difficult to control when they are accidentally introduced to the \nislands.\n  I am no stranger to the need to protect American agriculture from the \nmenace of alien pests and diseases. Throughout my tenure on the House \nAgriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, I was proud to support \nimportant U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, programs such as the \nAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service, APHIS. APHIS serves as an \nagricultural disease watchdog at our borders and around our farms and \nplays a vital role in preventing the introduction of agricultural pests \nand diseases to Hawaii. As a Member of the Senate, my appreciation of \nthese programs continues.\n  A single outbreak of a highly contagious livestock illness such as \nfoot and mouth disease, FMD, could cost the U.S. economy over $10 \nbillion. The 2001 FMD outbreak in Great Britain cost over $7 billion. \nIn 2000, the Banana Bunchy Top Virus threatened the Island of Hawaii's \n$10 million banana industry. More recently, the state has\n\n[[Page S7167]]\n\nseen an outbreak of the Papaya Ringspot Virus, which threatens a \ncommodity that earned $16 million in 2000. An outbreak of FMD in Hawaii \nwould threaten a $28 million milk industry and nearly $25 million worth \nof cattle and hogs.\n  These figures do not take into account the indirect effects on \nHawaii's economy if harsh restrictions were placed on travel in rural \nareas. During the 2001 outbreak of FMD in the United Kingdom, such \ntravel restrictions were imposed to stop the spread of the disease. The \ncost to businesses directly affected by tourism was nearly as high as \nthe cost to agriculture and the food chain. Clearly, the potential for \ndisruption of our food supply and our economy would be devastating.\n  My concerns are not unique to Hawaii. We must protect all of American \nagriculture, which is why I am introducing the Agriculture Security \nPreparedness Act of 2002. Federal agencies today are not as well \nprepared as they should be to respond to an agricultural disease \nemergency.\n  My bill provides the USDA with the resource and the response \nmechanisms to protect American farmers, ranchers, and consumers from \nagroterrorism. An agricultural disease outbreak, whether of natural or \ndeliberate origin, will require coordinated efforts by the USDA, the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, the Environmental Protection \nAgency, EPA, and the Departments of Health and Human Services, HHS, \nTransportation, DOT, and Justice, DOJ. This measure would give the USDA \nthe needed authority and resources to cooperate and coordinate efforts \nwith other federal agencies that have a stake in a rapid and effective \nresponse to agricultural disease events.\n  My legislation improves the government's preparedness and response to \noutbreaks of foreign and emerging agricultural diseases by: Improving \ncoordination between USDA and FEMA on preparedness and mitigation \nplanning for agricultural disease emergencies; improving coordination \nbetween the USDA and the DOJ to review whether state and local laws \nmight impede the rapid and effective implementation of emergency \nresponse measures; improving coordination between the USDA, and EPA, \nand regional and local disaster preparedness officials, to consider the \npotential environmental impacts of agricultural emergency response \nmeasures; establishing a public health liaison within the HHS to \ncoordinate emergency response efforts with the USDA and the animal \nhealth and emergency management communities; and establishing clear \nguidelines for the DOT and USDA to enforce restrictions on interstate \ntransportation in the event of an agricultural disease outbreak.\n  The National Research Council report ``Making the Nation Safer: the \nRole of Science and Technology in Countering Terrorism,'' released in \nJune, mirrors several other key provisions in my legislation. It calls \nfor: Stronger ties to the intelligence community to identify specific \nthreats to American agriculture; increased laboratory capacity for \nrapidly processing large volumes of clinical samples; development of \nrapid and sensitive disease diagnostic tools; development of improved \nlivestock vaccines; the use of statisticians and computer models to \nunderstand the transmission of agricultural diseases during outbreaks; \naddressing environmental concerns for the disposal of contaminated \ncrops and livestock; methods and standards for decontaminating areas \nwhere agricultural disease outbreaks occur; and communication and \npublic awareness campaigns about the importance of research for \nprotecting American agriculture.\n  My legislation complements P.L. 107-188, the Public Health Security \nand Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, which was \nsigned into law on June 12, by increasing the USDA's ability to develop \nthe resources and response mechanisms to contain and eradicate \nagricultural diseases when they are discovered on U.S. soil.\n  By enacting this bill, we can help safeguard American consumers and \nAmerican agriculture against threats to our food supply and economy. \nThe money and effort spent on protection from agroterrorism should be \nviewed as a general investment against the routine threats of disease \nagents and pests that infest crops and livestock. I urge my colleagues \nto support this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2767\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Law Enforcement Pay Reform Act \nof 1990 to adjust the percentage differentials payable to Federal law \nenforcement officers in certain high-cost areas; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nis important to Federal law enforcement officers and the people they \nprotect across America. I am joined today by Senator Warner, Senator \nLieberman, Senator Schumer, Senator Biden, Senator Torricelli, Senator \nGrassley, Senator Dayton, Senator Durbin, and Senator Clinton.\n  The legislation that we are offering will amend the Federal Law \nEnforcement Pay Reform Act of 1990 to ensure that the government treats \nFederal law enforcement officers fairly. This bill will partially \nincrease the locality pay adjustments paid to Federal agents in certain \nhigh cost areas. These areas have pay disparities so high they are \nnegatively affecting our Federal law enforcement officers, since \nlocality pay adjustments have either not been increased since 1990, or \nhave been increased negligibly.\n  All over America, Federal law enforcement personnel are enduring \ntremendous stress associated with our Nation's effort to protect \ncitizens from the threat of terrorism. Unfortunately, that stress has \nbeen compounded by ongoing pressing concerns among many such personnel \nabout their pay. I have heard from officers who have described long \ncommutes, high personal debts, and in some cases, almost all-consuming \nconcerns about financial insecurity. Many of these problems occur when \nagents or officers are transferred from low-cost parts of the country \nto high-cost areas. I have been told that some federal officers are \nforced to separate from their families and rent rooms in the cities to \nwhich they have been transferred because they cannot afford to rent or \nbuy homes large enough for a family.\n  An agent in the San Francisco area recently wrote to me to explain \nhow hard it is to live on the wages currently paid to federal officers \nin that area. This agent, a military veteran who continues to serve the \npublic, wrote: ``I have been with the federal government for 15 years \nnow and never thought that I would be forced to live in a trailer \npark.'' This agent further explained that she and her husband, who is \nstill in the military, cannot afford to buy even a small condominium on \ntheir government salaries. They can only barely afford to pay the \nmortgage on the trailer they purchased for $255,000.\n  Unfortunately, the raise in the cost of living in many cities across \nAmerica has outstripped our Federal pay system. I recognize that this \nis a problem for other Federal employees and I am prepared to work with \nmy colleagues to address this larger issue. The cost of living has also \nhad a very negative impact on non-federal employees as well and I have \nconsistently worked to ensure that all working Americans enjoy a truly \nlivable wage. The legislation that we are introducing today in no way \nsuggests that the needs of other workers should be ignored, but it \nacknowledges that as we continue to ask federal law enforcement \npersonnel to put in long hours and remain on heightened alert, we must \nprovide them with a salary sufficient to allow them to focus on their \nvital work without nagging worries about how to provide their families \nwith the essentials of food, clothing, and shelter.\n  The Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, representing more \nthan 19,000 Federal agents, along with the Fraternal Order of Police, \nNational Association of Police Organizations, National Troopers \nCoalition, National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, \nInternational Brotherhood of Police Organization, and the Police \nExecutive Research Forum have endorsed this legislative proposal. The \nproposed legislation will increase the pay of federal law enforcement \npersonnel in the following metropolitan areas by the following \npercentages:\n\n                                                             Percentage\nSan Francisco--Oakland--San Jose..................................14.02\nSan Diego, CA......................................................9.58\nHouston--Galveston--Brazoria......................................12.94\nMiami--Ft. Lauderdale..............................................9.34\nLA--Riverside--Orange Cty.........................................11.14\nCincinnati--NO KY--IN..............................................8.76\nNYC--NO NJ--SO CT.................................................10.44\nSeattle--Tacoma--Bremerton.........................................8.90\nChicago--Gary--Kenosha............................................10.76\nPhiladelphia--Wilmington--SO NJ....................................9.03\nDetroit--Ann Arbor--Flint.........................................10.57\nPortland--Salem....................................................9.26\nHartford, CT.......................................................9.67\nMinneapolis--St. Paul..............................................8.65\nBoston (MA-NJ-ME-CT-RI)............................................8.43\nSacramento--Yolo...................................................8.42\nDenver--Boulder--Greeley...........................................9.74\nWashington--Baltimore..............................................8.53\n\n  In these difficult time we must remain committed to recruiting, \nhiring, and retaining law enforcement officers of the highest caliber. \nHowever, we must also recognize that the federal government is in \ncompetition with State and local police departments that often pay more \nand provide better standards of living.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join us in this effort. I hope that we \ncan quickly pass this important legislation because it will improve the \nlives of the men and women who are dedicated to protecting and in so \ndoing it will improve the nation's domestic security.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS:\n  S. 2771.

Con. Res. 129\n\n       Whereas chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (referred to \n     in this concurrent resolution as ``COPD'') is primarily \n     associated with emphysema and chronic bronchitis, conditions \n     with which 3,000,000 and 9,000,000 people in the United \n     States, respectively, have been diagnosed;\n       Whereas COPD is progressive and irreversible;\n       Whereas as COPD progresses, the airways and alveoli in the \n     lungs lose elasticity and the airway walls collapse, closing \n     off smaller airways and narrowing larger ones;\n       Whereas symptoms of COPD include chronic coughing, chest \n     tightness, shortness of breath, increased effort to breathe, \n     increased mucus production, and frequent clearing of the \n     throat;\n       Whereas risk factors for COPD include long-term smoking, a \n     family history of COPD, exposure to air pollution or second-\n     hand smoke, and a history of childhood respiratory \n     infections;\n       Whereas more than half of all people who suffer from COPD \n     report that their condition limits their ability to work, \n     sleep, and participate in social and physical activities;\n       Whereas more than half of all people who suffer from COPD \n     feel they are not in control of their breathing, panic when \n     they cannot catch their breath, and expect their condition to \n     worsen;\n       Whereas 16,000,000 people in the United States have been \n     diagnosed with some form of COPD and an estimated 16,000,000 \n     people in the United States with COPD are undiagnosed;\n       Whereas nearly 107,000 people died in the United States of \n     COPD in 1998, making COPD the fourth leading cause of death \n     in the United States;\n       Whereas COPD accounted for 13,400,000 office visits to \n     doctors in 1997 and 668,362 hospitalizations in 1998;\n       Whereas COPD costs the economy of the United States an \n     estimated $30,400,000,000 a year;\n       Whereas in 1997, 24 States experienced death rates from \n     COPD which were between 41 and 61 deaths per 100,000 people; \n     and\n       Whereas too many people with COPD are not diagnosed or are \n     not receiving adequate treatment: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) November of each year should be established as \n     ``Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Awareness Month'' to \n     raise public awareness about the prevalence of chronic \n     obstructive pulmonary disease and the serious problems \n     associated with the disease; and\n       (2) the President should issue a proclamation calling on \n     the people of the United States to observe the month with \n     appropriate programs and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/22/senate-section/article/S7172-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4312.

Senator Daschle said, OK, we will make it 4 to 3--so we could get it \nto conference. Still no conference.
