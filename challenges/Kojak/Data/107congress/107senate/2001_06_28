We are going to complete the legislation, plus the \nsupplemental appropriations bill before we go home.\n  He said he would work Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday and \nWednesday, the 4th--take that off--and come back after that to complete \nour work. We are cooperating and doing our very best to meet the \nrequests of Senators Byrd and Stevens. Their last unanimous consent \nrequest has been cleared on this side as far as the filing of \namendments. We applaud the four managers who have been working on this \nbill. We look forward to continuing to work today.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 826\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 30 minutes for debate to be equally divided between the \nSenator\n\n[[Page S7012]]\n\nfrom Maine, Ms. Collins, and the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Breaux, \nprior to a vote on or in relation to the Collins amendment No. 826.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Virginia, Mr. Allen, be added as a cosponsor of the Collins-Nelson \namendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from Kansas, Mr. \nRoberts.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, here is the issue: The ability of States \nto determine what is best for themselves. That is the issue. Sure, the \nissue is the Patients' Bill of Rights. But if Kansas or Nebraska or \nMaine or Massachusetts or Louisiana or Connecticut--as I look at \nMembers in the Chamber--have an effective patient protection system \nthat is working, why impose new Federal regulations that will force \nthem to overhaul the system they have in place?\n  The Collins-Nelson-Roberts, and others, amendment would simply give \nthe State of Kansas and other States the flexibility to provide patient \nprotection required under this bill in a way that best fits each State. \nFor example, last year in Kansas we implemented a new law that assists \npatients who get into a dispute with their insurance company over the \nrefusal to pay for medical procedures. It is a long process, but the \nindependent reviewer will make a decision and reply within 30 business \ndays after an appeal procedure.\n\n  According to Kathleen Sebelius, our very good Kansas State Department \nof Insurance Commissioner, there were 22 cases that were closed last \nyear; 12 decided in favor of the HMO and 10 overturned the decision \nmade by the HMO. Now that more Kansans are aware of their ability to \nreceive this external appeal and receive independent review, more cases \nhave been filed with the Kansas Insurance Department. Simply put, our \nState commissioner, Kathleen Sebelius, and the Kansas State Department \nof Insurance are doing a good job looking out for the best interests of \nKansans covered by HMOs.\n  So the question is, Why does the Federal Government need to tell our \nState we have to completely scrap what we are doing and put into place \na Federal layer of new Washington-knows-best requirements? How good is \nthis really for families in Kansas, or your States' families? In fact, \nKansas has a large number of patient protections that have been in \nplace for years, and the list is impressive. The list includes a \ncomprehensive bill of rights, the internal and external appeals I have \nalready described, consumer grievance procedures, emergency room \nservices, OB/GYN access, prompt payment, continuity of care, a ban on \ngag clauses and financial incentives, screening and breast \nreconstruction, prostate cancer screening, maternity stay, drug and \nalcohol abuse treatment, standing referral, and the list goes on and on \nand on.\n  Under the bill we are debating today, many of these effective \nconsumer protections Kansas has in place will have to be thrown out and \nwe will have to start all over.\n  Our Kansas State Insurance Commissioner, Kathleen Sebelius, also \nserves as the president of the National Association of Insurance \nCommissioners. Kathleen has written a letter that clearly lays out the \ndevastating effects the Washington one-size-fits-all plan will have on \nState insurance markets, and she warns--listen to this, colleagues--\nthat this is going to be administered by an outfit called the Center \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services. It used to be called HCFA. If you \nreally want to turn over your state regulations to HCFA, that is \nanother issue that we can talk about for at least an hour or two. The \ncommissioner stated in her letter:\n\n       The proposed patient protection bills are far more \n     complicated than the Health Insurance Portability and \n     Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and will require considerable \n     oversight. To resolve these issues, the National Association \n     of Insurance Commissioners urges Congress to include in any \n     patient protection legislation provisions that would preserve \n     State laws and enforcement procedures, such as internal and \n     external review processes. Failure to maintain State \n     authority in this area could lead to implementation of \n     regulations that are inconsistent with the needs of consumers \n     in a State and that are not enforced effectively.\n\n  I think she nailed it right on the head. I am an original cosponsor \nof the Collins-Nelson amendment because it would allow States to do \nwhat they are already doing well. If these standards are not met, only \nthen would the Federal Government come in and impose its standards, and \nthe State would then be required to meet a higher standard in order to \nbe made eligible for the Patient Quality Enhancement Grant Program. \nOther amendments will have a stick; this is a carrot. I prefer a \ncarrot; other Senators may prefer a stick.\n\n  Let me just say, in summing up, can any other Member of this body \nhonestly tell me what is in this bill is better than what the State of \nKansas already has in terms of patient protection? Do you know better \nthan our commissioner, Kathleen Sebelius, or Governor Graves, and the \nKansas State Legislature? The answer is no.\n  My colleagues, support this amendment and give States a chance to \napply the standards they have currently in place, that are working. The \nexternal and internal appeals process is working. Don't make us \nreinvent the Federal wheel.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleagues.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the so-called Breaux-\nJeffords compromise amendment. We are dealing with a question of how \nare we going to allow the States to continue to operate their own \npatient protection bills that many of them have already instituted. My \nown State of Louisiana has passed over 35 different patients' bills of \nrights guarantees, and they are working fairly well. I think my \ncolleague, Senator Jeffords, wants to continue to allow those States to \nhave their State plans in effect when they are substantially complying \nto what we are trying to do here on a national level.\n  As Senator Kennedy said last night, if you had the Collins amendment, \nthere would be no guarantee that States would have a Patients' Bill of \nRights. They would not have to do anything if they so chose. A State \ncould say they are not interested in guaranteeing patients within their \nborders any rights at all, period. We don't think it is the right thing \nto do. We are not doing it. The only thing that they would suffer, if \nthey decided to take that approach under the Collins-Nelson amendment, \nis that they would lose grant money that is being authorized in this \nlegislation.\n  Well, I think that is unfortunate in the sense that we are talking \nabout a national program to guarantee patients the rights they should \nhave under this legislation. I think there is strong agreement \nnationwide that there is a need to have some kind of a national \nguarantee that covers all Americans, not just some Americans, not just \na few Americans, not just a handful of Americans, but all Americans, in \ndealing with their health insurance program.\n  Our compromise amendment does accomplish that goal, and it does it in \na way that gives the maximum ability of the States to do what they \nthink is necessary in crafting their Patients' Bill of Rights. The \nlanguage that we have put forth says that State plans would not be \nsuperseded. They will continue to operate as they do today, if they \nsubstantially comply with the patient protection requirements that we \nare instituting on a national level for all Americans.\n  That doesn't mean their plan has to be exactly the same as the \nFederal requirements. It has to substantially comply. That is a legal \nterm used in Congress on many other occasions. On the SCHIP program for \nproviding insurance to children, which we have enthusiastically \nsupported, the requirement is that a State can run their own program if \nit substantially complies with the Federal requirements for all \nAmericans that were instituted by this Congress.\n  On the Medicare Program, folks here in Washington understand how to \napply that terminology.\n  It is working. My State of Louisiana runs its own plan. I am very \nconfident that my State of Louisiana will continue to run the plan we \nhave in place\n\n[[Page S7013]]\n\nright now under the Breaux amendment because it clearly would, in my \nopinion, substantially comply with what we are talking about here.\n  We have a definition of what ``substantially comply'' means by saying \na State law would have the same or similar features as the patient \nprotection requirements and would have a similar effect. That is not an \nunbearable standard at all. It does not have to be exactly. It just has \nto have the same or similar features.\n  They can design those rights on States that will be tailored to the \nneeds of that particular State, and the only requirement is that it \nhave the same or similar features. That is not too strong a guideline \nto the States or a requirement on behalf of the States. I think it can \nwork. Most of the States, if not every single State, that have adopted \na Patients' Bill of Rights will find their plans in their respective \nStates will stay intact and will still be the State Patients' Bill of \nRights under this legislation.\n  If a State decides for some reason they do not care, they are not \ngoing to do anything, there should be the ability for us to make sure \nall Americans are guaranteed the rights we are talking about today; \nthat they are enforceable; there is an opportunity to go to court to \nenforce them; and that there is an appeals process when they are being \nabused.\n  This is what the Breaux-Jeffords amendment will allow. That is why it \nis a realistic compromise compared to the amendment of my good friends, \nSenator Nelson and Senator Collins, with whom I have worked on many \noccasions and will continue to do so in areas such as health. They are \ntrying to do the right thing. Their amendment will allow some States to \ndo nothing. Potentially thousands of Americans will not have any \ncoverage whatsoever if that is the decision of the State.\n  We are writing legislation for all Americans, and I suggest the \nBreaux-Jeffords bill is a proper compromise that can bring this about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Nine minutes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I thank Senator Collins for her strong \nsupport for this amendment, and I commend my colleague, Senator Breaux \nfrom Louisiana, for his strong support and consistent efforts to find a \ncompromise.\n  Certainly, the effort is an improvement over where we had been. One \narea I want to point out I disagree with my friend from Louisiana is \nhis suggestion that maybe the States will not do anything. If you take \na look at the charts that Senator Collins and I have up, when you look \nat all the checks, I suggest the States have been doing something and \nthey will continue to do something if the Federal Government does not \ncome in and take away both the incentive and the opportunity by putting \nin what is termed affectionately ``a floor,'' a minimum.\n  The problem is these minimums very often become the ceiling or they \nbecome, if you will, the top of whatever is being done because the \nStates will not have the same opportunity, nor will they have the same \nwillingness with the Federal deregulation, of the federalization of the \nregulation of State insurance as it applies to these health plans.\n  Generally preemption occurs when the States have not acted. I cannot \nimagine we are now preempting what the States have done on the basis of \nthey have done such a good job that we were able to pick and choose \nfrom the best of those protections to create this bill and now we say \nto them: It's a job well done; thank you very much, and, by the way, we \nwill impose these on you and we will make sure your laws will have to \nbe either substantially equivalent or consistent with, according to \nFrist-Breaux, or, with the compromise, substantially compliant.\n  I can understand our desire to take over the role of the States in \nthis area if the States have not done anything, but I cannot understand \nthe desire to do it when the States have done such a good job that we \nhave picked and chosen from the best of those efforts to comprise our \nbill.\n  It does not make sense to preempt under these circumstances. That is \nwhy many of us would like to see the States have the opportunity to opt \nout so we will have continuing experimentation under the Jefferson \nprinciple that the States are the laboratories of democracy. I am not \nagainst all preemptions, but I do have a question about this \npreemption, whether it makes sense under the circumstances with the \nprogress that the States have made.\n  The charts will show the States have been active. They have worked \nvery hard and diligently and are continuing to do so. Delaware just \nlast week enacted additional patient protection laws. What we need to \ndo is make sure we continue to permit the States to experiment.\n  I am also worried that with the application of these standards to the \nStates, we will not have further experimentation, we will not have \nfurther development of patient protections. I hate to think we are at a \npoint where the status quo will be sufficient for today as well as for \ntomorrow. I worry this effort in having a floor will result in it \nbecoming a ceiling.\n  If you look at the charts, you will see to one degree or another, \nwhether it is emergency room or whether it is the external appeals or \nthe internal appeals, that nearly every State is doing it. Many States \nhave decided not to do everything under every set of circumstances. I \ndo not think they ought to be penalized where they have made a \nconscious decision that that is not going to work within their State. \nWe ought not to have, in my judgment, a one-size-fits-all approach. We \nhave not found, if you will, the Holy Grail as it relates to what \npatient protection truly is. If we allow the States to continue to \nexperiment, we will find that they will be innovative and they will \ncome up with new methods of providing even better patient protections. \nAfter all, this is coming from the grassroots; this is coming from the \nbottom up.\n\n  I think we are making a mistake trying to drive it from the top down \nwhich will stifle and create the opportunity for stagnation rather than \nexperimentation. I hope that will not be the case, but I do not see it \nreally any other way.\n  The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, the president of \nthe National Association of Insurance Commissioners, the National \nCouncil of State Legislators all agree with this approach.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I yield 5 minutes to Senator Jeffords.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Maine for \nkeeping this issue alive. It is critically important that we defer as \nmuch as we can to the States because they are already set up for it. \nWhy not let them do it?\n  On the other hand, this is a Federal Patients' Bill of Rights. That \nmeans equal rights to everyone in this country, so there is a \nrequirement for uniformity as well as to make sure we get a firm and \neven enforcement of this bill.\n  A lot has been said about HIPAA and using HIPAA as an example of bad \npolicy, and it was bad policy, but it was totally different. HIPAA \ndealt with portability of insurance in the case of people being laid \noff work.\n  They said, if you do not do it, HCFA will come in and do it, and five \nStates said let HCFA do it, and it made a mess of it. This is \ndifferent. We are talking about the enforcement of rights, an even \nenforcement across the country. Yet we do recognize it is important for \nthe States to do it themselves. Many, if not most of them, are already \ndoing a legislative enforcement to require the appropriate and fair \nenforcement of the rights of individuals on health care.\n  This is an important difference. HIPAA was a mess, but this has \nnothing to do with that. This is quite different from HIPAA.\n  We all support the Patients' Bill of Rights. The question is who \nought to\n\n[[Page S7014]]\n\nenforce it. We say, yes, let the States that want to do it do it. On \nthe other hand, we need to make sure it is done fairly and uniformly \nacross this country. We do give the authority to the Secretary to \nreview it, and we also say he should lean over backwards to make sure \nthe States do it if at all possible. It is not a HIPAA-type situation; \nwe ought to differentiate that.\n  It is important that we also recognize that the compromise requires \nStates to have protections that are ``substantially compliant with'' \nFederal protection and defines this standard as having the ``same or \nsimilar provisions and the same or similar effect.''\n  The Secretary must approve the State's certification of compliance in \na manner that is in deference to existing State laws. If he does not \nact on the State application within 90 days, it is automatically \napproved. States that have their certification disapproved may \nchallenge that disapproval in court.\n  The amendment developed by Senator Breaux and myself requires States \nwith additional flexibility to implement strong patient protections \nwhile guaranteeing a basic level of protection for all Americans in all \nhealth plans. Requiring the States to be in substantial compliance with \nthe Federal law--not exact compliance but substantial compliance--\nprovides States with the flexibility they need to implement strong \npatient protections while ensuring that all patients receive the \nFederal floor of protections. Under this amendment, States can keep \ntheir own laws as long as their basic intent is similar to the Federal \nstandard and will have a similar effect.\n  The Secretary is required to be deferential to the States--give them \nevery break you can but make sure that the bill of rights will be \nenforced. Give them every possible opportunity to do it themselves \nrather than having to go to court. However, this requirement does not \ninfringe upon the Secretary's authority to determine whether current \nState laws will provide the basic level of protection promised to all \nAmericans in the health plans under the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  So HIPAA is just a totally different situation. It is a mess; we \nagree with that; but it is totally different. Do not get confused on \nthe HIPAA example.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. How much time is remaining on my side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Three minutes forty-seven seconds.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator \nfrom Ohio, Mr. Voinovich.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I thank my friends from Maine and \nNebraska for offering this important amendment. I believe the Collins-\nNelson amendment will allow the Senate to move forward and pass a \nstrong Federal patient protection bill without suffocating the patient \nprotections States have adopted over the last several years.\n  I wholeheartedly agree that the Senate should take action to protect \nthose Americans not covered under state plans. While the states were in \nfront protecting the majority of those insured individuals through \nstate regulation, the federal government has dragged its feet.\n  However, a federal patient's bill of rights should not preempt the \npatient protections that have already been passed by the states. There \nare more than 117 million Americans who are covered under fully insured \nplans, governmental plans and individuals policies, which are all \nregulated under state law.\n  My colleagues supporting the McCain-Kennedy legislation believe that \nthe federal mandates in the bill should apply not only to ERISA plans, \nbut also to those 117 million Americans in state regulated health \nplans. Apparently, they do not think that the states, which have \nalready acted and are already protecting millions of Americans, are \ncompetent enough to do the job. Instead, they think that the federal \ngovernment will do a much better job.\n  My colleagues on the other side of this debate want the public to \nbelieve that all Americans need to be covered under a federal patient \nprotections bill or else the quality of their health care will be \njeopardized. The fact of the matter is that the majority of Americans \nare already covered under very good, very comprehensive state health \ncare laws.\n  As a former Governor of Ohio, I was on the front lines in the fight \nto give working men and women in Ohio real health care choices. As \ngovernor, I signed into law five legislative measures and pushed \nthrough several administrative improvements to protect families who \nrelied on state-regulated plans for their health care coverage.\n  The majority of states, including Ohio, have moved aggressively--\ncertainly more quickly than the federal government--to reduce health \ncare inflation, expand access for the working poor, enhance consumer \nprotections and bring greater accountability to the system.\n  If the states had waited for the federal government to step up to the \nplate to provide patient protections, 117 million Americans would not \nhave the patient protections they currently enjoy.\n  The simple truth is that the states have been out in front of the \nfederal government in providing sound protections for its citizens. The \nfollowing facts prove this point:\n  42 states have already enacted a comprehensive Patient's Bill of \nRights;\n  50 states have mandated strong patient information provisions;\n  50 states already have an internal appeals process and 41 states have \nincluded an external appeals process;\n  48 states already enforce consumer protections regarding gag clauses \non doctor-patient communications;\n  47 states already have regulations regarding prompt payment; and\n  44 states already enforce consumer protections for access to \nemergency care services.\n  The states are already getting the job done for the majority of \ninsured Americans. But if we do not pass this amendment, we will be \nturning over to the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) the \nenforcement of state sponsored protection plans that are not \nsubstantially equivalent with the federal bill.\n  The fact is, HCFA already has its hands full. Administering and \nregulating Medicare and Medicaid has already overburdened this federal \nagency. Think about it. HCFA already has under its purview over 70 \nmillion Americans through these federal programs. Now, my colleagues \nwant to place the health care of an additional 170 million Americans on \nHCFA's shoulders.\n  The simple fact is that HCFA cannot handle the burden.\n  Those individuals on the front lines of protecting the 117 million \nAmericans with state regulated insurance know what will happen if the \nfederal government is given the responsibility to oversee these state \nregulated health insurance plans.\n  In fact, the National Conference of State Legislatures has described \nthe McCain-Kennedy bill as, ``. . . federal legislation that will \nlargely preempt important state laws and replace them with federal laws \nthat . . . the federal government is ill-prepared to monitor and \nenforce.''\n  Additionally, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners has \nmade clear its concerns about the McCain-Kennedy bill: if the federal \ngovernment unilaterally imposes a one-size-fits-all standard on the \nstates, it ``could be devastating to state insurance markets.''\n  The amendment that Senators Collins and Nelson have offered will give \ntrue deference to state laws and the traditional authority that states \nhave had to regulate insurance.\n  By ``grandfathering'' all state patient protection laws, Senators \nCollins and Nelson recognize that the vast majority of states have \nenacted comprehensive patient protections laws, as Ohio has done.\n  The amendment also encourages states, through Patient Quality \nEnhancement Grants, to review their current patient protection and, if \nthe state legislature and governor so desire, take action to mirror \nfederal patient protections.\n  I want to relay to my colleagues that I truly believe that this will \nbe the most important federalism vote that the Senate takes this year.\n\n[[Page S7015]]\n\n  In conclusion, it has been the traditional role of States to regulate \nthe needs of our States. However, both the McCain-Kennedy bill as \nwritten and the Breaux amendment seek to preempt what the States have \naccomplished in protecting patients. The underlying bill as written \nwould step over the 10th amendment which says: the powers not delegated \nto the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the \nStates, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\n  The bottom line is that the States have been involved in protecting \npatients a lot longer than the Federal Government, and they are doing a \ngood job with the protections they have put in place. They debated them \nin their State legislatures. Their insurance departments are doing a \ngood job of enforcing those laws. The Breaux amendment and the \nunderlying bill gets the States out of their role. We will have a dual \nsystem of enforcement--State insurance commissioners and HCFA. And I \ncan tell you, anyone who knows anything about HCFA in terms of the \nresponsibilities they have, knows they have a hard-enough time doing \ntheir job now. We should not get them involved in a system that is \nalready working on the State level.\n  I beg my colleagues not to go along with federalizing this issue. \nLet's take care of the Federal people who have been exempted over the \nyears because we haven't done the job we are supposed to do, and let \nthe States continue to do the job they have been doing.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to my good friend, the Senator \nfrom Connecticut.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Louisiana. I \ncommend him and the Senator from Vermont for their compromise proposal \nwe will be voting on shortly. I reluctantly oppose my friend from \nMaine, my fellow New Englander. I have joined with her on so many \nissues and have such great respect for her.\n  There is a title to this bill. It is not titled casually; it is \ncalled the Patients' Bill of Rights. We talk about a bill of rights. \nObviously we are all most familiar with our Constitution and the Bill \nof Rights we embrace and cherish so richly as American citizens. But if \nwe are going to have a bill of rights when it comes to basic \nfundamental health care, as has been pointed out by the Senator from \nLouisiana and the Senator from Massachusetts and others, then there \nought to be a floor that applies across the country to all 50 States. \nThat is what we are really advocating.\n  If the Collins amendment is adopted, then what you are developing is \na trapdoor in that basic floor that exists. Let me make the case just \nby pointing to one particular provision of this bill. That is the \naccess to emergency room care, Mr. President.\n  I have this chart to make the point. In the States that are in red in \nthis chart, they have laws that are weaker than the underlying bill \nwhen it comes to access to emergency rooms. We are not talking about \nsome grandiose new plan. We are talking about a fundamental right that \nyou can have access to the closest emergency room. In 27 States, they \nhave a much weaker provision than is in this law. We are saying when it \ncomes to a Patients' Bill of Rights, access to clinical trials, \nspecialists, emergency rooms, this is the floor across the country. If \nyou want to pass laws at the State level that are substantially in \ncompliance with that, we welcome that. If you want to do something more \nthan we are doing here, we welcome that. But if you are going to say \nthat we are going to allow weaker laws to exist in the access to a \ngynecologist, to a pediatrician, to a clinical trial, to a specialist, \nor to an emergency room, then we don't think that is right.\n  If you are for the Collins amendment, in many ways you are going \nagainst this bill. I understand that. I appreciate the fact that people \ndo not want to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights and just leave it up to \neach State to decide. But if you believe, as a majority of us do, and \nan overwhelming majority of the American public, that there ought to be \na Patients' Bill of Rights, a basic floor that provides these basic \nstandards, then you must vote to adopt the Breaux-Jeffords compromise \namendment and retain the integrity of this bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I imagine the Senator would like to close the debate, \nwould she not?\n  I believe I have 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. President, the issue is very simple and very basic and very \nfundamental. It is whether all Americans are going to be covered as \nincluded in this legislation. We do not believe it should depend upon \nwhere you live. We believe it should depend necessarily on where you \nwork. If a child needs a specialist to treat cancer, he or she ought to \nbe entitled to see the specialist and receive the treatment. If a woman \nneeds to be enrolled in a clinical trial that could be lifesaving, she \nought to be entitled to participate. If a breadwinner who is crippled \nwith arthritis needs a specialty kind of drug from a formulary, he or \nshe ought to be able to obtain it.\n  Now, our bill guarantees these kinds of protections, but with the \nCollins amendment it is a roll of the dice. President Bush believes \nthat all Americans should be covered. Every Republican bill that was \nintroduced and considered in the House of Representatives said all \nAmericans are covered. She covers about 40 percent of them; 60 percent \nof Americans are left out. We believe if you are interested in assuring \nthat all Americans be covered, you ought to support the Breaux-Jeffords \namendment. That will be doing the right thing.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, one of the myths in this debate is that \nunless the Federal Government preempts State insurance laws, somehow \nmillions of Americans will be unprotected in their disputes with HMOs. \nThat is simply untrue. Ironically, my friend from Connecticut makes the \npoint on emergency room care. Forty-four States have enacted \nlegislation guaranteeing access to the nearest emergency room. But they \nhave crafted their laws in different ways depending on the needs of \nthose States. Why should the Federal Government second-guess those \nlaws, substitute its judgment for the judgment of State legislators and \nGovernors' offices all over this country? It does not make sense. The \nproposal of the Senator from Louisiana would be both burdensome to \nStates and ineffective for consumers.\n  Does anyone really believe that a consumer with a problem with his or \nher insurance policy is better off calling the HCFA office in Baltimore \nthan dealing with their own State bureau of insurance?\n  The States have more than 50 years of experience in regulating \ninsurance. They have acted without any prod or mandate from Washington \nto enact good, strong patient protection laws. Let's honor their work. \nLet's build upon the good works of the States rather than preempting, \nsecond-guessing, and superseding their laws.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Is there any time remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine has 24 \nseconds.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I yield back the remainder of my time if the other side \nis ready to yield back.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time is yielded back.

We have the time allocated \nfor comments on it, and then have a voice vote on it afterward.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think we will have the Senator from \nMinnesota speaking for 2 minutes, and then I think we will voice vote \nthe Breaux-Jeffords amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague for his graciousness.\n  Mr. President, I understand the need to compromise, and I think we \nare moving forward in a very positive way. I do want to point out for \nthe record that what we are now saying is that a State need only be \n``substantially compliant'' with Federal protections as opposed to \n``substantially equivalent to.'' My big worry is that if you look at \nthis amendment, we are also saying we need to give deference to the \nState's interpretation of its own law and its compliance with Federal \nprotections.\n  I say two things to colleagues. No. 1, I think, in the best of all \nworlds, consumers would also have a right to appeal if they believe the \nState is in error.\n  To be fair, we want to give deference to what States are doing, as \nlong as we have strong consumer protections for everyone regardless of \nwhere they live. I also believe if we are going to do that, we have to \nmake sure not only that the States are given their proper due but so \nare consumers.\n  This amendment weakens the bill somewhat. I have said that to Senator \nBreaux. Frankly, more than anything, it would be helpful to have an \nombudsman office or something such as that in every State, where people \nwould know where to make a phone call, know what their rights are. \nThere are ways we can strengthen this.\n  I do not believe this amendment takes us in a strong consumer \ndirection. It is a good compromise in terms of where we are. I wanted \nto speak out and express my concerns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, several days ago in debate in this Chamber, \nI talked about how the employees of small businesses might lose their \nhealth care coverage if the provisions of McCain-Kennedy went into \neffect unamended. The junior Senator from North Carolina indicated that \nI was interested only in protecting the businesses.\n  Unfortunately, he misconstrued my arguments because we are concerned \nabout patients. We hope the employees of small businesses will continue \nto get the benefit of health insurance coverage by their employers.\n  I spoke about employees, however, because if this bill is not \nsignificantly amended, there are not going to be patients covered by \nthis bill; they are going to be thrown out of health care coverage. We \nare concerned about patients.\n  It is not only small businesses that should be worried about this \nbill, but employees of small businesses should also be worried about \nthis bill.\n  This amendment I offer today provides additional protection to \npatients. It provides protection to patients from trial lawyers, so we \nwill find out whether my colleagues are more interested in taking care \nof patients or ensuring that the rights to sue by trial lawyers are \nunabated.\n  There are a lot of words in the McCain-Kennedy bill, but there are \nalso some heavy-duty new lawsuits that are authorized.\n  The Federal claim of action really begins on page 140. It starts off:\n\n       In General.--In any case in which\n       (A) a person is a fiduciary of a group health plan, a \n     health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage in \n     connection with the plan, or agent of the plan, issuer, or \n     plan sponsor--. . . .\n\n  Cause of action starts off, No. 1, regarding whether an item of \nservice is covered under the terms; No. 2, regarding whether an \nindividual is a participant or beneficiary; No. 3, application of cost-\nsharing requirements.\n  Then there is the real hooker; there is the bombshell that opens this \nbaby up to anybody who really likes to file lawsuits. It says:\n\n     . . . otherwise fails to exercise ordinary care in the \n     performance of a duty under the terms and conditions of the \n     plan with respect to a participant or beneficiary.\n\n  There are tons of laws that are covered here--HIPAA and COBRA. This \nis a wonderful opportunity for our brothers and sisters of the trial \nbar to file lawsuits. That is the Federal side.\n  Then on page 157, it talks about State causes of action. It starts \noff, as this bill does--my good friend, the Senator from Texas points \nout all the bad stuff they do to providers of health insurance begins \nwith ``does not apply,'' ``except.''\n  Preemption does not apply. ``nonpreemption of certain causes.'' It \nbegins on page 157:\n\n       Except as provided in this subsection, nothing in this \n     title . . . shall be construed to supersede or otherwise \n     alter. . . .\n\n  It goes on page after page. There are exceptions for wrongful death, \nexceptions for willful disregard of safety of others; their definition \nof certain causes of action permitted. Somewhere around page 172 it \ngets to the point: Certain actions are allowable.\n  Basically, these pages of this bill provide tremendous opportunities \nto bring lawsuits. We should be talking about protecting patients, not \nabout protecting trial lawyers.\n  I believe it is appropriate now that we consider some protection \nagainst the HMOs and the insurance companies, important as that is, and \ninstead make sure that we protect patients against trial lawyers.\n  There are a lot of stories going on about trial lawyers: they are \ntaking advantage of their clients; some attorneys ask for 40 to 50 \npercent of any settlement; refuse to negotiate with clients; \ncontingency fees of 33 or 40 percent are common. Some trial lawyers \nflat out refuse to take a case based on an hourly fee, and they demand \nthey be able to take a huge percentage of the award. They also take \ntheir out-of-pocket expenses off the top before the contingency fee is \napplied, and that means in some circumstances the injured party, the \nplaintiff, gets less than the plaintiff's attorney.\n  I think that is outrageous. As a former attorney, as a recovering \nattorney, I realize lawyers perform useful services when someone is \nharmed. They should be justly compensated.\n\n  However, this amendment says enough is enough. The amendment is very \nsimple. Any patient who gets a monetary award through all the new \nlawsuits permitted in the McCain-Kennedy bill must get at least 85 \npercent of the award. If you are hurt, doesn't it make sense to receive \n85 percent of it? I can't see that being objectionable. The amendment \neffectively prohibits obscene contingency fees where large judgments \nare won and the plaintiff's attorney takes 30 or 40 percent after \ndeducting all the expenses.\n  Some may say lawyers will not take the cases. When we talk about \nsetting a patient minimum, we need to be cautious. Just as it doesn't \nhelp to have a right to sue your HMO when your employer drops health \ncare coverage, as would happen under this bill if it is not amended, it \ndoesn't help to have a strong patient minimum requirement if it means \nno attorney will take your case. This amendment includes two strong \nprotections to make sure access to attorneys is not threatened.\n  First, before the patient minimum is applied, the amendment allows \nthe attorney to be reimbursed for expenses incurred during the case. \nOnly after expenses are deducted from the award will a patient minimum \napply. In practice, this means an attorney can never lose money on a \nlawsuit that results in an award.\n  Second, we exempt certain lower level awards from the patient minimum \nrequirement. This ensures that the simpler cases that don't promise \nlarge awards can still be pursued and\n\n[[Page S7018]]\n\nare not limited by the requirement that the patient gets 85 percent. We \nhave set $100,000, which is above the median judgment normally entered \nin malpractice cases, as the limit.\n  I am not sure any State has taken the exact approach this amendment \nestablishes with a patient minimum, but 14 States have established caps \non attorney fees. The strictest cap is in New York where lawyers are \nlimited to 10 percent of awards over $1.25 million. That is the \nequivalent of a 90-percent patient minimum. California has the most \nwell-known cap on attorney fees. In California, lawyers are limited to \n15 percent of any award in excess of $600,000. When you add Florida and \nIndiana, which also have a 15-percent cap for the highest level awards, \n4 of the 14 States that established caps on awards of attorney fees \nessentially require that plaintiffs get at least 85 percent of an \naward.\n  Have these caps served as a barrier for plaintiffs? Have they denied \naccess to the courts? From the data we have, we conclude they \ndefinitely have not. The State with the toughest cap, New York, \nproduces almost twice as many malpractice awards per capita as the \nnational average. The national malpractice per year per million \nresidents, the U.S. average, is 49.2; California is 47.2; New York is \n99.5, more than twice the normal national level. From the other States \nwith tough caps, Florida has an average number of malpractice awards \nper capita and California's rate is about the average. Indiana, with a \n15-percent cap, falls below the national average.\n  It is hard to argue that the caps threaten access to the courts \nthrough attorneys. The California law has existed for at least a \ndecade. By not changing the law, the State legislature seems to have \ncome to the same conclusion.\n  Why do we take 85 percent? When you take out expenses and exempt \nlower level awards, patients should get the overwhelming amount of an \naward. For a patient who has been harmed, it is perfectly reasonable to \nask that that patient get 85 percent. For States with similar \nrequirements, there does not seem to be a barrier to finding attorneys \nand bringing a lawsuit if you believe you have been harmed. To my \nknowledge, none of these States has repealed their caps, demonstrating \nthat at least the State legislatures think they are working. By \nchoosing 85 percent as the absolute minimum amount to which a patient \nis entitled, this amendment simply reconciles Federal law with laws \nthat seem to be working in four of the largest States in this country.\n\n  We know of the horror stories. We have heard too many horror stories. \nI point out an August 16, 2000, article in the Los Angeles times about \nRodney King, who was brutally beaten by Los Angeles police. He is \ntaking a beating from his lawyers, he says. They made more money on his \ncase than he has. By his reckoning, they cheated him out of more than \n$1 million. In a nutshell, the man whose 1991 videotaped beating made \nhim an international symbol of police abuse said he thought he had a \ndeal with his lawyer to pay them only 25 percent of the award but they \nwound up showing King's lawyers received $2.3 million while he got only \n$1.9 million.\n  Another lawyer in California won a class action suit for police \nbrutality and civil rights and took a $44,000 verdict in the case, a \n$19,800 contingency fee, and collected $378,000 in fees awarded by the \ntrial court; the client received $810.\n  I have other examples. But one of my favorites is the Lawyers Weekly \nreport that a growing number of lawyers are putting arbitration clauses \nin the fine print, shielding them from being sued by another trial \nlawyer if the clients say they botched a case. The lawyers themselves \nwho are making the money off the large judgments prefer their disputes \ngo to private arbitration because arbitration is faster, cheaper, \ndecisions are made by other lawyers rather than juries, and there is no \npublic record. So they have recognized that there are certain instances \nin which it does not make sense to allow unfettered access to the \ncourts for people with a claim.\n  If a patient is harmed and wins an award through a lawsuit, it is \nperfectly reasonable to expect the patient will receive at least 85 \npercent of the money. Almost 180 pages of the bill protect patients \nfrom HMOs and insurance companies. I simply propose we add a few pages \nto the bill to protect patients from trial lawyers.\n  I see the Senator from North Dakota is on the floor. I ask after the \nother side finishes speaking that my colleague from Iowa be recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this amendment is one more in a series of \namendments designed to try to derail the Patients' Bill of Rights, or \nthe Patient Protection Act.\n  There is no evidence of unfairness in the attorney fee portion of the \nbill that we brought to the floor of the Senate. No one has alleged \nthat; no one has discussed that with us. This is the first moment in \nwhich there is an amendment offered and we have been working on this \nlegislation for five years. It is interesting that the amendments are \nalways designed to try to take the ground out from under patients, to \ndiminish the opportunity for the patients to address the enormous \nproblems they face in confronting a managed care organization that does \nnot want to give the care promised the patients.\n  This amendment ultimately prevents injured patients from finding the \nadequate legal protection they need in order to confront a managed care \norganization. Congress has passed over 300 laws allowing attorney fees, \nand the laws are described for every Senator to see in a Congressional \nResearch Service report No. 94-870-8. I commend anyone to that CRS \nreport which describes these laws.\n  I have not found any Federal law on attorney's fees that is as \nrestrictive as is proposed in this amendment. I repeat, there isn't any \nFederal law on attorney's fees that is as restrictive as that proposed \nthis morning on the Patient Protection Act.\n  Why, when we have this issue of managed care organizations not \nproviding the care required for patients and we have the opportunity in \nthis legislation to hold the managed care organization accountable, why \nis it that those who don't like this Patient Protection Act try to \ncarve the ground out from under patients once again with a restrictive \nproposal that almost certainly would diminish the opportunity of a \npatient to acquire access to an attorney to make that HMO accountable?\n  I find it also interesting that the concern behind this Bond \namendment is apparently excessive attorney fees. There are striking \nexcesses with respect to managed care organizations. Let me mention \njust a couple.\n  What about excessive salaries, excessive stock options? I don't hear \nanyone coming to the floor of the Senate complaining about $50 million \nin compensation that the CEO of a managed care organization receives. I \ndon't hear anybody saying that is an excessive salary for an individual \nto receive. How is it these CEO's get to be rewarded in amounts a large \nas $50 million? By pinching on access to care that ought to be \ndelivered to patients.\n  The opponents of our patients protection bill are not here on the \nfloor saying that $50 million paid to the president of a managed care \norganization is excessive. We just hear them come out here to say we \nare worried about an excessive fee received by an attorney who is \nrepresenting a patient trying to hold an HMO accountable.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield, of course.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware that William McGuire of UnitedHealth \nGroup earned $54.1 million last year?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am aware of that.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware that there were unexercised stock \noptions worth an additional $68 million by various people with that \ncompany, but McGuire held the most stock options, worth $358 million? \nIs the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am aware of published reports that say that, yes.\n  Mr. REID. Did I hear the Senator say he has not heard any debate on \nthe Senate floor this past 10 days about this excessive, exorbitant \namount of dollars to the people who run these companies and not helping \nthe patients? I have not heard that; has the Senator?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Nevada is correct. We have not heard one\n\n[[Page S7019]]\n\nword from opponents to our patients protection bill about the salaries, \nstock options, and the compensation paid to those who run the managed \ncare organizations.\n  Let me go back to the intention of our Patients' Bill of Rights, and \nthen bring it to this amendment. The reason we are here in the first \ninstance is because too many people in managed care organizations are \nnot getting the care they need. Too many people do not get the care \nthey need or expect from their health care plan, and they are not able \nto hold the health care plan accountable for it.\n  This legislation says there ought to be protections in place for \npatients. Patients ought to be able to know all their options for \nmedical treatment, not just the cheapest option. That is a patient's \nright. That is what we say in this legislation.\n  Some people do not want that. The managed care group does not want \nthat. The insurance companies do not want that. We say a patient ought \nto have a right to emergency room treatment when they have an \nemergency. That is a right that is in this bill that we are trying to \nget passed. I understand why the managed care groups don't want that. I \nunderstand why there are some who oppose it here in the Senate because \nthey stand with the insurance companies and the managed care groups. We \nstand with the patients saying there ought to be basic protections in \nplace.\n  This amendment is one more attempt, by our opponents, in a series of \nattempts just to undermine this bill, to say no, we don't stand with \npatients, we don't stand with patients in order to allow them to \nexercise the rights that are in this bill. What our opponents would \nlike to do is chip away and carve away at the foundation of this bill \nso at the end of the day the patients do not have these protections and \nthe patients do not have these rights.\n\n  This amendment, if it were genuine, if it were really concerned about \nfees, would not just address attorney's fees. They would address the \ncompensation paid to those who run these organizations, who make $50 \nmillion, $10 million, or $250 million in stock options. Is that \nexcessive? We don't hear anyone on the floor of the Senate talking \nabout that.\n  Why? Because this is not about fees. It is about with whom do you \nstand. It is about people who really do not want this legislation to \npass. They have been dragging their feet now, day after day after day, \nbringing out amendments to try to defeat the Patients Protection Act. \nIn every case, in every circumstance, they have failed. This amendment \nis the latest attempt to do that. The amendment limits attorney's fees \nin circumstances where patients would try to hold a managed care \norganization accountable. It limits attorney's fees, as I understand \nit, to an amount below all other attorney's fees that are now written \nin Federal law. We have it in a number of places in Federal law. I have \nreferenced the CRS report. All Senators can look at it.\n  This amendment proposes we limit attorney fees below all those other \nareas mandated by federal law. Why? Because here we are talking about \npatients. We are trying to advocate on behalf of patients. Why would \nanyone want to take away the patients' rights when they are confronting \nbig organizations?\n  One of the interesting things is I hear all this talk about a patient \nwho would hire an attorney to make a managed care organization \naccountable. I hear no discussion about the legion of attorneys who are \nhired by managed care organizations to deal with patients--none. Do you \nthink the big insurance companies and big managed care organizations do \nnot have a battalion of lawyers they pay? Of course they do. Maybe you \nwant to limit their opportunity to use lawyers? I don't think so. I \ndon't propose that.\n  Then why would you want to limit the opportunity of patients to use \nattorneys to make an HMO accountable? This just makes no sense on its \nface. It is one more step, one more attempt to try to defeat this bill. \nWe have had it day after day after day, amendment after amendment. I \nhope my colleagues will understand the last thing we ought to do is \nweaken the ability of the American people, who as medical patients \nexpected certain care but did not get it, to be able to hire an \nattorney and make that managed care organization accountable.\n  I would say one more thing. I would like those who offered this \namendment, who are indeed concerned about ``fees,'' to be concerned \nabout all fees. If they are concerned about lawyer's fees, good for \nyou. Then be also concerned about $50 million, and $250 million in \ncompensation paid to a CEO who runs a managed care organization. Be \nconcerned about those fees as well. You want to be consistent, bring \nboth amendments to the floor and let's debate both amendments.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Iowa is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. The two leaders are on the floor. I think they are about \nready to propose a unanimous consent request. If they are not now, \nwould the Senator mind yielding when they are ready?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would rather wait. Hopefully, they will do it right \nnow.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and I \nask unanimous consent to have the time run equally on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I support the Bond amendment and want \nto speak specifically to that point. It also deals with the point I \nhave made in other speeches--that this is a very good bill. But during \nthe process of considering giving patients a bill of rights against \ninsurance companies, I think we always have to keep our eye focused \nupon the fact that we want to give treatment for patients and not \ntribute for lawyers.\n  This amendment takes a very good approach in fixing the Kennedy-\nMcCain bill's provisions dealing with the liability parts of the bill, \nwhich, in my view, amount to nothing less than a trial lawyer's pot of \ngold.\n  I have always believed that medical malpractice liability laws should \nprovide adequate compensation for those who are truly injured while \nreducing frivolous lawsuits.\n  I firmly believe that it is a principle of any case, including \npatients against insurance companies, that people who are harmed ought \nto be made economically whole. But there has to be a balance between \nfrivolous lawsuits and making sure that people can be made whole if \nharmed.\n  I think the Kennedy-McCain bill fails to strike that very carefully \nneeded balance and instead creates a lottery for trial lawyers, which \nnot only inflates the cost of health insurance for all of us but also \nleads to more and more hard working Americans losing health coverage.\n  We shouldn't do anything in this bill that will cause people to lose \ntheir health insurance. We already have 42 million uninsured Americans. \nThe best opportunity for affordable health insurance as well as \ncoverage is in employer-related health insurance programs.\n  Don't forget that we have over 50 million insured Americans under the \nself-insured plans that employers offer. The case is that most of these \nself-insured plans come from small business more so than large \ncorporations. We should not be putting these employers and their \nemployees in a situation where that employer, because of the threat of \nsuit under this bill and losing a generation and a lifetime of savings \nin that family business, will not want to take a chance of losing his \ninvestment which has been built up through a family working together \nand investing everything back into the business because of a threatened \nlawsuit. If that is a threat, then you can understand why the employer \nmight just eliminate their self-insurance and in the process throw the \nemployees into a situation of having no health insurance, resulting \nincreases in the number of 42 million people in this country who now do \nnot have such insurance.\n  Here is how I believe this will inflate costs, and thus cause \nemployers and\n\n[[Page S7020]]\n\nemployees to not have health insurance coverage. Except for the $5 \nmillion cap that is in this bill on punitive damages in Federal courts, \nthe Kennedy-McCain bill sets absolutely no limits on what damages trial \nlawyers can collect.\n  When it comes to patients and those harmed because of lawsuits, it \nought to be an axiom of all of our public policy that the people \nharmed, not lawyers, should get most of the money from a lawsuit.\n  Of course, the Bond amendment then makes this more true than under \nthe existing practice. You have to consider that trial lawyers \ngenerally collect 40 percent of their clients' recoveries. In fact, in \nmany cases, you can have the lawyer's fees plus other court costs work \nout to where the person harmed is getting less than 50 percent of what \nthe jury might award.\n  Trial lawyers generally collect 40 percent of their clients' \nrecoveries. Incentives for bringing cases regardless of merit are then \nextremely high. It is a perverse incentive to go to court and to go to \ntrial.\n  But the real jewel in the trial lawyer's crown is this bill's \nprovision that allows the same suits for the same claims brought by the \nsame trial lawyers, whether they proceed in State or Federal courts.\n  Even though this debate is supposed to be about patients, the \nKennedy-McCain liability scheme isn't about patients at all. It is \nabout trial lawyers. In fact, as you can see, I call this the ``trial \nlawyers lottery ticket.'' I want to show where five out of six \nopportunities for monetary awards are virtually jackpots for lawyers.\n  Take a closer look. I would like to just scratch the trial lawyer's \nlottery ticket and see what the lawyer gets. Let's start with medical \ncosts.\n  Peel off the lottery ticket top, both for State court and Federal \ncourts, you will see ``bingo''--no limit on what trial lawyers can \ncollect in both State and Federal court. That is a jackpot that ought \nto make any lawyer happy.\n  But why quit when you are ahead? Let's take a look at what is in \nstore on pain and suffering. Peel that lottery ticket, and you can see \nwhat you get on pain and suffering. It is another jackpot--unlimited \ndamages in State and Federal courts.\n  The sky is the limit. That is where the trial lawyers are really \nwinning big.\n  Now, for the trial lawyer's favorite damages, punitive damages, they \nstand to reap tens of millions of dollars.\n  Let's see what this ticket offers the trial lawyers. So we pull off \nthe punitive damages square. You can see: unlimited damages in State \ncourt, and up to a $5 million cap in damages as far as the Federal \ncourts are concerned.\n  This is another big win. Talk about good luck: unlimited punitive \ndamages in State courts, and in the Federal courts almost unlimited--a \n$5 million cap. If you ask me, that is hardly any limit at all.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. No, I will not. I only have 10 minutes. And we lost \nsome other time on this situation of waiting for the leader.\n  Mrs. BOXER. On my time. I would ask a question on my time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Finally, if I could, let's not forget about class \naction lawsuits where multimillion-dollar damages are the name of the \ngame. So here again we peel off the lottery ticket. You can have class \naction lawsuits in State courts. You can have class action lawsuits in \nFederal court.\n  So bingo again. Kennedy-McCain has no limits on class action \nlawsuits. It even creates new grounds for bringing class action cases.\n  As you can see, everybody wins--every lawyer, that is--with the trial \nlawyers' lottery ticket.\n  What we get back to then is that we are more concerned about \ntreatment for trial lawyers, not treatment for patients. It seems \nironic that the very individuals this bill claims to protect are the \nones who lose. Despite what its sponsors say, the bill before us \nexposes employers to the constant threat of litigation, even for simple \nadministrative tasks and clerical errors.\n  What is the ultimate result? What everybody says they do not want to \never happen. People lose coverage. When this sort of perverse incentive \nis out there to threaten small business, particularly those that are \nself-insured--because they do not want to put in jeopardy their \nlifetime of work but want to create jobs, so they can be part of the \ncommunity, so they can have good workers and pay their workers well--\nand, most importantly, workers want good fringe benefits; and the No. 1 \nfringe benefit they want is health insurance--it puts it in jeopardy \nemployer-based coverage. Then the ranks of the uninsured go up \ntremendously.\n  I yield myself 1 more minute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, I would ask for 1 minute \nas well upon the conclusion of the Senator's remarks.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I object to that. There is plenty of time on that side \nfor the Senator to take her time. I am taking time off our side.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 3\\1/2\\ minutes left for the sponsor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would like to take 1 minute of that 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. So the ranks of the uninsured are going to go up. There \nare 42 million uninsured now. Do we want to increase that? No, nobody \nwants to increase that, but that is going to be the end result when \nthese self-insured plans are dropped. Then, of course, the employees \nbecome the biggest losers in this lottery.\n  So I urge my colleagues to reject this lottery and to support the \nBond amendment, which creates much needed patient minimums and ensures \nthat patients, not lawyers, get fair compensation for their losses.\n  I reserve the remainder of the time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I will use my leader time and not take \nany time off the agreed-upon time allocated for the amendment.\n  Madam President, I would just say on the amendment, there is nothing \nin there that would limit the lawyers' fees for the insurance industry. \nThose are unlimited. While they limit the legal fees for lawyers \ndefending patients, there is nothing to limit the legal fees for \nlawyers defending HMOs and insurance companies. I find that quite \nironic.\n\n\n                      Supplemental Appropriations\n\n  Madam President, I want to propound a unanimous consent request. I \nwill not do that at this time because I have been talking with the \ndistinguished Republican leader. But I want to propound a request, as I \nhad indicated I would, to lock in the debate for the supplemental.\n  There are a number of amendments that have been suggested. I know the \nunanimous consent agreement has been cleared on our side now for I \nthink 3 days. We have been unable to get consent from our Republican \ncolleagues for the last 3 days.\n  Now I am told they may object to even going to the supplemental, at \nleast initially. If that happens, of course, I will be forced to file a \nmotion to proceed. But I think it is important.\n  There was a story in the Washington Times dated June 26, and I think \nfor the Record it would be helpful if I just read it because I think it \ndoes capture the urgency with which we address the supplemental. So I \nwill take just a moment to read it:\n\n       The U.S. military would be forced to curtail or cancel \n     training exercises, facility repairs and equipment \n     maintenance if Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle holds up a \n     pending emergency budget until late July, according to \n     Pentagon projections.\n       The Pentagon provided a list of hardships at the request of \n     Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott.

He used the list yesterday \n     to criticize Mr. Daschle for threatening to delay action on a \n     $6.5 billion supplemental budget bill until the Senate \n     completes work on a contentious patients' bill of rights. \n     That delay would push approval of the fiscal 2001 defense \n     legislation until late July or beyond.\n       ``If we don't get this bill completed by . . . mid-July, \n     we're going to have canceling of base-property maintenance, \n     [and] holding some of our deployed units where they are \n     overseas until the end of the fiscal year [Sept. 30],'' said \n     Mr. Lott, ``So we're really pushing the envelope when it \n     comes to the needs of our military personnel in health as \n     well as in steaming hours.''\n       Picking his first confrontation with Democrats since they \n     took control of the Senate, Mr. Lott also accused Mr. Daschle \n     of sacrificing the nation's urgent energy needs in order to \n     push through the health care bill.\n       Neglecting energy and defense has ``very dangerous \n     implications for the security and prosperity of the American \n     people,'' the Mississippi Republican said.\n       Nearly all the budget bill's funding goes for replenishing \n     military training accounts depleted by peacekeeping missions \n     in the Balkans and elsewhere.

But incoming Defense \n     Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld nixed the request. The White \n     House scrubbed the numbers and presented the $6.5 billion \n     proposal. The House already has approved that number, as did \n     the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n       Mr. Lott said he suggested the Senate OK the emergency \n     defense bill by unanimous consent, since both chambers \n     approved Mr. Bush's list of spending requests without adding \n     home-state projects, as was the practice with supplemental \n     bills the past few years. But Mr. Lott said Mr. Daschle, \n     South Dakota Democrat, rejected that idea.\n       Mr. Dashle, despite earlier indications that he would allow \n     a speedy vote on the spending bill, told colleagues Friday \n     that he would not bring it to the floor until the Senate \n     completes work on a patients' bill of rights.\n       Republicans have been slowing down final passage of that \n     legislation, raising concerns about employer liability and \n     increasing premiums. Their tactics could derail Mr. Daschle's \n     stated goal of finishing the bill by Friday.\n       The fate of the health care bill is particularly sensitive \n     for Mr. Daschle because it is his first test of his ability \n     to move legislation since becoming majority leader. Senate \n     committees remain unable to take up new legislation due to \n     prolonged negotiations between the parties on how to \n     reorganize and whether to guarantee votes on Supreme Court \n     nominees.\n       Daschle spokeswoman Molly Rowley said Mr. Daschle wants to \n     complete the patients' bill of rights, the spending bill and \n     the reorganization before the Senate adjourns for the Fourth \n     of July recess.\n       ``We think all three of these things can be done this week \n     before we leave,'' she said.\n       Sen. Robert C. Byrd, West Virginia Democrat and chairman of \n     the Appropriations Committee that approved the spending bill \n     last week, said yesterday he was ``not in a position to \n     comment'' on Mr. Daschle's intentions.\n       ``The leader has to balance a lot of things,'' Mr. Byrd \n     said, ``I'm sure he'll get to the [spending bill] when he \n     thinks he can.''\n       Mr. Lott said Mr. Daschle rejected his suggestion to \n     approve the spending bill by today, making it unlikely that a \n     conference bill could be worked out before the House adjourns \n     Friday for a weeklong Independence Day vacation.\n       ``We need to get this defense and other issues supplemental \n     done before we leave, because it is critical for nonessential \n     operations like pilot training, steaming hours, fleet \n     exercises,'' Mr. Lott said, ``I'm very worried that by not \n     acting this week on the defense supplemental appropriations \n     bill we're asking for more delay and even more problems with \n     our defense needs.''\n       Mr. Daschle has been threatening to cancel the Senate's \n     vacation to compel Republicans to finish work on the health \n     care bill.\n       Republicans and Democrats have been sniping politely about \n     legislative priorities ever since the power shift in the \n     Senate. Republican lawmakers have been pressing for passage \n     of President Bush's energy plan, but Mr. Daschle has \n     expressed more interest in the health-care legislation, as \n     well as increasing the minimum wage and passing a hatecrimes \n     bill.\n       Mr. Lott said yesterday that Democratic leaders do not \n     intend to address the energy issue by the end of July.\n       Congress is in recess for the entire month of August, \n     meaning the Senate would not take up the administration's \n     energy plan unitl September at the earliest.\n       House and Senate Republicans met with White House \n     representatives late yesterday and agreed to call attention \n     to Democrats' inaction on an energy plan over the recess next \n     week. The meeting took place in the office of House Majority \n     Whip Tom DeLay, Texas Republican.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd came \nto me a couple of weeks ago and asked for a special exemption from the \nunderstanding we have been working under here in the Senate that no \nofficial action can take place on any legislation until we have broken \nthe impasse on the organizing resolution and assigned each committee \nits full complement of members. I, of course, agreed, in the interest \nof urgency, to allow the Appropriations Committee to work its will and \nto finish this supplemental, which is what it did. I applaud both of \nthem for taking the action they did.\n  The House, of course, has now acted. Now it is up to us. A couple of \ndays ago the President called me and said: Above all, I hope that you \nwill pass the supplemental before you leave. I gave the President my \npersonal assurance that we would pass the supplemental here in the \nSenate before we leave.\n  Now I am told that there are some who would prefer to take vacation \nrather than finish the work. Madam President, we can't do that. We \ncan't take vacation until the work is done. We can't take vacation \nuntil the Patient Protection Act is done. We can't take vacation until \nthe supplemental is done. We can't take vacation until the organizing \nresolution is done. It is as simple as that.\n  I will propound a unanimous consent request at a later time because I \nknow Senator Stevens wanted to come to the floor. We have been working \nthrough this. As I say, I thought we had an agreement. In fact, I was \ntold we were able to propound the request an hour or so ago. \nUnfortunately, that report apparently was in error.\n  I am going to do what we have to do, in part because as Senator Lott \nhas said so clearly--and forcefully--the alternative to not acting is \nto risk what the Washington Times has reported, to wreak havoc with the \nmilitary, to keep them from getting their job done, to actually \nendanger our military personnel in some ways. We are not going to be \naccused of endangering the military. We have to do what the President, \nthe Commander in Chief, requested. That is what we are doing here.\n  We will offer the unanimous consent request to proceed. If that \nfails, I will file a cloture motion on the motion to proceed, and when \nit ripens we will have the vote. But we will have the vote.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator from South Dakota yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask the majority leader, isn't it the case that the \nthree issues that are outstanding--finishing the Patients Protection \nAct, passing the supplemental, and the organizing resolution--could be \ndone rather quickly? We have, after all, been debating\n\n[[Page S7022]]\n\nthe Patients Protection Act for some long while. We have gone through \nmost of the major amendments. We started debating this issue 5 years \nago. It has now been on the floor for some while. We have done most of \nthe major amendments. If we could complete the Patient's Bill of Rights \nlater today we could move on to other business. I am a member of the \nAppropriations Committee. When we passed the supplemental bill, it was \npassed almost with no amendments in the House of Representatives; that \nbill is very important--we did it with very little debate in the full \nAppropriations Committee. The organizing resolution can be completed, I \nunderstand, with perhaps one vote.\n  It is the case, isn't it, that all of this could be done perhaps this \nevening if we had cooperation? Is that not the case?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct. As I understand it, this bill \nwas not subject to amendment in the House. It passed overwhelmingly in \na very short period of time. I don't know why we would have to elongate \nor unnecessarily prolong the debate on this side.\n  Whatever length of time may be required to consider this bill, we \nwill do that. All I am saying is that we have to do it before we leave.\n  I see both the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee and the \ndistinguished Republican leader are on the floor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the majority leader, following \nconsultation with the Republican leader, may proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 76, S. 1077, the supplemental \nappropriations bill and that the bill be considered under the following \nlimitations: That only first-degree amendments in order other than a \nmanagers' amendment be the following list which is at the desk--I won't \nread the list at this point--that any listed first-degree amendment be \nsubject to relevant second-degree amendments, that any time limitation \nfor debate on a first-degree amendment be specified in this agreement; \nthen any second-degree amendment to that amendment be accorded the same \ntime limit; that upon disposition of the above amendments, the bill be \nadvanced to third reading; the Senate then proceed to the consideration \nof Calendar No. 77, H.R. 2216; that all after the enacting clause be \nstricken and the text of S. 1077, as amended, be inserted in lieu \nthereof; that the bill be advanced to third reading, and the Senate \nthen vote on passage of the bill with no intervening action or debate.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that S. 1077 be returned to the \ncalendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. First of all, I think it is important that we dispose of \nthis issue as quickly as possible so that we can get back to the debate \non the amendments that are pending. There are still a number of very \nimportant amendments that Senators wish to offer with regard to the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. I know the Senator from Nevada has been \nworking on this issue and knows that. These are substantive and \nimportant amendments.\n  When it was suggested by the Senator from North Dakota that most of \nthe major amendments have already been offered and considered, I don't \nbelieve that is accurate. Of course, I guess how important they are is \nin the eye of the beholder or the offeror of the amendment. I think it \nis important that we address this issue and get back to having debate \nand hopefully votes this afternoon and into the night, however long it \ntakes to deal with important issues that still need to be addressed.\n  We still believe very strongly that this bill has not been corrected \nin terms of its major problems in the likelihood of loss of coverage \nand increased premiums, and when, how, and where lawsuits are going to \nbe filed instead of making sure patients get the health care coverage \nthey need. We can resolve this relatively quickly and then go back to \nthat.\n  With regard to the organizational resolution, we continue to exchange \nideas. I think it is possible that it could be handled with only one \nvote, or it may take three, but we are hoping we can get that worked \nout. I know there are a couple of letters that are being reviewed now \non both sides that might make it unnecessary to have three recorded \nvotes. I think we are going to have two letters dealing with the \nquestion of public disclosure of the blue slips which can be used by \nSenators to block a judicial nomination. There is a strong belief on \nboth sides that those should be made public and not just handled \nsecretly, as has sometimes been the case but not always the case, in \nthe past.\n  Also, we are looking to see if we can get some agreement in writing \nthat we would continue to do what the precedents are with regard to \nSupreme Court nominees. I believe going back all the way to 1881, the \nwhole Senate has voted on Supreme Court nominees even when the \ncommittee has voted on a tie or negatively. But we are working on that, \nand I would like us to get that resolved in the next 24 hours myself.\n\n  With regard to this unanimous consent request, I had really hoped we \ncould do it Monday. I thought it could have been, I believed it could \nhave been done Monday in a very limited period of time without this \nrash of amendments. I think we could have gotten an agreement that \nthere be no amendments. That didn't happen for whatever reason.\n  Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens had indicated they would like to \nhave done it even last night so that we could have done it quicker and \nso we could perhaps have gotten into a conference with the House. The \nproblem now is that if we don't take this up immediately, right now, we \nare not going to be able to get a conference agreement. There is no \nchance of a conference agreement until after the Fourth of July recess, \neven if the Senate should act sometime tomorrow or Saturday. I really \nhad hoped we could do it earlier so we could get into conference, get \nit completed, and send it to the President. That now appears not to be \nlikely, unless the Senate wants to turn right now to consider this very \nimportant supplemental appropriations resolution. I would like that to \nbe considered.\n  Failing that, I think we are not going to object to agreeing to this \nunanimous consent request, but there are 35 amendments now--34 or 35. \nSome of them clearly are important to Senators involved on both sides \nof the aisle. Senator Bond has a couple of them. Senator Boxer has one \nI think she probably feels very strongly about. Senators Cleland, \nRoberts, and others have amendments with regard to the B-1 bomber. \nSenator Conrad, I haven't talked to him, but he has one on Turtle \nMountain Indians. As you look down the list, some of them are not just \nrelevant, some of them are amendments about which Senators are going to \ncare greatly. And it looks to me as if you are talking about an \nextended period of time at this point to complete action on this \nlegislation. I regret that.\n  If we could get an agreement to go to it now--I see Senator McCain; I \nknow he has an amendment he feels very strongly about--if we could do \nthat now, maybe we could get some time agreements and move to \ncompletion.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Alaska, the senior member of the \nAppropriations Committee on the Republican side, who wants to speak. I \nam glad to yield under my reservation, Madam President.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I am here to urge that the Senate take \nthe bill up now. I think if we took it up now, working with the people \nwho have those amendments, we ought to be able to finish it today. I \nthink if we finish today, the House will stay, and we could complete \nthis before the recess. If we wait until Monday after the House has \nalready gone home, it will be very difficult to get them back, even \nfrom the point of view of getting travel arrangements for the House to \ncome back on Monday or Tuesday.\n  I cannot speak for the chairman, but I can say that we both have \nsought for the last 2 weeks to try to have this bill become law in time \nto meet the needs of the armed services. Very clearly, they have been \ndemonstrated now. There is no question that if we do not get this bill \npassed, there is going to be an impact on the armed services. I will \ncommit myself to both leaders to work with all Members to see what we \ncan work out, to constrict the time and finish it tonight, if we can \ntake it up now.\n\n[[Page S7023]]\n\n That might put pressure on the other bill, too.\n  I urge that the organization resolution get resolved. I personally \nsay to both leaders, my Kenai Peninsula is on fire. That is where I \nwant to go fishing next week, too. So there is a disaster and the \nurgent call of the pink salmon to respond to.\n  I pledge myself to work even harder than Senator Reid does to find \nsome way to constrict this time so we can vote on this and get it to \nthe House and bring it back so we can all vote on the bill before we go \nhome. I plead with the leaders to let us have the reins for a few hours \nand see what we can do. I think we can finish this bill tonight.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, under my reservation, I will propound as \nan alternative unanimous consent agreement the same proposal the \nmajority leader has made, except that in the first paragraph under \nconsultation with the Republican leader, I would add ``may proceed \nimmediately to the consideration of Calendar No. 76, S. 1077.'' I make \nthat in the form of a unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I have \noffered this to our Republican colleagues now for several days. I have \nsaid, give me a definitive list that will allow us to finish our work \non the Patients' Bill of Rights. We will proceed immediately to the \nsupplemental, finish it, and then return to the Patients' Bill of \nRights with the understanding that we will complete work on that as \nwell.\n  Unfortunately, our Republican colleagues have been unable to do that. \nMy offer still stands. Give me a definitive list that we can complete \nbefore we leave, and I will go immediately to the supplemental. I have \noffered it privately to Senator Lott. I have offered it to our other \ncolleagues. That offer still stands. Until we get that assurance, I \nwill object.\n  Mr. LOTT. Under my reservation, I have one inquiry. I thought we had \na definitive list. It may be big, but I thought we had a list of \namendments still pending out there.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I have not seen it.\n  Mr. LOTT. We will work on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. REID. While the two leaders are here, if I may chime in, first of \nall, Senator Daschle has read the importance of this supplemental. If \nit is as important as has been read into the Record, it would seem to \nme the House should hang around a little while longer.\n  I say to the Republican leader and our majority leader, I haven't \nseen a list of amendments. Everybody knows we have just a few important \namendments to finish the Patients' Bill of Rights. If we are given a \nlist of amendments that is large in number, I don't think that is in \nkeeping with what I think should be the general agreement to finish the \nlegislation. If we are given a list of 10, 20, 30, 50 amendments, I \nsuggest to the majority leader, that is not part of the deal. We have a \nfew amendments left to go.\n  Mr. LOTT. If Senator Daschle will yield to respond briefly, I thought \nyou had been given a list. I am going to make sure you have it and then \nwe can evaluate that and work on it.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I offer a unanimous consent request \nthat the Senate complete its work on the Patient Protection Act by 6 \no'clock tonight, and we have final passage by 6 o'clock tonight. If we \ncan agree to that right now, I will move to the supplemental at 12 \no'clock this afternoon.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I object to that. Obviously, I have to \nconsult with the managers of the legislation on our side about the \namendment list, which is very long, and I have it now, and about what \nis possible in terms of completing it. I don't think it is possible at \nall to set an arbitrary time, in view of the very serious amendments \nthat are pending on the Patients' Bill of Rights. So I object to that \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The original request of the majority leader is \nstill pending. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, Madam President, I am \nconstrained to say with due respect to the leader and the majority \nleader and majority whip, I find it very difficult to deal with the \nconcept putting ahead of this supplemental the completion of two very \ncontroversial items. We know the House is going home, and having spent \n8 years here on the floor as leader, I can tell you I have never seen \nthe time when any Senate could dominate the House. We have a bipartisan \nagreement to go home. They have told me they will stay if we get this \nbill done and over there today.\n\n  I do believe that the interest of national defense should come ahead \nof concepts that we are dealing with here in terms of whether it is the \nPatients' Bill of Rights or organization of the Senate. We know people \nwill be told they cannot train in July and August unless we get this \nbill done this week. It is not something on which we have been \ndilatory. We have been trying for a long time.\n  I have great respect for the leader and the assistant leader, but I \ncannot stay silent and have a concept that because the leader has \nstated these things must be done, they must be done before the \nsupplemental is brought up. That is unacceptable to this Senator. I \nthink it is unacceptable to the Senate. I hope it is.\n  I say with great humility now that the needs of our people in the \narmed services must come ahead of concepts of scheduling or \nprerogatives here on the floor. These needs are very real. We have \ntwice held hearings now where the chiefs have told us what is going to \nhappen if this bill is not signed by the President before the Fourth of \nJuly.\n  Even the concept of taking up and passing it now and letting it wait \nfor the House to come back is unacceptable to me because, again, we all \ntravel and we know you can't let the House go home and expect they will \ncome back here on July 3 just before the Fourth of July. You can't \ntravel in this country that easy during that period.\n  So I plead with the Senate, let us proceed with this bill. We should \nput aside all other desires. There is no timeframe on the Patients' \nBill of Rights that matters to this country. It is a bill that must be \npassed, and I am going to vote for it. But it does not have the urgency \nof this supplemental.\n  This supplemental deals with more than that. It now deals with \nmatters that are emergencies coming out of the disasters that have \nhappened in this country this spring.\n  I hope the leader will accept my comment that I mean no offense to \nhim. I have served under several leaders, and I admire both Senator \nDaschle and Senator Reid for what they are doing. But it is \nunacceptable to me to say no in terms of a request that has come on a \nbipartisan basis to put this bill aside for a few hours and pass a bill \nas important to the military of this country as is this supplemental.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I remind my dear friend and colleague, \nthe Senator from Alaska, in 1999, we took up the Patients' Bill of \nRights under a unanimous consent request and passed it in 4 days, with \n17 amendments. Now we are told we can't do it in 2 weeks. While we may \ndiffer on whether the supplemental is more or less important than the \nPatients' Bill of Rights, I would hope we could all agree that \ncompleting action before we leave on a supplemental dealing with the \nsafety of our troops is a top priority. The Pentagon places an \nextraordinary priority on this legislation--so much so that the \nCommander in Chief called me to ask that it be done this week. \nCertainly we can agree it is more important than fishing or any other \nkinds of vacation we could be taking next week. While there may be some \ndifferences on other issues, I would think there would be unanimity \nthat getting the supplemental done is more important than taking a \nvacation.\n  So that is what the issue is. We are not going to take a vacation \nuntil we have completed action on the supplemental. We are not going to \nleave until this is done. This is something that not only has been \nrequested by the Pentagon but by the Commander in Chief as well; I \nwould hope if the President makes additional calls, he will call the \nHouse and say: Don't leave until we get this done. You have heard the \nPentagon. Don't leave until this is done. Vacations are secondary to \nwork. We have to get it done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Has an objection been heard?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, that is a little bit of a \ncheap\n\n[[Page S7024]]\n\nshot. I am not talking about a vacation. I am willing to stay here as \nlong as any other Senator. I am talking about the realities of the \nHouse. Leader, I am not going to forget that. That was a cheap shot, \nand for the time being, I object to the request.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 831\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the amendment? The Senator \nfrom Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time. I \nbelieve there is more time on the other side. I want to give the other \nside their remaining 19 minutes, but I believe we only have 2 minutes. \nI reserve those 2 minutes for the end of the debate, and I do have a \ncouple of minutes after they have had an opportunity to present their \ncase.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, with the consent of Senator Kennedy, I \nyield myself such time as I may consume, recognizing the Senator from \nNorth Dakota wishes to be recognized. I will not take long.\n  Many years ago, before I came to Congress, I practiced law. I was a \nlawyer. I was a trial lawyer. I am very proud of that fact.\n  With that brief background, I received a call last night from a \nlifetime friend. I have not talked with him in a while, but we went to \nhigh school together. We played ball together. We were inseparable \nfriends. He did not have my phone number. I had moved. He called my \noffice and said it was urgent.\n  He called because his son was in trouble. Why? Because they had hired \na cheap lawyer. His son was in trouble, and they hired a cheap lawyer. \nThe young man is now in jail.\n  My friend from Missouri is a lawyer, a fine lawyer, I am sure. I \nrefer to the pending amendment as the ``cheap lawyers amendment.'' You \ncannot find decent lawyers to take a case for 15 percent. Almost 50 \npercent of the cases in our Federal court system take 4 years to \nlitigate, with files stacked as high as my desk. People work to prepare \nthose papers representing people who are injured, hurt, and need an \nattorney. That is why we have contingent fees. It is hard to find \nlawyers to take even a good contingent fee case because they have to \nconsume so much time and effort.\n  Of course, there are some people who are paid too much, I am sure, \nbecause they put in the time and it is a contingent fee. I sold my home \nin Virginia within the past year. The woman who sold my home was a good \nrealtor. I tried to find the best I could. I signed a contract with \nher. She made a ton of money on my home. She worked about a week. I \ndon't know, but she probably took a lot of time off during that week. \nMy home sold in a week. She made a lot of money for the few hours she \nspent on my home, but that is the way America works.\n  If we have people who need help, we need to have the full panoply of \nlawyers available so they can get a good lawyer.\n  My friend from Iowa had a chart and peeled off medical bills: These \npeople are going to get their medical bills. Well, isn't that too bad. \nIf someone does something wrong, should they not pay your medical \nbills? Do you need to have a lotto, as he says, a lottery to get your \nmedical bills paid? I hope not.\n  We have heard mentioned several times, if we are concerned about \nattorney's fees, how much are these attorneys for these big HMOs making \nto prevent people from getting medical care? Let's take a look at that.\n  We talk about these cases in the abstract, but the fact is that \nattorneys, whom everyone wants to hate, are necessary; they help. I am \nproud of the fact I was a lawyer. I have four sons. Every one of them \nis a lawyer, and I am proud of the fact that they followed in the \nfootsteps of their father. My daughter is a schoolteacher. She married \na lawyer. I am very happy for that.\n  We do not have to be shameful, concerned, or embarrassed about some \nlawyers getting paid a contingent fee. That is how people who are \ninjured and hurt are allowed to take those cases.\n  Fifteen percent will discourage representation by good lawyers. My \nfriends on the other side of the aisle talk about the sanctity of \ncontracts. Why do we want to step in and tell States what lawyers can \nbe paid based on a contract they get?\n  This amendment is only to protect HMOs, as all the other amendments \nfrom the other side, to try to derail this legislation. This amendment \nis a frivolous amendment. It has nothing to do with the merits of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Nevada yield?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield to my friend from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Nevada and I had a brief discussion \npreviously about this issue. He is correct that this amendment attempts \nto limit the ability of patients to hold HMOs accountable.\n  The discussion by those on the other side who have offered this \namendment talks about lawyers in a pejorative way on behalf of \npatients. Does the Senator know of any attempts by those who have \noffered this amendment to limit HMOs, managed care organizations, from \nusing lawyers, or is this just saying we will limit patients from using \nan attorney to go after a managed care organization that did not \nprovide the care they promised, but we will not limit managed care \norganizations from using attorneys to do whatever they want to do?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I answer as follows: Of course, there is \nnothing in the way of amendment to limit what attorneys for these \nwealthy, big, sometimes brutal HMOs are paid. But remember, I say to my \nfriend, that people who are seeking help from a lawyer are looking for \na lawyer who will do it not on an hourly basis but who will do it on \nwhat is called a contingent-fee basis. They have no money to hire one \nof the big HMO lawyers, so they look around and find somebody who will \ntake their case on a contingent-fee basis.\n  I say to my friend, a 15-percent contingent fee will not get a good \nlawyer. It will be like my dear friend who called me last night. In \neffect, the client will not wind up in jail but will end up with no \ncompensation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask my friend from Nevada to yield further for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield to my friend for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Is it not the case that this entire process, this debate \non the Patient Protection Act, is an attempt to balance things a bit; \nthat patients do not have the ability to confront a big managed care \norganization?\n  The Senator from Nevada knows the story we have talked about coming \nfrom his State: Christopher Roe, a circumstance where a 16-year-old boy \nwas fighting cancer at the same time he was fighting his managed care \norganization for treatment and care he needed. That is not a fair \nfight, asking a young boy to fight an insurance company and fight for \nhis life at the same time. That young boy lost his life on his 16th \nbirthday.\n  The question is, Do those patients and their families have the right \nto get an attorney to hold the managed care organization accountable to \ndeliver the care they promised? Do they have that right?\n  We have an amendment pending that says: No, we are going to limit the \nrights of the patients, we are going to limit the rights of citizens, \nbut we are not interested in limiting the rights of the managed care \norganizations because we want to stand for them rather than standing \nfor patients, and that is the issue.\n  Mr. REID. In answer to my friend, I have a CRS report that talks \nabout awards of attorney's fees by Federal courts and Federal agencies. \nIt is big. I know of no other Federal attorney fee statute that affects \na State system.\n  This amendment is wrong. I appreciate very much my friend from North \nDakota, who is not a lawyer, standing up and speaking for the injured \npeople and the potentially injured people of America.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask for 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \nthat has been offered. We have seen the efforts of the HMOs to \nundermine this legislation in different ways over the last few years. \nWe were unable to bring this matter up for consideration by the Senate \nand get full consideration of the bill when we wanted to. This happened\n\n[[Page S7025]]\n\neven during the last term when a majority of the Members would have \nsupported a good, tough, effective Patients' Bill of Rights. We have \nseen over the past days constant efforts to undermine this legislation.\n\n  We see another effort to try to appeal to the Members about the \nexcessiveness of decisions made in the courts to reimburse individuals \nin terms of wrongdoing by other industries.\n  The fact is, as we are reminded by our colleagues, we have spent 3 \ndays talking about the sanctity of the contract between the HMO and the \npatient. We have had amendment after amendment saying, look, this is \nenormously important. We do not want to permit any changes in that \ncontract. We want to stick with that contract. We want to hold to that \ncontract. Now with the Senator's amendment we are saying basically that \nwe are going to ride roughshod over contracts that are decided, \npermitted, and authorized by law in the States between attorneys and \ntheir clients.\n  I have listened a great deal to talk about how Washington doesn't \nknow best; how we don't want just one solution to solve all of our \nproblems. We had that debate early this morning and last night. We now \nhave one solution: to override States in terms of what decision the \nStates make for compensation going to court.\n  The fact is, how many working families, and how many middle-income \nfamilies are going to be able to go out and hire lawyers? For the time \nit will take to get some kind of recovery after they have been wronged, \nhow many are going to be able to do that and follow this through the \nState courts? How many will be able to do it after they have been hurt, \nafter their child has been disabled, after a wife or husband has been \nkilled? How many? Very few. The fact is, they are not going to be able \nto be compensated unless they are able to convince a jury they are \nright, that there has been wrongdoing.\n  Does that bother people in the Senate? Evidently it does. There are \nonly a very few Americans who can afford the high-priced lawyers to go \ninto court and pursue this. This amendment undermines it for the rest \nof the people. It undermines it for working families, undermines it for \nmiddle-income families. That is the record. That is what has been done.\n  It doesn't surprise me. We have seen the powerful special interests \noverturn ergonomic regulations which were there to protect working \nfamilies. Then we have the undermining of funding for the enforcement \nfor protecting our air. There has been undermining of funding for \nprotecting OSHA, effectively cutting back on the protection of workers. \nWe are undermining regulations to protect workers, undermining the \nenforcement mechanism to protect consumers, and now they want to take \nthis right away from individuals who will be harmed because of HMOs.\n  It is a common pattern. It is all targeted by the major financial \nspecial interests versus the consumer. That is what this is about. They \ndon't like to hear about it. They keep offering amendments that are \ncouched in other language about all the people that will be unemployed. \nHowever, it is the power of the HMOs against the little guy.\n  This amendment says the little guy will not be able to defend their \ninterests in court. That is what this is about.\n  Make no mistake. They can't deal with us in giving protections to the \nconsumers. They are going to take them away by denying them the rights \nto enforce them. That is what this is about.\n  Expect that after we have this percentage, it will go a little \nhigher, and then try to go even higher. Every time it does, it is an \ninsult to middle-income and working families and individuals who will \nbe harmed. Make no mistake, it is another assault on the fundamental \nprotections of this act. That is what this amendment is about. I hope \nit will be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has 3 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. I want to respond. Does the other side desire more time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I don't think so. It depends on what the Senator says. \nWe don't intend to at this time.\n  Mr. BOND. How much time remains on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five and a half minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. I yield myself the remaining time. I think some of the \nthings that have been said deserve to be answered.\n  Our efforts are not to undermine a bill but to deal with very bad \nprovisions in the bill which skipped the committee, did not go through \ncommittee markup. We are marking up a bill now which we should have \nmarked up in committee. It has come to the floor and we are a committee \nof the whole.\n  There are things that are in there that are very bad for patients, \nemployees, particularly of small business. Why are we inserting the \nFederal Government into restricting attorney's fees? The States in this \nNation have limited attorney's fees because they recognize the abuses \nof the trial lawyers. Under this bill, we are inserting the Federal \nGovernment into areas that the States have already acted on, and they \nhave acted on them and provided limits on the amount that trial \nattorneys can take so the injured party can recover.\n  We have heard about the powers of special interests. Let me state who \nthe special interests are that have a big stake in this, the four top \ntrial lawyer PACs: Trial Lawyers Association of America; Williams & \nBailey; Ness, Motley; and Angelos Law Offices, have given over $8 \nmillion, more money than all the HMOs together have given in politics.\n  If you want to talk about special interests, there are special \ninterests on the other side, as well.\n  We believe the measures we brought forth are good for employees, for \npeople who not only want to be able to appeal the decision of an HMO, \nbut they want to have health coverage.\n  Somebody suggests there have not been problems with fee structures. \nThey are not in this bill. We know from the State experiences that \nthere can be a tremendous amount of wasted money.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  I yield to my distinguished colleague from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I rise in support of the Bond amendment. \nThis is a Patients' Bill of Rights and we should focus on the patient. \nWe are talking about a patient who has been harmed or injured, gone \nthrough an appeals process and through the court. If there is a \nmultimillion-dollar suit, it should be to help the patient, not to fund \nthe pockets of the trial lawyers.\n  This is a Patients' Bill of Rights, not a trial lawyer bill of goods.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, every time you pay the HMO lawyers, \nthat comes out of patient protections. So the point is raised was, if \nyou put a limitation on the trial lawyers because they are going to get \nthe benefits, why not put a limitation on the attorneys for the HMOs so \nit doesn't come out of patient protections?\n  But they won't do it. They won't do it.\n  I yield the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. REID. What is the matter before the Senate now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 831.\n  Mr. REID. All time is yielded back?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has been yielded back.\n  Mr. REID. I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 62, nays 38, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 204 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--62\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n\n[[Page S7026]]\n\n\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Shelby\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Thompson\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--38\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Craig\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. REID. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The clerk will continue the call of the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk continued the call of the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 833\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, in consultation with the managers of the \nbill, it has been indicated to me this will be an appropriate time for \nthis amendment to be raised. I send it to the desk and ask that it be \ngiven immediate consideration. However, we have to set aside, as I \nunderstand it, the standing order with regard to the Snowe amendment. I \nfirst ask unanimous consent that it be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right to object--and I will \nnot object--we have been in consultation for the last hour or so. \nSenator Snowe of Maine is in the process of having her amendment \ndrafted. She is a half hour away from being able to present something \nin writing that we can give to the Senator from New Hampshire. I have \nno objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 833.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To limit the amount of attorneys' fees in a cause of action \n                        brought under this Act)\n\n       On page 154, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       ``(11) Limitation on award of attorneys' fees.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Subject to subparagraph (C), with \n     respect to a participant or beneficiary (or the estate of \n     such participant or beneficiary) who brings a cause of action \n     under this subsection and prevails in that action, the amount \n     of attorneys' fees that a court may award to such \n     participant, beneficiary, or estate under subsection (g)(1) \n     (not including the reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket \n     expenses of an attorney as approved by the court in such \n     action) may not exceed the sum of the amounts described in \n     subparagraph (B).\n       ``(B) Amounts described.--For purposes of subparagraph (A), \n     the amounts described in this subparagraph are as follows:\n       ``(i) With respect to a recovery in a cause of action \n     described in subparagraph (A) that does not exceed $100,000, \n     the amount of attorneys' fees awarded may not exceed an \n     amount equal to \\1/3\\ of the amount of the recovery.\n       ``(ii) With respect to a recovery in such a cause of action \n     that exceeds $100,000 but does not exceed $500,000, the \n     amount of the attorneys' fees awarded may not exceed an \n     amount equal to 25 percent of such excess recovery above \n     $100,000.\n       ``(iii) With respect to a recovery in such a cause of \n     action that exceeds $500,000, the amount of the attorneys' \n     fees awarded may not exceed an amount equal to 15 percent of \n     such excess recovery above $500,000.\n       ``(C) Equitable discretion.--A court in its discretion may \n     adjust the amount of an award of attorneys' fees required \n     under subparagraph (A) as equity and the interests of justice \n     may require.\n       On page 170, between lines 21 and 22, insert the following:\n       ``(9) Limitation on attorneys' fees.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, or any arrangement, agreement, or contract regarding \n     attorneys' fees, subject to subparagraph (B), a court shall \n     limit the amount of attorneys' fees that may be incurred for \n     the representation of a participant or beneficiary (or the \n     estate of such participant or beneficiary) who brings a cause \n     of action under paragraph (1) to the amount of attorneys' \n     fees that may be awarded under section 502(n)(11).\n       ``(B) Equitable discretion.--A court in its discretion may \n     adjust the amount of attorneys' fees allowed under \n     subparagraph (A) as equity and the interests of justice may \n     require.''\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I will do something unusual. I am \nactually going to read the amendment myself such that colleagues and \nthose observing floor operations from their offices can have a clear \nunderstanding of exactly what is in the amendment.\n  Further, I do not desire to consume a great deal of time in the \ndebate because we have just had a very thorough debate on the generic \nsubject of attorney's fees. Therefore, the Senate has pretty well \nframed in their minds the parameters in which they will or will not \naccept an amendment that has the effect of, in my judgment, preserving \na reasonable amount of attorney's fees and at the same time allowing \nsuch awards as those attorneys obtain for their clients to be given; \nagain, with the thought that it is a Patients' Bill of Rights and they \nhave a right to get a reasonable amount of such recovery as is obtained \nfrom them.\n  I shall read from the amendment--it is very short--and say a few \nwords, and then rest my case:\n  On page 154, insert the following: Limitation on award of attorneys' \nfees----\n\n       (A) In general.--Subject to subparagraph (C), with respect \n     to a participant or beneficiary (or the estate of such \n     participant or beneficiary) who brings a cause of action \n     under this subsection and prevails in that action, the amount \n     of attorneys' fees that a court may award to such \n     participant, beneficiary, or estate under subsection (g)(1) \n     (not including the reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket \n     expenses of an attorney as approved by the court in such \n     action)--\n\n  In other words, that would be awarded by the court without any \nrestriction except to the court itself----\n\n     may not exceed the sum of the amounts described in paragraph \n     (B).\n\n  The sums I am about to recite, we carefully researched all types of \nactions similar to this to get a scale of attorney fees which I felt \nwas clearly reasonable.\n\n       (B) Amounts Described.--For purposes of subparagraph (A), \n     the amounts described in this subparagraph are as follows:\n       (i) With respect to a recovery in a cause of action \n     described in subparagraph (A) that does not exceed $100,000, \n     the amount of the attorneys' fees awarded may not exceed an \n     amount equal to one-third of the amount of the recovery.\n\n  In years previous to coming to the Senate and other various jobs, I \nwas actually a member of the bar and practiced law. I was assistant \nU.S. attorney in a modest trial practice myself. That has sort of been \na standard for many years in the bar, the one-third.\n\n       (ii) With respect to recovery in such a cause of action \n     that exceeds $100,000 but does not exceed $500,000, the \n     amount of the attorneys' fees awarded may not exceed an \n     amount equal to 25 percent of such excess recovery above \n     $100,000.\n       (iii) With respect to recovery in such a cause of action \n     that exceeds $500,000, the amount of the attorneys' fees \n     awarded may not exceed an amount equal to 15 percent of such \n     excess recovery above $500,000.\n       (C) Equitable discretion.--A court in its discretion may \n     adjust the amount of an award of attorneys' fees required \n     under subsection (A) as equity and the interests of justice \n     may require.\n\n  In other words, a judge may look at this fee schedule and decide, \nthis particular counsel has done a great deal of work and, therefore, I \nbelieve I should raise his fee within the parameters of the section \nitself.\n  Further:\n\n       (9) Limitation on Attorneys' Fees.--\n       (A) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, or any arrangement, agreement, or contract regarding \n     attorneys' fees, subject to subparagraph (B), a court shall \n     limit the amount of attorneys' fees that may be incurred for \n     the representation of a participant or beneficiary (or the \n     estate\n\n[[Page S7027]]\n\n     of such participant or beneficiary) who brings a cause of \n     action under paragraph (1) to the amount of the attorneys' \n     fees that may be awarded under section 502(n)(11).\n       (B) Equitable discretion.--A court in its discretion may \n     adjust the amount of attorneys' fees allowed under \n     subparagraph (A) as equity and interests of justice may \n     require.\n\n  This amendment simply sets, in my judgment, a reasonable category of \nfees. I have tried, as best I can, not to tread, by virtue of States \nrights, on the right of the State to administrate its own bar and the \nlike. I felt that discretion should be given to the trial judges, \nFederal and State, such as they can adjust that schedule of fees as \nthey see fit.\n  The Senate, again, has, in a very thorough discussion under the Bond \namendment, covered these issues and has in mind, again, its own \nframework wherein we can legislate on this matter by amendment or not \nlegislate.\n  At this point, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Virginia for \nhis efforts. I think there is an agreement that there needs to be a cap \non attorney's fees. It is my strong sense and belief that if we had a \ncap of 33.3 percent that applied to Federal and State courts, that \nwould be accepted by the majority of this body.\n  What I worry about is us just going back and forth with escalating \namendments. There are very few benefits of old age. One of them is to \nremember what happened in the past. When we were doing the tobacco \nbill, we had amendment after amendment, a series of amendments, on caps \non lawyer's fees. It got a little ludicrous. We finally had a majority \nvote for $1,000 an hour. It was clearly not an effort at legislating, \nbut it was an effort at some kind of political advantage. I know that \nis not the intention of the Senator from Virginia.\n  I hope that once this is debated and, if it is not accepted, that \nperhaps we could move to an amendment after Senator Snowe's amendment \nthat would be around 33.3 percent, State, Federal court, end of it. \nThat is going to make everybody unhappy, but I think it would be \nsomething that we could all support and then get this issue off the \ntable and get to the very important issues such as resolution of \nexhaustion of appeals that Senators Thompson and Edwards are working \non, liability issues. Senator Frist has some important amendments, \nagain, on liability issues, which we are narrowing down.\n  Hopefully, we can move forward. I thank the Senator from Virginia for \nhis input.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, if I might reply to my friend and \ncolleague, there was no intention of the Senator from Virginia to \nrepeat what is an historically important case on tobacco. I studied \nthat case very carefully. There were, I think, three votes. My \nrecollection is it was $4,000 per hour, at which time the Senate \nfinally accepted. I would not participate in such a process. I just \nstruck the one-third for the lower amounts of the recovery and \nbasically scaled it to 25 and the other percentage as the rate of \nrecovery increase. I would be happy to work with colleagues.\n  It goes to the question of just how much will be eventually given to \nthe recipients who need these funds.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, of course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Virginia are \non the right track.\n  This amendment, with all due respect to my dear friend from Virginia, \nis really--we have another 15-percent limitation in here above a \ncertain amount. I think that the most expeditious thing to do would be \nto set this aside, for the time being, and get some of the lawyers and \nnonlawyers to sit down and see if they can work out something \nacceptable to the managers. I am sure if it were acceptable to the \nmanagers, we could accept this.\n  I ask my friend from Virginia, who believes he has talked enough on \nthis, that we withdraw this amendment, for the time being, in \nanticipation of working something out that is clear and more concise.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is exemplified by the leadership the Senator shows \ntime and time again on this floor. I don't view this as a partisan \nissue. This is an honest effort by the Members of the Senate to \nrecognize that individuals should be given their rewards and the \nattorneys should be given fair compensation. Therefore, Madam \nPresident, unless other Senators wish to speak at this time, I will----\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield, I say to my colleague from \nVirginia, if the outcome of this amendment is not to the Senator's \nsatisfaction, then I hope we can enter into negotiations that on a \nreasonable level--again, I just plucked 33\\1/3\\ percent because it is \nin there in one category, across the board, simple, two lines, and \nperhaps we can move on.\n  I know the Senator from Virginia, as well as the rest of us, doesn't \nwant to be hung up on a series of votes that are iterations over the \nsame issue. It seems that we can sit down and come to some reasonable \nagreement, which the other side of the aisle would strongly resist \napplying to State court, and this side would resist it on Federal \ncourt. It is something to have a substantial majority vote for. I hope \nthe Senator agrees to enter into those negotiations.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays before I \ntake the action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if the Senator really wants a vote on \nthis, we will be happy to give it to him right now. I don't think it is \nthe right thing to do. I suggest to the manager and my friend from \nVirginia, why don't we set this aside for a few minutes to see if we \ncan work something out to get the matter resolved. I think as the \nSenator from Arizona indicated----\n  Mr. WARNER. I am agreeable. I ask unanimous consent that this \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is set aside.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is my understanding, under the order \nthat is in effect, we will go to the Snowe amendment with the purpose \nof offering the amendment under a 4-hour time agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 834\n\n  (Purpose: To modify provisions relating to causes of action against \n                               employers)\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Snowe], for herself, Mrs. \n     Lincoln, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Specter, and \n     Mr. McCain, proposes an amendment numbered 834.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is located in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today to offer an amendment along \nwith my colleagues Senator DeWine, Senator Lincoln, and Senator Nelson, \nwho worked so hard, so diligently in crafting this compromise. Senator \nMcCain and Senator Specter are coauthors of this amendment as well.\n  The amendment we are offering today is designed to bridge the gap \nthat exists between the supporters of the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy \napproach to employer liability in the Breaux-Frist-Jeffords bill.\n  I commend Senators McCain, Edwards, and Kennedy for their willingness \nas well as their patience to work with us on resolving the many issues \nthat are associated with employer liability.\n  Everyone involved has had the same goal essentially, and that is to \nprotect\n\n[[Page S7028]]\n\nemployers from liability when they are not participating in making \ndecisions concerning the health care of employee beneficiaries.\n  The discussion has really focused on how best to achieve that goal. \nThis is an incredibly complex liability issue that has far-reaching \nconsequences, and everyone who has been part of this discussion and \nthis effort to reach this consensus recognizes that fact and has worked \nin good faith to arrive at a solution that we can live with and, more \nimportantly, employers can live with and not denying care that patients \nrightly deserve.\n  This is an issue that is significant on a number of different levels. \nFirst of all, to what extent will employers that voluntarily offer \nhealth insurance be exposed to liability. To what extent will employers \nbe involved in the decisionmaking process in terms of the provisions of \nhealth care for their employee beneficiaries, and perhaps \nmore important, will patients have legal recourse should they have a \ngrievance concerning the care they receive through their health care \nplan.\n\n  The goal we all share in designing and crafting this amendment to the \nMcCain-Kennedy-Edwards legislation is how best we protect patients for \ntheir medical care without creating an expansive bureaucracy adding to \nthe cost of providing that health care and generally creating an \nincentive to drive away employers from providing health care insurance \nto their employees which, as I said earlier, they do so on a voluntary \nbasis. We should be commending employers for providing these benefits, \nnot penalizing them.\n  We should also take great care to write a provision under which \nemployees remain insured through their employers, while also protecting \nthe employees' rights under their health insurance plans. What we do \nnot want to do is create unintended consequences for employers by \nleaving legal questions open that can leave employers exposed to \nliability over matters in which they have no control and over matters \nin which they have not participated and having the resulting decision.\n  That is all the more significant when we realize there are more than \n43 million Americans who remain without any insurance, and of those who \nhave insurance, employers voluntarily provide health coverage to more \nthan 172 million Americans. Obviously, what we do today is significant, \nand it will matter.\n  We cannot afford to have employers suddenly opting out of providing \ninsurance to their employees because we do not want to create the \nunintended consequence that adds to the rolls of the uninsured in \nAmerica. I think that is something on which we all can agree, and that \nis a very real risk. In fact, there was a recent poll taken of \nbusinesses in America, and it said that 57 percent of small businesses \nsaid they would drop coverage rather than risk a lawsuit.\n  As one businessman in my State wrote to me recently:\n\n       We're not an HMO or an insurance company. We are an \n     employer. We cannot afford the time, expense, and aggravation \n     of litigation. And, please, make no mistake, that is what \n     this is about.\n\n  So we approach the issue of reconciling the differences between the \ntwo approaches by addressing the question: What language will deliver \nus to that mutual goal? We assess what was really the best qualities of \nthe McCain-Edwards-Kennedy legislation, as well as the Breaux-Frist-\nJeffords issues.\n  Ultimately, the solution we came to was a melding of the two \napproaches. The result was to provide employers with varying levels of \nliability protection depending on their involvement in the \ndecisionmaking process but regardless, patients will have the legal \nrecourse they deserve, no matter what.\n  There are many other issues that need to be resolved in this \nlegislation. I realize this represents one facet, the liability \nquestion, that has been raised by others with respect to this \nlegislation, and this is not intended to address all of those \nquestions, but clearly it does address a most important issue when it \ncomes to subjecting employers to litigation and liability.\n  Let me take a moment to explain the differences between the McCain-\nEdwards-Kennedy legislation and the Breaux-Frist-Jeffords approach and \nthe approach we are taking in the amendment we have offered to S. 1052 \nand how our amendment affects the underlying legislation and addresses \nthe concerns that have been raised about the net legal impact on \nemployers.\n\n  Essentially, there are several categories we are attempting to \naddress today when it comes to employer-sponsored health care \ninsurance.\n  First, there are employers that contract with an insurance company \nthat, in turn, pays beneficiary claims and administers the plans and \nthe benefits.\n  Second, there are employers that fund a plan but leave the actual \nadministration of the plan to an outside entity, generally an insurance \ncompany.\n  Third, there are those who both self-insure and self-administer, in \nessence creating their own insurance company within their existing \nbusiness.\n  The McCain-Edwards-Kennedy legislation as written allows a suit \nagainst any employer if it directly participates in a decision that \nharms or results in the death of a patient. Direct participation is \ndefined as the actual making of a medical decision or the actual \nexercise of control in making such a decision or in the conduct \nconstituting the failure.\n  The bill then goes on to offer specific circumstances that do not \nconstitute direct participation, including any participation by the \nemployer or other plan sponsor in the selection of the group health \nplan or health insurance coverage involved or the third party \nadministrator or other agent, or any engagement by the employer or \nother plan sponsor in any cost-benefit analysis undertaken with the \nselection of or continued maintenance of the plan or coverage involved.\n  While the bill language does not provide an exhaustive list of \nexceptions, it does allow an employer to offer into evidence in their \ndefense that they did not directly participate in decisions affecting \nthe beneficiaries of the health care plan.\n  That suggests while employer protections would be provided under the \nlegislation, an employer would still have to go to court to make its \ndefense. As with any such legal language, direct participation \nobviously can be open to legal interpretation, and that precisely is \nthe circumstance which we are seeking to avoid and prevent.\n  Under the Breaux-Frist-Jeffords legislation that was introduced, the \nlanguage provides for a designated decisionmaker, or DDM, which in most \ncases would be the insurance company an employer contracted with to be \nthe party that is liable for medical decisions and, therefore, the \nparty could be subject to liability. In other words, the employer would \ndesignate the DDM as the responsible party to shield itself from that \nliability. If an employer chose not to designate a DDM, they would have \nno protection from that liability.\n  An argument that has been made against the Breaux-Frist-Jeffords \nlanguage is if the DDM is a person designated within a company that \nself-insures, for example, they could under the employment law attempt \nto escape liability by claiming that ultimate decision came from the \nemployer; that they, as a DDM, did not make a final decision on a \nparticular beneficiary's case. In an effort to improve the Breaux-\nFrist-language, we designate that when a contract is signed with the \nemployer, the DDM cannot mount any such defense, that somehow they \ndefer the liability, defer the suggestions that the employer somehow \nparticipated in making the decision.\n  In an effort to improve the employer liability provisions, we \nencompassed key provisions of both models in the legislation while \naddressing their inherent weaknesses so we can attain our shared goals.\n  First, our amendment allows employers that turn their health care \ncoverage to outside insurance companies, that their insurance company \nwill automatically be their designated decisionmaker unless they \nspecifically choose not to have a DDM. This is built directly on the \nBreaux-Frist-Jeffords model in which the decisionmaking authority \nshifts to the DDM, which will in most cases be the insurance company. \nUnder this approach, an employer would not have to take the extra steps \nto secure a designated decisionmaker and would not be required to go to \ncourt to file papers or to make defenses against any actions they may \nhave taken. In other words, they would not have to do anything \ndifferent than\n\n[[Page S7029]]\n\nwhat they are doing today with a contract with an insurance company.\n  When they sign up with an insurance carrier that will provide \nbenefits to their employees and administer the benefits, they are then \nsigning up with, essentially, a designated decisionmaker, and they are \nsigning up as well for a safe harbor from liability in both medical as \nwell as contractual decisions.\n  Where we depart from the existing Breaux-Frist language is we clarify \nsince the DDM, which is also the insurance company, has assumed full \nresponsibility at the time the employer and the insurance company \nsigned a contract, the designated decisionmaker would be prevented from \nturning around and assigning the employer for some failure that \nresulted in a lawsuit from a beneficiary. In other words, the dedicated \ndecisionmaker can't transfer liability to the employer because of \nsomething the employer does or failed to do.\n  The legislation we have introduced today to modify the McCain-\nEdwards-Kennedy legislation delineates specifically that the dedicated \ndecisionmaker is responsible for a contractual arrangement as well as \nexclusive authority for any medically reviewable decisions.\n  For employers that choose not to have a dedicated decisionmaker, for \nwhatever reason, and for those employers that prefer to continue to be \nself-insured but contract out the administration of their health care \nplan, we leave in place the general McCain-Edwards model in the \nunderlying bill that protects employers insofar as they do not directly \nparticipate in the medical decisionmaking process.\n\n  Again, as I outlined earlier, direct participation is defined as the \nactual making of a medical decision, the actual exercise of control in \nmaking such a decision or in the conduct constituting the failure. \nThese are two of the changes we have made in the amendment we are \npresenting today from the underlying McCain-Edwards legislation.\n  In our amendment, we eliminate one element of the bill that would \nhave potentially led to the filing of lawsuits on a variety of grounds \nunrelated to specific medical decisions impacting individual \nbeneficiaries. The language is, in layman's terms, broad and \nnonspecific and potentially exposes a defendant to a wide array of \nnonlegal actions. If additional grounds for lawsuit should be added to \nthe legislation, we should delineate and specify them and not have \nbroad language that essentially leads to a legal potpourri.\n  Striking this language does not affect the ability of the patient to \nseek remedy in court for medical decisions made in their particular \ncircumstance. But it does prevent a whole new arena of lawsuits from \nbeing created that would heighten an employers' exposure to liability.\n  In addition, our amendment also modifies the underlying legislation \nto ensure that self-insured, self-administered plans, employers, and \nunion health care plans will not be subject to lawsuits under Federal \nlaw simply because of contractual disputes. This change is critically \nimportant when considering that self-insured, self-administered plans \ndo not have the ability to assign liability to a dedicated \ndecisionmaker. As a result, they may opt to simply stop offering \ninsurance for employees altogether rather than risk a substantial \njudgment on a contractual matter. That is a result, again, we simply \ncannot afford if we are going to ensure that people have the kind of \nhealth insurance plans in America in which they will continue to be \ninsured, and that employers are the ones providing predominantly the \nhealth insurance in America today.\n  To describe our amendment in another way, we essentially are saying \nas an employer that is not self-insured, you can hand over all your \ndecisionmaking and therefore your liability to a dedicated \ndecisionmaker which will, in all likelihood, be your insurance company \nwhen you sign your contract with your insurance company. There is \nnothing more you need to do to protect your business from liability for \nthe decisions that are made.\n  For the self-insured and for those who do not self-insure as an \nemployer, you would still have the protections afforded under the \nunderlying legislation if you don't directly participate in those \ndecisions. In other words, employers who contract out their health \ninsurance have a clear choice under our amendment, although once again \nI stress that under this amendment patients will still have the legal \nrecourse regarding questions over appropriate medical care and medical \ndecisions related to the beneficiary's plan, no matter which option the \nemployer chooses.\n  The bottom line is we seek to protect employers from liability in \ncases where they are not making the medical decisions that harm \npatients or result in death while still protecting parents rights, \nwhich after all is the goal of this legislation.\n  Finally, let me assure my colleagues, under this amendment, dedicated \ndecisionmakers would have to demonstrate they are financially capable \nof fulfilling their responsibilities as the party liable in causes of \naction. They could not be shell entities or sham individuals or \norganizations without the ability to actually pay the event of \nlawsuits.\n  The criteria the Secretary of Health and Human Services will require \nrelating to the financial obligations of such an entity for liability \nshould also include an insurance policy or other arrangements secured \nand maintained by the dedicated decisionmaker to effectively insure the \nDDM against losses arising from professional liability claims, \nincluding those arising from service as a designated decisionmaker. A \nDDM would have to show evidence of minimum capital and surplus levels \nthat are maintained by an entity to cover any losses as a result of \nliability arising from its service as a designated decisionmaker. It \nwould have to show that they themselves have coverage adequate to cover \npotential losses resulting from liability claims or evidence of minimum \ncapital and surplus levels to cover any losses.\n\n  Once again, I think we have designed an amendment that represents a \nworkable approach, that addresses some of the more serious and \nsignificant concerns that had arisen in the various pieces of \nlegislation that had been introduced here in the Senate and with the \nunderlying legislation we are seeking to amend today.\n  We try to meld the best of both approaches, to balance the concerns \nof businesses that do seek to voluntarily provide this most important, \ncritical benefit to their employees. That is an incentive we want to \nmaintain and reinforce in every possible way. But we also understand \nthere are going to be those circumstances in which the employee has \nreceived inappropriate care that has resulted in significant harm, \ninjury, or even death, and that they should have the opportunity to \nseek legal redress for that inappropriate care or denial of care. That \nis the kind of consideration we want to ensure in this legislation, \nwithout creating the unintended consequences or the disincentive for \nemployers to say we just simply cannot afford to provide this health \ninsurance for our employees anymore because we are going to be subject \nto litigation, to endless losses, and we do not want to put ourselves \nin the position of that kind of exposure.\n  I think this approach has been examined on both sides of the \npolitical aisle. More important, I think it has been embraced by this \nbipartisan group in the Senate, my colleague Senator DeWine, who has \nworked so hard, Senator Lincoln whom I see on the floor, and Senator \nNelson. They have worked very diligently on behalf of this amendment to \nassure that we address all facets, all potential implications and \nramifications associated with this approach, to hopefully address it in \na way that will ultimately yield the best effect for both the employer \nas well as the employees.\n  I yield the floor. I will be glad to yield time to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, let me thank my colleagues, Senator \nSnowe and Senator Lincoln, whom I see on the floor, and Senator Nelson, \nwho have worked long and hard on this amendment.\n  The issue in front of us today is how do we help shield businessmen \nand businesswomen from liability at the same time providing access to \nthe courts for people to sue HMOs. Everyone I think agrees, one of the \nthings we worry about as we deal with this legislation is that we will \ndo something that would cause businesses in this\n\n[[Page S7030]]\n\ncountry to decide not to insure employees. That would be a very bad \nunintended consequence, so we have to be very careful as we write this \nlegislation.\n  The amendment in front of us today is really a compromise. It is a \ncompromise based on the Frist-McCain bills. It is a compromise on the \nissue of employer liability, how we best protect the employers while at \nthe same time ensuring people their right in court. I think we have \nreally blended these bills. I think we have the best of both worlds. \nThe situation and the language are clarified and made simpler.\n  We started this debate with some basic principles on which everyone \nagreed. In both bills we agreed we wanted to try to protect businesses \nbut at the same time we wanted to allow suits in limited circumstances \nagainst HMOs. The President agreed to that principle, and the two \nunderlying bills do as well. This amendment, I believe, achieves that. \nThis amendment effectively takes out 94 percent of businesses and \nprovides them great protection. When you compare our amendment versus \nthe underlying bill, it helps and improves the situation for the other \n6 percent. We will talk about that in a moment.\n  My colleague from Maine has talked about this concept of the \ndesignated decisionmaker. What do we mean by that? What we mean is \nlet's just make it simple and let's make it plain; let's have the \nemployer say who is going to make those decisions and therefore who \nwill be sued. In essence, what we are saying is once that decision is \nmade, that employer is no longer going to be subject to suits; the \ndesignated decisionmaker will be.\n  How will this work in the real world? Let's say we have a small \nhardware store in Greene County, OH. Let's say they employ 12 people, \nand let's say what they do is they provide some health insurance and \nthey do that by going out in the market, finding the best deal they \ncan, and buying this group coverage for their 12 employees. Under this \namendment, once they contracted with that insurance carrier, they would \nhave automatically made that designated decisionmaker decision. They \nwould have designated that automatically, that group as being the \ndesignated decisionmaker. They would have to do nothing. They cannot \nmake a mistake. It takes no affirmative action on their part. That is \ngoing to improve the language we have in front of us.\n  The other way of doing it, the way the underlying bill did it, was to \ntalk about direct participation. Frankly, I think the language in the \nbill was pretty good. But I think it needs to be improved. By having \nthe designated decisionmaker, it is a lot more clear. What will happen \nas a practical matter is this. As we all know, anybody can sue anybody. \nWe cannot prevent suits, but we certainly can discourage them, and we \ncertainly can provide when suits are filed against a business, the \nbusiness has the ability to get out of that lawsuit very quickly. So by \nusing the concept of the designated decisionmaker, as a practical \nmatter, if a suit were brought against a businessperson, if a lawyer \nwere foolish enough to file that suit, the business would simply have \nto go into court and file a copy of that designated decisionmaker \ndecision and would be dismissed from the case. As a practical matter, \nthis language significantly improves the underlying bill and will make \na big difference.\n\n  Our amendment does build on the two bills in front of us, the two \nbills we have been talking about and have been considering, the Frist-\nBreaux bill and the underlying bill we have in front of us today, the \nMcCain-Kennedy bill.\n  I believe our amendment would protect business owners from needless \nlawsuits as well as protect patients who rely on employer-sponsored \nhealth care plans for their medical needs. I believe this amendment \nbrings together the best of all worlds by providing certainty, much-\nneeded certainty to employers, employees, and, yes, to health care \nproviders. That is something we desperately need in any patient \nprotection bill.\n  Based on the designated decisionmaker concept in the Frist-Breaux-\nJeffords bill, our amendment would automatically, as I have indicated, \nremove liability from small business owners and shift it to health care \nproviders or other designated entities. In addition, our amendment \nstipulates this designated decisionmaker must follow strict actuarial \nguidelines and be capable of assuming financial responsibility for the \nliability coverage. This means the designated decisionmaker could not \nbe a hollow shell, unable to come up with the money, the assets, to \ndefend against potential lawsuits and financial damages and be able to \nsatisfy those losses. Our language ensures that the designated \ndecisionmaker cannot be a straw man, cannot be a sham that has no \nability to pay a patient in the event a lawsuit is filed and that \ndamages are in fact awarded.\n  In creating the designated decisionmaker process, it makes it easier \nfor employers that provide health insurance coverage to be protected.\n  We think that is a major step forward for businesses, and especially \nfor patients.\n  I say that because the fear of being sued often becomes so great that \nemployers simply stop offering health care coverage. We don't want that \nto happen under this bill. We simply can't let that happen. The reality \nis in this country that already there are more than 42 million \nAmericans, including 10 million children, who have no health care \ncoverage. The last thing we want to do is add to this number.\n  Our amendment greatly diminishes the likelihood that employers will \nstop offering health care coverage. Again, we believe it is the best of \nboth worlds as it allows patients the ability to sue the designated \ndecision maker if they are denied medical benefits to which they are \nentitled by their health plans. But at the same time it protects \nemployers from unnecessary and costly lawsuits.\n  Under our amendment, employees would have the comfort of certainty \nand the comfort of knowing that the designated decisionmaker is \nultimately responsible for health care decisions and, therefore, that \nindividual or that entity bears the liability for a lawsuit.\n  In another effort to keep employees insured, our amendment also adds \nlanguage to the underlying McCain-Kennedy bill to limit the liability \nof businesses to self-insure and self-administer their health care \nplans. The fact is that these employers are assuming additional risk by \nfinancing and by administering health care coverage to employees. To \nthat extent, I believe we must take their unique circumstances into \nconsideration. This amendment does that.\n  Ultimately, our objective is to encourage employers to offer and to \ncontinue to offer their employees health care coverage. We don't want \nto discourage them out of fear that they will be sued.\n  The reality is that these self-insured and self-administered plans \nare doing some very good things for their employees. We want them to \ncontinue to do these good things. Our amendment will help them keep \ntheir employees, their families, and their children insured. That is \nwhat the Patients' Bill of Rights should be all about.\n  Further, our amendment improves the original Frist language by making \nvery clear exactly who is liable. The amendment leaves no room for \nambiguity because it would not allow the designated decisionmaker to be \nbroken into sub-decisionmakers. One, and only one, entity would be the \nsole bearer of liability. We think that is an improvement.\n  Finally, our language would strike vague and ambiguous language in \nthe underlying McCain-Kennedy bill that is of great concern to \nemployers. This language is a catch-all section of the bill that could \nopen employers to a flood of lawsuits simply because of the imprecise \nnature of the language.\n  Let me read the exact language currently in the Kennedy-McCain bill \nin regard to the cause of action relating to provisions of health \nbenefits. There is the (ii) section. This is what is in the underlying \nbill:\n\n       Or otherwise fails to exercise ordinary care in the \n     performance of the duty under the terms and conditions of the \n     plan with respect to the participant or beneficiary.\n\n  We believe this language is simply too vague. We eliminate it in \nregard to businesses and their potential liability.\n  This language that I just quoted creates an explicit cause of action. \nThis means employers could be the subject of lawsuits that none of us \ncurrently\n\n[[Page S7031]]\n\nhas any way to anticipate. The language is broad. It is too broad as \ncurrently drafted. Our amendment would completely remove this section.\n\n  Finally, I think we must recognize what this amendment does, but also \nwe need to be very clear about what it does not do. Does this amendment \nsolve every problem with this bill? The answer is that it does not. It \ndoes what we have said it does. It deals with the heart of the \nliability problem in regard to businesses, but it does not solve all \nthe problems.\n  I think it is important for us to have truth-in-labeling with this \namendment. It is a good amendment. It is a probusiness amendment. It is \nan amendment that will encourage business men and women to do what we \nwant them to do, which is good public policy, to insure their \nemployees. It will give them important protections. It will give them \nmore assurances.\n  That is why we ought to pass this amendment. It is a significant \nimprovement over the underlying bill that is in front of us.\n  But it does not solve all the problems. It only deals with a portion \nof the pie. It does not deal with the caps issue. It does not deal with \nwhere the lawsuits should be brought and the issue of whether they \nshould be brought exclusively in the Federal court or in the State \ncourt. It does not deal with the class action question, about which I \nam very concerned. And I know my friend from Tennessee has been working \non this issue as well. It does not deal with the class action issue. I \nintend to have an amendment later today or tomorrow in regard to the \nclass action issue.\n  We want to say what it does. It helps businesses do the right thing. \nIt encourages people to continue to insure their employees. But there \nare many things it does not do.\n  I would be more than happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator's effort. I \nhaven't had a chance to digest all of it. I understand the intent and \nthe thrust as described by the Senator from Ohio, which I think is \nappropriate and good.\n  As I look at the first section, I am wondering. It appears to me that \nunder the definition section it draws union plans in, and they are \nbeing given a special status which is really higher than a self-\nemployed plan is given. I am wondering why union plans are suddenly \nbeing raised to a special status under the amendment.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I would be more than happy to answer the question.\n  In the original language that we have been negotiating for the last \nfew days, we could not figure out any way to really help the roughly 6 \npercent of businesses that self-insure and self-administer.\n  My colleague Senator Lincoln has brought to our attention and \nbusinesses have brought to our attention the fact that this amendment \nas originally written really did not help those 6 percent. Why? Why \noriginally didn't it help? The basic problem is they do make medical \ndecisions. They are really effectively operating as their own HMO.\n  We thought about how to protect them and give them some help while at \nthe same time preserving their employees' rights to sue just as \neverybody else has. We came up with a compromise. My colleague Senator \nLincoln may want to get involved in this and explain it a little bit. \nBut basically it says for those self-insured, self-administered plans, \nwe carve out a special exemption for them because of the special \nstatus. We say they are excluded and exempted from lawsuits brought in \nthe Federal court on the nonmedical decisions based on the contract \ndecisions. That is a break they are getting. We think it can be \njustified by what they do because we want to encourage them to continue \nto do what they do.\n  Why is the other group that you have mentioned included? They are \nincluded because they operate basically the same way the self-insured, \nself-administered businesses do. They basically take the risk. They \nbasically make the medical decisions.\n  I appreciate the question, but I would disagree with my colleague the \nway he has categorized it. This is no special break for unions. This is \ntreating people who operate the same way the same way in the language. \nI cannot come up with any way to justify carving them out and not \ngiving them the exception because they are operating under the same \nprinciples that they are basically self-insured and are basically \nmaking the medical decisions, and doing it the same way.\n  So when you compare apples to apples, you ought to treat them the \nsame. That is why we did it. We think it is justified. We think it \nmakes sense. The option, candidly, would be not to give the 6 percent \nof businesses this break, not to give them the encouragement to try to \nget them to continue to do what they are doing. But we came to the \nconclusion that we should try to help them. We are not helping them \nimmensely, but we are helping them.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the concept here is to treat everybody in the basket \nthe same, then you have not necessarily done it, because union plans do \nuse third-party administrators and therefore can designate, and a \nsingle-employer plan would therefore be more identifiable with the \nunion plan. Yet, under your proposal, the single-employer plan \nbasically is still liable. And that is 56 million people, by the way. \nFifty-six million people fall into that category.\n  So you have exempted out the Wal-Marts of the world, maybe, that \nallow people to go out and get their health care, and then they come \nback and get their approval. And that exemption makes sense, but that \nexemption is not consistent with what unions do. So don't come here and \nrepresent to this Senate that it is because it is not. You have raised \nthe unions to a brand new level of independent liability protection. So \nplease do not make that representation.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I will reclaim my time. I thank my colleague for his \ncomments.\n  The intention of the language is to treat people equally. If a union \ndoes in fact make the medical decisions and if they are operating in \nthe same way that the Wal-Marts of the world are, they ought to be \ntreated the same way. If they are not operating the same way, then they \nshould not be treated the same.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DeWINE. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. The Senator from Ohio is exactly correct. We are treating \nall employers the same. In this instance, in this particular category, \nit is those employers who do not have a designated decisionmaker. That \nis the intent of this particular provision: To treat them equally so \nthey are not subjected to liability when it comes to contractual \nmatters, whereas other employers are not who contract with insurance \ncompanies and have a designated decisionmaker. That is what the intent \nis of this legislation. It is to treat them all equally and to draw \nthat bright line.\n  We could say, let's not address the self-insured and self-\nadministered programs. I do not think that is fair either because, \nobviously, they have a different kind of program, and we want to \nencourage that. We commend them for the kind of benefits they are \nproviding their employees. They happen to be large employers, and they \nwant to design their own internal program. But we don't want to subject \nthem to litigation to which other employers are not going to be \nsubjected. So that is the reason for the intent of this particular \nprovision that happens to include union plans that are designed \nsimilarly.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I am more than happy to yield to the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. This is an important point, and therefore I think the \ncolloquy is important so we can address it.\n  We have just seen the language for the first time a few minutes ago. \nThe way I understand it, we have about 170 million people out there we \nare talking about in an employer-sponsored plan. There are about 6 \nmillion people who are in what are called self-insured, self-\nadministered plans. Over the last 2 to 3 years, as we have tried to \nfigure out how to treat these 6 million people in a fair way, we have \nstruggled because it is hard. We have produced the designated-decision-\nmaker model--which I am a great believer in; and I believe most people \nin this body, if they step\n\n[[Page S7032]]\n\nback and look at it, are great believers in--but what you have in your \nbill is you have carved out those 6 million people and addressed the \nissue directly, but in addition to that, you carve out the unions.\n  The argument that was made is that the unions are self-insured, self-\nadministered plans like the other 6 million; that these are union \nplans, and therefore they should be treated the same as self-insured, \nself-administered plans.\n  I think the Senator from New Hampshire and I would argue that the \nunions should not be carved out as well because--while a few may be \nself-insured and self-administered--the majority of the union plans are \nnot self-insured and self-administered. Therefore, why are you giving \nthis privileged position to the unions that are not self-insured and \nself-administered like the 6 million whom you targeted initially? That \nis the question I think the Senator from New Hampshire and I wish to \nask you, because we like very much more the designated-decision-maker \nmodel.\n  I guess the question is, Are you contending that the union plans that \nyou carved out are self-insured and self-administered plans?\n  Mr. DeWINE. If I could reclaim my time to answer the question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I can tell you what the intent was. And, as you know, we \nhave been drafting the language, and it has been going on and on. I can \nonly tell you what the intent was.\n  I am more than happy to take a minute and look at that language again \nwith your comments in mind.\n  The intent was to treat people who operated one way equally. In \nregard to unions, the intent was we would cover union plans that were \nthe same as the Wal-Marts of the world which are self-insured and self-\nadministered. That was the intent. It was not the intent to go one inch \nbeyond that or to cover one group or one plan beyond that.\n  I will bluntly say, if the language in here is not consistent with \nthat intent, we need to go back to the drawing board and look at the \nlanguage. That was the intent of the four or five of us who were \nworking on this issue. That was the specific intent, and that was the \ninstruction that was given to staff.\n\n  If the lawyers did not come back with that language, and I did not \ncatch it when I read it, I apologize, and we will look at that. But it \nis going to take us a few minutes to get the language out.\n  My understanding of what my colleague has said is that if a union \ndoes in fact operate a plan, and they are in fact self-insured and \nself-administered, he believes they should be treated the same way; \nanybody who runs a plan with those two qualifications should be treated \nthe same way. Is my understanding correct?\n  Mr. FRIST. We have to be very careful.\n  Mr. DeWINE. If those are the facts.\n  Mr. FRIST. We have to be very careful whom we carve out. And then \nwhatever definition we use for the carve-out, we need to apply \nconsistency to it.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I agree.\n  Mr. FRIST. I believe we should go back and look at the way the bill \nis written.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Let me suggest we take a look at that as we continue this \ndebate. We have a little time to debate. Let us look at the language.\n  I again want to reiterate something, though. And I do not want any of \nmy colleagues who are watching this back in their office or who are in \nthis Chamber to misunderstand this. This is a limited carve-out. This \nis not a huge carve-out.\n  Basically, what this carve-out says is, because of the unique \nsituation of the self-insured, self-administered plans, we are going to \nexempt them from lawsuits, based on contract, in Federal court--they \nare not going to be exempt from other lawsuits and in State courts, and \nbased on medical decisions. So it is a limited carve-out. I do not want \nanybody who is watching this debate to think this is some huge carve-\nout. It is a carve-out on a limited basis. Our intent was to treat \npeople equally who were in that unique circumstance.\n  I know my colleague from Tennessee has been wrestling with this for a \ncouple years: How do you deal with these folks who have this unique \nproblem?\n  I say to my colleague from New Hampshire, this may not be perfect, \nbut we think it improves the status quo. That is sort of what we are \nabout today: Trying to improve the status quo.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DeWINE. No, I will not yield yet.\n  We have had criticism of this amendment from people who say it does \nnot solve all the problems. I came to this Chamber and said, no, it \ndoes not solve all the problems, but we are trying. And we are trying \nwith this amendment. If we can improve the amendment, and if we can get \nthe language more precise that does it, I will be more than happy to do \nit.\n  Yes, I yield to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I think the language, as presently drafted, is in your \ndefinitional section of the amendment where you find ``(ii) (II).'' It \nsays:\n\n     a group health plan that is maintained by one or more \n     employers or employee organizations described in [this \n     section].\n\n  That essentially encompasses all union plans. Very few union plans do \nnot use a third-party administrator, very few. So I think you want to \ntighten up that definition to make it clear that you are applying it to \nthe self-insured, self-funded, self-administered plans, and then you \nwould be picking up the same people that you are picking up under the \nWal-Mart exception.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Reclaiming my time, that was our intent. If that is not \nreflected in the language, we will change the language.\n  I yield to my colleague from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. The Senator from Ohio is making exactly the correct point. \nThis particular provision was intended for those insurers, self-insured \nand self-administered plans, that obviously do not have a designated \ndecisionmaker. I should further emphasize, all employers are treated \nequally when it comes to the idea that they participate in medical \ndecisions on behalf of their employees. They are all treated the same. \nThis particular area of the legislation is with respect to contractual \ndecisions. We are attempting to craft out for self-administered, self-\ninsured plans, and that includes union health plans that conform to \nthat particular organization, that they would not be subjected to \nlitigation that other employers would not be subjected to because they \nhad designated decisionmakers.\n  We know self-insured, self-administered plans do not have designated \ndecisionmakers. So we did not want to expose them to that kind of \nlitigation in this particular section that delineates the causes of \naction. We were trying to treat all of the employers equally.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I reclaim my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, we have stated our intent. I think we \nought to get about our business and come up with the language to do \nthat, some possible language that we could use. It is always dangerous \nto try to draft language on the fly on the Senate floor.\n  I will at least throw this out for possible discussion. We could add \n``to the extent the Taft-Hartley Plan Act as self-insured, self-\nadministered plans,'' something to that effect of basically qualifying \nso that you would get down to whatever the number is--I don't know what \nthe number is--that are self-insured and self-administered. We \ncertainly could do that. There is no reason that cannot be done.\n  Mr. GREGG. Is the Senator suggesting that additional definition? Is \nthe Senator suggesting that definition, that expansion of the \ndefinition, that expanded language be placed on the definition section?\n  Mr. DeWINE. We could do it that way. If the Senator has a suggestion \nof how better to do it, I would be more than happy to take the \nsuggestion.\n  Mr. GREGG. That may well resolve the problem.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield to my colleague from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I ask the Senator from Ohio, I think the discussion has \nbeen very helpful. Two points are important to have on the record. A \nself-insured and self-administered plan by this amendment would not \nrelieve themselves of being subject to litigation for\n\n[[Page S7033]]\n\ndecisions made based on medical necessity under the Patients' Bill of \nRights bill we are adopting.\n  Mr. DeWINE. The Senator is absolutely correct. We believe the \nlanguage does reflect that, but that is clearly the intent.\n  Mr. BREAUX. If the Senator would further yield, the point made by the \nSenator from New Hampshire is absolutely correct in the sense that on \npage 3 of the Senator's amendment, line 18, when he talked about that \ngroup health plan--basically the Taft-Hartley group health plans, as I \nunderstand it--you didn't have that limitation of those that would also \nbe self-insured and self-administered. I think if you added that to \nthat definition, you would correct the problem. I think it would be in \nkeeping with what the Senator wants to do and certainly something I \ncould support.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I appreciate my colleague's comments. I think they are \nwell taken. We will get about the business of dealing with that. The \npoint is very well taken.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I yield myself approximately 15 minutes \non the opposition time for the time being.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine has 7 minutes remaining \nin her time on the proponent's side.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, is this 4 hours evenly divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are four 1-hour segments. The Senator \nfrom Tennessee controls 1 hour of the 4-hour time. The Senator from \nMaine controls 1 hour. She has 7 minutes remaining on her hour. The \nSenator from New Hampshire controls 1 hour, and the Senator from \nMassachusetts controls 1 hour.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that for the \nfirst hour, it be equally divided so we can continue the debate for \nthose in opposition.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I am sorry. What was that request?\n  Mr. FRIST. For the first hour of the debate, which we are about, I \nguess, 20 or 30 minutes into, the opposition has not had the \nopportunity to speak. I was saying for the first hour, in which about \n25 minutes has been used, if we can have 30 minutes on either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The debate has already consumed 53 minutes on \nthe proponent's side controlled by the Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Tennessee has an hour. He can use it any \nway he wants.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I understand I have an hour on my side. I \nwill use time off our side at this juncture. I yield myself such time \nas necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, first of all, let me put perspective on \nthis because we have had the amendment introduced, and there are \nbasically three points I want to make.\n  No. 1, I applaud the Senator from Ohio and the Senator from Maine \nbecause they have, for the first time in the debate, addressed this \nissue of suing employers--this issue of who is responsible, who gets \nsued, if there is harm or injury or cause of action. As one can tell \nfrom their earlier discussion, there has been a lot of debate in \nstruggling with how best to address who you sue and when you sue them \nand what entity. There is not very much certainty out there. Do you sue \nthe plan? Do you sue the employer? Do you sue the agent of the plan? Do \nyou sue the physician or the hospital when there has been harm or \ninjury?\n  In the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill, there are exclusions for the \nphysician and the hospital. However, the argument and the debate over \nthe last 4 or 5 days has made it clear that you can sue the employers \nif they directly participate. And what has now been brought to the \nfloor in a very positive way, I believe, is this concept of giving \ncertainty to all that through a model that is called the designated-\ndecision-maker.\n  Really all that means is that since somebody is going to be sued--and \nthe way it is designed now, you don't know who it is; that doesn't give \nanybody certainty--the easiest thing to do is for an employer to walk \naway. It might be me that is sued. It might be the entity that is \nadministering my plan. It might be an agent of that plan. That is so \nconfusing and puts so much risk out there, and you never know whether \nyou are at risk or not, or somebody else, or who the lawyers will be \ngoing after. The designated-decision-maker says: We are going to all \nget in a room and say there is one entity responsible. If there is a \nlawsuit, you are going to go after that entity. That entity has to bear \nthe risk, and also whatever value there is for that risk will have to \nbe either purchased or sold. That gives certainty to the overall \nliability issue.\n  The second point--I will come back to this--that is very positive in \nthe underlying amendment is this broad cause of action which is being \nstruck from the underlying bill. That is where the underlying bill, \nwhen you go to the Federal level in the underlying bill, there is a \ncause of action called ``duty under the plan.'' Unfortunately, if you \nleave that cause of action in there, it sweeps in all sorts of things, \nwhether it is the HIPAA regulations or the COBRA regulations, and all \nof a sudden for those sort of indications, you don't have just \ncompensation, but you are exposed to these unlimited lawsuits out \nthere. So it is very positive, in the amendment that has been put on \nthe floor by the Senators from Maine and Ohio, to take that cause of \naction out of the underlying bill.\n  The third point is that the Senator from Ohio made the point that \nthis is not the answer to liability. Liability involves exhaustion of \nappeals. And we have an amendment pending on the floor addressing \nwhether there should be caps; and that entire debate, once you get to \ncourts, whether it is noneconomic damages or punitive damages, involves \nwhether you to go Federal court or State court and then this whole idea \nof who do you sue. Can the employer be sued? And that last point is \nwhat the designated decisionmaker selectively looks at, that sliver of \nthe pie of liability.\n  So far in the debate, over the last 4 or 5 days, we have not \naddressed Federal versus State jurisdiction, whether or not there are \ncaps, full and completion exhaustion, or should there be class action \nsuits. The Senator from Ohio made that point. It is critically \nimportant to address. If you read the press on this, this decision-\nmaker model will take care of the liability. But it does not answer the \nquestions on the part of myself and many others.\n  The history of the designated-decision-maker model is interesting as \nwell. It is in the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill. The amendment on the \nfloor is very similar to what is in the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill in \nthat you give certainty; you have to name an entity to be the \ndesignated-decision-maker. That is who you sue. The Frist-Breaux-\nJeffords bill based that on what already passed the Senate about a year \nand a half ago. A designated-decision-maker amendment passed this body. \nThat amendment came from the conference last year, where you had \nDemocrats and Republicans sitting around a table addressing how to come \nup with a system that best addresses this problem of having employers \nbeing sued out here when you really want to go after HMOs. How do you \ndelink employers versus HMOs?\n  Basically, you make one entity responsible. It could be the employer, \nif they meet certain financial criteria; it could be the HMO; or the \nHMO might contract with another entity. But somebody has the risk. They \nhave to have the financial wherewithal that equals that risk or the \npotential of that risk. So I love the designated-decision-maker model. \nIt is clearly needed and necessary.\n  Let me take a minute. We keep drawing references to the Frist-Breaux-\nJeffords bill and the way that worked, because whether or not I can \nactually end up supporting the amendment of the Senators from Maine and \nOhio really depends on how close in my own mind we get to the \nunderlying model that is in the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill. I believe \nthat gives the most certainty--certainty to the employer and also \ncertainty to the employee, at both levels.\n  The way that process works is there is an internal and external \nappeals process. Under the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill, you can't opt \nout of that and go directly to the court as you can in the McCain-\nEdwards-Kennedy bill. We are trying to fix that through another bill.\n\n[[Page S7034]]\n\n  In the Frist bill, once you go through the internal and external \nappeals and you go to court, you are going to end up going to Federal \ncourt. If there is a lawsuit in advance, prospectively--not after the \nfact--a designated-decision-maker has been identified. If there is a \nlawsuit, there is no question of whether you sue the employer or the \nHMO or the agent of the plan or the hospital or the doctor. Indeed, you \nsue one person. There is no choice. It is the designated-decision-\nmaker. That is decided in advance.\n  The Snowe-DeWine amendment takes that concept. Again, I think it is \nthe right way. I think most people would agree that is the most \nappropriate way to address this issue of employer liability. But what \nthey have done is given a choice, from direct participation, of the \ndecision-maker model. To me--and I will have to be honest--that leads \nto some sort of uncertainty because instead of having real certainty in \nthe employer's mind and employee's mind, the beneficiary of the plan, \nthat there is one person, and you know in advance a year before, 6 \nmonths before, that they have the responsibility, and somebody has paid \nfor it. Instead of having that certainty, you introduce more choice. \nAgain, are they directly participating? Are they in the decision-maker \nmodel? The debate we just heard--are they a self-insured, self-\nadministered plan which is carved out of the Federal cause of action, \nor are they a union plan? We just heard that debate. Some are self-\ninsured. Some are not. Why carve unions out there? We will look at that \nparticular language. All of that uncertainty is avoided with the \ndesignated-decision-maker model.\n\n  Now, that second point that I have already mentioned, which is very \npositive in this bill--probably more positive, I believe, in the \namendment introduced by the Senators from Maine and Ohio, is the part \nof their amendment which deletes the provision in the underlying \nMcCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill that would allow lawsuits against employers \nand insurers for unspecified failures--and I quote from the bill--``in \nthe performance of the duty under the terms and conditions of the \nplan.''\n  That is the language which is going to be deleted. That is important \nbecause if you don't take that out of the underlying bill, employers \nwill still be highly vulnerable to lawsuits based on alleged failures \nin the whole realm of administrative duties. That could be under HIPAA, \nthe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which we \npassed in this body several years ago, and COBRA, whereby employers are \nnot allowed to delegate administrative duties, under those laws, to \nanyone else, by law. You can't. So the liability for those \nadministrative duties, because you can't delegate, would fall on the \nemployer, thus allowing the employer to be sued. So that is very \npositive, I think. It was addressed directly in the amendment, and I \ncommend them for that.\n  Third is that we need to understand throughout this debate, as we \nhopefully can refine this amendment and pass it if we can resolve some \nof the specific issues in the language. We need to be crystal clear \nagain that addressing the designated-decision-maker addresses the \nemployer aspect of liability but does not address the many other \nfactors of liability, which I think we have a responsibility to address \non this floor, since this bill never went through committee and, in \ntruth, we are marking up and writing this bill for the first time on \nthe floor. We need to talk about Federal versus State courts, class \naction suits, whether or not there should be caps in a noneconomic \ndamage or should there be punitive damages. All of those other issues \nhave not yet been addressed. Now I am quite pleased we are addressing \nthe designated-decision-maker aspect of employers being sued.\n  Several quick examples. There need to be clear and effective limits, \nI believe, on class action lawsuits. There need to be firm requirements \nthat we fully exhaust internal and external reviews before initiating \nany lawsuits. There are a lot of broad exceptions. We talked about some \nof them as the Thompson amendment was on the floor; we have addressed \nit. We have to have complete exhaustion as we go through.\n  Second, if an independent external medical reviewer, who is a doctor, \nwhich is in the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords plan, as well as in the McCain-\nEdwards-Kennedy plan, upholds the plan's denial, then the plan should \nnot be subject to liability. We need to discuss that on the floor. In \nthe underlying McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill, a patient can still sue, \neven though that independent medical reviewer, a physician with age-\nappropriate expertise, has decided that the plan made the right \ndecision in internal and external appeals and the physician says \neverything was right going through. I believe the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords \nbill says, no, you can sue for care, injunctive relief, but not for \nextraordinary rewards. That has to be addressed.\n  Also, the underlying McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill would allow the \nindependent reviewer to ``modify''--I believe that is the word used--\nthe plan's denial. And this is just as a physician. What it means is \nthat in a paper review you never see the patient. You read records and \nhope they are complete, and the reviewer is going to have the \nopportunity to maybe do thousands of these, maybe hundreds, maybe 10. I \ndon't know. I was with a doctor a few minutes ago who has done \nthousands of these reviews.\n  The point is that you never see the patient. You never get the \nsubtleties of clinical diagnosis, which all of us know is science, but \nthere is also art to it. You are asking somebody to look at this paper \nand review it and say, yes, it was right or, no, it was wrong.\n  With the information written on that paper, you are allowed to come \nin and modify the treatment of that patient. I can say as a physician \nthe fact that based on that paper review, a reviewer could require that \nthe plan cover treatment that neither the treating physician nor the \nplan ever contemplated or ever recommended, this reviewer who maybe \nover the telephone is reading it, is going to be able to modify it \nbothers me.\n  It bothers me because it becomes binding, and we all know it becomes \nbinding. When it becomes binding and you have not had that direct \nexperiential observation, to me it is not right. It needs to be \ncorrected.\n  I will give another example: The employer in the plan would be \nsubject to simultaneous litigation in Federal and State court. Again, \nspeaking to the underlying bill, we have to address that because we all \nknow when we have lawsuits which result in--take a $120 million damage \naward such as there was 2 years ago. A $120 million award is a large \naward. Some will say it is too much; some will say it is too little. \nBut a $120 million damage award results in total premiums being paid \nfor about 55,000 enrollees on average.\n  I do not want to correlate the two, but $120 million is a lot of \nmoney, and, at least in my mind, I come back to the uninsured and the \nnumber of enrollees who could go out and buy insurance.\n  We need to be careful about encouraging shopping between the Federal \ncourts and State courts, and once you get to the State courts, from \nState to State. Maybe tomorrow, Saturday, Sunday, or Monday we will \ncome back to that and talk about it. Clearly, if you are an attorney, \nfor a single event, you have multiple causes of action, you can \nquestion that, but in addition to that, you have multiple venues: the \nFederal court, the State court, or from State to State to State. That \nis our interpretation. That is our attorneys' interpretation. It has to \nbe fixed.\n  In closing, I support the designated-decision-maker model. The \nSenators from Maine and Ohio are to be congratulated for the first time \nin this Chamber addressing in a sophisticated, appropriate way how to \nclarify the uncertainty about suing employers versus suing HMOs.\n  I support the model. It is in the underlying Frist-Breaux-Jeffords \nbill. We are looking at the language, as we speak, on the issue of \nunions and why they are specifically carved out. That needs to be \naddressed. We hope to have factual information. We will read the \nlanguage, and I look forward to working aggressively with the authors \nof this amendment so we can all rally around it.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. If I can respond to the Senator's comments about why we \ncrafted the bill, it was to give the employer a choice as to whether or \nnot they would go under the designated decisionmaker or under the \nlanguage of the other bill, which is direct participation.\n\n[[Page S7035]]\n\n  Frankly, I do not think this is a huge deal. The reality is that the \nvast majority of businesses will go under designated decisionmaker, \nand, in fact, we provide in the bill that it is automatic. That will \njust happen unless they make a conscious decision to say: We do not \nwant to do the designated decisionmaker; we want to go under the direct \nparticipation language.\n  We are in an unknown area, and I do not think anyone knows how this \nis going to play out entirely in the real world and what decisions they \nare going to make. Some people come up with some scenarios under which \nthey would not want to designate someone as a designated decisionmaker. \nThe vast majority are. We wanted to provide this as a fallback \nposition, more options.\n\n  I do not think it is going to make it more ambiguous or less definite \nbecause we provide automatically it is going to be designated \ndecisionmaker unless they make an action and say: No, we do not want \ndesignated decisionmaker; we want to go with our model because for some \nreason it works that way. We can look at the language and talk about \nit.\n  In explanation to our colleague from Tennessee, that is what our \nthinking was. We do not know where the world is going with this new \nlanguage, and we wanted to give as many options to businesses as we \ncould. That is why we did it.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I claim my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. I guess this decision of certainty--I usually like choice \ncoming through, and it appeals to me. I am a 50-person convenience \nstore operator and have three or four convenience stores in the area, \nand I have people barely scraping by, working minimum wage, but I \nrecognize giving people some insurance goes a long way. Some people say \nit does not matter; you still have your care. If you have insurance, \nyou end up getting better care in the United States of America, it gets \nyou in the door. We talk about the 43 million uninsured, and we all \ncare. It bothers me in a direct way.\n  I am that operator and I know I am going to have to find a \ndesignated-decision-maker. That is going to cost money because it is \nliability; it is increased liability. I do not know, but if I have a \nchoice, I am going to say I am barely scraping by and it is just easier \nfor me not to play at all. Dealing with designated-decision-maker, you \nhave that choice. If that is the case, I fall back to the direct \nparticipation language, and the direct participation language has all \nof the other problems. The pressure of the system is going to be such \nbecause direct participation does not cost you much, but if you get \nsued for $120 million or in 1993 for $89 million or in the year 2000 \nfor $80 million. That is real; just one case.\n  If I am sitting in my convenience stores and I say designated, this \nis the new model created by the U.S. Congress; I am not going to \nparticipate in it; it is too expensive. Thereby I go back to direct \nparticipation, and we are where we are now.\n  It is easier to walk away and not give even those 30 employees \ninsurance out of fear, out of risk. That is why with the direct \nparticipation model, as long as everybody plays and everybody is \ncertain it has prospective certainty for the employer and employee, \npeople are not going to drop their insurance.\n  I will be happy to yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE. To respond, as envisioned by the Senator's original \nbill--and the Senator from Tennessee is the one who came up with the \nlanguage of the designated decisionmaker and I applaud him for it \nbecause no one has come up with one better. This is the model. This \nlanguage is pretty much the Frist bill. But in the Senator's example, \nthe designated decisionmaker is going to automatically--you have this \ncompany that has three or three convenience stores; they have who knows \nhow many employees; they buy insurance. Their designated decisionmaker \nis automatically going to be the group handling the insurance. They \nwill not have to make a conscious decision at all. It will just happen. \nThat is the glory of the way it is written and of the Senator's \noriginal language, that it is automatic; it is going to happen. They \nare not going to have to look for a designated decisionmaker.\n\n  Under the language of the Senator from Tennessee, it is going to take \ncare of itself. That is the strength of it.\n  Mr. FRIST. May I use 1 minute and then I will yield on that issue. I \nwant to respond to that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. May I ask a question? We have two other cosponsors of \nthe amendment. They have yet to have a word.\n  Mr. FRIST. How much time has been used by this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee has consumed about \n22 minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. How much has the other side used since we have been on the \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The other side has used 53 minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. They have used 53 minutes, and we have used 22 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much have we used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has used none.\n  Mr. FRIST. I was speaking in opposition to the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think the presenters ought to be entitled to whatever \ntime they have remaining. I am a strong believer in that. I would like \nto invite our cosponsors to have a word.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee still has the \nfloor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Thank you, Mr. President. A matter of clarification, in \nspeaking in opposition to the amendment, yielded by Senator Gregg, we \nhave used how much time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-three minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Twenty-three minutes since we have been on the amendment. \nClarification: The proponents have used how much?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifty-three minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. I will be happy to yield the floor in a moment. \nClarification on the designated-decision-maker model: We would not \nnecessarily assume the insurance company is the designated-decision-\nmaker. You would have to designate that, and that is part of our Frist-\nBreaux legislation, just to clarify that.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. FRIST. I will be happy to.\n  Ms. SNOWE. It is important to emphasize in this amendment as we have \ndrafted it includes a provision that starts out with automatic \ndesignation: That a health insurance issuer shall be deemed to be a \ndesignated decisionmaker for purposes of subparagraph (A) with respect \nto participants and beneficiaries of an employer or plan sponsor.\n  That is important to emphasize, and it automatically occurs so we \nremove the ambiguity, extra steps, cost, and so on, with respect to \nthat particular requirement.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield such time as he desires to the Senator from \nNebraska and then the Senator from Arkansas, two lead sponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts for the opportunity to speak to this amendment. There has \nbeen a lot of discussion recently and I think most people's heads are \nswimming about what a DDM is and what the purpose of this amendment \ntruly is.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to make sure, whether you are a plan \nsponsor or an employer, if you are self-insured and self-administered, \nthat you are treated the same. You have to treat one and all the same. \nThat is what this is about. I believe there is some language being \nworked on that probably will be offered shortly to make it clear that \nis exactly what is intended by this amendment. It does not specifically \ncarve out one group or another. It carves out all groups where there \nare plan sponsors or employers who are self-insured and self-\nadministered. All other employers are in a position to have a DDM, \ndesignated decisionmakers, or they have an insurer which is a \ndesignated decisionmaker.\n  The whole purpose of this legislation is to be able to provide \nadditional rights and opportunities for insurance. This does it. What \nit also does is make sure that employers are not entrapped in \nunnecessary litigation and that if they don't make decisions about \nhealth\n\n[[Page S7036]]\n\ncare and make decisions about claims, they are not involved in \nlitigation.\n  Specifically, this amendment narrows it down to not being brought \ninto Federal causes of action. It does not absolve employers or plan \nsponsors from any kind of litigation that may come through State \ncourts.\n  While it may be difficult to follow the roadmap, there is one thing \nthat needs to be clarified and that is, it does not treat any one group \nin any special way. It treats all plan sponsors and all employers who \nself-insure and self-administer, the same way. If they choose to get a \nthird party administrator, which becomes a designated decisionmaker, \nthey will be absolved from liability from litigation unless they \nsomehow participated in the claim-making process, which they would not \ndo if they had a designated decisionmaker. This is intended to make \nsure we balance the interests of the right of the individuals, the \nright of the patients to sue, with the opportunity for employers not to \nbe entangled in litigation where they should not be entangled. It also \nmeans that in balancing these interests, there will be fewer cases of \nuninsureds, and there will be fewer employers deciding to get out of \nthe business of providing health insurance benefits to employees.\n  We have heard from employer after employer about their concern--as a \nvoluntary provider of these benefits, now suddenly they can be sued. \nThis makes it clear they will not be sued and it also makes it clear \nthat those who are plan sponsors will not also be sued unless they \nparticipate in making decisions about health care claims. That is what \nthis is all about.\n  I hope this clarifies it for some of my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle who have raised questions. It is important to raise \nquestions and certainly ask the question whether there is any special \ntreatment. But if you look at the language and you look at what is \nbeing done, there is not any special treatment for one group over \nanother. The category is the same. If you self-insure and self-\nadminister you will be open to some exposure. However, we will make \ncertain that exposure is limited when it comes to Federal actions. That \nis what this is about.\n\n  I yield to my colleague from Arkansas and say before departing, thank \nyou to my colleagues and cosponsors from Maine and Ohio. I believe this \nis the right way to proceed to improve this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I am the last of four children and I am the last in \nthis line of four, and I am delighted to have waited patiently to rise \ntoday and speak in support of an amendment I am offering with Senator \nSnowe, along with Senator DeWine and Senator Nelson, to protect \nemployers from liability.\n  The good Senator from Tennessee, Dr. Frist, would certainly join and \nagree, as we have taken a good bit of his designated decisionmaker \nlanguage, that our ultimate goal is to protect the rights of patients \nwhile ensuring that employers who provide health care are not subject \nto frivolous lawsuits.\n  The objective is to those individuals, the good guys in this bunch, \nthe employers reaching out and providing the kind of health care that \nAmericans need; that we can work within the confines of this bill and \nwithin this amendment to ensure they can continue doing that. That is \nexactly what we have attempted to do. I think we have worked long and \nhard. I know my colleagues and I have worked long and hard to develop \nlanguage to do just that, in working with those employers who want to \nprovide the much needed health insurance that Americans want.\n  Employers that are offering health insurance are the good guys. We \ndon't want to discourage them from offering health insurance. This \namendment provides the assurance they need to those offering health \ninsurance, that if they do not make medical decisions or override \nmedical decisions, they are not liable. Again, I know the good Senator \nfrom Tennessee, Dr. Frist, understands that in terms of making sure \nthose who are not making medical decisions are not going to be held \nliable.\n  We have worked hard on the underlying bill, as the Presiding Officer \nknows, as we have talked in many press conferences on some of the most \nimportant issues to the American people. This Patients' Bill of Rights \nis one of those issues. We have reached out.\n  The opponents of the Bipartisan Patient Protection Act have argued \nthat the Patients' Bill of Rights will drive up health care costs by \nsubjecting employers to increased liability and frivolous lawsuits, and \nin turn they argue rising costs will force employers to drop health \ninsurance. Our amendment presents an innovative solution to this \npotential dilemma. We have been able to provide the protection needed \nby these individuals who are already out there doing the right thing.\n  By allowing these employers to design this designated decisionmaker, \na term presented from the Breaux-Frist legislation, to oversee medical \ncare decisions, we remove most large and small business owners from the \nthreat of liability. They have that option of choosing a designated \ndecisionmaker. We make it possible for employers to contract with a \nthird party to administer health benefits and protect themselves from \nunnecessary and crippling lawsuits. This amendment makes it crystal \nclear that employers will not have to open themselves up to new \nliability as a result of providing health insurance to their employees.\n  When we began discussing the Patients' Bill of Rights years ago, we \nwanted to ensure that patients would be able to choose their own \nphysicians and their medical professionals--not accountants, not \nbureaucrats, not insurance company executives, but the medical \nprofessionals--would make the medical decisions. We never, absolutely \nnever, intended to open employers up to liability. And we certainly \ndon't want to do anything in this bill that would discourage these \nemployers from providing health insurance to their employees.\n  We are delighted to work out the clarifying language that Members \nbelieve is needed to assure everyone is treated fairly.\n  The amendment I offer today refutes the charge that the Patients' \nBill of Rights is a trial lawyers employment act. Today we make it \nclear that we have absolutely no intention of subjecting employers to \nnew liability or frivolous lawsuits. We want to encourage our employers \nin this country to provide health care coverage for their workers.\n  In 1993 when we began the discussion of health care, we made it our \nobjective to get more individuals covered under health insurance \nprovided by their employers. We were able to do that. Unfortunately, we \nhave more uninsured in this country today, and we do not want to \nexacerbate that problem. We want to give these employers the comfort \nthat they need, to feel confident in keeping that employee insurance \navailable.\n  This amendment is our pledge of good faith to American employers and \nbusiness owners that we will protect their needs as well as the needs \nof their employees.\n  I applaud the work of my colleagues. I have enjoyed working with \nthem. I appreciate everyone's patience and endurance in this process. \nWe hope to be very inclusive, to bring others in to make sure this \nlanguage is exactly that: It is giving the protection and the comfort \nlevel to the employers of this Nation that are doing an excellent job \nin providing health care to their employees.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that Senator Baucus be added as a \ncosponsor to this amendment, and I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the Senator from Michigan 5 minutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise first of all to ask unanimous \nconsent to add my name as a cosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle for their hard work and the innovative language that is put \ntogether in this amendment. For those of us who are sponsors of the \nPatients' Bill of Rights, we have said since the beginning this was in \nno way intended to allow lawsuits to be brought against employers, this \nwas about making sure those who make medical decisions were held \naccountable for those medical decisions.\n\n[[Page S7037]]\n\n  As we said so many times on the floor, it is really about closing a \nloophole in the law as well. We have indicated over and over again, \nwhen you have only two groups of people in this country who are not \nheld accountable for their behavior and their decisions, one being \nforeign diplomats, the other being HMOs, it doesn't make any sense. We \nknow this was a loophole that was created by the outgrowth of HMOs and \ndevelopment of new ways of managing health care, and basically the \nPatients' Bill of Rights is meant to clarify that and make sure those \nwho are making medical decisions are held accountable for the outcomes \nof those medical decisions, just as are doctors and nurses and other \nmedical professionals.\n  What I think is important about this amendment is it very clearly \nstates to each and every employer, large and small, that in fact we \nwill make sure if they are not making medical decisions--and in the \nvast majority of times an employer is not making a medical decision--\nthe intent of the Patients' Bill of Rights is not to create a liability \nfor the employer. We have employers, many in Michigan--hundreds of \nthousands of them--who are responsible employers, providing insurance \nfor their employees. We want to encourage and support and salute them \nfor doing that and make sure nothing gets in the way of that \ncontinuing.\n  I again thank my colleagues from both sides of the aisle who have put \nin a tremendous amount of work on this amendment. There has been a \nwonderful job done clarifying this. I hope we have now been able to put \nto rest what was unfortunately a common misperception, something said \nover and over again to employers of this country, that somehow this \nopens them up to lawsuit. It never was the intent. This amendment \nclarifies that and reiterates it.\n  I hope this will allow us to move forward, to pass this very strong \nPatient Protection Act that says to each and every family: When you \nhave insurance you can have the confidence, whether it is in the \nemergency room or the doctor's office or the hospital, that you will \nhave the care available that your family needs.\n  I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Both the Snowe amendment and the Frist amendment attempt to protect \nlawyers using the designated decisionmaker language. However, the fact \nthat they use similar names can't mask the dramatic differences between \nthese two amendments. Senator Snowe's amendment helps employers without \nhurting patients.\n  There are two important differences between the designated \ndecisionmaker language in the Snowe amendment and the Frist amendment. \nSenator Snowe's amendment ensures that the person an employer \ndesignates as responsible and will be liable for all damages caused by \nany wrongful benefit determinations the patient gets under our bill. \nThis is exactly what employers want and deserve, a clear way under the \nlaw to protect themselves.\n  The Snowe amendment allows employers to name an HMO or health insurer \nor plan administrator as their designated decisionmaker and not have to \nworry anymore about being sued. That is what President Bush wants, and \nthat is what we want. If employers give up all control over medical \ndecisions in individual cases such as this, Senator Snowe's language \nhelps guarantee employers will not be sued, period.\n  Senator Frist's designated decisionmaker language is much weaker. \nUnder his proposal, the only entity that can be sued is the designated \ndecisionmaker. While the designated decisionmaker is supposed to have \nexclusive authority to make benefit determinations, a court or jury \nremains free to find in fact another person or company influenced the \ndecision that caused the harm. People who are not designated \ndecisionmakers may in fact influence decisions and share liability. But \nthe Frist language leaves victims no way to hold these outsiders \naccountable. That is because, unlike the amendment of Senator Snowe, \nthe Frist amendment never deems the designated decisionmaker liable for \nthe acts or omissions of other parties who affect benefit \ndeterminations. This is the most critical difference between the two \nproposals.\n  The other important difference is that under Senator Snowe's \namendment, only employers can name designated decisionmakers; HMOs \ncannot. After all, the entire point of having designated decisionmakers \nis to ensure employers have a clear, easy way to avoid all possibility \nof being sued, not to protect HMOs.\n  Of course, the effect of allowing HMOs to have a designated \ndecisionmaker is to enable them to escape liability for part or all of \ntheir actions. Under the Frist-Breaux amendment, if a judge or jury \nfinds someone in an HMO harmed a patient and that person working for \nthe HMO was not a designated decisionmaker, the HMO escapes liability.\n  I think the amendment is sound. I think it has been a matter of \ndiscussion and debate. I think those of us who were involved in the \ndevelopment of the initial legislation sought to achieve what this \namendment does enormously fairly. It also treats the various Taft-\nHartley aspects equally with the other parts, so we have equality for \none and equality for the other.\n  Another important feature of Senator Snowe's amendment is that it \nprotects employers and Taft-Hartley plans which self-insure and self-\nadminister claims. The Frist alternative contained in S.889 fails to \naddress this issue. The Taft-Hartley plans have a long history of \nproviding quality health care for their members. In their unique \nstructure, employee advocates comprise half of the members of the \nboard. The record shows that this has been an excellent protection even \nfor beneficiaries who have extraordinary health care needs. In \nstructuring this legislation, we wanted to be certain that we didn't \nimpose any inappropriate burdens on these plans.\n  I commend the Senators. They spent a great deal of time on this \namendment. One would think it would be easy in the drafting of it, but \nI know they have been challenged with it. I commend them for really \nadvancing this whole issue in a very positive, constructive way, a way \nwhich really reflects what this President has enunciated and a way \nwhich we had hoped to include in our legislation. There was a \nsignificant question about it. Legitimate issues were raised. I think \nthis is one of the important contributions in helping move this \nprocess. I commend all those on both sides who were very much involved \nin its development.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, this amendment is a wonderful example of \nwhat can be done when we work together to solve problems. The \nbeneficiaries of the work that has been done by Senators Snowe, Nelson, \nDeWine, and Lincoln are not the Members of the Senate but the people of \nthis country, the families who need quality health care, and the \nemployers that need to be protected from unnecessary lawsuits and \nunnecessary litigation.\n  First, I thank Senator Snowe for her leadership. She has taken the \nlead on this issue from the beginning. Her work has been absolutely \ncrucial.\n  My friend, Mr. DeWine, the Senator from Ohio, has also lent \ntremendous leadership and expertise to the work on this effort.\n  I also thank my colleague seated near me, Senator Nelson from \nNebraska, who not only brings great expertise to this issue both as \nGovernor and as insurance commissioner of the State of Nebraska, but he \nhas been dogged in his determination to ensure that the small \nemployers, particularly, and employers generally, of America are \nprotected in this legislation.\n  This effort could not have been achieved without his leadership and \nwithout his dogged involvement in this issue. He has been involved in \nso many of the issues with respect to this legislation. He and I have \nworked together. He and I and Senator McCain have worked together. He \nhas been involved in this patients' rights protection act from the very \nbeginning. We thank him for all of his work and important contribution.\n  Also, the Senator from Arkansas, who has expressed a concern about \nemployers from the very first moment,\n\n[[Page S7038]]\n\nand I have talked about this issue. She cares deeply about patients and \ndeeply about doctors making medical decisions, having a very well-\ntrained physician in her own family, that being her husband. She has \nfirsthand experience with that. But in addition to that, she has shown \ngreat concern for small employers and, as has Senator Nelson, has made \nit very clear to Senator McCain and myself and Senator Kennedy that the \nonly way she could support this legislation is if we did what was \nnecessary to protect employers. She has been absolutely crucial in \nachieving that goal.\n  Without the work of Senators Lincoln, Nelson, Snowe, and DeWine, the \nemployers of this country would be in a different place than they are \ntoday. I think they will be after this amendment is voted on.\n  They have achieved two very important purposes:\n  No. 1, they have insured that there are real and meaningful \nprotections for employers through the designated decisionmaker model \nwhich we have already talked about, which essentially means the small \nemployers that we have talked about are 100-percent protected. They \ncannot have liability under the language of this amendment, which is \ncrucial. It is a goal and a principle that we have all shared from the \nbeginning but, again, couldn't have been done without their work. They \nhave also managed to do it in a creative and innovative way that, while \nprotecting employers, does not leave the patients and the families high \nand dry, which is exactly what needed to be done.\n  Honestly, it is a very difficult task, but they have worked doggedly \non this issue. All of them managed to reach a bipartisan agreement.\n  The most important thing from the perspective of the overall \nlegislation is that this is another in a series of obstacles about \nwhich we have now been able to reach some consensus.\n  They have followed sort of one by one by one, starting with the issue \nof scope, which Senator Breaux, Senator Jeffords, I, and others worked \non, reaching a crucial compromise going to the issue of independence of \nmedical panels to make sure that those panels are, in fact, \nindependent.\n  We have reached a resolution of that issue. On the issue of medical \nnecessity, the Presiding Officer from Delaware, along with my friend, \nthe Senator from Indiana, were crucial in being able to reach a \nresolution that shows proper respect for the sanctity of the contract \nand the specific language of the contract but some flexibility, where \nnecessary, for the independent review panel with respect to patients, \nkeeping in mind the interest of patients on the one hand, which I know \nyou care about deeply, and the importance of the contract in keeping \ncosts under control.\n  Without your work and Senator Bayh's work, that would not have been \nachieved.\n  The Senator from Tennessee and I, as we speak, are attempting to \nfinalize an agreement on the exhaustion of appeal. Both of us believe, \nas do most Members of this body, that it is a sensible thing to have a \npatient go through the internal and external appeal before any case \ngoes to court. We have tightened up that language; working together on \nit. We know it is important.\n  The Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Thompson, and I are resolving this \nissue of the exhaustion of appeal. All of us believe that the appeals \nprocess is crucial to getting patients the care they need.\n  If this bill works the way Senator McCain and Senator Kennedy and I \nbelieve it should, the ultimate goal will be achieved if there were \nnever a lawsuit filed because what would have happened is the appeals \nprocess would have worked and the patients would have received the care \nthey needed. That is what this is about.\n  We want patients to use this appeals process. The Senator from \nTennessee and I are finalizing an agreement on exhaustion of \nadministrative remedies.\n  I also want to thank our colleagues on this specific amendment \nbecause that is another crucial obstacle. Scope, independence of the \npanel, protecting employers, medical necessity, and exhaustion of \nappeals are crucial issues in this legislation about which we have been \nable to reach consensus.\n  As I said earlier, the important result is not what is happening \nwithin this Chamber but that the families of this country will have \nmore control over their health care, and we will actually have a more \nrealistic possibility of getting the legislation they so desperately \nneed passed.\n  I thank all of my colleagues for all of their hard work. Without \nthem, this could not have been achieved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me begin by saying that this amendment \nis moving in the right direction. I believe, with some of the changes \nwhich we have discussed with the Senator from Ohio and the Senator from \nMaine, that we can make real progress on improving it. Unfortunately, \nthe amendment came late. It is complicated. The issues involved are \nconsiderable. But before getting into the specifics of the amendment \nand how it may or may not play out in a positive way relative to \nproducing a quality bill, let me make the point that this amendment \naddresses an important but not a broad part of the issue.\n  This amendment doesn't, for example, address some very real and \nsignificant issues in the area of liability. It doesn't address the \nissues of the 56 million people who are in self-insured plans.\n  It does not, therefore, solve the overall liability question, which \nif you were to rate the five issues that I think the Senator from North \nCarolina has appropriately highlighted, although I am not sure he \nmentioned liability--he probably wasn't thinking in those terms, but he \ncertainly hit the floor if you put liability on the table--liability is \nprobably the key issue for a lot of people in this Chamber.\n  Issues such as forum shopping, class action, damages, punitive versus \ncompensatory damages, are major issues that we still have to address. I \nthink we recognize that there is still a fair amount of distance to go \nin the liability area.\n  But this amendment takes up the designated decisionmaker language. It \ntakes a portion of the Frist-Jeffords-Breaux bill in this area and \ntries to basically graft that on to what is the McCain-Kennedy bill--a \ngood and appropriate attempt, although I must admit that with just a \nquick reading of it I think there is going to be some real confusion on \nthe part of employers between what they can do as a designated \ndecisionmaker versus direct participation. I had hoped that the \nlanguage would have a firewall in there. But as a practical matter, at \nleast the movement is in the right direction to give some insulation \nfor designated decisionmakers and people who use designated \ndecisionmakers.\n  As to the issue of union liability, there has been a lot of talk \naround here about making businesses liable. And they are liable. Small \nbusinesses and large businesses are all liable--and making HMOs liable.\n\n  If you are a union employee and have a union plan, and your union \ntells you you can't get some sort of treatment that you need and should \nget, unfortunately, the way the bill was originally drafted, you would \nnot have been able to sue that union plan, any more than if you had \nbeen employed by a company, and the company had sponsored your plan, \nand you would be able to sue them or, under this bill, the HMO. But \nironically the unions ended up, under the original draft, of being \ncompletely taken out of the picture.\n  The Senator from Ohio and the Senator from Maine made clear that was \nnot their intent. I understand they are going to adjust some language \nso union plans, which are in the same basic position as those plans \nwhich are self-funded and self-administered, will be the ones which are \ntaken out of the liability picture. That is reasonable. That is the way \nit should be. We look forward to that modification.\n  Another issue that this bill raised, which has not been really talked \nabout at all, is the fact that it basically has Federal usurpation of \nwhat has been a very traditional State responsibility of determining \nthe viability of the insurance agency, whether the insurance agency has \nadequate financial strength to cover the projected losses which may \noccur. This has been something on which States have spent a huge amount \nof time. It is a real specialty. It is an art form to look at these \ninsurance companies and determine whether\n\n[[Page S7039]]\n\nor not they have the depth and the ability to cover the costs if they \nget hit with a whole series of claims.\n  I would hate to see the Federal Government step into this arena where \nthe States have been responsible and suddenly take it over. But under \nthis amendment, as originally drafted, that would be the case; the \nFederal Government would now basically take all that responsibility \naway from the States.\n  We discussed this with the Senator from Maine and the Senator from \nOhio and their staffs to try to straighten this out. They recognize the \nissue.\n  I think the Frist model in this area is the right model. It \nessentially says: Where the States have responsibility, where they are \nthe insurer, then they will have the ability--and retain the ability--\nto evaluate the insurer. But where it is a new Federal cause of action, \na new Federal event, then the Federal Government will come in and do \nthe evaluation. That seems to be a reasonable bifurcation of \nresponsibility and will be an improvement if it is accepted.\n  I understand language is being developed which hopefully will be \naccepted. That is all very positive, in my opinion.\n  As I mentioned, this amendment, if we can get these issues worked \nout--and there are one or two other small ones--becomes a much more \npositive event for moving the bill in the right direction. The question \nbecomes: What do we have left to do in that we have taken up a lot of \namendments? Unfortunately, we still have a lot of amendments to go. \nMost of them are in the liability area. Some of them are in tangential \nareas. But I do expect we will have amendments, as we move into the \nevening, which will address such issues as the small employer who \ndecides to cash out their employees and what type of protection they \nget. Senator Enzi happens to have that amendment.\n  There will be amendments dealing with class action suits. I think \nSenator DeWine actually has an amendment in that area. There will be \namendments dealing with coverage and liability. I have an amendment on \npunitive damages which essentially says if an employer lives by the \nterms of the external review, they should not be subject to punitive \ndamages. There are a variety in that area. There will be amendments on \nforum shopping. I think Senator Specter has an amendment in that area \nthat he may bring forward.\n\n  So there are still a fair number of issues, especially involving the \nliability questions, which have to be resolved, after we get past the \nlanguage which the Senator from Maine and the Senator from Ohio have \nbrought forward, which, as I mentioned, I think with some adjustment--\nwhich is major to the amendment, but which would be positive; and it \nappears to be acceptable to the sponsors--hopefully, will move the \nprocess in a better direction.\n  At this time I will yield to the Senator from Wyoming such time as he \nmay need from my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator from Wyoming will yield for a brief inquiry \nof the Republican manager, it is my understanding that because of some \npeople being at the White House and a conference that is going to be \nheld by the minority at 3 o'clock, the minority does not wish to vote \nuntil 3:45 or 4 o'clock.\n  Mr. GREGG. I believe there is still approximately an hour and a half \nleft on the amendment. I would hope that once we reach an agreement, \nand we have the language from Senator Snowe and Senator DeWine relative \nto the issue of coverage for union plans and liability--and State \nversus Federal responsibility for reviewing the adequacy of liability, \nand there is one other issue--once we have that language, I personally \nwould think we could start yielding back time and go to a vote.\n  I think it would be hard to get to a vote before 4 o'clock because of \nother commitments. It would be my hope we could vote at around 4 \no'clock on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, this bill is really a strange one for me to \nbe working on at all. Wyoming has one HMO. It is owned by some doctors. \nSo far as I know, there are not any complaints on it. But there are \nsome basic problems here that people in Wyoming are asking about.\n  Because of Wyoming's makeup, I usually talk about small companies, \nbecause under the Federal definition of ``500 employees or less,'' we \ndo not have a single company headquartered in Wyoming that would be \nconsidered ``big business.'' But on this amendment I have to talk about \nbig business.\n  I have been hearing from the accountants of a number of these \ncompanies. They are a little bit concerned about what is going to \nhappen to their health care. They work for those companies. They can \nsee what the costs are going to be on their companies. I have to say \nthat this amendment before us now does not address the problem. I would \nlike to think that it did.\n  I would like to be able to pass this. I would like to not have to \ntalk about a big company. There are the Caterpillers and Motorolas and \nthe Pitney Bowes and the Hewlett Packards. There are about a dozen of \nthese big companies in the United States. Again, none of them is \nheadquartered in Wyoming. I am pretty sure that none of them operates \nin Wyoming. But I am still concerned about them because there are 6 \nmillion people who get their insurance that way.\n  I would suspect that almost everybody in this Chamber, with the \nexception of my friend from Wyoming, has one of these big companies in \ntheir State. Six million people are getting their insurance from these \ncompanies.\n  What we are talking about is having a designated decisionmaker. It \ndoes sound like baseball season, doesn't it?\n  Let me tell you how this insurance works. Right now they work it in-\nhouse. They are able to keep their administrative expenses down to 5 \npercent. Now they are faced with the possibility of having liability. \nThese are the companies that are providing the Cadillac insurance in \nthis Nation.\n  I am not aware of complaints of these companies on their insurance. \nThe insurance these people have is far better than the plan we have in \nthe Senate. But they are self-funded, and they are self-administered. \nWhere they make their big savings is in self-administration.\n  Now we are talking about having a designated decisionmaker. That \nmeans they are going to shift the administration to somebody else, \nwhich might still be done at 5 percent, but there is this new liability \nfactor that goes with it. The guy that is over here, who is the \ndesignated decisionmaker, is going to have to charge them for his \npotential liability in the decisions that he makes incorrectly. He will \nnot do that for 5 percent. He will need a lot more because what he is \nselling is liability insurance. So it is going to drive up the costs.\n  I have asked some of these companies what those costs would be. They \nhave said that, quite frankly, what they will have to do is get group \nplans for their employees that have less benefits, to fit in the same \ncost level that they have right now, because this little bit of a \nliability factor drives up the price astronomically. So in this \nparticular provision that is before us, we are not taking care of the \nself-insured and the self-administered.\n  I do have a proposal that I may offer after this one is finished, one \nthat will provide some mechanism for them to continue to do that, and \nfor those employees who they have, who are more concerned about their \nability to sue than they are about the current benefits that they have, \nwould have a choice. In exchange for that choice, this company would \nnot have to hire a designated liability holder because that is what a \ndesignated decisionmaker would be.\n  For most of the firms that have the Cadillacs of the industry, most \nof them will have to change to a designated decisionmaker. That \nadditional cost will be considerably more than the 5 percent they are \ncurrently paying to handle administration, that 5 percent that they do \npartly because they have employee committees that get involved in the \ndecisions. And those employee committees are not going to want to be \nsued, so they are going to need some relief. I am here in the \nuncomfortable position of speaking up for the companies that are in \nyour States, not mine, to protect the kind of health insurance they \nhave at the present time and not drive up the cost, forcing them to go \nto a lower benefit plan with a designated decisionmaker.\n  This is not the solution. I hope you will pay attention to the \nsolution when that amendment comes forward.\n\n[[Page S7040]]\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. ENZI.

Mr. President, for the edification of our colleagues, the \nprojected order of events is that Senator Gramm and Senator McCain are \ngoing to offer an amendment which I believe is agreed to and will \nrequire no vote. We will lay aside the Snowe amendment, and then \nSenator Enzi is going to offer an amendment. We will debate the Enzi \namendment for whatever time he requires. I am not sure it will be that \nlong. Then Senator Specter will offer an amendment after laying aside \nthe pending amendments. We will debate that and then probably go to a \nvote on the Specter, Snowe, and Enzi amendments later this evening--\nhopefully early evening.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like to speak to the majority \nleader, but this sounds fine. It is my understanding--I have spoken \nwith the principals; I have spoken with Senator Kennedy and Senator \nSnowe, and that matter appears to have been worked out so we can have a \nsatisfactory resolution of that tonight as soon as Senator Frist gets \nback.\n  Senator Frist had to leave the Hill for a minor matter. He has some \ndental work that has to be done tonight. We understand that certainly. \nIt is a valid reason for leaving.\n  What the Senator from New Hampshire has suggested is appropriate. We \nwill go to another McCain amendment and then the Enzi amendment and \nthen the Specter amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I think it is a Gramm amendment actually.\n  Mr. REID. There is no unanimous consent request at this time, but I \nthink what the Senator from New Hampshire has outlined is appropriate. \nI will check with the majority leader.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator from \nWyoming be recognized to offer an amendment and that we debate that for \nup to 30 minutes with the time equally divided and no second-degree; \nthat thereafter, we go to an amendment from Senator Gramm, which I \nunderstand is agreed to, and that debate will be up to 10 minutes; then \nwe go to an amendment from Senator Specter.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, we have been told the Gramm \namendment is substantially agreed to but one or two other people have \nto look at it first.

Mr. President, we have spent more than a week debating this \nversion of a Patients' Bill of Rights which would affect the health \ncare coverage of more than 160 million working families who are \ncurrently provided insurance by employers on a voluntary basis. We have \nspecifically debated the matter of protecting employers from the new \nliability in the bill. To that end, Senators Gramm and Hutchison \noffered an amendment that mirrored the employer protection provision of \nTexas law by completely carving it out. That amendment was \nunfortunately defeated. So we are still in the same predicament. We \nhave employers that are providing health care coverage that may think \ntwice about doing so if this bill passes as it currently reads.\n  Now everyone, including the sponsors of the bill, acknowledges that \nthis bill's stab at an employer protection from frivolous lawsuits \nneeds to be fixed. The Senators are now talking about how we protect \nthe good actors. Those are employers that are doing right by their \nemployees, offering health coverage but not playing a role in denying \nmedical care to which their employees are entitled under the insurance \ncontract.\n  My hope is that in the course of these discussions everyone will \nsettle on a comprehensive liability fix that includes the designated \ndecisionmaker model presented in the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill. As \nmany of my colleagues have said, that certainly seems to do the job. I \nagree it certainly seems to. In fact, I agree that the designated \ndecisionmaker mechanism must be part of an amendment to successfully \nresolve the problems in the underlying bill.\n  However, while the designated decisionmaker model does present itself \nas the most reliable proposal for protecting most employers, there \nremains a small segment of the market that will continue to go \nunprotected. Ironically, this handful of employer health plans may \nrepresent the best of the best. These are the plans that we all should \nenvy. They are plans better than we have in the Senate. They are \nreferred to as the self-insured, self-administered employer plans. They \ncomprise roughly 5 percent of the entire ERISA market.\n  Five percent is not a small number because that is still 6 million \npeople, but the problem under the Kennedy-McCain direct participation \nmodel and even a designated decisionmaker model as we have been \ndebating in the last few minutes is that these employers will have to \ndramatically alter their health plan because they do the plan \nadministration in-house. That means they are participating in \neverything, and it means they cannot just designate their third party \nadministration or insurance company because they don't currently \ncontract with such entities for the purpose of processing claims. That \nis the difference between the self-administered and the fully insured \nemployer plan.\n  We can reasonably expect the fully insured employer plan to be able \nto designate the final decision on a claim for benefit because that is \ngenerally how they function now, having the insurance company \nadminister the plan, with the employer participation ranging from full \nplan design to advocating for a sick employee. But that is not the way \nthe self-administered plan operates. So none of the proposals protects \nthem.\n  My fear is that none of the proposals even preserves that kind of a \nplan. Let me explain why that is a problem. These companies that self-\nadminister are few and far between, probably a dozen in the entire \nUnited States. But they are the big companies, the companies that \noperate probably in everybody's State but mine. Usually I am the \nadvocate for small businesses because all of my businesses are small. \nThere is not a single company headquartered in Wyoming that would be \nconsidered big business by the Small Business Administration. This \nissue has come to my attention from companies that participate all over \nthe United States, and they have brought me the stories of how it will \naffect their plan, what the costs will be. It does require a fair bit \nof capital to administer a health plan and also requires that the \nemployer wants to be actively involved in the caliber and range of \nbenefits their employees receive. They receive more benefits than \nalmost anyone else. And they want to design a wide, often unique range \nof benefits to suit the specific needs of their employees. Because the \nemployers have the in-house resources to do so, they are actually able \nto be more cost-effective in what they provide than if they provided a \nfully insured health plan. They would rather have the health benefits \nthan the administration benefit. It is not that they can just provide \nthe same benefits cheaper and more efficiently; they actually provide a \nricher benefit package for less.\n  The benefits some of these employers provide include extensive mental \nhealth counseling, on-site wellness clinics, routine screenings, they \ninclude cancer, osteoporosis, and domestic violence counseling, and the \nlist goes on. These employers often use employee review boards to \nevaluate disputed claims for benefits, which is also a practice used by \na number of employee union operated health plans. These are clearly \nbenefits and administrative practices designed to help employees get \nthe highest quality health care available. In fact, these employer \nplans are often referred to as the Cadillac of plans. As I said before, \nisn't it ironic that these are the health plans hardest hit by this \nbill? That doesn't make any sense to me. And it clearly doesn't make \nany sense to me to leave these employers unprotected as we identify a \nway to protect employers.\n\n  For that reason, the amendment I offer today is a solution that I \nthink is reasonable and will force us to ask ourselves a few tough \nquestions about the purpose of a Patients' Bill of Rights. The \namendment would require a self-insured, self-administered employer to \noffer their employees one or both of the following options, in addition \nto the self-administered, self-funded plan, and thereby gain a \n``shield'' around that self-administered plan from the new cause of \naction. The logic of this amendment is to provide employees with the \noption of choosing a different health plan, which would also afford \nthem access to a cause of action. The employee chooses if he or she \nwants that to be a component of their health benefit.\n  Under the amendment, self-administered, self-insured employers would \nbe required to offer at least one of the following options. The first \nwould be a fully insured product, under which an employee could \nexercise the cause of action in this bill against the insurance company \nadministering the health plan; or, the employer would provide the \noption of receiving, in the form of an ``individual health benefit,'' \nthe amount of their employer's annual premium contribution under the \nself-\n\n[[Page S7042]]\n\nadministered employer plan. This would have to be used to buy health \ncare, which is done in the State regulated individual market. They have \nthe right to sue.\n  If an employer offers one or both of these choices to employees, then \nthe employer would not be subject to the new cause of action under the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. Any new civil monetary penalties would apply \nto these employers for violations of the act, and the external appeals \ndetermination would be binding on the employer, but enrollees would not \nbe able to pursue damage awards against the employer under the new \ncause of action. As under the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill, this \nprovision would not preempt any medical malpractice action currently \navailable in state court.\n  It would not do that. This is very clear. An employee makes the \nchoice to either keep the caliber of benefits under the self-\nadministered plan, or to choose a plan specifically for the right to \nsue. Those employees that choose the fully insured product will be able \nto hold their plan accountable under the new cause of action. And, \nthose employees that choose to purchase their own plan through the \n``individual health benefit'' are similarly able to hold their plan \naccountable under state law.\n  The argument has always been that ERISA is unfair because it \n``traps'' employees in the employer sponsored plan, affording that \noption alone, where damage lawsuits aren't available. This proposal \nsolves that dilemma without jeopardizing access to top-notch employer \nsponsored health care for those employees. Have any of you been hearing \nfrom the major companies that provide the self-insured, self-\nadministered employer plan? No, you have not. They have not been asking \nfor that right to sue. They like the range of benefits they have. They \nlike the personal way it is handled.\n  The arguments you will hear against the amendment, I believe, \nactually make the case for it. It is very simple. It will be argued \nthat employees will never be able to get the rich benefit packages that \ntheir employer's self-administered plan currently provides if they opt \ninto the individual market by taking the ``individual benefit,'' and, \nwhile it may be better than the individual market under the fully \ninsured option, surely it won't compare to the self-administered \noption.\n  That is absolutely right. If they spend the same amount of money and \nadd a liability part to it, you do not get as much insurance. I am \ntrying to preserve their insurance, not the right to sue, by giving \nthem the flexibility. Any employer that ever had a bad actor incident \nin their company would have all of their people go out into the \nindividual market under this plan.\n  This bill would eliminate the best employer plans out there because \nwe feel compelled to sue them instead of making the decision to \neliminate self-administered plans by a lawsuit from Washington. Why \ndon't we let the employees make the choice for themselves? Every time a \nwindow of choice comes open they can opt into this other plan if they \nthink it is a good way to go.\n  But I will tell you why the businesses cannot do what is being \nmandated under this bill. If they have to have a designated \ndecisionmaker, they are hiring somebody to take the liability risk. \nThey are not just hiring somebody to administer the plan. That is only \na 5-percent cost. This will drive their prices up dramatically if we do \nnot give this option, and people who are receiving the best care in the \nUnited States at the present time will have to settle for something \nelse.\n  I believe we have made a concerted effort through the amendment. It \nis one we talked about a lot last year in the Patients' Bill of Rights \nconference committees. We made an attempt to amend the process, to \nremedy the problems of the entire liability section under the \nunderlying bill, including protecting employers and including \nprotecting small employers.\n  It is not worry about the small ones; this is worry about the big \nones who are providing the best of the best. I do not believe we will \nbe doing a good job unless we include this amendment.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If no one yields time, time will be charged \nagainst both sides.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I understand what my friend from Wyoming \nis trying to do. We appreciate his work on this issue. This is a \nsubject matter that was covered previously by the Snowe-Nelson-DeWine-\nLincoln amendment on which we reached consensus on the floor a few \nhours ago. That amendment was specifically designed to strike the \nproper balance between protecting employers on the one hand and making \nsure we also protected the rights of employees. So this is an issue \nthat has already been covered, about which there has already been great \ndiscussion, work, and compromise across party lines, Democrats and \nRepublicans, and about which we are soon to have a vote. It is an issue \nabout which we already have consensus. We have widespread support for \nthat consensus.\n  The reason for that widespread support is we have protected employers \nwhile at the same time kept alive the rights of employees and patients. \nWe have struck in a very creative way a solution to that problem.\n  This specific amendment has at least two major problems. No. 1, what \nit does is take away the rights of employees, patients, and families, \nto hold anybody accountable if one of two things occurs. The problem \nwith that concept is that it is in violation of the President's \nprinciple, which we have talked about at great length on the floor of \nthe Senate, which is that employers be protected but that somebody be \nheld accountable if the employee, the patient, is injured as a result \nof a medically reviewable decision. The President specifically said \nthat in his principle. That principle is completely complied with in \nthe Snowe-DeWine-Nelson amendment because in that amendment we create a \nsituation where we protect the employees right to recover if, in fact, \nthey are injured by a medically reviewable decision, while at the same \ntime providing protection for employers. So that is the reason that \nconsensus was reached. That is the reason both Democrats and \nRepublicans support it across party lines, and that consensus is \nconsistent with the President's principle.\n  This is an issue about which we have already talked and an issue \nabout which we have reached some agreement.\n  In addition to that, there are at least two other problems with this \nspecific amendment.\n  No. 1, it provides the employees with a false option. It says for \nself-insured, self-administered plans, if either of two things occurs, \nthe employee, the family, and the patient lose their right to hold \nanybody accountable. One of those options is that they go out, get a \nvoucher, and buy their own health insurance. But there is absolutely no \nrequirement that the voucher be adequate to buy quality health \ninsurance plans.\n  Second, they may provide a comparable plan. But there is nothing to \nrequire that the benefits of that plan be equal to the benefits the \nemployee would otherwise have.\n  The bottom line is there are no protections that require that under \nthese options the employee or the patient end up with the same quality \nhealth care plan. In many regards, it is a false option that is being \nprovided to them.\n  Another fundamental problem is that there is a provision in the \namendment--this is the B-1 exclusion from income--which says section \n106 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding at the \nend the following. Of course, an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code \ncreates a blue slip problem. This issue has to originate in the House, \nwhich means, if adopted, that this entire legislation could be sent \nback to the Senate from the House.\n  We have a number of problems. I understand what my colleague is \ntrying to do. I think his purpose is very well intentioned. But I say \nto my colleagues, No. 1, this is an issue about which we have already \nreached consensus in the Snowe-DeWine-Nelson amendment. We have reached \nthat consensus for an important reason. We have complied with the \nPresident's principle. We have complied with the fundamental principle, \nwith which many of us on both sides of the aisle\n\n[[Page S7043]]\n\nagree, which is we need to protect employers and provide the maximum \nprotection for employers but, in that process, not leave the patients \nbehind. That is the reason we have an amendment to be able to reach \nconsensus.\n  No. 2, the choices that are being provided in this particular \namendment we believe are false choices, and they would not require that \nthe employee or the patient receive the same quality plan they would \nget with the employer.\n  No. 3, it creates a blue slip problem, which means the entire Patient \nProtection Act could be sent back to the Senate since it involves an \namendment to the IRS Code.\n  There are a number of fundamental problems. I appreciate my \ncolleague's work on this issue. I think this does not move us in the \nright direction. We have an amendment that already addresses this \nissue. It is an amendment that provides protection for employers while \nat the same time keeping alive the rights of patients and employees.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I want to quickly refresh the memory of the \nSenator from North Carolina.\n  I would not have entered into the time agreement had I known he \nwasn't listening when I debated the Snowe-DeWine arrangement where I \nclearly pointed out that it is not considered thereunder. I think this \nis a sticking point that the President would see as being very \ndifficult.\n  We are talking about companies such as Hewlett-Packard, Firestone, \nMotorola, Caterpillar, Pitney Bowes--big companies that are providing \nthis. I have checked on the costs. Their costs will go up from $40 \nmillion to $70 million if the Snowe-DeWine amendment is the only \ndefense they have.\n  I yield the remaining time to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, first of all, this problem has not been \nfixed. The amendment we will adopt is window dressing and has no impact \non this problem. What the Senator has proposed is a solution to an \nassault on the best health care plans in America. The biggest companies \nwith self-insured plans that employees love will be destroyed by this \nbill.\n  All the Senator is saying is that if Wal-Mart employees love their \nplan, and they want to keep it and agree to not require Wal-Mart to be \nliable to be sued, and if Wal-Mart gives them the option of going into \na fully-insured plan with liability so that they do not have to be in \nthe Wal-Mart self-insured plan, they can choose to remain in it, and \nWal-Mart will not be forced by liability costs to cancel their plan. \nThis is an important issue that addresses a very real shortcoming in \nthis bill. The incredible paradox is that this bill will do the most \ndamage to the best health care plans in America--plans that are self-\ninsured, that are large, and that provide terrific coverage. Under this \nbill, there is no question about the fact that the employer will be \nheld liable. That liability fear will end up forcing them out of these \nplans.\n  The Senator has offered us a third way. The third way is if every \nemployee is offered an alternative where there is liability available, \nthen those who choose to stay in their health plan and say, I love my \nWal-Mart plan and I don't want to sue Wal-Mart, would have a right to \ndo it. That is what the Senator's amendment does. All of the rest of \nthese arguments have nothing to do with the amendment.\n  Do you want to destroy the best health care systems in America? If \nyou do, you want to vote against the Enzi amendment. If you do not, \nvote for the Enzi amendment which guarantees that a Wal-Mart employee \nwill have an option of another health care plan where everybody is \nliable. But if they choose a better plan with fewer lawsuits, aren't \nthey better off by definition by choosing?\n  The Senator from North Carolina says if you do not get lawsuits, you \nought not to be happy. Maybe not everybody agrees with the Senator from \nNorth Carolina.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No time is remaining on Senator Enzi's side, \nthe sponsor of the amendment, and 8 minutes 44 seconds remain in \nopposition to the amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I understand the Senator from Texas has an amendment, \nwhich has been agreed to by both sides, and she needs about 3 minutes \nto present it. Is there any objection to setting aside the Enzi \namendment and allowing the Senator from Texas to go forward?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized for 3 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 839\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], for herself and \n     Mrs. Clinton, proposes an amendment numbered 839.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To include information relating to disenrollment in the \n                   information provided to patients)\n\n       On page 101, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n       (3) Disenrollment.--Information relating to the \n     disenrollment of a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this amendment is a very simple one. \nThere are several things that must be reported to an enrollee in a plan \nbefore the company can implement those things. They are major changes \nto that person's plan because you don't want a person to go into the \ndoctor's office or into the pharmacy and be told they have been dropped \nfrom their insurance or that their spouse has been dropped from their \ninsurance or their child.\n  We are requiring under the basic bill 30-day notice of any material \nchange. My amendment just specifies disenrollment as one of those items \nthat must be given 30 days' notice.\n\n  I have had an experience in which a person's husband was dropped from \na plan, was not told about it, and found out when the person went to \npick up a prescription drug for the husband, and had no way to fight it \nin the pharmacy. Later in the week, when the person called to find out \nwhy the husband was dropped from her plan, they found it was a mistake. \nOf course it was a mistake.\n  So that is why you want the 30 days' notice, so that a person would \nnot have to find out that they are not getting coverage they thought \nthey had through a clerical error.\n  That is all this amendment does. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 839) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 840\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, let me respond briefly to a couple of the \ncomments that were made about the Enzi amendment.\n  First of all, no argument was made that I heard about the blue-slip \nproblem, so I presume there is agreement that if this amendment is \nincluded, it would require the entire Patient Protection Act to be sent \nback.\n  Second, I say to my friend from Wyoming, I actually did listen to his \ncomments in the debate. And not only that, I sat in hours of meetings \nwith Senators Snowe and DeWine, and others, working out the language of \nthe Snowe-DeWine-Nelson amendment.\n  The Senator is factually incorrect about one thing; that is, that \nwhat Snowe-DeWine-Nelson does is, No. 1, provide complete, 100-percent \nprotection for 94 percent of the employers in the country. Almost every \nsmall employer is totally protected. But we left rights in place for \npatients. The employers are completely protected.\n  For the self-insured, self-administered employers, we have also \nprovided\n\n[[Page S7044]]\n\nspecific protections in this amendment, which we have been working on \nfor several days now. No. 1, they are completely carved out. Self-\ninsured, self-administered plans are totally carved out of the Federal \ncause of action in the Bipartisan Patient Protection Act. They cannot \nbe held responsible for contractual, administrative responsibilities, \nperiod. They are out.\n  Second, we have provided that if they choose to do so, they can pick \na third party designated decisionmaker and send all liability to that \ndecisionmaker by which they are completely protected.\n  And finally, we have provided that if they have what many of these \nlarge employers have, which is a system where they simply make a \ndecision, yes or no, on paying the claim after the treatment has \nalready been provided--that the patient goes and gets the treatment; \nthen they decide whether they are going to pay for it or not--they \ncannot be held responsible.\n  So I say to my friend and colleagues, what we have done is provide \ncomplete protection for 94 percent of the employers in this country in \nthe Snowe amendment, while at the same time not removing the rights and \nprotections of patients.\n  For the self-insured, self-administered employers, we provided three \nprotections: No. 1, they are completely out on the Federal cause of \naction, which is contracts, administrative issues.\n  No. 2, we have specifically said they can use a designated third \nparty decisionmaker and remove all liability by doing that if they so \nchoose.\n  No. 3, we have said if they operate the plan by saying: we decide \nafter the treatment just simply whether we are going to pay for it or \nwe are not going to pay for it, they are completely protected.\n  So after lots of work, and many hours, I say to my colleagues, we \nbelieve we struck the right balance in both cases--for providing \nmaximum protection for the employers and keeping in place the rights of \npatients, employees, and families.\n  So in addition to the blue-slip problem, which in and of itself would \nbe enormous, we believe that we have dealt with this issue. We have \ndealt with it in a proper and adequate fashion. And we have addressed \nthe concerns of the self-insured, self-administered plans, and the \nissues raised by small employers around the country who will be \ncompletely protected by this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on this amendment?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that the managers of the bill, \nincluding Senator Frist, would ask that this vote be put over until a \nlater time. So I ask unanimous consent that be the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Chair advises the Senator from North Carolina he has 4 minutes \nremaining in opposition to this amendment.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, under the previous unanimous consent \nagreement, I believe I had 10 minutes to offer an amendment with \nSenator McCain, but he is not here. I am waiting for him to come back. \nSo I would just like to suggest that perhaps we could modify the \nunanimous consent agreement so that when he does come back, whoever is \nspeaking at that point, whenever they are finished, we would be \nrecognized to do the amendment. But there is no reason we cannot \nconduct other business while we are sitting here.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Why not talk now?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am offering this with Senator McCain. I think he wants \nto be here as well. It is my understanding he is on his way.\n  Let me just suggest we let Senator Nickles speak, if he would like to \nspeak. We could all learn something from listening to him. And then, \nwhen he is finished, hopefully Senator McCain will be back, and we will \ndo this long-awaited amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I just appreciate my friend and colleague \nfrom Texas. I will be very brief. I understand the Senator from \nPennsylvania wants to come and speak on his amendment. I would just \nlike to make a couple general comments.\n  Just for the information of our colleagues, I believe at--6:30 we \nwill have three votes. So people should be cognizant of the fact we are \ngoing to have two or three votes--three votes, I believe--at around \n6:30.\n  One, I wish to compliment the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi, for his \nenrollee choice proposal. I think it is an outstanding proposal. I urge \nmy colleagues to be in favor of it.\n  I would also like to make a couple comments dealing with the \ndesignated decision maker. Some people are acting like this is a grand \ncompromise, that this is going to save employers: Employers are going \nto be exempt now because we are going to give this decision to a third \nparty.\n  When I ran a company, Nickles Machine Corporation, we had a third \nparty administrator. They handled all the administrative claims. They \ndid a decent job. So I didn't have to do it, our company didn't have to \ndo it. We hired them to pay the benefits, to harass the providers, to \nmake sure that benefits were paid or weren't paid. They paid the right \nbenefits, didn't pay the right benefits. They were hired guns to run \nthe plan, to make the decisions, to negotiate with the hospitals, \nnegotiate with the doctors--all those kinds of things. That is what \nthird party administrators do.\n  Now we are talking about saying: They have that responsibility, and \nnow they have liability, too. That's what this amendment does. Some \npeople said: It is going to hold employers harmless. It will not. I \nwill tell you, the net result is third party administrators are going \nto say: What am I liable for? Under the McCain-Kennedy-Edwards \nproposal, they are liable for anything and everything. They are liable \nfor unlimited economic damages. They are liable for unlimited \nnoneconomic damages, pain and suffering. They are liable for punitive \ndamages--up to a cap of $5 million--in Federal courts. They are liable \nfor unlimited economic and noneconomic damages in State courts.\n  It has never been said that State court limitations for doctors and \nso on would apply to the plans and/or to the States. So now we are \nsaying to a third-party administrator, we want you to assume the \nliability but the extent of the liability is not defined. It is \nunlimited. One good lawsuit and they are going to have to write a great \nbig check. What are they going to do? They are going to have to charge \na lot of money. They are going to have to charge as much money as they \nthink this will cost, and they are going to guess because they don't \nknow.\n  It is kind of like playing Russian roulette. They might be lucky and \nnot have any suits so whatever they charge will be profit. Conversely, \nif there is one bad suit and they are found liable, they are assuming \nthis liability and they could go bankrupt. So they are going to be \ntrying to err on the high side.\n  The net result, for everybody who thinks this is going to exonerate \nemployers and all they have to do is designate somebody else to accept \ntheir liability, I tell my colleagues, as an employer, that is not \ngoing to happen. An employer may say: You handle this, third party; you \nassume our liability. And that third party is going to say: OK, but I \nam going to charge you for it, and I am going to charge you more than \nenough to make sure that we don't go bankrupt in the process.\n  Maybe they can buy insurance themselves or maybe they can't. My guess \nis we are going to find out. Some people have said: CBO says that the \nliability provision under this bill is .8 percent. I would be willing \nto bet anybody the premiums that are going to come out as a result of \nthis liability in third party administrators assuming liability is \ngoing to be a lot more than .8 percent. My guess is you are going to be \nlooking at premium increases of 4 and 5 percent just to cover the \nliability\n\n[[Page S7045]]\n\nbefore someone will take this because the liability is not defined. It \nis unlimited, unlimited noneconomic, unlimited economic.\n  The contract coverage, well, you may have to cover just about \nanything. We never did tighten up medical necessity so if somebody says \nmaybe it should be covered, it should be covered. So you are not even \nconfined to the contract. We don't have contracts. This third party \nadministrator, which is usually charged with enforcing a contract, does \nnot have a defined contract and has unlimited liability. And we tell \nthem they have to pay for everything. They are going to end up charging \nthe employer more than they think it would cost so they don't go \nbankrupt.\n  So we are going to find out how much this costs. My point is, I want \npeople to be aware of the fact that just having a designated decision \nmaker with no limitations on liability, with no limitations on covering \nwhat is in the contract can be enormously expensive.\n  One other fact that people haven't considered. If you are a \ndesignated decision maker and you are making these decisions on what to \ncover and not to cover and you are liable if things don't work out, you \nare hardly ever going to say no. You will hardly ever say no because if \nyou say no, you might be sued. Therefore, you are going to have more \ndefensive medicine than you have ever had. Whereas before they were \ncharged with the responsibility of enforcing a defined contract--this \nis covered; this is not covered; being more of an administrator of a \ncontract and a plan--they are now going to be faced with liability. And \nthey can't afford the ultimate price of being hit with a heavy lawsuit. \nSo when the claim comes forward, if it is even close, they are going to \npay it. Pay it. Pay it. They don't want to take a risk or a gamble that \nthey can be sued for unlimited damages. So you will have enormous \nincreases through increase of what I would call defensive protections \nso people don't have liability costs.\n\n  And then you will have people guessing what the liability will be, \nand that will increase the cost to make sure that they have enough that \nthey don't go bankrupt.\n  The net result is that this designated decision maker that some \npeople think is going to exonerate employers will show that this is a \nvery expensive provision, and the cost of this bill, the cost of \nmedicine, the cost of health care and, therefore, ultimately the number \nof uninsured will rise dramatically as a result of this bill and \nbecause of this provision.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the underlying amendment that \ndeals with this provision.\n  I want to mention--I hope it gets fixed--I think it is outrageous we \ncould exempt union plans from this provision. I hope it is fixed.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 843\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a previous order, the Senator from Texas \nis recognized, with the agreement that his 10 minutes will be equally \ndivided, 5 minutes on either side.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm], for himself and Mr. \n     McCain, proposes an amendment numbered 843.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To ensure the sanctity of the health plan contract)\n\n       Insert at the appropriate place:\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, any \n     exclusion of an exact medical procedure, any exact time limit \n     on the duration or frequency of coverage, and any exact \n     dollar limit on the amount of coverage that is specifically \n     enumerated and defined (in the plain language of the plan or \n     coverage claimants) under the plan or coverage offered by a \n     group health plan or health insurance issuer offering health \n     insurance coverage and that is disclosed under section \n     121(b)(1) shall be considered to govern the scope of the \n     benefits that may be required, provided that the terms and \n     conditions of the plan or coverage relating to such an \n     exclusion or limit are in compliance with the requirements of \n     law.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator from Texas will withhold, and no time will \nbe charged against him, I want to propound a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Specter be \nrecognized to offer an amendment regarding Federal courts with an hour \nfor debate equally divided in the usual form; further, that Senator \nSnowe be permitted to modify her amendment; further, that the Senate \nvote in relation to the Snowe amendment at 6:50 p.m. this evening, with \n10 minutes for debate prior to the vote equally divided in the usual \nform with no second-degree amendments in order prior to the vote; \nfurther, that following disposition of the Snowe amendment, there be 2 \nminutes for debate prior to a vote in relation to the Enzi amendment \nwith no second-degree amendments in order prior to the vote; further, \nfollowing disposition of the Enzi amendment, there be 2 minutes for \ndebate prior to a vote in relation to the Specter amendment with no \nsecond-degree amendments in order prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, as I understand it, as to \nthe 10 minutes, because the amendment was itself divided into four \nparts, four holders of time will be given 2\\1/2\\ minute segments.\n  Mr. REID. When I read that, I knew we should have a clarification. I \nappreciate the Senator clarifying that.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I entered \nthe Chamber and I heard my name mentioned. I would ask that the \nunanimous consent be repeated.\n  Mr. REID. That the Senator from Pennsylvania would have one hour \nevenly divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I do object to that. I was asked how long \nI thought it would take, and I said 2 hours. Then I was asked if I \nthought I could do it in an hour, and I said I would do my best. This \nis a complicated amendment. This is a complicated bill. I am not \nprepared to enter into a unanimous consent request which limits my \npresentation to 20 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Pennsylvania agree to have having 45 \nminutes for him and 15 for us? We have Members who want to know when \nthey are going to vote.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is not satisfactory. I am being importuned over \nhere about what a good deal it is. This amendment, Mr. President, \ninvolves a question of whether there will be both Federal jurisdiction \nand State jurisdiction. It is a matter I have discussed with the \nmanagers of the bill again this morning and with Senator Edwards. I \nbelieve there is going to have to be some discussion. There are going \nto have to be some issues raised and some questions answered. It simply \ndoes not lend itself to that kind of time constraint.\n  Mr. REID. If I could say to the Senator from Pennsylvania, how about \nif he has an hour and we have 20 minutes?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am prepared to start the debate and to \nmake it as expeditious as possible. But I am not prepared to negotiate \ntime to an hour and 20 minutes total. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes on his amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I have sent an amendment to the desk. The \namendment has been read.\n  Let me explain to my colleagues what the amendment does, why it is \nimportant, and then I will thank our distinguished colleague from \nArizona.\n  Under the bill that is now before us, under the language of the \ncurrent bill on page 35, the bill says that contracts are binding. But \nthen it makes those contracts binding unless they are subject to a \njudgment of medical facts and they are subject to medical review.\n  This creates an extraordinary ambiguity and, for all practical \npurposes, makes the contract not binding. That creates a situation \nwhere every health insurance company in America will realize that these \noutside medical reviewers, based on medical necessity, could invalidate \nevery health insurance contract in America and, as a result, put \neverybody under the high option plan whether they pay for it or not. \nThe net result would be an explosion in health care costs. In fact, if \nthis provision is not fixed, it is at least as explosive in potential \ncost as the liability section, which we have talked about 10 times as \nmuch.\n  The amendment I have offered makes the contract binding, and it \nprovides\n\n[[Page S7046]]\n\nlanguage that says the contract is binding as long as the contract does \nnot violate the language of the bill. Let me explain very briefly what \nthat means. If, as we do under the bill, we say that if you provide \nemergency room coverage, you have to have a prudent layperson standard \nfor that emergency room coverage, so you have to do that if you provide \nthe coverage no matter what this amendment says; or if we say under the \nbill that if the plan has pediatric care for children, that can be the \nprimary physician, then it would have to be the law that would govern.\n  Within that very limited proviso, this amendment makes the contract \nbinding. I think it is a dramatic improvement in the bill.\n  I thank our distinguished colleague and my old and dear friend from \nArizona for helping me work this provision out. It is something I have \nworried about. I do think it improves the bill, and it certainly would \nnot have happened without the reasonableness of our dear colleague from \nArizona. I thank him for that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for causing \nthis amendment to happen. It really is to ensure the sanctity of the \nhealth care contract. Concerns were raised that under the pending \nMcCain-Kennedy legislation, independent medical reviewers can order a \nhealth plan to provide items and services that are specifically \nexcluded by the plan.\n  That was not the intention of the law. The Senator from Texas pointed \nout that it could have been interpreted in another way, and clearly \nthis amendment I think tightens that language to the point where it is \nclarified that the bill doesn't do this and its specific limitations \nand exclusions on coverage must be honored by the external reviewers.\n  There are numerous safeguards already in the bill to ensure that \nexternal reviewers cannot order a group health plan or health insurer \nto cover items or services that are specifically excluded or expressly \nlimited in the plain language of the plan document and that do not \nrequire medical judgment to understand.\n  So I think this language is important in its clarification. I \nunderstand Senator Gramm's concerns. I know this will not bring him to \nthe point where he is willing to vote for the bill, but I do hope it \nsatisfies many of his concerns, and we will continue to work with him \nto try to satisfy additional concerns. I appreciate his cooperation and \nthat of his staff. I believe my friend from Texas would agree this is \nprobably the 35th draft we have of this maybe 9-line amendment, but \neach word is important nowadays as we work our way through this bill. I \nbelieve the appropriate place is on page 36, line 5.\n  By the way, I thank Senator Kennedy and Senator Edwards and their \nstaffs for agreeing to this amendment. I share the opinion of the \nSenator from Texas that it is an important amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge that we accept this amendment. As \nin other areas, there has been a desire to provide clarification to the \nlanguage we had in the bill. One of the issues that has been debated is \nthe power and authority of the review medical officer in the review \nprocess. It was never the intention to include benefits that were not \noutlined in the contract. It was going to be limited to the contract, \nbut it was also going to give discretion in terms of medical necessity. \nSo this is a clarification of that, and I think it is a useful and \nvaluable clarification. I hope the Senate will accept it.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I seek only to do good, not to have it \nrecorded through a recorded vote. So I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 843) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The amendment that I offered today with Senator Gramm \nhelps to clarify the intent of how this bill deals with medically \nreviewable decisions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senate should understand that the language in the \nMcCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill is based on language from a bipartisan \ncompromise between John Dingell and Charlie Norwood. Every member of \nour conference signed off on our approach the last Congress, from Don \nNickles and Phil Gramm to John Dingell and me.\n  Our approach is based on a very important concept. It assures that \nthe external reviewer cannot be bound by the HMO's definition of \nmedical necessity. This does not mean that the reviewer sign off on \nanything that is explicitly excluded by the health plan. If the plan \ncovers 30 days in the hospital the reviewer cannot approve 100 days. \nHowever, where a coverage decision requires medical judgment to \ndetermine whether of not what the patient is requesting is the type of \ntreatment or services that is explicitly excluded, we intend for that \ndetermination to be eligible for independent review.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The amendment we are drafting here--that merely restates \nwhat is in the underlying bill--is not intended to change our \nfundamental approach, just to clarify our intent.\n  Our overall bill still clearly states that coverage decisions that \nare subject to interpretation or that are based on applying, medical \nfacts and judgment should be reviewed. This includes those decisions \nthat require the application of plan definitions that require that \ninterpretation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Absolutely--the reviewer should be looking at those \ncases. The amendment is intended to clarify that we never meant to have \nthe independent reviewer approving a benefit that is explicitly \nexcluded in all cases. However, in the case where there is some dispute \nabout whether it is a medically reviewable benefit, we do want the case \nreviewed.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Right, just as in the case we have heard about a child \nwith a cleft palate. The plan says they do not cover cosmetic surgery, \nbut the doctor argues that there is specific health risks for not \nhaving this surgery. That is something the independent reviewer would \nlook at to determine if it is covered in this case.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Under the bill the external review process is first \ndesigned to determine whether a denial by the plan or issuer is based \non a particular definition, or a specific benefit exclusion or \nlimitation under the plan or contract whose meaning is unambiguous and \ndoes not turn on specific medical facts in an individual patient's \ncase. An appeal will be dismissed in cases where the entity concludes \nthat unambiguous plan language is the basis of a denial and that no set \nof medical facts either could or would result in coverage under the \nterms of the plan.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are going to have a vote sometime from \n6:45 to 7:15, according to how much time is taken on the Specter \namendment. We will have three votes at that time. Members should be \nready to come and vote at or about 6:40 or 7:15, something like that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nPennsylvania is recognized to offer an amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 844\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 844.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require that causes of action under this Act be maintained \n                           in Federal Court)\n\n       On page 153, strike line 9 and all that follows through \n     page 154, line 2, and insert the following:\n       ``(10) Statutory damages.--The remedies set forth in this \n     subsection (n) shall be the exclusive remedies for causes of \n     action brought under this subsection.

Mr. President, I declined to enter into a time agreement \nbecause this is an amendment which deals with the complex subject of \njurisdiction. I have long been a cosponsor for a Patients' Bill of \nRights, and I was surprised to learn many years ago of the Federal \npreemption which precluded an injured patient--for example, where a \nfamily doctor recommended a specialist and the HMO refused to provide \nthe specialist to the person and the person was injured, or perhaps \ndied, and had no redress in the Federal courts because of the so-called \npreemption under ERISA.\n  It has seemed to me for many years that that was one of the problems \nthat ought to be addressed. I compliment Senator McCain, Senator \nKennedy, and Senator Edwards for the work they have done, and also \nSenator Frist, Senator Breaux, and Senator Jeffords for their companion \nbill, and what the managers have done here.\n  This amendment addresses what I believe, from my experience as a \nlitigator in the civil courts, to be a very fundamental question of \nconcern as to what courts these cases are going to be tried in. The \nvery brief history of ERISA is that cases which have been brought under \nsection 502 of ERISA are governed by what is called the doctrine of \ncomplete preemption, and that is where the cases involve contract \ninterpretation, or so-called quantity of medical care.\n  Under ERISA, section 514, a plaintiff's case has been barred where it \nrelates to an employee benefit plan, and that has been decided by the \ncase law, and has been referred to as quality of care or medical \nmalpractice. For many years, under ERISA, which was enacted in the \n1970s, that barred any action at all. But as the courts saw the \ndifficulty of this matter, there gradually came to be a loosening of \nthe interpretation and noted succinctly in a Fifth Circuit opinion, \nCorporate Health Insurance v. The State Department of Texas, where \nCircuit Judge Higginbotham noted that the court had ``repeatedly \nstruggled with the open-ended character of preemption provisions of \nERISA and also the Federal Employers Health Benefits Act.''\n  The court noted that there had been a faithful following of the \nSupreme Court's broad reading of ``relate to'' in its opinions decided \nduring the first twenty years after ERISA's enactment. Since then in a \ntrilogy of cases, DeBuono v. NYSA-ILA Med. & Clinical Services Fund, \n117 S.Ct. 1747 (1997); California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement \nv. Dillingham Constr., N.A., Inc., 117 S.Ct. 832 (1997); New York State \nConference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins., Co., \n115 S.Ct. 1671 (1995), the Court has confronted the reality and had \nlimited the application of that preemption so the cases were brought \nfor medical malpractice in the State courts.\n  The provisions of the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill provide that where \nyou have an action brought on contract interpretation or ``quantity of \nmedical care,'' those cases will go to the Federal court, but where you \nhave a claim which is brought for the ``quality of medical care,'' or \nso-called malpractice, those cases will go to the State court.\n  I suggest to my colleagues that to have the two courts handle the \nmatters in that way will result in procedural quagmire because if you \nhave a case such as the following where a child is born to a mother who \nhas a plan under an HMO which seeks to limit the hospital stay to 24 \nhours. The patient is then discharged and an unfortunate result happens \nto the child. There will be both claims under the so-called quantity \ninterpretation of the contract and quality on medical malpractice.\n  That is illustrated in the case of Bauman v. U.S. Healthcare, 1 F. \nSupp. 2d 420, a case which was heard in the United States District \nCourt for the District of New Jersey in 1998. In that case, and this \nillustrates the kind of an issue I am referring to, the HMO plan had \npolicies which encouraged the discharge of a mother and a newborn \nwithin 24 hours after birth. Mrs. Bauman was discharged after that time \nelapsed, and the next day the Baumans' daughter fell ill.\n  The Baumans contacted the HMO and requested a home visit by a nurse. \nThe HMO refused to send a nurse, and the daughter died of meningitis \nthe same day. The Baumans brought an action against the HMO, the \ndoctor, and the hospital, and they went into State court. The HMO \nremoved the case to Federal court as they had a right to under ERISA.\n  The district court made a determination that counts under the \ncomplaint relating to the discharge decision were ``quality-of-care'' \ndecisions, and the counts would be remanded to the State court. The \ndistrict court said that the failure to provide the nurse was a \n``quantity'' decision and, therefore, was preempted totally.\n  On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, \nin a case captioned In re U.S. Healthcare, Inc., 245 F.3d 266, reversed \nthe district court holding that the claim was a quality decision.\n  The Bauman case illustrates the point about how hard it is to decide \nwhether a claim is a ``quantity'' claim or a ``quality'' claim.\n  Under the McCain bill, the claim that the Baumans would bring if the \nMcCain bill were enacted, would be in the Federal court on the issue of \nplan coverage because that is a determination of the ``quantity'' of \nmedical care, but that the other claims would be brought in the State \ncourt. I suggest obviously that is a procedural quagmire.\n  The point is further illustrated by an opinion of the Court of \nAppeals for the Third Circuit in a case called Lazorko v. Pennsylvania \nHospital, 237 F.3d 242, decided just last year, where the underlying \nfacts show the plaintiff's wife was hospitalized for attempted suicide. \nShe was released but continued to have\n\n[[Page S7048]]\n\nthoughts of suicide. Her doctor refused to readmit her to a hospital, \nand thereafter, regrettably and unfortunately, she killed herself.\n\n  In the State court, the plaintiff sued the HMO. The case was removed \nto the Federal court where the counts on direct liability against the \nHMO were dismissed. The case was then remanded to the State court and \nthen removed again by the HMO to the Federal court.\n  The Federal court dismissed some of the counts against the HMO but \nremanded the case to the State court because of the various vicarious \nliability claims which the plaintiff had against the HMO. On appeal, \nthe circuit court reversed the district court on one liability count \nand remanded the case to the district court.\n  That is legalese, obviously, and very hard to present in the course \nof a floor statement in a Senate debate on this subject, but it is \nillustrative of a point that where you have a situation where an HMO \ncovers certain kinds of treatments for medical illness and you have a \nquestion as to the coverage, under the McCain bill that claim would go \nto the Federal court, but if there is a claim on malpractice, failure \nof the doctor to exercise ordinary care, that case would go to the \nState court.\n  There is no doubt that with the long history which the Federal courts \nhave had on interpreting ERISA that there is going to be the first line \nof jurisdiction, and appropriately so, in the Federal court.\n  My amendment would provide that the Federal court would have \nexclusive jurisdiction over all of the claims. In a situation where the \nHMO would have its case heard in the Federal court, the Federal courts \nfrequently will retain jurisdiction over the doctors, the nurses, and \nthe hospital, and the other parties where the matter would ordinarily \ngo to State court on what is called pendent or supplemental \njurisdiction.\n  Again, it is very complicated. It does not lend itself to a short \ntime agreement, but the upshot of it is that if you have the provisions \nof the McCain bill which give jurisdiction to the Federal court on \ncontract interpretation or ``quantity of care\" and jurisdictions in the \nState court on malpractice or ``quality of care'', a plaintiff is going \nto have to go to two courts to get both of the claims adjudicated which \nis, as I say, a procedural quagmire.\n  The amendment which I have proposed would give appropriate deference \nto State law by providing that it would be the law of the State where \nthe incident occurred which would govern the lawsuit. That is to say \nthat the damages would be determined by State law and damages do vary \namong the 50 States.\n  Also, if the State had a cap or a limit on the amount which could be \ncollected, that would be determinative when the case is brought in the \nFederal court.\n  This is very much like the diversity cases where jurisdiction resides \nin the Federal court, where the plaintiff is a resident of one State \nand the defendant is a resident of another State. A simple illustration \nwould be if a patient from Camden, NJ, is treated in a Philadelphia, \nPA, hospital by a Philadelphia physician and there is an allegation of \nmalpractice, negligence on the part of the physician and the hospital, \nthen the resident of the State of New Jersey could sue in the Federal \ncourt with requisite jurisdictional amount, but it would be the law of \nPennsylvania which would govern, or the plaintiff could sue in the \nState court of Pennsylvania. State courts would have jurisdiction.\n  Once you bring the HMO into the picture and you have what is \ntraditionally under ERISA, it has to start out in the Federal court at \nleast as the contract interpretation and ``quantity of care.'' That is \nwhy it is my view, my legal judgment, that it is necessary to avoid the \nprocedural quagmire to have the Federal court have jurisdiction over \nthe entire matter.\n\n  The question has been raised as to choice of law and venue, the \nquestion raised by my distinguished colleague from Tennessee, and I \nspecified in the legislation that it would be the place of the incident \nwhich would determine the applicable law. Again, liability varies from \nState to State and venue has an important place. We want to avoid the \npotential of judge shopping so that the choice of law and the \ndetermination of venue would be where the incident occurred.\n  There is another important aspect to the litigation in the Federal \ncourt because of a feeling of a greater confidence in the Federal \njudicial system than in some State court judicial system. This is a \ntouchy point, but it is one which the Judiciary Committee examined in \nsome detail last year in considering the question of amending diversity \njurisdiction in class action cases. Class action is when plaintiffs \njoin to sue a defendant. There had been, for illustrative purposes, a \ncase which had been denied class action status by the Court of Appeals \nfor the Third Circuit, and the plaintiffs then went to Louisiana, to a \nfavored county, and instituted the class action case and had the class \naction certified.\n  Diversity jurisdiction is easily defeated in a class action matter \nbecause if you have many plaintiffs, as you do in a class action, and a \nsingle defendant, all you have to do to avoid diversity jurisdiction is \nto have one of the plaintiffs a resident of the same State as the \ndefendant. In order to have a diversity jurisdiction in the Federal \ncourt, all the plaintiffs have to be from a State other than the \nresidence of a defendant.\n  In the Judiciary Committee report on this subject, the following \nfacts of findings were made:\n\n       Some State court judges are less careful than their Federal \n     court counterparts about applying the procedural requirements \n     that govern class actions.\n\n  That appears on page 16 of the report of the Judiciary Committee \nreporting this bill out at a 10-8 vote.\n  On the next page, page 17, appears the following statement:\n\n       A second abuse that is common in State court class actions \n     is the use of the class device as ``judicial blackmail.'' \n     That is a fairly strong condemnation in citing that criticism \n     of the State courts. I do not suggest the impugning of all \n     State court judges everywhere. But there is a considerable \n     difference in many States in the quality of the courts where \n     you have electoral process in many States, contrasted with \n     the Federal system of life tenure, where I believe it is fair \n     to say it is generally accepted that the caliber of the \n     Federal courts is better, at least as a generalization.\n\n  There has been a great deal of concern expressed by some about the \nunlimited potential that would be present in a Patients' Bill of Rights \nin exposing defendants, HMOs, and employers to very high verdicts which \nwould increase the cost of health care. So there is some assurance, I \nthink fairly stated, by having the cases brought in the Federal courts.\n  I think it is useful to cite a couple of other illustrations abut the \nunderlying concern which I have about the procedural quagmire which \noccurs. One of the two cases I intend to cite additionally--but I shall \nnot cite many of the other cases, and there are many illustrative of \nthis proposition--is the case of Pryzbowski v. U.S. Healthcare, Inc., \n245 F.3d 266, decided by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit \nearlier this year. The plaintiff had back problems, sought surgical \ntreatment, the HMO delayed a decision for months, the plaintiff went to \nState court, suing the HMO for medical complications occasioned by the \ndelay. The HMO removed the case to the Federal court where the Federal \ncourt dismissed the claims against the HMO, finding that they were \n``quantity determinations'' and therefore preempted under ERISA section \n502. The district court also found that claims against the primary care \nprovider were expressly preempted by section 514 and dismissed those \nclaims, as well. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated the \nfindings and remanded the case to district court to make further \nfindings. The appellate court noted that the claims against the primary \ncare provider raised both ``quality'' and ``quantity'' issues and, on \nthe record before it, the court could not decide which applied in this \ncase.\n\n  So not only do you have the provisions of the pending bill, which \nwould send a plaintiff to two different courts on what is essentially \nthe same situation, but even have the courts unable to draw a bright \nline between what is ``quantity'' and ``quality.''\n  Another case which is illustrative of the problem is Corcoran v. \nUnited Health Care Inc., 965 F.2d 1321, heard in the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in 1992, where a patient was \npregnant, and her doctor recommended complete bed rest and \nhospitalization so that he could monitor\n\n[[Page S7049]]\n\nthe fetus. The patient's doctor sought precertification from the HMO \nfor a hospital stay. The HMO denied the request and authorized only 10 \nhours per day of health nurse services at home. Subsequently, the fetus \nregrettably went into distress and died at a time when the home health \nnurse was not on duty. The Corcorans, parents of the deceased child, \nbrought suit in the State court which then had it removed to the \nFederal court, with the HMO arguing that they had not made a medical \ndecision on ``quality'' but only a decision as to what benefits were \ncovered under the health plan which was preempted by ERISA. The court \nconcluded that the HMO gave medical advice, but in the context of \nmaking a determination about the availability of benefits under the \nplan, and as such the court found the Corcorans' claim was preempted by \nERISA.\n  So there you have a curious situation of what is viewed as a medical \ndecision but again, preemption, because it was held to relate to a \ndetermination of benefits under the plan.\n  The amendment would give jurisdiction to the Federal court on both of \nthe claims so that when any one of these plaintiffs, such as a mother \nwho is delivering a baby and has a limitation of 24 hours in the \nhospital and has a claim both as to coverage and as to malpractice, she \ncould bring the case into Federal court, where State law would apply as \nto damages, and if there was a cap on damages in that State, that cap \nwould apply.\n  I am a cosponsor of the bill and I, too, intend to support the bill. \nBut I do believe that this sort of a jurisdictional clarification is \nindispensable if we are to avoid having a plaintiff compelled to \nlitigate in two courts with that kind of multiplicity of action.\n  I ask the manager of the bill to engage in a discussion, if the \ndistinguished manager would be willing to do so, or if a co-manager \nwould be more appropriate to talk about the operation of the plan, if I \nmay have Senator Kennedy's attention. I direct a question to my \ncolleague from Massachusetts and raise the issue as to whether it would \nbe more appropriate to discuss the matter with the Senator from North \nCarolina on this issue, but the question I have relates to the McCain-\nKennedy-Edwards bill where you have a case, taking the illustration of \nthe underlying facts that I gave in the Lazorko case. Where you have an \nHMO, which covers medical care, and a woman being in a hospital for \nattempted suicide being released and the HMO refusing to readmit her, \nand thereafter she killed herself--isn't it true that the claims which \nwere brought, say in Lazorko, which raised questions of interpretation \nof the plan, would be brought in the Federal court and the cases on \nmalpractice would be brought in the State court under your bill?\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I do not expect we will be able to \nlitigate a case on the floor. I am not familiar with the facts in that \nparticular situation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Massachusetts \ndoes not have the floor; the Senator from Pennsylvania does. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Did the Senator from Massachusetts suggest the absence \nof a quorum?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the floor; \nthe Senator from Massachusetts does not.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do not intend to litigate a case on the Senate floor. \nSo without referring to a specific case, I ask the Senator from \nMassachusetts, is it true that under his bill a claim which calls for \ninterpretation of coverage of the insurance contract for so-called \n``quality of care'' would be brought in the Federal court, and a claim \nwhich might--which would arise out of the same occurrence, which \ninvolved malpractice, or a ``quality'' case--would that not, under his \nbill, be brought under the State court?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I say to the Senator, it is my understanding of the \ncase, the facts we have to date with that particular issue, following \nthe Supreme Court holdings in the Pegram case, this would be tried in \nthe State court.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I would press the question as to the \ninterpretation of the insurance contract, which defined the rights of \nthe parties under the contract. Isn't it plain, under your bill, I say \nto Senator Kennedy, that this is a matter which goes to the Federal \ncourt?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The understanding of our position on this issue is that \nthe Supreme Court in Pegram said, when there is a dual issue involved \nin terms of the medical decision and the contract decision, as the \nSenator knows, on medical issues decided in the State contract, in the \nFederal courts, and where there is a mix of those, the predominance of \nthese issues being medical, it would be tried in the State court.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I suggest that is at variance with the \nprovisions of the Senator's bill. I will cite the exact citation here.\n  At page 140, if I might call it to the attention of the Senator from \nMassachusetts, section 502 of ERISA, which is brought in the Federal \ncourt, and at the bottom, line 24:\n\n       (I) regarding whether an item of service is covered under \n     the terms and conditions of the plan or coverage,\n\n  So that is a section where you have Federal court jurisdiction, and \nthat would be the issue, as to interpretation of a contract to \ndetermine coverage.\n  I ask the Senator from Massachusetts if that is not an accurate \ncitation of the Senator's bill?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. No. No, it is not. The Senator would be reading it out \nof context:\n\n       Cause of action must not involve a medically reviewable \n     decision.\n\n  The Federal cause of action excludes the medically reviewable \ndecision. That is on page 142, line 6.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I might have the attention of the Senator from \nMassachusetts, on the preceding page, 139, section 302 talks about the \n``availability of civil remedies.''\n\n       (a) Availability of Federal Civil Remedies In Cases Not \n     Involving Medically Reviewable Decisions.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Going on to 140.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct, and that is consistent with my \nearlier remarks.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I may be permitted to finish my sentence, since I do \nhave the floor----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator wants a response, I am trying to respond \nto those highly technical questions the best way we can.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do want a response, but not in the middle of my \nsentence or the middle of my question.\n  But to go forward here on the availability of Federal civil remedies \nin cases not involving medically reviewable decisions, this covers, \nline 24-25:\n\n     regarding whether an item of service is covered under the \n     terms and conditions of the plan or coverage,[.]\n\n  My question to the Senator from Massachusetts: Isn't that an explicit \nconclusive statement that, if it is a matter of interpreting a contract \nas to what service is covered under the terms and conditions of the \nplan or coverage, that is a Federal remedy? That is what it says in \nblack and white, doesn't it? I ask Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is wrong. That is taking it out of context. \nThe fair way is to read the complete paragraph and go on to the next \npage.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, if the Senator cares to read the next \nparagraph, where he makes a claim of being taken out of context, I \nwould be interested in hearing him read any such paragraph.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have referred to that earlier, page 142, line 6. The \ncoverage decision depends on a medically reviewable issue. On the \nmatters dealing with the medically reviewable issue, the Supreme Court \nhas indicated that it would be decided in the State courts. That is \nessentially what we have included in this language.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I agree with the general delineation \nthat it was a medically reviewable decision. That is called ``quality \nof care,'' as I have said before, and is a malpractice issue. But the \nquestion which I have directed to the Senator from Massachusetts is a \nmuch narrower question.\n  To repeat, is this not a question on the interpretation of the \ncontracts, specifically where an item of service is covered under the \nterms and conditions of the plan for coverage? That is my question. The \ninterpretation of ``an item of service is covered under the terms and \nconditions of the plan for\n\n[[Page S7050]]\n\ncoverage'' is a matter for the Federal court.\n  I believe it is plain from the language on 139 to 141 that it is a \nFederal matter. But if you move to an interpretation of what is medical \nmalpractice or a breach of duty by a doctor on what is a medically \nreviewable decision, then that is a matter which goes to the State \ncourts. And this legislation does not continue the preemption of \nexisting law.\n  If I might have the attention of the Senator from North Carolina, \nMadam President, this is an issue which my distinguished colleague from \nNorth Carolina and I have been discussing for several days. And this \nmorning in my hideaway we discussed the complications, at least as I \nsaw them, on having the provisions of the pending bill which deal with \nthis complex dichotomy of an interpretation of contract coverage, which \nis set forth at line 24, 25 on page 140 over to lines 1 and 2 on 141, \nwhich comment regarding an item of service covered under the terms and \nconditions of the plan for coverage which comes under the category of \navailability for Federal civil remedies. Then if you move over to a \nmedically reviewable decision on medical malpractice, there is the \ndifference.\n  Is my interpretation correct that the legislation provides for cause \nof action in different courts, No. 1? It is the coverage of the \ncontract, or what the courts have called ``quantity'' malpractice and \nwhat the courts have called ``quality.''\n  Mr. EDWARDS. If the Senator would repeat the question, it is \ndifficult for me to hear.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would be glad to repeat the question. As the Senator \nand I were talking this morning, isn't it accurate that the courts have \nmade a distinction in ERISA, section 502, on what is contract coverage \nor ``quantity'' with complete preemption under existing law?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. My understanding is--as the Senator said, we talked \nabout this earlier today--that has traditionally been the case. I think \nthere has been, I think, some erosion on that during the last few \nyears. I think the Senator is correct. There have been a number of \ncourt rulings in that respect.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I agree with the Senator from North \nCarolina. There has been erosion on the preemption of 514 where the \ncourts have really seen the inequities of denying injured parties \nrelief, and instead of being under 502 with ``quantity'', they have \ntried to move the cases into ``quality'' with the broader \ninterpretation where some relief has been granted.\n\n  I am a cosponsor of the amendment. As I said earlier, one of the \nconcerns that I candidly expressed a decade ago was my surprise over \nthe reach of the preemption of ERISA. It seemed to me to be unfair to \ndeny injured plaintiffs redress in the courts because of the \npreemptions which were really designed originally under other kinds of \nbenefit plans and not under health maintenance organization plans. When \nthe HMOs came into being, they took the benefit of the same kind of \npreemption.\n  But in this legislation you have the dichotomy where some cases are \nheard in the Federal courts as they relate to ``quantity care'' or \ninterpretation of the contract, and other cases or the same case may be \nheard in the State court as it relates to a medical malpractice or the \n``quality of care.''\n  My question to the Senator is, isn't that an accurate statement?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Again, I am having a little trouble hearing you. If the \nSenator said that the separation under our legislation between the \ncontract causes of action, which have traditionally been considered \nERISA causes of action, go to Federal court and in the case of the \nmedically reviewable decision cases go to State court, that would be \naccurate.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The concern I have, having gotten an understanding on \nthe applicability of the statute, which the Senator and I are in \nagreement with, is, how is it going to work? I characterized it, while \nthe Senator was off the floor, as a procedural quagmire.\n  If you have a case--and I cited a couple of them--where a child is \nborn, and the mother has an HMO which encourages release from the \nhospital within 12 hours, and the child, unfortunately, dies--and I \ncited a specific case--and then you have a series of claims which were \nbrought by the plaintiff and one of the claims involves interpretation \nof the contract, is that care covered by the contract?\n  Then if there are other claims for negligence on the part of the \ndoctor or hospital, that would then fall under the amendment of the \nSenator from North Carolina under State court jurisdiction.\n  I cited another case where you had a woman who was suicidal, she was \nreleased from the hospital, the doctor wanted to put her back in, and \nthe HMO wouldn't let him do that. She committed suicide. A suit was \nbrought and the HMO defended it on the ground that it wasn't covered. \nThat went from the Federal court. They dealt with the exclusive \npreemption under 502. But the aspect of ``quality of care'' is a State \ncourt action. You have perpetuated that.\n  It is very difficult, obviously, to move totally away from Federal \njurisdiction under ERISA on the interpretation of the contract because \nthere is so much law on the subject. I know my colleague will agree \nwith me on that generalization.\n  What happens when you have the suicide? The mother of the infant is \nreleased from the hospital within 24 hours, and the claims are made. \nThey are essentially the same claims. They are claiming that they are \ncovered under the contract. They are claiming personal injuries, loss \nof earning potential, or for the woman who has committed suicide, loss \nof earnings, loss of consortium, the whole range.\n  Having litigated some of these cases, you more recently than I. But \nthe essential claims are going to be the same: Personal injuries for \nboth the claim for coverage and ``quantity of care\" as opposed to the \nclaim for ``quality of care'' or malpractice.\n  So how is it going to be resolved with two separate courts, Federal \ncourt having jurisdiction over ``quantity,'' and State court having \njurisdiction over ``quality?''\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I think----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair reminds Members to address each \nother in the third person and to address the questions through the \nChair.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Nunc pro tunc.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I would answer the Senator's question by saying that \nunder the examples given, if I understood them correctly, most of those \nexamples would involve interpretation of contract language in the \ncontext of a medically reviewable fact.\n  So I believe under our legislation those, in fact, go to State court. \nI say to my colleague, if there is any medical fact interpretation \ninvolved, I believe those cases go to State court. So I think under the \nexamples given, all of the cases would end up in State court.\n  Having said that, though, in fairness to the Senator, I can imagine \ncircumstances--I don't think the Senator's examples meet it--where \nthere could be a medically reviewable decision which would go to State \ncourt and also there could be a claim that the contract was breached \nseparate and apart from that, which I think is the issue the Senator is \nraising.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I would accept the modification by my \ncolleague from North Carolina. I think the citation I gave has a \ncontract claim. But rather than disagree about that, since the Senator \nfrom North Carolina acknowledges there could be some cases, I will take \nanother case whereas the Senator from North Carolina says there could \nbe that kind of distinction.\n  I ask the Senator, through the Presiding Officer, then in your bill \nwhat do you do in that situation where you have the Federal court \ncontrolling--in the language of the statutes--``whether an item or \nservice is covered under the terms and conditions of the plan or \ncoverage'' and other aspects of the same set of facts are covered under \nmedically reviewable factors?\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would be glad to yield as soon as I get this answer.\n  Mr. GREGG. It is just a technical question. The answer might be \nbetter if he has time to think about it.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, it is too late now to retain the continuity \nwithout yielding, so I do yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator and apologize for breaking the \ncontinuity. I\n\n[[Page S7051]]\n\nthink building the record on this issue is very important.\n  We are trying to get a sense of the situation, so we can tell our \nmembership what they are going to be doing this evening. After your \namendment is completed, we will have three votes lined up. I wonder if \nwe could agree that we would begin the vote on those amendments at \nsometime around 6:45.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I am not able to specify when because \nthe Senator from North Carolina and I are in the midst of what I \nconsider to be an important colloquy. But I will try to keep it as \nbrief as possible.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The question, Madam President, that I ask the \ndistinguished Senator from North Carolina is, in taking his conclusion \nthat there are some cases which would involve contract interpretation, \nand the same case would involve a medical malpractice determination, \nwhat do you do when the contract interpretation has jurisdiction in the \nFederal court and the medical malpractice has jurisdiction in the State \ncourt?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Madam President, I would say, in answering my \ncolleague's question, that in fact I am having difficulty imagining a \ncase right now. The vast majority of cases similar to what we have just \nbeen discussing would fall within the category of a contract \ninterpretation involving a medically reviewable fact. So I think, at \nleast of all the examples that occur to me as I stand here, those cases \nwould all end up in State court.\n  As the Senator and I have spoken about on a number of occasions, he \nhas a concern--and I understand it--about the possibility of there \nbeing some confusion about which cases go to State court and which \ncases go to Federal court. We think we have defined that fairly well in \nour bill.\n  I might add, in response to the Senator's question, that there is a \nprinciple involved in this which we have not discussed, which is that \nphysicians, hospitals, and health care providers believe--and I agree \nwith them--if an HMO is going to overrule their decision and engage in \nthe practice of medicine, they ought to be treated the same way they \nare treated.\n  As the Senator knows, their cases are normally handled in State \ncourts. So I think conceptually we start with the principle that HMOs \nshould be treated the same as other health care providers when they \nmake medical decisions.\n  No. 2, I say to my colleague that what we are doing is taking a \nFederal protection curtain that was unintended for HMOs when it was \npassed--because they basically did not exist--and lifting it. The \neffect of lifting it is they become subject to State court law.\n  So I think it is consistent in that respect. As the Senator and I \nhave talked about before, it is also consistent with the fundamental \nconcept that HMOs, if they are going to engage in the practice of \nmedicine, ought to be treated as other health care providers.\n  I yield back to my colleague.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I agree completely with my colleague \nfrom North Carolina that when HMOs engage in the practice of medicine, \nthey ought to be treated like physicians.\n  But coming back to the distinction in the Edwards bill, which does \nhave a provision on coverage as distinguished from medically reviewable \ndecisions, there are two thoughts which occur to me. You have a whole \nbody of case law--dozens of cases--which have wrestled with factual \nsituations on coverage, whether a plan covered the specific item: The \ninfant in the hospital for 24 hours; or the woman who was suicidal, \nwhether the plan covered further hospitalization for her. And then \nthose cases also involve counts on medical malpractice, on ``quality.''\n  So it seems to me it is very hard for my colleague from North \nCarolina to argue that it is not a commonplace occurrence to have \nspecific cases arise where under his bill they would go to different \ncourts. And then the express language of the Edwards bill has a \ndelineation between medically reviewable decisions on malpractice and a \ncategory--``whether an item or service is covered under the terms and \nconditions of the plan or coverage.''\n  So I would direct perhaps only two more questions to my colleague \nfrom North Carolina--and I say perhaps.\n  The first question is--and I address this question through the \nChair--isn't it conclusive where the Edwards bill has language which \ndistinguishes ``whether an item or service is covered under the terms \nand conditions of the plan or coverage,'' as distinguished from \nmedically reviewable decisions, that the Edwards bill contemplates \nthese two categories, which under the Edwards bill are going to go to \ntwo different courts?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Again, if I correctly understand the Senator's \nquestion----\n  Mr. SPECTER. I can understand the difficulty, Madam President, when \npeople are whispering to him all the time. That is why I keep my people \noff the floor.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I am trying very hard to listen to the Senator.\n  Madam President, if I may respond to the Senator's question, the \nanswer to the question is: I really think there is a fundamental \nquestion that the Senator and I may have some disagreement about, which \nis contract interpretations that involve medically reviewable facts \nunder our legislation go to State court. I believe that all of the \nexamples the Senator has mentioned and all the examples I can think of \nwould fall in that category.\n  Specifically as related to his concern about the possibility of there \nbeing two separate courts with jurisdiction, I think, in fact, that is \nnot only highly unlikely but I can't think of a fact situation, as I \nstand here now, that would meet that criteria.\n  What we have done is to have a principle, and we have designed this \nbill around that principle. The Senator knows very well that this is \nthe principle that was discussed in the Pegram case, a U.S. Supreme \nCourt case, principle supported by the State attorneys general, the \nAmerican Bar Association, this separation. It is a concept that makes \nsense in this context.\n  No legislation is perfect. We certainly can't eliminate the \npossibility that there may be in a hypothetical case some joint \njurisdiction, but I can't think of such an example.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I will direct this question to my \ncolleague from North Carolina: How do you account for the many, many \ncases which have been litigated distinguishing between contract \ncoverage, where really the language in the Edwards bill ``whether an \nitem for service is covered under the terms and conditions of the \nplan,'' and a medically reviewable decision, where so many courts on so \nmany cases labored with those distinctions, if, in fact, there aren't \nmany cases where they are going to end up in different courts under the \nEdwards bill?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Madam President, if I may respond to the Senator's \nquestion briefly, I believe it is because we have created a presumption \nthat if the contract interpretation involves a medically reviewable \nfact, which is going to be the vast majority of cases--all the cases I \ncan think of, as I stand here--those cases go to State court.\n  Those are the kinds of cases to which I believe the Senator is \nreferring. I don't think the problem the Senator is addressing is one \nthat is likely to occur in real life. We have specifically dealt with \nthe issue of when there is a question, if it involves a medically \nreviewable fact, those cases go to State court.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, if it is unlikely, even with the \nbrilliance and conceptual imagination of the Senator from North \nCarolina--he can't think of one--to occur in real life, why put this \njurisdictional provision in the bill?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Because there are two separate categories, if I may \nanswer the Senator's question. There are two potential causes of \naction. If it involves any issue relating to medical care, specific \nmedical fact, those cases go to State court. We treat the HMOs just as \nthe doctor because they are engaging in the practice of medicine. If, \non the other hand, the issue is one of were they covered for 60 days as \nthe contract provided, do they meet some other specific contractual \nrequirement, those are purely contractual issues that have been decided \nin Federal court for many years under ERISA. So we left those cases \nwhere they have traditionally been decided, which I think is the \nappropriate place to leave them.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, if you do have those contract \ndecisions, isn't it entirely possible that there may be a factual \nsituation arise where there is a matter of malpractice or a medically \nreviewable decision involved in the same occurrence?\n\n[[Page S7052]]\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I would answer my colleague's question exactly the way I \nhave before, which is, absent a presumption in our bill that if there \nis an involvement of a medically reviewable fact, I think the Senator's \nconcern would be one that I would share. But we have dealt with that \nissue by specifically saying where the contract interpretation involves \na medically reviewable fact, those cases go to State court. Those, in \nmy experience and in my judgment, I believe will be the same cases that \nthe Senator is describing as cases, I think he used the term, of \nmedical malpractice.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, as they say in Oklahoma, we have gone \nabout as far as we can go on this colloquy. I would advise the managers \nof the bill that I will be prepared to conclude my argument by 6:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that if the other \nside does not require any additional debate, we begin the votes on the \nthree pending amendments, which would be, in order, the Snowe \namendment, the Enzi amendment, and the Specter amendment, beginning at \n6:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right to object, we need \nSenator Snowe to have 10 minutes, and she needs to offer a \nmodification.\n  Mr. GREGG. We also need to have 2 minutes on Senator Enzi's amendment \nprior to his vote. So we would have 10 minutes prior to the Snowe \namendment and 2 minutes prior to the Enzi amendment. And Senator Snowe \nwould have the right to modify her amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I accept that as a unanimous consent agreement in line with \nwhat we previously offered except for the time.\n  Mr. GREGG. I would have to add that it is my understanding Senator \nEnzi may divide the question on his amendment. That is his right, as I \nunderstand it; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator desires to divide his amendment, he may do \nso.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator wish the 10 minutes dedicated \nto Senator Snowe to start at 6:45 or to begin now?\n  Mr. GREGG. It should begin prior to the vote.\n  Mr. REID. We are going to vote on the Specter amendment at 6:45.\n  Mr. GREGG. We are going to vote on the Specter amendment.\n  Mr. REID. At 6:45.\n  Mr. GREGG. We are going to vote on Snowe and then Enzi and then \nSpecter.\n  Mr. REID. We do need Senator Snowe here.\n  Mr. GREGG. She will be here. So 10 minutes on the Snowe amendment \nwould begin at 6:45.\n  Mr. REID. Or when she arrives.\n  Mr. GREGG. Or when she arrives. And the votes would begin thereafter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, these are on or in relation to the \namendments as per the previous oral agreement?\n  Mr. GREGG. Right.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I believe the colloquies with the \nSenator from Massachusetts and the Senator from North Carolina have \nmade my point. That point is that there is jurisdiction created under \nthe McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill in two courts. There really is no doubt \nabout that because section 302 provides for the availability of Federal \ncivil remedies, and that covers whether an item of service is covered \nunder the terms and plans and conditions, and later there are medically \nreviewable decisions in State courts.\n  Although there can be an inconclusive colloquy, as there is no \nconfession or admission on the floor of the U.S. Senate, I think it is \npretty plain that there are cases--and I have cited a whole series of \nspecific cases in my presentation, Bauman, Pryzbowski, Lazorko, and \nCorcoran--where you had factual situations where you have an \ninterpretation of a plan which would come under Federal jurisdiction--\nsuch as the mother's stay covered for more than 24 hours, the suicidal \nwoman's coverage extended for hospitalization under that circumstance--\nthen a combination of failure to have a plan coverage and also medical \nmalpractice. And you have both claims brought.\n  And under the McCain-Kennedy-Edwards bill, it is plain that those two \nclaims would be brought in separate courts beyond any question. It is \nnot a matter of what the distinguished Senator can imagine. You have \ncase after case which have had these interpretations, contract \ninterpretation and ``quantity of care,'' and that goes to the Federal \ncourt. And then you have ``quality of care,'' and that goes to the \nState court.\n  I am not unaware of the realities of votes in this Chamber where a \ncoalition has been formed, and there is a mindset. But I do hope that \nthe managers of this bill will revisit this situation after this vote \nand when the bill goes to conference because having both these courts \navailable is going to double the burden on plaintiffs who are injured--\nto make a contract interpretation claim in the Federal court and to go \nto the State court to make a medical malpractice claim--and it is going \nto require double expenses by the HMO, by the doctors, and by the \nhospitals--although you might have the doctors and hospitals eliminated \nfrom the Federal litigation, but the HMOs will certainly be there; and \nthat is highly undesirable.\n  I have a grave concern about the speed of passage of this bill. Now, \nit is true we have been considering the Patients' Bill of Rights for a \nlong time--many years. Too long. But this bill has come to the floor \nwithout the benefit of committee action, without the benefit of a \nmarkup; and what there has been is sort of a moving target markup of \nthis bill on the floor by the committee of the whole, as we have gone \nthrough many amendments. But it simply cannot be denied that there are \ntwo sections of this bill, one conferring Federal jurisdiction and one \nconferring State jurisdiction, and the same factual situation would \nraise questions under both court systems, and this bill would require \nlitigation in two courts.\n  That is very wasteful and very confusing. To call it a procedural \nquagmire is not an overstatement. The answer is fundamental, and that \nis to provide for exclusive Federal court jurisdiction, which I have in \nthis legislation. You might argue that it could go to the State court \nand that would be an improvement rather than have both State and \nFederal courts. But it is very hard to move exclusively to the State \ncourts where you have the long body of law built up under ERISA as to \nwhat is a plan's coverage. So given the fact that you are going to \ninevitably end up in the Federal court, the Federal court ought to be \nexclusive jurisdiction. And as the amendment provides, the damages will \nbe determined by State law, no new Federal caps, but whatever State \ncaps there were would be in effect.\n\n  I see my colleague from Illinois on the floor. He commented to me \nthat he agreed with the provision that there ought to be unitary \njurisdiction, but thought it ought to be in the State court. I will \nyield to the Senator from Illinois if he cares to use the limited time \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam President, I did want to, in part, agree with \nmy colleague from Pennsylvania. I think he has identified an important \nproblem that exists in the underlying bill. I have long favored \ncreating liability for HMOs that harm someone because of their \nnegligence. Right now, HMOs are protected. They are immune from \nliability, and that is a protection that almost no other individual or \ncorporation has in this country, and I don't think it is defensible.\n  For the last 2 years, I have been voting regularly to make HMOs \nliable where they have been negligent. But I do think we have a problem \nin this bill in that we create State court tort liability by repealing \nthe ERISA immunity in one part of the bill. That is on page 157, I \nbelieve. But then, at the same time, we create also tort liability, as \nwell as more contract liability, and there already is contract \nliability under ERISA in Federal court.\n  The problem I see is that there are tort causes of action authorized \nin this\n\n[[Page S7053]]\n\nbill both in State court and in Federal court. I have always thought \nthe playing field was tilted in favor of HMOs, and that playing field \nneeds to be leveled. But I am concerned now that if this effect in the \nunderlying bill is not remedied, the playing field will be tilted in \nthe opposite direction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 6:45 having arrived, under the \nprevious order, the Senator from Maine is to be recognized.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 834, As Modified\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to modify the \namendment that has been offered by Senator DeWine, Senator Lincoln, and \nSenator Nelson and send a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 834), as modified, is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To make technical corrections concerning the application of \n               Federal causes of action to certain plans)\n\n       On page 2 of the amendment, between lines 9 and 10, insert \n     the following:\n       ``On page 144, lines 7 and 8, strike `or under part 6 or \n     7'.''.\n       On page 3 of the amendment, strike line 14 and all that \n     follows through line 21 and insert the following:\n       ``(ii) Definition.--A group health plan described in this \n     clause is--\n\n       ``(I) a group health plan that is self-insured and self \n     administered by an employer (including an employee of such an \n     employer acting within the scope of employment); or\n       ``(II) a multiemployer plan as defined in section 3(37)(A) \n     (including an employee of a contributing employer or of the \n     plan, or a fiduciary of the plan, acting within the scope of \n     employment or fiduciary responsibility) that is self-insured \n     and self-administered.\n\n       On page 11 of the amendment, line 16, insert after the \n     period the following: ``The provisions of this paragraph \n     shall not apply in the case of a designated decisionmaker \n     that is a group health plan, plan sponsor, or health \n     insurance issuer and that is regulated under Federal law or a \n     State financial solvency law.''.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, it is modified in the following way. \nFirst of all, the question was raised about the original intent of the \namendment in regard to the self-insured, self-administered plans. \nSpecifically, with regard to contractual dispute, it will only exempt \nfrom liability employer and union plans that are self-insured and self-\nregulated, again applying symmetry to all of the plans regarding self-\ninsured and self-administered, so we do not make any exceptions. So we \naddress that by modifying it to ensure that both employer and union \nplans are consistent with the legislation.\n  Secondly, because insurance plans are already regulated at State and \nFederal level with regard to assets and other issues, we assure that \nthese regulated plans are not subject to a new Federal solvency plan to \nqualify as a designated decisionmaker. As a result, the solvency \nstandard in this amendment will appropriately apply to nonhealth \ninsurance designated decisionmakers.\n  Finally, we also make a technical correction in the legislation to \nensure that the causes of action are not inadvertently opened to other \nstatutes that are already a matter of law. This change reflects the \nintent of our amendment to prevent the filing of lawsuits in a broader, \nmore undefined number of issues.\n  I urge adoption of the modification as well as the underlying \namendment.\n  Again, I remind my colleagues that this was an effort to address many \nof the legitimate issues that were raised regarding employer liability. \nIt was a consensus that was drafted along with my colleague from Ohio, \nSenator DeWine, Senator Lincoln, and Senator Nelson. I also thank \nSenator McCain, Senator Kennedy, Senator Edwards, as well as Senator \nGregg and Senator Frist, for working together to make this amendment \npossible. We thought it essential that we develop precise and clear \nguidelines in terms of how we establish employer liability but at the \nsame time protecting patients' rights with their ability to seek legal \nredress when there is inappropriate care or denial of care.\n  We think we have developed and crafted the amendment in a way that \ncreates the bright line and the firewall so that we do provide the \nnecessary protection to employers, so that we limit and, in fact, in \nmost instances I think prevent any exposure to liability. They can \nconfer that liability and risk to the designated decisionmakers and \ntherefore they will have that kind of liability protection, and \npatients will have their ability to be able to sue in those instances \nwhere they have been denied care or there has been wrongful injury, \npersonal injury, or even death.\n  I think it strikes the right balance. The consensus represents the \noptimum approach to providing the kind of basis for removing an \nemployer's exposure to litigation when they are not directly \nparticipating in medical decisions.\n  We hope this will satisfy the concerns that have been raised by the \noriginal legislation. We think we crafted the best approach, borrowing \nboth from the McCain-Edwards-McCain legislation as well as the Breaux-\nFrist-Jeffords approach.\n  Again, I urge adoption of this amendment, as modified, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor amendment No. 834 \nwith Senator Snowe and my other colleagues. It addresses an issue \nimportant to all of us here--protecting employers from undue liability. \nThis amendment clarifies any confusion about who is responsible for \nmedical decision-making.\n  Under this amendment, employers who generally do not make medical \ndecisions anyway--will be able to name a designated decision maker. If \nthey contract with an insurance company, that company is automatically \ngiven the status of designated decision maker. The employer doesn't \nhave to take any further action.\n  Once designated, this entity will have the authority to make medical \ndecisions. And with this authority, the designated decision maker--not \nthe employer--will have the responsibility for those decisions if they \nresult in harm to the patient.\n  I believe this amendment serves as an important compromise. It \nenables employers to feel more comfortable offering their employees \nhealth benefits. And that's certainly something we want to encourage. \nBut it also protects patients, and ensures that they receive all the \nprotections provided under the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I understand the Parliamentarian has \nruled that I have 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 5 minutes in opposition.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, unless somebody else is seeking that \ntime, I will speak. I congratulate the Senator from Maine and the \nSenator from Ohio for adjusting this amendment. The changes they made \nin this amendment are very positive. The amendment moves in the right \ndirection.\n  However, it must be made clear this amendment targets one narrow \naspect of the concerns of this bill, and, in fact, there are still some \nissues in that aspect. Specifically, employers are going to have a very \ndifficult problem figuring out whether they are a direct participant or \nwhether they fall under the designated decisionmaker safe harbor.\n  There are issues within this narrow issue that are very significant.\n  The greater issues on the question of liability still remain very \nviable. It is of serious concern to those of us who look at this as \nextremely expensive legislation in the sense it will drive up health \ncare costs and result in a lot of people losing their health insurance. \nEmployers will drop the health insurance because of the liability \naspects being thrown at employers in this bill and the costs employers \nsimply are not going to bear. They will drop health insurance or reduce \nthe quality of health insurance.\n  The estimates of CBO are in the range of 3.1 million, and OMB \nestimates are in the range of 1 million to 4 million people will lose \nhealth care. I think it will be literally tens of millions of people \nwho will see the quality of their health care insurance degraded as \ntheir employers start to adjust.\n  As to this specific amendment, which is a narrow amendment, not an \nexpansive amendment, the movement by the Senators from Maine and Ohio \nis to be congratulated. I thank them for it.\n\n[[Page S7054]]\n\n  I yield back my time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is yielded back.

There are now 2 minutes equally \ndivided on the Enzi amendment.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 840\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, under the amendment we just agreed to, we \nmade some progress on handling liability. But there is a group of \nbusinesses that were left out. You will never hear me in this Chamber \ntalk about big businesses. I always talk about the small ones. None of \nthese is headquartered in Wyoming. But I am compelled to put in an \namendment that will take care of a major problem which will take care \nof health care at the level they know it for 6 million people in the \nU.S. who work for the big, self-insured, self-administered companies, \nsuch as Hewlett-Packard, Caterpillar, Wal-Mart, and Pitney Bowes. None \nof those is in my State.\n  This provides an option to allow one of two ways of providing \ninsurance to their people so individuals can get the right to sue if \nthey want that right or they can stay with the plan which they \npresently get all the benefits from without any difficulty. This \nprovides that option for them.\n  This is providing an option so that the company can avoid liability \nby providing a liability option for their people.\n  I ask for your support on this amendment to clear up what the people \nin your State need.\n  I also believe it is my right to divide the amendment on page 3, line \n18.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, let me just mention what this amendment \nis all about.\n  If an employer gives options to any employee, it can offer a program \nthat is very inferior or it can provide a voucher that is inferior. You \ncan't buy a good health insurance policy. If it offers those two \noptions to any employee, and that employee denies it, then the employee \nwho stays with that company is virtually excluded from bringing any \naction against the employer, no matter how involved the employer is in \nmaking medical decisions that can cause adverse reaction to that \nemployee--either death or injury.\n  That is a lousy choice. This is an option many companies will take. \nIt will be at the expense of the employees. They can get two inferior \noptions. If they reject it and stay with the company, they are excluded \nfrom the benefits and the protections of this bill. It is going to open \nup a great exclusion for millions of hard-working Americans and their \nfamilies. It should be rejected.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have already been ordered.\n  The question occurs on division I.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I move to table the whole amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: As I understand \nit, the question was divided. Is this a motion to table on the first \npart?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. That is true.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw \ndivision II of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I announce to our colleagues that this \nwill be the last vote of the evening. We will begin voting tomorrow \nmorning at 9 o'clock on a series of votes on amendments that will be \noffered this evening. There is one more vote, but after that there will \nbe no more notes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 844\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes now evenly divided on the \nSpecter amendment.\n  Who yields time? Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, this amendment provides for exclusive \njurisdiction in the Federal courts. Under the bill, there would be \njurisdiction in the Federal courts for interpretation of the contract's \ncoverage or what is referred to as ``quantity of medical care'', and \njurisdiction in the State courts for what is called medical malpractice \nor ``quality of care.'' That means that for a plaintiff to bring a \nclaim, they would have to go into two courts, enormously more \nexpensive, and it would involve removal to the Federal courts and \nbouncing back and forth.\n  This amendment gives due deference to the States by using any State \ncaps which are in effect and provides for State law on the computation \nof damages. With the life tenure of Federal\n\n[[Page S7055]]\n\njudges, the probability is high that the verdicts will be more \nrealistic and more reasonable than we have seen in some of the State \ncourts.\n  In the colloquies with the managers of the bill, it is obvious that \nthere are many of these cases which involve both ``quantity'' and \n``quality.'' During the floor presentation, I went over a number of \ncases where they bounced back and forth.\n  I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Madam President, I have great respect for my colleague's \nexpertise in this area. I appreciate very much his work. He and I have \ntalked about this a number of times. The problem is that this amendment \nviolates a fundamental principle on which we have based this entire \nlegislation. That is, when HMOs and health insurance companies make \nmedical decisions and overrule doctors, they should be treated exactly \nthe same way doctors are treated. That is the reason our bill sends \nthese cases to State court. It is the reason this is so critical for \nthe AMA and medical groups all over this country.\n  They want the HMOs, if they are going to be in the business of \noverruling doctors' decisions, to be treated exactly the same as \ndoctors and exactly the same as other health care providers.\n  For that reason, I reluctantly must oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n844.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 42, nays 58, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 207 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--42\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--58\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The amendment (No. 844) was rejected.\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, in just a few moments, I believe there \nwill be a consent request by the minority floor leader to outline a \nseries of amendments to consider and outline the order in which to take \nthem up this evening, with disposition of those on the morrow.\n  It is not the intention, as we have gone through amendments, to \nsecond degree them. We are not prepared to say that until we have an \nopportunity to see those amendments. We are trying to work through the \namendments at the present time. I hope perhaps we can get started on \nthe discussion, and then in a few moments time when we have a chance to \nsee each of the amendments, we can come back with the leadership \nproposal for an agreement on time and order this evening.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are ready to enter into an agreement \nrelative to time and reserve the issue of second-degree amendments \nuntil the Democratic leader has had the opportunity to review the \namendments. If we can get times locked in, that will be very helpful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Does the Senator \nfrom Virginia have an amendment pending at the desk?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 833, As Modified\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send to the desk a modification to that \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 833), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 154, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       ``(11) Limitation on attorneys' fees.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, or any arrangement, agreement, or contract regarding an \n     attorney's fee, the amount of an attorney's contingency fee \n     allowable for a cause of action brought pursuant to this \n     subsection shall not exceed \\1/3\\ of the total amount of the \n     plaintiff's recovery (not including the reimbursement of \n     actual out-of-pocket expenses of the attorney).\n       ``(B) Determination by district court.--The last Federal \n     district court in which the action was pending upon the final \n     disposition, including all appeals, of the action shall have \n     jurisdiction to review the attorney's fee in accordance with \n     subparagraph (C) to ensure that the fee is a reasonable one \n     and may decrease the amount of the fee in accordance with \n     subparagraph (C).\n       ``(C) Determination of reasonableness of fee.--\n       ``(i) Initial determination of lodestar estimate.--\n\n       ``(I) In general.--To determine whether the attorney's fee \n     is a reasonable one, the court first shall, with respect to \n     each attorney representing the plaintiff in the cause of \n     action, multiply the number of hours determined under \n     subclause (II) by the hourly rate determined under subclause \n     (III).\n       ``(II) Number of hours.--The court shall determine the \n     number of hours reasonably expended by each such attorney.\n       ``(III) Hourly rate.--The court shall determine a \n     reasonable hourly rate for each such attorney, taking into \n     consideration the actual fee that would be charged by each \n     such attorney and what the court determines is the prevailing \n     rate for other similarly situated attorneys.\n\n       ``(ii) Consideration of other factors.--A court may \n     increase or decrease the product determined under clause (i) \n     by taking into consideration any or all of the following \n     factors:\n\n       ``(I) The time and labor involved.\n       ``(II) The novelty and difficulty of the questions \n     involved.\n       ``(III) The skill required to perform the legal service \n     properly.\n       ``(IV) The preclusion of other employment of the attorney \n     due to the acceptance of the case.\n       ``(V) The customary fee of the attorney.\n       ``(VI) Whether the original fee arrangement is a fixed or \n     contingent fee arrangement.\n       ``(VII) The time limitations imposed by the attorney's \n     client on the circumstances of the representation.\n       ``(VIII) The amount of damages sought in the cause of \n     action and the amount recovered.\n       ``(IX) The experience, reputation, and ability of the \n     attorney.\n       ``(X) The undesirability of the case.\n       ``(XI) The nature and length of the attorney's professional \n     relationship with the client.\n       ``(XII) The amounts recovered and attorneys' fees awarded \n     in similar cases.\n\n       On page 170, between lines 21 and 22, insert the following:\n       ``(9) Limitation on attorneys' fees.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, or any arrangement, agreement, or contract regarding an \n     attorney's fee, subject to subparagraphs (C) and (D), the \n     amount of an attorney's contingency fee allowable for a cause \n     of action brought under paragraph (1) shall not exceed \\1/3\\ \n     of the total amount of the plaintiff's recovery (not \n     including the reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses \n     of the attorney).\n       ``(B) Determination by court.--The last court in which the \n     action was pending upon the final disposition, including all \n     appeals, of the action may review the attorney's fee to \n     ensure that the fee is a reasonable one.

Born Alive Infant Protection Act.\n  I presume it passed the House.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. On that there will be an objection to a time limit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GREGG. Why don't we begin with the DeWine amendment for 15 \nminutes, followed by the Grassley amendment for 30 minutes, and we will \nwork on the rest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, and I do not intend to \nobject, I appreciate what the Senator from New Hampshire is attempting \nto do. We have every inclination to support that proposal up to this \npoint, but we reserve possible second-degree amendments and a tabling \nmotion. We do not intend at this time to exercise those until we see \nthe amendments, but we are going to operate on a good faith measure.\n  We are thankful for the leadership of the Senator from New Hampshire \nproceeding with those first two.\n  There are some others we might be able to get a time agreement on, as \nwell, if the Senator wants to mention them.\n  Mr. GREGG. Of course, at this time we cannot proceed past the \nSantorum amendment until we get an agreement on that. At least I renew \nmy request subject to the reservations of the Senator from \nMassachusetts, to which I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest, as modified, for consideration of the amendments of Senators \nDeWine and Grassley?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 842\n\n           (Purpose: To limit class actions to a single plan)\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.

No action maintained by \n     such class, such derivative claimant, or such group of \n     claimants may be joined in the same proceeding with any \n     action maintained by another class, derivative claimant, or \n     group of claimants or consolidated for any purpose with any \n     other proceeding. In this paragraph, the terms `group health \n     plan' and `health insurance coverage' have the meanings given \n     such terms in section 733.''.\n       ``(2) Effective date.--This subsection shall apply to all \n     civil actions that are filed on or after January 1, 2002.''.\n       (b) RICO.--Section 1964(c) of title 18, United States Code, \n     is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(1)'' after the subsection designation; \n     and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(2)(A) No private action may be brought under this \n     subsection, or alleging any violation of section 1962, where \n     the action seeks relief concerning the manner in which any \n     person has marketed, provided information concerning, \n     established, administered, or otherwise operated a group \n     health plan, or health insurance coverage in connection with \n     a group health plan. Any such action shall only be brought \n     under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. In \n     this paragraph, the terms `group health plan' and `health \n     insurance issuer' shall have the meanings given such terms in \n     section 733 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of \n     1974.\n       ``(B) Subparagraph (A) shall apply to private civil actions \n     that are filed on or after January 1, 2002.''.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I allowed the clerk to read because I \nwanted my colleagues to hear the essence of the amendment. It is a very \nsimple amendment.\n  My amendment in a very rational way limits class action suits that \ncould be filed as a result of this bill. The goal of the patient \nprotection legislation under consideration, both the McCain-Kennedy \nbill and the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill, is, of course, to protect \npatients. We cannot be unmindful of the cost. Obviously, we have to be \nconcerned about the cost, and we have to worry if any parts of this \nbill do in fact drive up the cost because ultimately this will impact \nhow many employers do in fact offer health insurance. It is something \nwith which we have to be concerned.\n  I believe my amendment offers a very simple way to curtail some of \nthese increased costs. The problem is that the underlying bill will \nincrease the cost of health care because the bill currently contains no \nlanguage to limit the scope of class action lawsuits. This very \npossibility could lead to increases in the filing of onerous, \nburdensome, costly class action suits.\n  My amendment ensures that class action lawsuits are used in a very \nresponsible way. I think my colleagues would agree that class actions \ncan be very effective and can be efficient and can be a valuable tool \nto achieve justice.\n  As we also know, unfortunately, these suits sometimes are subject to \nabuse. That is why I believe we need to limit the target of these class \nactions. That is what our amendment does.\n  The reality is that our amendment is needed. Let me explain for a \nmoment what our amendment does and then talk about what it does not do. \nOur amendment permits a class action to be filed with regard to the \nHMO, in regard to a plan, as long as we are only dealing with one \ncompany and the employees of that specific company. It says we cannot \ngo beyond that.\n  The reality is that within every company there exists unique \nrelationships between the company, the employees, and the health care \nplans. Because of that, it is impossible to compare different companies \nthat happen to offer similar health care plans. The fact is that every \ncompany negotiates every contract differently. There may be \nsimilarities. Every situation is, obviously, different.\n  Now, at the same time, employees within the same company, with the \nsame health care plan, who suffer the same way as a result of being \ndenied entitled benefits, should have the right to band together to \nform a class and to file suit. That is why our amendment would \nrecognize class actions within one company against one plan.\n  Our language essentially says this: One employer, one health care \nplan, one class action suit. It is that simple.\n  Here is how our amendment works if adopted. Suppose Ford Motor \nCompany offers its employees the hypothetical Aetna Health Care Plan A. \nGeneral Motors has this plan. Assume, also, that Chrysler has the same \nplan. Now, if employees at Ford have reason to band together in a class \naction against Aetna because they all believe they suffered harm \nbecause of the same denial in entitled benefits, they can go\n\n[[Page S7057]]\n\nahead under our amendment and do that. Similarly, if employees at GM or \nChrysler also believe they have suffered as a result of denial of the \nsame benefits, GM and Chrysler employees can file their own class \nactions against Aetna. But employees at Ford, GM, and Chrysler can't \njoin together in one suit against the health care provider.\n\n  This means class actions would be limited to employees within one \ncompany against one health care plan. Ultimately, we need this because \nabuse of class action lawsuits is not a road to assuring access to \nquality health care. If we want the bill before the Senate not to add \nunnecessary litigation and costs, I encourage my colleagues to adopt \nthis amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is not a \nsufficient second.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I repeat the request for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is not a \nsufficient second.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator from Ohio wishes the yeas and nays, we would \nbe happy to give those to him with the agreement that we will vote \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I renew my request for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are Senators prepared to yield back time on \nthe amendment?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I believe we have an understanding to reserve several \nminutes tomorrow morning for summation.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, there are a couple of issues--and I have \njust seen this amendment--a couple of issues raised immediately.\n  One, the entire Patients' Bill of Rights is about treating everybody \nthe same. This, of course, carves out a special treatment for HMOs on \nthe issue of accountability.\n  Second, this amendment makes a special exception under RICO for HMOs \nand under rules of procedure.\n  Third, it has been some time since I looked at the rules, I confess, \nbut I seem to recall under class action law, rule 23 of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure, there is a numerosity requirement, that you \nhave to have a sufficient number of employees involved to satisfy the \nclass action requirement, and I am not sure under the language the \nSenator has drafted that would be possible because I believe, if I \nunderstand the Senator's amendment correctly, he has limited it to one \nemployer for purposes of class actions.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Obviously, the amendment does not change what the rules \nsay as far as the number of people required for a class action. The \nSenator is correct; it does limit it to one company.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Senator for his answer.\n  There is at least a serious question about that and we would need to \ngo back and look. Under the Class Action Rules of Civil Procedure, it \nis my recollection there is a numerosity requirement that means a class \nhas to be of sufficient size to be able to be certified as a class \naction, and I am not certain, if you limit the actions to one employer, \nthat you don't effectively eliminate the possibility of a class action \nbecause that requirement cannot be met.\n\n  I confess to the Senator, that is from memory, and I will have to go \nback and look to be certain.\n  I have concerns about the fundamental question that the principle of \nthis legislation is that we treat HMOs, for accountability purposes, as \neveryone else. And the notion of doing something specifically to \nprotect them from class actions and to limit class actions and to limit \nthe RICO statute is something that would violate that principle of \nwhich I would want my colleagues to be aware.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Do the Senators yield back time?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I inquire, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I will respond to my colleague and I appreciate his \ncomments. He is closer to the courtroom in time than I am, and it has \nbeen many years since I have practiced law.\n  What this comes down to is that we are creating new opportunities for \nlawsuits, obviously, in this bill. What we are about is a balancing \ntest, a balancing question. It is a matter of public policy. We have to \ndecide. As we create new causes of action, new opportunities to file \nlawsuits, I think it is legitimate to look around and say: How \nexpansive do we want to allow class actions to be under this new cause \nof action?\n  It seems to me language we have included, which is basically--\nbasically, I say--what was in the Frist bill originally, is a rational \nway to do it. It doesn't ban class actions but basically says we are \ngoing to limit them. I think it is a balancing test and Members are \ngoing to have to make their own decision whether they think it is worth \nproviding people with the opportunity to have nationwide class actions. \nCandidly, with the tremendous cost this is probably going to incur, \nthat ultimately is going to be paid and ultimately going to drive up \nhealth care costs. I think Members have to make that decision.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio yields the remainder of \nhis time. The Senator from North Carolina has 10 minutes 48 second.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. If I may respond briefly to the comments of my \ncolleague, the one issue he did not address, at least in his last \nanswer--he may have discussed it earlier--is the issue of civil RICO. I \nbelieve I am correct in saying there are some State medical societies \nthat have pending actions against them, civil RICO actions against \nHMOs, where they believe, obviously, the requirements of that statute \nhave been met and there have been improper and illegal activities by \nthe HMOs. Particularly as we go forward, if any State medical society \nbelieves those problems continue to exist, they may want to avail \nthemselves of the civil RICO statute, a law that exists in part for \nthat purpose.\n  Again, the trouble would be we are carving out special treatment for \nHMOs. Having said that, I do not disagree with the fundamental \nprinciple that is part of this process; it is public policymaking. We \nhope to balance the interests on both sides. I think that notion makes \nsense. My concern is we are carving out the HMOs from this particular \nstatute when we are not carving anyone else out from this particular \nstatute.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Just to respond to my colleague--and I do appreciate his \ncomments about RICO--again it is a balancing question each Member is \ngoing to have to decide.\n  Just to clarify things, I want to make it clear, the way this is \ndrafted, we do not affect any pending issues, so those suits would not \nin any way be affected.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I yield my time?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I wonder if I may inquire whether or not there was a \nunanimous consent as far as the vote tomorrow morning at any time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was no consent.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Daschle has indicated we are going to come in at 9 \no'clock in the morning and start voting. The first vote will be 15 \nminutes, and if there are other votes stacked, which I am confident \nthere will be, there will be 10-minute votes on whatever is debated \ntonight. There is 10 minutes for the subsequent votes. There would be 4 \nminutes between each vote to debate.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Would that include the first vote?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. So we would have in the morning then 4 minutes evenly \ndivided prior to the first vote?\n  Mr. REID. That is right.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield the floor and thank my colleague from Nevada.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. We yield the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back. Under the \nunanimous consent agreement, the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, is \nrecognized.\n\n[[Page S7058]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator sending an amendment to the \ndesk?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 845\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 845.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To strike provisions relating to customs user fees and \n                        Medicare payment delay)\n\n       On page 179, strike lines 1 through 14.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I think three times during the debate on \nthis bill I have been trying to make the point that bringing this bill \nto the floor usurped the consideration of the Senate Finance Committee \nof two provisions that are in the bill and another provision that ought \nto be in the bill that is not in the bill. My amendment today deals \nwith striking sections 502 and 503. It is another way of my saying, as \nI tried to in an amendment 2 days ago on this legislation, to the \nFinance Committee, that people writing this legislation ought to keep \ntheir hands off subject matter that comes within the jurisdiction of \nthe Senate Finance Committee. If people are writing a piece of \nlegislation that comes out of Health, Education, Labor, they ought to \nfind sources of revenue out of programs within their own jurisdiction \nto fund bills that they think up, rather than robbing another \ncommittee. That is basically what has happened.\n  I am opposed to both provisions on jurisdictional grounds because \nthey are within the control of the Finance Committee, not the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee. But I also want to make it \nvery clear it is not just jurisdictional, I also have concerns about \nwhat it does to policy, dealing with customs on the one hand and \nMedicare on the other hand. I want to review each of these in turn.\n  Section 502 of the bill extends the customs user fees from the year \n2003 to 2011. This generates $7 billion over 8 years of the total \nrevenue that it takes to fund this piece of legislation.\n  When Congress authorized these customs user fees, the avowed purpose \nwas to underwrite the costs of customs commercial operations. But today \nin this bill, the fees are not being used for customs. They are being \nused to offset the cost of the Patients' Bill of Rights to the tune of \n$7 billion. I think this is unacceptable and violates the comity that \none committee ought to have towards the other.\n  It also is unacceptable because when you have constituents who pay \ncustoms user fees for the purpose of having an efficient and effective \noperation of the Customs Service, so you can enter this country in an \nexpeditious way, for those fees not to be used for what they were \nintended--for expedited entry to the country, to police illegal entry \nto the country, to police illegal drugs coming into the country, \ngenerally to make the customs agency's personnel more efficient and \nbetter able to do their job so the United States can be a sovereign \nnation protecting its borders the way it should--if these fees are \nextended, and I want to emphasize the word ``if,'' they should be \nextended in a thoughtful way, not as some budget trick to make the \ncosts of this bill fit within the confines of the Federal budget.\n  I am not the only one who thinks so. I have received numerous letters \nfrom companies, from associations that are very concerned about this--\nLiz Claiborne, Inc., the National Association of Foreign Trade Zones, \nthe Joint Industry Group, the National Retail Federation, the American \nElectronics Association, and also a memo from the U.S. Customs Service. \nThey are all raising concerns because these are folks who pay this \ncustoms user fee, a fee that is meant to pay for bringing things into \nthe country. They believe since the Customs Service is so outdated, so \nslow moving, not working in an expeditious way, this revenue ought to \nbe used for the improvements in the customs operation that were \nanticipated when these fees were put in place. I ask unanimous consent \nthese letters and memos be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Liz Claiborne Inc.,\n\n                                  North Bergen, NJ, June 20, 2001.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley. We write in opposition to a \n     provision in the Patients' Bill of Rights (S. 1052) that \n     would extend the merchandise processing fee, or ``mpf,'' for \n     eight additional years. This is a trade-related measure, a \n     user fee levied against importers like ourselves, that has no \n     place in this legislation. We ask you to support efforts to \n     delete the provision entirely.\n       First by way of background, the merchandise processing fee \n     is an ad valorem fee levied against each import transaction, \n     or ``entry.'' When it was passed 15 years ago, it was done so \n     with the avowed purpose of underwriting the costs of \n     commercial operations at the US Customs Service. In fact, \n     however, it has never been used for that purpose. Instead, \n     proceeds have been diverted to the general fund and act as a \n     revenue source to balance the costs of other governmental \n     programs. As of FY2001, the trade community has paid nearly \n     $7.2 billion for merchandise processing, an amount far \n     exceeding Customs' commercial operations budget.\n       In truth, the fee is really a tax on US imports and, from \n     the beginning, we have objected strongly. It has been illegal \n     under GATT and then World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, \n     although the federal government has indulged in the fiction \n     that it is a ``user fee.'' Now, under the terms of S. 1052, \n     all pretense has been dropped and it is being offered as an \n     offset to the costs of the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n       The fee is indeed due for renewal by 2003 and it is the \n     trade communities' intention to seek its termination. While, \n     before, the nation was experiencing a serious deficit, the \n     reasons for its passage have since disappeared. Now, it is \n     simply a tax on American citizens who buy imported products, \n     whose price is inflated by the mpf. It is unconscionable to \n     continue to tax Americans in this manner and we intend to \n     seek repeal in the appropriate committee jurisdiction.\n       In the meantime, however, we ask that you assist us in \n     removing the mpf funding from the Patients' Bill of Rights. \n     The merchandise processing fee has no place in this debate. \n     The fee will not be viewed on the merits in these \n     proceedings, but is instead being used--cynically--as a \n     ``pay-for'' a totally unrelated program.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  Frank Kelly,\n\n                               Vice President, International Trade\n     Compliance and Government Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                       of Foreign-Trade Zones,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 15, 2001.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley. The National Association of Foreign-\n     Trade Zones (NAFTZ) has learned that S. 872, Sec. 602 the \n     ``Bipartisan Patient Protection Act'' provides for the \n     extension of the Merchandise Processing Fee (MPF) through \n     2011. Congress established the fee to offset the cost of the \n     commercial operations of the U.S. Customs Service. Not only \n     does the proposed legislation continue the practice of \n     allocating the MPF to the general fund of the U.S. Treasury \n     with no relationship to the purpose of the fee, it completely \n     eliminates the relationship of the fee to the Customs \n     Service. We have serious reservations as to whether this is \n     permissible through the General Agreement on Tariffs and \n     Trade, and the World Trade Organization.\n       The NAFTZ is not opposed to the imposition of a fee for \n     services rendered. We do believe, however, that any such fee \n     must correlate to a discernible cost associated with the \n     service provided. We are concerned that at a time when \n     Congress is struggling to find the necessary funding to cover \n     the cost of the modernization of the Service, that funds \n     already designated by Congress for that purpose are being \n     diverted.\n       Since the purpose of the MPF, as established by Congress, \n     is to fund the commercial operations of the U.S. Customs \n     Service, we are strongly opposed to any extension of the MPF \n     without designating the revenue to that intended purpose and \n     we respectfully request that you drop the merchandise \n     processing fee extension from S. 872.\n       Thank you for your attention and consideration of our \n     views. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact \n     me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Randy P. Campbell,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         Joint Industry Group,\n\n                                    June 20, 2001, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain. The Joint Industry Group (JIG) \n     expresses its opposition to a provision in the Bipartisan \n     Patient Protection Act (S. 1052) that would automatically \n     extend the U.S. Customs user fee from 2003 to 2011 (Sec. \n     502). This 8-year extension would remove any near-term \n     opportunity to debate whether the fee should be continued or\n\n[[Page S7059]]\n\n     whether an extension could be earmarked specifically for \n     modernizing U.S. Customs operations.\n       JIG is a coalition of more than 160 companies, trade \n     associations, professionals and businesses actively involved \n     in international trade. We both examine and reflect the \n     concerns of the business community relative to current and \n     proposed international trade-related policies, actions, \n     legislation, and regulations. We undertake to improve \n     policies and procedures through dialogue with government \n     agencies and the Congress. The Joint Industry Group \n     represents over $350 billion in trade.\n       JIG members account for millions of dollars paid yearly in \n     merchandise processing fees (MPF). Every year, Customs \n     collects over $1 billion from companies importing goods into \n     the United States. Additionally, companies are burdened by \n     administrative costs associated with the fee, since Customs \n     imposes complex reporting and accounting requirements on \n     companies in the course of collecting fee payments. All this \n     is occurring at a time when tariffs on products are declining \n     and approaching zero.\n       If the Customs Service is to continue collecting this user \n     fee it MUST directly fund improvements to Customs processing, \n     specifically the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) and \n     other U.S. Customs initiatives that are greatly needed to \n     improve the trade process. Improving Customs' ability to \n     handle trade will become more critical as the amount of \n     commerce entering the United States is expected to continue \n     its double-digit rate of growth. While Section 502 of S. 1052 \n     does not earmark user fees for health care purposes, it does \n     use the fee as de facto justification for the revenue \n     neutrality of the bill. JIG is greatly concerned that this \n     approach will prevent user fees from being applied to the \n     commercial operations of the U.S. Customs Service for which \n     they are intended.\n       Use of the fee to offset the revenue impact of S. 1052 \n     could also increase potential for a WTO dispute. In the late \n     1980's, a GATT panel found that the user fee was GATT-illegal \n     because it was being collected in amounts exceeding the cost \n     of Customs processing. While the U.S. addressed that problem \n     by placing certain caps on the fee, it was clear from the \n     panel finding that linkage of the fee to the cost of Customs \n     commercial operations is of seminal importance to the \n     question of GATT legality. If our trading partners believe \n     Customs user fees are being used to fund health-care related \n     goals, another GATT challenge is virtually certain to surface \n     in the WTO.\n       For the reasons cited above, JIG would have no choice but \n     to support such a challenge. It is clear that the proposed \n     action in S. 1052 violates the WTO provisions to which the \n     United States is a signatory.\n       We therefore urge that the user fee extender be removed \n     from S. 1052.

Chuck Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on Finance, Dirksen \n         Bldg., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley. The National Retail Federation (NRF) \n     was surprised to learn that section 502 of the Bipartisan \n     Patient Protection Act (S. 1052) contains an eight-year \n     extension of the Customs Merchandise Processing Fee (MPF). \n     The MPF is an administrative fee leveled on imports into the \n     United States, through which U.S. retailers and other \n     importers pay hundreds of millions of dollars every year.\n       NRF and the U.S. retail industry object most strongly to \n     inclusion of this provision and, for the following reasons, \n     we urge that the provision is stricken from the bill.\n       The Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over \n     the MPF and other customs issues, was not consulted about \n     this provision in S. 1052 and, has had no opportunity to \n     consider the merits of extending the fee as currently \n     structured.\n       The MPF was created to offset the administrative costs of \n     the U.S. Customs Services' commercial operations, and any \n     attempt to use it for other purposes, as this bill would do, \n     is against the rules of the World Trade Organization.\n       The Finance and Ways and Means Committees have been working \n     for some time with Customs and the importing community on \n     renewing the MPF in a way that would ensure it be used for \n     its proper and intended function--for commercial operations, \n     including customs modernization funding.\n       It is unacceptable that extension of the MPF has been \n     slipped into a health bill without the approval of the \n     Committee of jurisdiction or the knowledge of those in the \n     private sector that will be most directly affected as a \n     result. At the same time, we are struggling to provide \n     Customs Service with sufficient funds for a new computer \n     system to allow Customs to modernize its operations and \n     protect our nation's borders. If this provision in S. 1052 is \n     allowed to stay, it will be impossible for the Senate Finance \n     Committee to restructure the MPF program in the way it was \n     intended--to finance the costs of Customs' operations. \n     Accordingly, we ask for your help in insisting on the removal \n     of this provision when S. 1052 comes to the full Senate for \n     consideration.\n       The National Retail Federation (NRF) is the world's largest \n     retail trade association with membership that comprises all \n     retail formats and channels of distribution including \n     department, specialty, discount, catalog, Internet and \n     independent stores. NRF members represent an industry that \n     encompasses more than 1.4 million U.S. retail establishments, \n     employs more than 20 million people--about 1 in 5 American \n     workers--and registered 2000 sales of $3.1 trillion. NRF's \n     international members operate stores in more than 50 nations. \n     In its role as the retail industry's umbrella group, NRF also \n     represents 32 national and 50 state associations in the U.S. \n     as well as 36 international associations representing \n     retailers abroad.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Steve Pfister,\n     Senior Vice President, Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                          AeA,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 25, 2001.\n     Hon. Chuck Grassley,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley. AeA, the nation's largest high-tech \n     trade association, is opposed to the provision (section 502) \n     in the Bipartisan Patient Protection Act (S. 1052) that would \n     extend the application of the U.S. Customs user fee from \n     September 30, 2003, to September 30, 2011.\n       The U.S. importing community currently has full expectation \n     that this import tax will expire as scheduled in 2003. As the \n     leading U.S. importing sector, the U.S. high-tech sector \n     would be particularly impacted by such a tax increase. Our \n     member companies already pay tens of millions of dollars \n     annually in customs user fees. In addition, there are \n     additional administrative costs associated with the fee, \n     since customs authorities impose complex reporting and \n     accounting requirements on importers in the course of \n     collecting the user fee payments. An unexpected, eight-year \n     extension of the user fee, with its associated administrative \n     costs, would be an unwelcome and unnecessary additional cost \n     burden on our industry.\n       While section 502 of S. 1052 does not earmark user fees for \n     health care purposes, it does use the fee as de facto \n     justification for the revenue neutrality of the bill. We \n     believe this provision introduces the potential that the U.S. \n     Customs user fee will again be found contrary to U.S. \n     international obligations under the WTO. In the late 1980's, \n     a GATT panel found that the user fee was GATT-illegal because \n     it was being collected in amounts exceeding the cost of \n     customs services rendered. While the United States addressed \n     that problem by placing certain caps on the fee, it was clear \n     from the panel finding that linkage of the fee to the cost of \n     customs commercial operations is of seminal importance to the \n     question of GATT legality. If our trading partners believe \n     customs user fees are being used to achieve health-care \n     related goals, another GATT challenge could well surface in \n     the WTO.\n       For the reasons stated, AeA urges you to remove the customs \n     user fee extender from S. 1052. This Patient Protection Act \n     is an inappropriate forum for any consideration of extending \n     the custom user fee. If you have any questions about our \n     views on this issue or wish to discuss the matter further, \n     please contact me at 202-682-4423.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Tim Bennett,\n     AeA Senior Vice President International.\n                                  ____\n\n\n [From the Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and \n                         Budget, June 21, 2001]\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n    (This statement has been coordinated by OMB with the concerned \n                               agencies.)\n\n       S. 1052--Bipartisan Patient Protection Act. (Sens. McCain \n     (R) AZ, Kennedy (D) MA, Edwards (D) NC) The President \n     strongly supports passage of a patients' bill of rights this \n     year and has been working with members of both parties since \n     the first week of the Administration to forge a compromise. \n     Congress has been divided on this issue for far too long at \n     the expense of patients and their families. The President \n     strongly urges Congress to pass a strong patients' bill of \n     rights this year that provides meaningful protections for \n     patients, not a windfall for trial lawyers or a threat to \n     Americans' ability to obtain and afford quality health care. \n     On February 7, 2001, the President transmitted to Congress \n     his principles for a bipartisan patients' bill of rights and \n     urged Congress to move quickly on this important issue.\n       The President's principles called for passage of a \n     patients' bill of rights that ensures all Americans enjoy \n     strong patient protections, including: access to emergency \n     room and specialty care; direct access to obstetricians, \n     gynecologists, and pediatricians; access to needed \n     prescription drugs and approved clinical trials; access to \n     health plan information; a prohibition of ``gag clauses''; \n     consumer choice provisions; and continuity of care \n     protections. The President also recognizes, however, that \n     many States have passed strong patient protection laws \n     already, some of which have been in force for over a decade. \n     To the extent possible, a Federal patients' bill of rights \n     should give deference to these effective State laws.\n       The President's principles emphasized the importance of \n     providing patients who have\n\n[[Page S7060]]\n\n     been denied medical care with the right to a fair, prompt, \n     and independent medical review, which will ensure that \n     disputes are resolved quickly and inexpensively and that \n     patients receive the quality care they deserve.\n       The President stated that only after this independent \n     review decision is rendered should we resort to the costlier, \n     time-consuming remedy of litigation in Federal courts to \n     ensure that health plans are held liable for wrongful \n     decisions.\n       The President's principles also reminded Congress of the \n     necessity of avoiding unnecessary and frivolous lawsuits, \n     which will only serve to drive up costs and leave more \n     individuals without insurance coverage. S. 1052 will \n     significantly increase health insurance premiums and the \n     number of uninsured. According to the Congressional Budget \n     Office, health insurance premiums under S. 1052 as originally \n     drafted would increase by over 4 percent. If the effects of \n     litigation risk on the practice of medicine and of the \n     reduced ability of health plans to negotiate lower rates were \n     included, CBO's estimated cost impact could be much higher, \n     by 4-5 percent or more. This is in addition to the estimated \n     10-12 percent premium increases employers are already facing \n     in 2001. Further, leading economists have predicted that \n     employers drop coverage for appropriately 500,000 individuals \n     when health care premiums increase by 1 percent. According to \n     these estimates, S. 1052 could cause at least 4-6 million \n     Americans to lose health coverage provided by their \n     employers.\n       The President is encouraged by efforts in the Senate, like \n     those of Senators Frist, Breaux, and Jeffords, to develop a \n     common sense compromise that forges a middle ground on this \n     issue and meets the President's principles.\n       While the President strongly supports a comprehensive and \n     enforceable patients' bill of rights and has been working \n     with members of both parties to enact legislation this year, \n     he believes that S. 1052 would encourage costly and \n     unnecessary litigation that would seriously jeopardize the \n     ability of many Americans to afford health care coverage.\n       The President objects to the liability provisions of S. \n     1052. The President will veto the bill unless significant \n     changes are made to address his major concerns. In \n     particular, the serious flaws in S. 1052 include:\n       --S. 1052 circumvents the independent medical review \n     process in favor of litigation. The President believes that \n     patients should be given care first--litigation should be the \n     last resort. Patients should exhaust the medical review \n     process first, allowing doctors, not trial lawyers, to make \n     decisions about medical care.\n       --S. 1052 jeopardizes health care coverage for workers and \n     their families by failing to avoid costly litigation. S. 1052 \n     overturns more than 25 years of Federal law that provides \n     uniformity and certainty for employers who voluntarily offer \n     health care benefits for millions of Americans across the \n     country. The liability provisions of S. 1052 would, for the \n     first time, expose employers and unions to at least 50 \n     different, inconsistent State-law standards. The result will \n     inevitably be that employers and unions will be forced to pay \n     for different benefits from State to State, even within a \n     particular State, based on varying precedents set in State \n     courts and leading to inconsistent standards of care for \n     patients. Further, S. 1052 imposes no limitations on State \n     court damages, and it is not clear whether existing State-law \n     caps would apply to the broad, new causes of action in State \n     courts that S. 1052 creates.\n       S. 1052 also would allow causes of action in Federal court \n     for a violation of any duty under the plan, creating open-\n     ended and unpredictable lawsuits against employers for \n     administrative errors. These new federal claims do not have \n     any limitations on the amount of noneconomic damages, \n     creating virtually unrestrained damage awards that are \n     limited only by an excessive $5 million cap on punitive \n     damages.\n       Moreover, S. 1052 would subject employers and unions to \n     frequent litigation in State and Federal court under a vague \n     ``direct participation'' standard, which would require \n     employers and unions to defend themselves in court in \n     virtually every case against allegations that they ``directly \n     participated'' in a denial of benefits decision. Because such \n     determinations are inherently fact-specific, any such \n     allegation will force a costly and time-consuming court \n     process and result in varying State interpretations of \n     ``direct participation,'' forcing employers to adhere to \n     different standards in every State.\n       --S. 1052 fails to provide a fair and comprehensive remedy \n     to all patients. The President believes the new Federal law \n     should establish a comprehensive set of rights and remedies \n     for patients. S. 1052 instead encourages costly litigation by \n     providing no effective limitations on frivolous class action \n     suits and allows trial lawyers to go on fishing expeditions \n     to seek remedies under other Federal statutes.\n       --S. 1052 subjects physicians and all health care \n     professionals to greater liability risk. S. 1052 would expand \n     liability for physicians and all health care professionals in \n     State courts well beyond traditional medical malpractice by \n     permitting new, undefined causes of action in State courts \n     for denials of medical benefits. This expanded litigation \n     against physicians and all health professionals will create \n     an opportunity to circumvent State medical malpractice caps \n     that may not apply to these new causes of action.\n       --Extraneous User Fee Provision. The Administration objects \n     to inclusion in S. 1052 to an extraneous revenue-raising \n     provision (section 502), which extends for multiple years \n     Customs charges on transportation, passengers, and \n     merchandise arriving in the country.\n\n\n                         Pay-As-You-Go Scoring\n\n       S. 1052 would affect direct spending; therefore, it is \n     subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus \n     Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring \n     estimate of the bill is under development.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         U.S. Customs Service,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 20, 2001.\n\n     Memorandum for James F. Sloan, Acting Under Secretary \n       (Enforcement).\n     From: Acting Commissioner\n     Subject: Pay-go Offset for the Patient Bill of Rights\n       Congress will soon consider passage of the Patient Bill of \n     Rights. The Customs Service offers no opinion of the \n     legislation. However, we have concerns with the bill's \n     potential impact on future Customs appropriations. Section \n     502 of the bill would extend our collection of COBRA fees \n     from 2003 to 2011, but would use the revenue to offset the \n     cost of implementing this new legislation. Although we \n     support extending the collection of COBRA fees, any scoring \n     of the COBRA extension which would limit, in any way, the \n     ability to fund or offset Customs activities would likely \n     cause a critical funding shortfall for the Customs Service.\n       Section 502 of the bill states: Section 13031(j)(3) of the \n     Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (19 \n     U.S.C. 58c(j)(3)) is amended by striking ``2003 and inserting \n     2011, except that the fees may not be charged under \n     paragraphs (9) and (10) of such subsection after March 31, \n     2006''.\n       The COBRA fees collected by Customs are used both to \n     reimburse Customs appropriation for certain costs, such as \n     overtime compensation, and to offset a portion of the Customs \n     Service Salaries and Expenses Appropriation (S). As an \n     example, our FY 2001 collections will offset approximately $1 \n     billion or almost 50 percent of Customs appropriation this \n     year. Authorizing a COBRA extension to offset costs for \n     something other than the Customs Service could negatively \n     impact our available funding. Additionally, the Merchandise \n     Processing Fee authorized in the COBRA is a fee that is paid \n     by importers for the processing of merchandise by the Customs \n     Service. Directing the funds collected from this fee for \n     something other than Customs operations could pose GATT \n     interpretation issues.\n       While Customs supports the extension of the COBRA fees, we \n     also acknowledge that changes are warranted with the manner \n     in which we collect those fees. We intend to review this \n     issue in the near term.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I want to speak specifically to what one company wrote:\n\n       The merchandise processing fee has no place in this debate. \n     The fee will not be viewed on the merits in this proceeding, \n     but is instead being used--cynically--as a ``pay-for'' for a \n     totally unrelated program.\n\n  Obviously, the totally unrelated program is the Patients' Bill of \nRights that is before us.\n  Our experience today--in other words, how we handle this issue of \ncustoms user fees today--will only hurt us in our deliberation of what \nought to be done to expedite and make more efficient entry into our \ncountry. It is going to hurt us when that policy debate comes up \nsometime down the road--weeks, months, but sometime. Customs \nmodernization is a very important priority.\n\n  My point is that there are important Customs modernization issues \nthat should no longer be ignored. Let's not have a rush to pay for this \nPatients' Bill of Rights today and blind us towards the real public \npolicy questions we have on the Customs Service and their problems \ntomorrow.\n  Are you concerned about drugs at our borders? Are you concerned about \nillegal transshipment of textiles, import restrictions on steel and \nlumber, and backup of trucks at our borders? If you vote for extending \nfees, there will be no committee consideration if Customs is using the \nfees for these or other Congressional priorities.\n  I would like to tell you that extending these fees will definitely \nhave an impact on what we are able to do or not to do about \nmodernization of the Customs agency and its operations around the \nborders of our country, even in the interior of the country where we \nhave Customs operations.\n  I would like to read what the acting Customs Commissioner had to say \nabout this. He wrote on June 20, this year:\n\n       Any scoring which would limit in any way the ability to \n     fund or offset Customs activities would likely cause--\n\n  And it is highlighted--\n\n     a critical funding shortfall for the Customs Service.\n\n\n[[Page S7061]]\n\n\n  Experience a critical funding shortfall when you want to get in and \nout of Chicago with some Customs operations and people are complaining \nbecause it takes so long to get it done because of a shortage of \npersonnel and not having the technical equipment that ought to be there \nto help efficient operation. Then you know that maybe you made the \nwrong decision when you took $7 billion out of Customs to do this.\n  Also, I have a statement, which was submitted for the Record, from \nthe President himself, dated June 2001, clearly opposing section 502 of \nthe bill.\n  I would like to raise one other issue, and that is it is not at all \nclear that using Customs user fees to offset revenue is consistent with \nthe World Trade Organization rules.\n  Think about that. We are making a decision to take $7 billion out of \nCustoms user fees under the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, and we may be doing this in a way that does not meet our \nobligation under the World Trade Organization. Under that organization, \nCustoms fees are to be used as payments for Customs services, not as a \nsource of general revenue to the Federal Government.\n  In a sense, as we would say to our constituents back home, you pay a \ngas tax, and we use the gas tax for transportation, to build highways. \nWhen people pay Customs fees, they pay those Customs fees for \nfacilitating entry of product into the country and the policing of that \nentry of product into the country. A fee levied for a certain purpose \nought to be used for that purpose or it might violate the WTO because \nit should not be a source of general revenue any more than taking money \nfrom the gas tax and putting it into the general fund of the United \nStates.\n  Here is what the Customs Service writes on this issue.\n\n       The merchandise processing fee is a fee that is paid by \n     importers for the processing of merchandise by the Customs \n     Service. Directing the funds collected from the fee for \n     something other than Customs' operations could pose GATT \n     interpretation issues.\n\n  While it is not clear that a WTO case would arise or that a challenge \nwould be successful, it seems to me that this is a warning bell that \nshould certainly be heard.\n\n  No Senator should vote against this motion to strike unless they are \nprepared to face the possibility of a WTO challenge and take \nresponsibility accordingly.\n  We should strike this provision from the bill. Before blindly \nsupporting section 502, we should have time to consider its broader \nimplications.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to strike.\n  Turning to the other provision of their bill that my amendment \nstrikes, section 503, that would delay payments to Medicare contractors \nby one day thereby shifting $235 million in Medicare part B spending \nfrom fiscal year 2002 to fiscal year 2003 is simply a budget gimmick.\n  I am troubled by this provision because it comes within the \njurisdiction of the Senate Finance Committee and also because we are \ntrying to work to make Medicare a better program, not do things to harm \nit.\n  First, I point out to my colleagues that, again, the Finance \nCommittee has jurisdiction, not the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions. It is the Finance Committee that authorizes and \noverseas the Medicare Program and the Federal agency that runs it, now \nknown as the Center for Medicare Services.\n  It is the Finance Committee and not the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee that is in the best position to know how changes in \nthe Medicare Program, such as this one-day payment delay in section 503 \nof this bill that will affect our senior citizens, will affect our \nhealth care providers and will affect the integrity of the Medicare \ntrust fund.\n  With all due respect, when it comes to Medicare and Medicaid and \nother Federal entitlement programs, it seems terribly ridiculous to \nignore the committee that has the very expertise in these programs, \nmeaning the Senate Finance Committee.\n  The second reason that I am proposing to strike the Medicare payment \ndelay in section 503 of the bill is that the delay itself, which may \nnot seem serious to some, could actually have consequences for Medicare \ncontractors and providers.\n  Delaying payments by one day and moving them into the next fiscal \nyear just to finance this bill is fuzzy math, to say the least. But it \nunfairly subjects the already fragile Medicare Program and its health \ncare contractors to accounting disruptions and to administrative \nuncertainties.\n  Medicare providers already have it hard enough just dealing with the \nMedicare Program in the first place. They are overwhelmed by paperwork, \nconfused by conflicting regulations, and frequently left hearing that \n``the check is in the mail.''\n  Can you imagine the Federal Government saying ``the check is in the \nmail'' when it comes to timely payments of their reimbursements?\n  Subjecting those providers to any additional delay, even if just for \na short period of time, is simply unfair. We need to make it easier for \nproviders to do business with Medicare.\n  Think about it. No one wants to do business with late payers, and \nhealth care providers are no exception.\n  Think about it for a minute. No one wants to do business with late \npayers, and health care providers are no exception. We should not be \ngiving Medicare an additional opportunity to delay for one minute--let \nalone a longer period of time--their obligations to promptly pay \nproviders.\n\n  For the last 3 months, Senator Baucus and I have been working hard to \ndevelop a Medicare reform proposal that strengthens and improves the \nprogram by adding prescription drug coverage and making the entire \nbenefit package more modern.\n  Part of this bipartisan effort also includes an initiative to make \nMedicare more responsive and accountable to both seniors and providers. \nWe want to send a message to providers that they will be treated fairly \nand professionally by Medicare.\n  Unfortunately, the delay provision in section 503 does exactly the \nopposite. It sends an entirely wrong message and undercuts our \nbipartisan effort to make Medicare a better business partner for \ntoday's providers.\n  For these reasons, I cannot support the inclusion of section 503 in \nthis bill. Neither 502 nor 503 belong in this bill. They are both \noutside the jurisdiction of the Health, Education, Labor Committee and \na long way away from the subject of this debate, which is patients' \nrights. Both sections should be stricken from this bill entirely.\n  Consequently, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will take just a few moments of the \nSenate's time.\n  The fact is, this provision, as stated on page 179, does not even go \ninto effect until the year 2003. There is plenty of time for the \nFinance Committee to work it out if this isn't a satisfactory way of \ndealing with this issue. It is basically a bookkeeping issue. There is \na judgment that is made by CBO that the value of a wage package is \n``X,'' and if you are going to guarantee additional kinds of benefits \nin terms of health care, then the wages are going to go down, which is \ngoing to mean less money in terms of Social Security.\n  This is actually a balance from the Budget Committee's point of view \nto make sure that the bookkeeping will be balanced.\n  Tomorrow, we will hear from the chairman of the Budget Committee who \nwill describe this and, at the appropriate time, make the point of \norder.\n  I point out, though, it is my understanding that this has no impact \nor effect on the Customs Service. They will still receive the money. If \nthey want to go through with their modernization, they will still be \nable to do that. But it basically ensures that this is going to conform \nto the budget consideration. That is the reason that this was put in \nthere. There will be sufficient time for the Finance Committee to make \nany other kinds of adjustments and changes.\n  To make it very clear, the resources that are collected in this are \nnot to pay for the bill. It is basically a bookkeeping offset to what \nwill be anticipated to be the shortfall in terms of the payments under \nthe CBO estimate of the wage package because of the enhanced value, \nwhich I think ought to\n\n[[Page S7062]]\n\nbe encouraging for workers of their health benefits. So we will hear \nmore from the Budget Committee tomorrow. At that time, the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee will make a further comment, speaking for the \nBudget Committee. They are in support of our position.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Is the Senator yielding back his time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to yield back the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts yields back the \nremaining time on the Grassley amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that this amendment and all \namendments that have the yeas and nays ordered tonight be stacked for a \nvote tomorrow morning, with the appropriate time of 2 minutes to each \nside, or whatever is agreed to, before each amendment is voted on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, at this time I would like to outline the \nremainder of the evening, if acceptable to the parties, relative to our \nside, which would be that Senator Santorum would go next with his \namendment. He would have 10 minutes; the Senator from California, Mrs. \nBoxer, would have 10 minutes. Then we would go to Senator Nickles. He \nwould have 10 minutes; and 10 minutes to whoever is in opposition. \nSenator Brownback would come next. He would have an hour divided, as is \ntraditional. And Senator Ensign would then follow with two amendments, \nthe physician pro bono amendment and the genetic discrimination testing \namendment.\n  I believe the Democratic membership has all these amendments. I would \nhope we could also agree there would be no second degrees.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Ensign amendment we have just received. I have no \nobjection to the earlier request. I am sure we will agree with this, \nbut we would like for that, as far as it being locked in in terms of no \nsecond-degree amendments, just to have an opportunity to----\n  Mr. GREGG. I would reserve my request on the second degrees relative \nto the Ensign amendments but ask unanimous consent that the unanimous \nconsent agreement include that there be no second degrees on DeWine, \nGrassley, Nickles, Santorum, or Brownback.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 814\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I have amendment No. 814 at the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum], for himself, \n     Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, and Mr. DeWine, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 814.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n            (Purpose: To protect infants who are born alive)\n\n       On page 179, after line 14, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. DEFINITION OF BORN-ALIVE INFANT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 1 of title 1, United States Code, \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 8. `Person', `human being', `child', and `individual' \n       as including born-alive infant\n\n       ``(a) In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or \n     of any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of the various \n     administrative bureaus and agencies of the United States, the \n     words `person', `human being', `child', and `individual', \n     shall include every infant member of the species homo sapiens \n     who is born alive at any stage of development.\n       ``(b) As used in this section, the term `born alive', with \n     respect to a member of the species homo sapiens, means the \n     complete expulsion or extraction from his or her mother of \n     that member, at any stage of development, who after such \n     expulsion or extraction breathes or has a beating heart, \n     pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of \n     voluntary muscles, regardless of whether the umbilical cord \n     has been cut, and regardless of whether the expulsion or \n     extraction occurs as a result of natural or induced labor, \n     caesarean section, or induced abortion.\n       ``(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affirm, \n     deny, expand, or contract any legal status or legal right \n     applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any \n     point prior to being born alive as defined in this \n     section.''.\n       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the \n     beginning of chapter 1 of title 1, United States Code, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new item:\n\n``8. `Person', `human being', `child', and `individual' as including \n              born-alive infant.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the unanimous consent agreement, the \nSenator from Pennsylvania is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, this is an amendment that I think really \ngoes to the heart of this bill: Patient protection. This bill is \npurported to deal with trying to take care of patients. What this \namendment does is make sure that every living human being is protected \nby this act as well as all other acts of Congress.\n  This is a very simple amendment that says--I am quoting from the \namendment--\n\n       In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or of \n     any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of the various \n     administrative bureaus and agencies of the United States, the \n     words ``person'', ``human being'', ``child'', and \n     ``individual'', shall include every infant member of the \n     species homo sapiens who is born alive at any stage of \n     development.\n\n  That is a rather simple amendment. Obviously, I think it is an \namendment that should be broadly accepted.\n  The reason I offer this amendment is really twofold. No. 1 is the \nconcern about how certain little children--little infants--are treated, \nparticularly those who are born alive after an abortion, an abortion \nthat was not successful in the sense that the child was not killed \nbefore the child was delivered outside of the mother's womb.\n  So what we want to do is make sure those children in particular, as \nwell as others, are treated with the same dignity and are covered by \nthe same laws as all other people in America.\n  There are, unfortunately, many disturbing examples of how these \nlittle children are not treated the same and not given the proper care \nand, frankly, the proper respect that is required under the laws that \nwe have passed in this Congress.\n  I am going to use a couple of examples that were given by nurses in \ncongressional testimony.\n  Last year, we had testimony from Allison Baker, who is a registered \nnurse, who witnessed three induced abortion survivor incidents. For one \nof them, she says:\n\n       I happened to walk into a ``soiled utility room'' and saw, \n     lying on the metal counter, a fetus, naked, exposed and \n     breathing, moving its arms and legs. The fetus was visibly \n     alive, and was gasping for breath. I left to find the nurse \n     who was caring for the patient and this fetus. When I asked \n     her about the fetus, she said that she was so busy with the \n     mother that she didn't have time to wrap and place the [baby] \n     in the warmer, and she asked if I would do that for her. \n     Later I found out that the fetus was 22 weeks old, and had \n     undergone a therapeutic abortion because it had been \n     diagnosed with Down's Syndrome. I did wrap the fetus and \n     place him in a warmer and for 2\\1/2\\ hours he maintained a \n     heartbeat, and then finally expired.\n\n  The second incident involved a 20-week-old fetus with spina bifida \nwho lived for an hour and 40 minutes until she died.\n  She continued:\n\n       The third case occurred when a nurse with whom I was \n     working was taking care of a mother waiting to deliver her 16 \n     week Down's Syndrome fetus. Again, I walked into the soiled \n     utility room and the fetus was fully exposed, lying on the \n     baby scale. I went to find the nurse who was caring for this \n     mother and fetus, and she asked if I could help her by \n     measuring and weighing the fetus for the charting and death \n     certificate. When I went back into the soiled utility room, \n     the fetus was moving its arms and legs. I then listened for a \n     heartbeat, and found that the fetus still was alive. I \n     wrapped the fetus and in 45 minutes the fetus finally \n     expired.\n\n  We have other stories, disturbing stories of cases where children \nwere born alive and basically discarded as trash in soiled utility \nclosets or laying on tables fully exposed at a very tender age.\n  This is a story from Jill Stanek, another registered nurse:\n\n\n[[Page S7063]]\n\n\n       One night, a nursing co-worker was taking an aborted Down's \n     Syndrome baby who was born alive to our Soiled Utility Room \n     because his parents did not want to hold him, and she did not \n     have time to hold him. I couldn't bear the thought of this \n     suffering child lying alone in a Soiled Utility Room, so I \n     cradled and rocked him for the 45 minutes that he lived. He \n     was 21 to 22 weeks old, weighed about \\1/2\\ pound, and was \n     about 10 inches long. He was too weak to move and very much \n     expending any energy he had to breathe.\n\n  This is the current problem, and this is the reason we are \nintroducing this legislation. Frankly, I have concerns that this may be \neven more of a problem in the future based on court decisions. The \ncourt decision I refer to is the recent decision by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt in the Nebraska partial-birth case. In that case, in a concurring \nopinion, two Justices said two things: One, Justice Stevens with \nJustice Ginsburg concurring, and the other, Justice Ginsburg with \nJustice Stevens concurring. I am going to quote two things that should \nsend a chill down the spines of people here when it comes to what the \nfuture could have in store for us if we do not pass legislation such as \nthis.\n  This is what Justice Stevens said in this decision:\n\n       The holding [of Roe]--that the word ``liberty'' in the 14th \n     Amendment includes a woman's right to make this difficult and \n     extremely personal decision--makes it impossible for me to \n     understand how a State has any legitimate interest in \n     requiring a doctor to follow any procedure other than the one \n     he or she reasonably believes will best protect the woman in \n     her exercise of this constitutional liberty.\n       For the notion that either of these two equally gruesome \n     [abortion] procedures performed at this late stage of \n     gestation is more akin to infanticide than the other, or that \n     the State furthers any legitimate interest by banning one or \n     not the other, is simply irrational.\n\n  What that says very clearly is, according to these two Justices, that \nany procedure that the doctor determines is in the best ``health \ninterest of the mother'' can be used without question. So if the doctor \nbelieves the best way to safely perform this abortion is to deliver a \nlive baby and then subsequently kill it because it is the safest way \nfor the mother's health to have that done, under this rationale, under \nthis reasoning, that would be legitimate. I think we have to make it \nvery clear that that is not legitimate; that after delivering a baby, \nonce the baby is outside the mother, it is no longer legitimate to \nconsider that child just a piece of property to be disposed of, or \nmassive cells to be disposed of when it is a living, breathing \nindividual.\n  Justice Ginsburg's opinion says the following:\n\n       Such an obstacle [to abortion] exists if the State stops a \n     woman from choosing the procedure her doctor ``reasonably \n     believes will protect the woman in [the] exercise of [her] \n     constitutional liberty.''\n\n  Again, it is an open door to whatever procedure the doctor wants to \nuse, irrespective of the baby, which again leaves the door open \ncertainly for the doctor to say that he or she reasonably believes that \nthe mother's health will be served if the baby is delivered and then \nkilled because that is the safest way. This was not the majority \nopinion, thankfully, of the Court, but it does show that there is a \npossibility, at least, out there for this kind of ruling within our \ncourt systems at the highest level, much less what some district or \nappellate court might do.\n  I think it is important for us to clearly draw the line, if that is \ncalled drawing the line, that once a child is born, it is no longer a \nhealth threat to the mother, and that we have a legitimate interest in \nprotecting this child from being killed at that point or, shall we say, \ntreat that child within the context of the law as we would treat any \nother child or any other person in America.\n  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, my colleague, in his discussion of this \namendment, does attack the landmark case of Roe v. Wade which simply \nsaid, in the 1970s--and women have had the right since then--that in \nthe early stages of a pregnancy, the government should play no role in \nthe very personal, private, moral decision that a woman and her family \nand her doctor and her God would make without the interference of \ngovernment. But his amendment certainly does not attack Roe in any way.\n  His amendment makes it very clear that nothing in this amendment \ngives any rights that are not yet afforded to a fetus. Therefore, I, as \nbeing a pro-choice Senator on this side, representing my colleagues \nhere, have no problem whatsoever with this amendment. I feel good about \nthat. I feel good that we can, in fact, vote for this together. It is \nvery rare that we can.\n  Simply put, this amendment says it all in its purpose: ``To protect \ninfants who are born alive.'' Of course, of course. My colleague goes \non to say that simple statement, which is very important, is in fact, \nhe said, the heart of this bill. I think the heart of this bill is even \nmore than that. The heart of this bill is, yes, protecting infants; it \nis also protecting children, protecting teenagers, protecting people as \nthey get older, until they are very old and very frail and are fighting \nfor their life.\n  So this bill really should protect us all at every stage of our life, \nfrom the earliest days until the final days. I hope that my colleague \nwill join with us in supporting this Patients' Bill of Rights because \nit does, in fact, protect all of us. And it will, in fact, give all of \nus at any stage, at any age, the quality health care that we need.\n  I can tell my friend, and I think I have mentioned it to him before \nand on the floor before, that I gave birth to two premature babies, one \nquite premature. And I can say right here and now that I will never, \never forget the experience of those doctors. This was a long time ago, \nI say to my friend; this was way back. Now my kids are taking care of \nme. And the doctor came in and grabbed my firstborn son and, before \nthey could even take a cloth to clean him, ran him into the incubator \nwhere he had to stay for 1 month. Had I not had that kind of dedication \nfrom a pediatrician, that kind of concern, a hospital that knew at that \ntime we didn't have the money to pay the $1,000 a day that it costs--\nnow it is way more than that--I don't know if today I would have a \nbeautiful healthy son who is married and the pride of our lives.\n  My daughter was also born premature, a similar circumstance, same \nthing:--dedicated people, dedicated hospital, quality care.\n  I join in voting for this amendment, with the understanding that all \nof us at every stage of our life deserve that kind of quality care. In \nother words, if my friend were to expand it and say every human being \ndeserves quality health care, deserves, when they are in the hospital, \nto be protected, I would join with him as well. That is what I think \nthe larger bill does do.\n  He believes it is necessary to single out infants. Fine. That is \nfine.\n  Again, I say to my friend in the chair that we will be voting for \nthis amendment, I hope unanimously. If we have to have a recorded vote, \nthat is fine. And we will state that we feel very strongly that every \nperson deserves protection from this health care system and that this \nPatients' Bill of Rights should give us all the care that we deserve \nand all the care our families deserve, regardless of whether we are a \nhelpless newborn baby or whether we are an elderly person who is \nfighting and struggling against illness.\n  If 100 people vote for this amendment, which I think will be the \ncase, then 100 people should vote for the Patients' Bill of Rights \nbecause it will afford the families of those vulnerable infants and all \nof us the protections that we need against HMOs that oftentimes put \ndollar signs ahead of our vital signs. That is wrong to do. Some of \nthese babies are born into families who don't have a lot of money, who \ndon't have a lot of power, who are going against HMOs where the CEO \nmakes hundreds of millions of dollars. But they say: Gee, we are not \ngoing to give that little baby the care he needs.\n  I had a case I talked about on the floor where a child was denied a \nmedicine. She was 3 years old and had cancer. It was $54 for the \nmedicine and the HMO denied that medicine. That child suffered so with \nnausea and all the rest, while the head of that HMO, because of a huge \nmerger--and I asked my staff to check this because I could hardly \nbelieve it--made $800 million in the course of that merger. But they \ndenied a drug to a little baby suffering from cancer--$54.\n\n  I heard my colleagues on the other side--some of them against this \nbill--\n\n[[Page S7064]]\n\nsay: We can't legislate by anecdote. Well, I have to tell you, when you \nhear one story, and then another and another, from people you never \nheard of, and you hold hearings and the people come out and tell the \nstories, then we know there is a need to pass this Patients' Bill of \nRights. So I would vote for this to protect the infants, and then I \nwill vote to protect everyone in this country because everyone deserves \nprotection from HMOs who put their bottom line ahead of people's \nhealth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Feinstein). The Senator from \nMassachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I am going to urge the Senate to accept \nthe amendment tomorrow. I think we have had a good discussion about it. \nI hope that we will move ahead and accept it. I am prepared, when the \nSenators yield the time or use the time, to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I thank the Senator from California \nfor her comments and support of this amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 846\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles], for himself and \n     Mr. Ensign, proposes an amendment numbered 846.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To apply the bill to plans maintained pursuant to collective \n     bargaining agreements beginning on the general effective date)\n\n       Beginning on page 173, strike line 19 and all that follows \n     through line 14 on page 174, and insert the following:\n       (2) Treatment of collective bargaining agreements.--The \n     amendments made by sections 201(a), 301, 302, and 303 (and \n     title I insofar as it relates to such sections) shall apply \n     to group health plans maintained pursuant to one or more \n     collective bargaining agreements between employee \n     representatives and one or more employers beginning on the \n     general effective date.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will be brief. I hope this amendment \ncan be agreed to. In the underlying bill on page 173, it has \n``effective dates'' for implementation of the legislation. The \neffective date for everybody, all plans in America, is by October 1, \n2002. So that is when all the plans in America will have to comply with \nthis bill. They will have to have the patient protections in line, the \nappeals process, the liability sections--all are mandated to be \neffective by October 1 next year. That is about 14 months from now.\n  If you continue reading on page 173, you find out that the plans that \nare covered by collective bargaining agreements are exempt. They are \nexempt from the legislation. It says they ``shall not apply to plan \nyears beginning before the later of--(A) the date on which the last \ncollective bargaining agreements relating to the plan terminates.''\n  Some of these plans may not terminate for months. Some may not \nterminate for years. As a matter of fact, looking at a couple of \nexamples, one is the Plumbers and Pipefitters Union, with 2,200 \nemployees, has a 128-month contract. It doesn't expire until 2010. The \nInternational Union of Electric Workers, with 1,800 employees, has a \n148-month contract that doesn't expire until the year 2007. I could go \non and on. There are lots of examples.\n  The point is that there are about 30 million lives that would be \nexempt from this bill for years. If we are going to make it apply to \neverybody else in the private sector, I think we should make it apply \nfor collective bargaining plans as well.\n  There is also something else that is troubling to me. It says it \nwould not apply until the plan terminates, and then the language says \nif they adopt these patient protections, that still doesn't count as a \nplan termination, a collective bargaining agreement termination. So, in \neffect, even though a plan adopts it, it hasn't terminated and, \ntherefore, it is still not covered or enforced by the terms of this \nbill. I find that troubling. I also am troubled by the fact that when \nit says ``relating to the plan terminates,'' a lot of plans or \ncontracts don't terminate. They are renegotiated. So they never get to \ntermination. They are actually renegotiated and extended. That is well \nand good. That means there is peace and harmony and no labor shortages \nand so on.\n  My point is that it is very important for us not to be exempting 30 \nmillion workers who happen to be in collective bargaining agreements \nfrom the protections in these plans. If we are going to give these \nprotections to 170 million workers in the private sector, in that 170 \nmillion are included 30 million who happen to be members of a \ncollective bargaining agreement. They should have the patient \nprotections that Congress is in the process of determining which are so \nvital for everybody else in the private sector. They should not be \nexempt because they happen to be members of the collective bargaining \nunit. We are asking every other plan in America to comply by October 1. \nWhy would we not ask members of collective bargaining agreements to \nalso comply? Why should we have them have different expiration dates, \nsome of which might be 5, 10 years, or even longer?\n  Maybe this is an oversight, a mistake from a previous drafting; but, \nclearly, if these are such valued protections that we want to extend \nthem to the private sector, we should certainly extend them to members \nof collective bargaining agreements as well.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Madam President, I direct my colleagues' attention to the lines 15 \nand 16 on page 173. They talk about ``for plan years.'' That is an art \nof words that applies to insurance companies, and it says, ``beginning \non or after'' plan years. As we know, the insurance starts generally at \nthe first of every year. So with regard to insurance companies, the \nSenator is completely wrong. This does not apply for insurance \ncompanies because there are existing contracts.\n  We have heard a great deal in this debate about the sanctity of the \nHMO contract and how we are not going to permit--in terms of the \nstandards for the treatment of patients--they are going to be tied \ncompletely to the contract. I don't know how many hours I listened to \nthat. Now we see that we are respecting the contract in insurance and \nwe expect the same--to respect the contract in terms of collective \nbargaining. It is simple as that.\n  This is boilerplate, Madam President. We did this in the HIPAA \nprogram, and there was no row about it at that time. People understood. \nThere was a normal transition, and we didn't have objections at that \nparticular time. So that is what we have done here. There are existing \ncontracts in insurance, and we take it to the next time when the \ninsurance plans are going to be implemented. There are existing \ncollective bargaining agreements. We are going to take it at the next \ntime when they are going to be renegotiated because of the respect for \nthe existing contracts.\n  So what is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander, Madam \nPresident, particularly when we are listening to so much about the \nimportance of contracts and that we ought not interfere with them, even \nif it is going to be as a matter of medical necessity, and that we are \ngoing to be bound by them because they are so important and sacred. \nThere is a sanctity of the contracts.\n  I listened to that for 5 hours, and now we find out in the final \nhours of this that, oh no, that is not true regarding collective \nbargaining. We are going to interfere with ongoing collective \nbargaining agreements. That just doesn't make sense. This is what we \nhave done at other times. It says insurance, generally, at the start of \na year--some are longer and they will be respected in that way just as \nwe do regarding collective bargaining. I hope this amendment will not \nbe accepted.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I appreciate my colleague's statement,\n\n[[Page S7065]]\n\nbut I totally disagree. Some of us have argued for contract sanctity, \nbut we haven't been totally successful, I might add. Almost all those \ncontracts would begin, if not by October 1, certainly by January 1 of \nthe year 2003. So maybe there are a few more months. But under \ncollective bargaining agreements, if you read the language on page 174, \nit is not until the contract or the agreement terminates. And then the \nsecond part of it says that even if they comply, it shall not count as \na termination.\n  You could have collective bargaining agreements exempt under this \nprovision indefinitely for 12 years. They may never terminate the \nagreement. They may continue rolling it over, so it is never \nterminated. It might be readjusted; it might be renegotiated; but it is \nnever terminated. Are we going to take 30 million Americans and say: \nYou are not covered by these patient protections?\n  Some of these contracts will last 10 years, 15 years. The average \ncontract I was looking at had a schedule of 5 to 6 years. One I \nmentioned does not expire until the year 2010. If they renegotiate it \nbetween now and next year, the duration of the contract will be exempt. \nWe are telling everybody else in the private sector: Get your act in \norder, and by the end of next year you have to have these new patient \nprotections, oh, unless you are a member of a collective bargaining \nagreement.\n  This is not the only exemption we found. We did not cover Federal \nemployees. Maybe I will have an amendment dealing with Federal \nemployees. All these great patient protections do not apply to Federal \nemployees. They do not apply to Medicare. They do not apply to Indians \nin our hospitals. They do not apply to veterans.\n  These are patient protections that are so important for the country, \nbut we do not give them to publicly funded plans; we only do it for \nprivate sector plans.\n  What about unfunded mandates? What about union plans, collective \nbargaining? We leave them out. We leave out Government plans; we leave \nout union plans; but it is fine we are going to hit the private sector. \nUnions, this does not apply for the duration of your collective \nbargaining agreement, and if it does not terminate, you are never \ncovered.\n  I think that is a serious mistake, so I urge my colleagues to support \nthe amendment.\n  I thank my friend and colleague from Nevada for his support of the \namendment as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, the Senator ought to read page 174 \nbecause this language is very clear, precise, and exact. It does not \npermit what he just said it permitted, and that is the rollovers. It \njust does not permit it.\n  The Senator can state it, and he can misrepresent it, which he just \nhas, but it is not the fact. On line 5, it says: ``relating to the plan \nterminates,'' and that is when it ends. That is when it has to be \nimplemented.\n  This idea that it can roll over and over, for 10, 15 years, is not \nwhat the legislation says. The fact is, with insurance, many start in \nJanuary, many others start in July. We have tried to say when that \ncontract plan year, which is a term of art that refers to when that \ninsurance transitions, we will implement it at that time, and the same \nshould be true with the collective bargaining agreements.\n  I would think the overwhelming majority of the workers and employers \nwould be eager to get these protections. We are going to find out many \nwill work out arrangements so they get the protections even earlier.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield to the Senator from Nevada such time as he \ndesires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I have a story that was told by the \njunior Senator from North Dakota on the Senate floor the other day. It \nis about a young man, Christopher Thomas Roe, who is from Nevada. He \nwas attending Durango High School and was diagnosed with acute \nlymphocytic leukemia. As anybody who has had a child with that terrible \ndisease knows, sometimes the treatments are not very successful.\n  During the course of his treatment, the doctors were recommending a \ncertain type of experimental treatment, and as we have heard throughout \nthis bill, sometimes that experimental treatment has to be had at a \ncertain time of treatment, and waiting for its approval sometimes leads \nto that treatment not being able to be given to that patient. That is \nexactly what happened to Christopher Thomas Roe. He was not able to \nreceive this type of a treatment in a timely manner.\n  His father is a school district employee in the State of Nevada. He \nis not a teacher, but he is an employee of the school district. There \nis an employee trust fund that has been set up to provide health \ninsurance to school district employees. Based on our discussions with \nthe Department of Labor, this trust fund, because of the way it was set \nup, would not be covered under the provisions of this bill.\n  Similarly, the 30 million people Senator Nickles is talking about who \ndeal with collective bargaining agreements are not covered adequately \nunder this bill. If we are going to say to other people that they \ndeserve these rights, we believe that people who are in unions deserve \nthe same patient protections.\n  These patient protections right now do not just deal with lawsuits, \nthey deal with provisions that everybody agrees with in the bill: The \nright of a woman to choose an OB/GYN as her primary doctor; the right \nof a family to say their children's primary care doctor is a \npediatrician; the right to a reasonable layman's interpretation of \nwhether emergency room care should be paid for when they have an \nemergency.\n  These patient protections we believe are very important to give not \nonly to the 170 million people who are covered by the underlying bill, \nbut also those who are covered in collective bargaining agreements.\n  If there is tweaking of the language that needs to happen with this \namendment, then let's tweak the language. The bottom line is this is \nnot an anti-union agreement. This amendment says we want union workers \nto have the same rights as other people.\n  I would think the other side of the aisle, who are generally in favor \nof union workers, would be on our side on this amendment. If the other \nside thinks this amendment needs a little tweaking, maybe we can do \nthat, but right now as we read the bill, as we have had some of the \nlegal experts look at the bill, collective bargaining agreements would \nsupersede and not allow union workers who are covered under those \ncollective bargaining agreements to be covered under this Patients' \nBill of Rights.\n  I urge our colleagues to work with us and to make sure those union \nworkers get the same protections as other people in America are going \nto receive.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I did not understand, did the Senator say that public \nemployees were not covered? Does he understand that to be the case?\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator is correct. Federal employees are not \ncovered by the underlying McCain-Kennedy bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I understand he was talking about teachers in Nevada; \npublic employees is the example he gave. I find this enormously \ninteresting because both Senators voted for the Collins amendment that \nexcluded 139 million Americans. They only included 56 million. They \nwere going to have the protections. The others were going to be \ndependent upon whether the States actually moved ahead and passed the \nvarious protections.\n  One of the groups that was left out of the Collins amendment was \npublic employees, such as firefighters, schoolteachers, and others. We \nresisted that. No one has fought harder to make sure we are going to \nhave comprehensive coverage since day 1 of this program. Now we are \nbeing flyspecked because somehow there are some who, under certain \ncircumstances, are going to come into these protections on a different \ncalendar.\n  Madam President, we have tried to include people who are going to \nhave coverage from insurance. We are going\n\n[[Page S7066]]\n\nto respect the contract. When those insurance contracts expire, whether \nit is in January, whether in July, the protections go into effect. The \nsame is true of the collective bargaining agreement. We have done that \nin other times. It has worked, and worked effectively. As I say, I \nbelieve the consumers, as well as employers--the employers from whom we \nhave heard, and we have had many examples--indicate they cannot wait to \nget these protections in place. It isn't that people will delay getting \nin; it will be because they want to get in and get in more quickly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Leader time has expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Then I ask for 4, 2 each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. A couple comments. The average length of collective \nbargaining agreements: 66 percent of collective bargaining agreements \nwith over 1,000 employees--that is over 1,200 collective bargaining \nagreements--the average length is 3 to 5 years; 28 percent are 5 to 6 \nyears; an additional 7 percent are 6 to 8 years.\n  My point is these things last for years. People renegotiate their \nhealth care plan. Federal employees do this every year. Almost \neverybody does it every year. So for the health care plan for everybody \nelse in the private sector, you have to comply by next October, 12 \nmonths from now, maybe even January of next year; you will have to \ncomply. But if you are in a collective bargaining plan, you wait until \nthe plan terminates.\n  We asked the Department of Labor, does the plan terminate if \nrenegotiated and rolled over? Not necessarily.\n  In collective bargaining, you are talking about 30 million Americans \nwho will not receive the so-called benefits under this bill. That is a \nfact.\n  Another fact: My colleague said we supported an amendment by Senator \nCollins that said let the States use their State protections. I \nstrongly agree with that. That is a reason I will vote against the \nunderlying bill, because I don't think we should preempt States as the \nKennedy-McCain bill does. I believe in that strongly. I know my friends \nand colleague from Massachusetts have a different belief. We could \ndebate that for hours.\n\n  My point is, if the patient protections are so good--and I heard many \nsponsors say we should cover all Americans--the bill does not cover all \nAmericans. As a result of the language we have been debating, \ncollectively bargaining agreements are exempt for years. The bill we \nare debating now does not cover public plans; it does not cover \nMedicaid; it does not cover Medicare; it does not cover public \nemployees; it does not cover the military; it does not cover veterans; \nit does not cover Federal employees.\n  We have control over Federal employees. If the patient protections \nare so good for the private sector, why not for collective bargaining \nplans as well?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, it is interesting to listen to my \nfriend and colleague. The fact is, the last President, President \nClinton, put those in through Executive orders to cover those because \nof the delay of the Republican leadership in letting us get through \nthis bill over the last 5 years. So rather than wait and wait and wait, \nwe had a Democratic President put them into effect.\n  Now if a collective bargaining unit or contract expires on October 2, \nthey go in prior to the time of the insurance coverage. They will go in \nmonths ahead of the insurance. If the contract expires on October 5, \nthat goes in before July of the next year. So they get more protections \nthan those being covered by the insurance.\n  This is just a way of saying if the contracts are out there, we are \ngoing to respect the termination of those contracts, whether it is in \nthe insurance or in collective bargaining. Evidently, the Senator wants \nto use this as a device to punish some of their enemies, the unions in \nthis case, to try to use the legislative process to do so. I hope we \nwill reject that.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield myself 5 minutes off the leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my friend, Senator Brownback. I am the third \nSenator squeezed in front of him, and he has shown great patience. I \nwill be brief.\n  My colleague from Massachusetts said President Clinton gave these \nprotections to Federal employees because he couldn't wait for the \nRepublican Congress to pass them.\n  The facts are, Federal employees do not have patient protections that \nare nearly as expensive, as aggressive, as intrusive as we are getting \nready to impose on the rest of the private sector. I may have an \namendment tomorrow to address that so we can save that for tomorrow's \ndebate.\n  The patient protection that President Clinton passed is not nearly \nthis big. Federal employees cannot sue their employer. When they have \nan appeal process, they do not go to an independent party; they go to \nOPM, Office of Personnel Management; they go to their employer. We do \nnot do that in this bill. Maybe we will debate that tomorrow.\n  Finally, he said in collective bargaining plans, they have to be \ncovered when the plan terminates. My point is the plan can be \nrenegotiated. You are talking years. Sixty-six percent of collective \nbargaining plans are 3 to 5 years.\n  Then it says if they go ahead and implement it, it is not counted as \na plan termination; therefore, it is not effective. Let's give union \nmembers the same protections we give all other private sector \nemployees.\n  I thank my colleagues and my colleague from Massachusetts and \nparticularly my colleague from Kansas for his patience in allowing us \nto go forward.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am prepared to yield back the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 847\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I send an amendment to the desk for immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 847.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n        (Purpose: To prohibit human germline gene modification)\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n                TITLE--HUMAN-GERMLINE GENE MODIFICATION\n\n     SEC.   01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Human Germline Gene \n     Modification Prohibition Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC.   02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Human Germline gene modification is not needed to save \n     lives, or alleviate suffering, of existing people. Its target \n     population is ``prospective people'' who have not been \n     conceived.\n       (2) The cultural impact of treating humans as biologically \n     perfectible artifacts would be entirely negative. People who \n     fall short of some technically achievable ideal would be seen \n     as ``damaged goods'', while the standards for what is \n     genetically desirable will be those of the society's \n     economically and politically dominant groups. This will only \n     increase prejudices and discrimination in a society where too \n     many such prejudices already exist.\n       (3) There is no way to be accountable to those in future \n     generations who are harmed or stigmatized by wrongful or \n     unsuccessful human germline modifications of themselves or \n     their ancestors.\n       (4) The negative effects of human germline manipulation \n     would not be fully known for generations, if ever, meaning \n     that countless people will have been exposed to harm probably \n     often fatal as the result of only a few instances of germline \n     manipulations.\n       (5) All people have the right to have been conceived, \n     gestated, and born without genetic manipulation.\n\n     SEC.   03.

Madam President, I rise today to offer an amendment to \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights. This amendment is about human germline \ngene modification. That is a long way of saying--and I will go into \nthis for a period of time--stopping people from attempting to modify \nthe human species with outside genetic material. It may seem strange. \nIt happens in livestock, genetically modified organisms. Some people \nare researching and discussing doing this within the human species to \ncreate better people. I think it should be stopped, prohibited, \nremoved.\n  I looked for a better vehicle for this amendment, for another bill \nthat was a closer fit. It is a medical issue on the medical front. If \nwe get an agreement that I get a freestanding bill, I will do it that \nway. Having not been able to do that, we offer it as an amendment now.\n  My amendment prohibits human germline gene modification. What is \nthat? Technically, it is the process by which the DNA of an individual \nis permanently changed in such a way that it permanently affects his or \nher offspring. Normally this is a DNA modification in either the egg or \nthe sperm within the human species, so when they combine, that genetic \nmodification is carried in that person and in future organisms, in \nfuture people. So it starts at this single stage, the egg or the sperm, \nmolded together and multiplied in future generations.\n  This is not about genetic therapy; it is not about stem cell \nresearch; it is not about human cloning. All those are other issues for \nanother day that do need to be considered but not here. My amendment in \nno way hinders genetic therapy or other medical interventions that \ntreat patients suffering from diseases.\n  My amendment is about eugenics. For those not familiar, that is the \nprocess or means of race improvement previously tried by many \ndiabolical methods or schemes, generally looked at as restrictions of \nmating, of so-called superior people together, and now being attempted, \ntalked about, pressed forward by adding genetic material of humans from \noutside the species.\n  This is ugly stuff, and it should be stopped. It is about what we as \na society are willing to allow and not to allow. The issue of germline \ngenetic modification is about our ability to create designer babies, \nchoose eye color, height, or IQ. I offer this amendment, well aware \nthat many of my colleagues understandably may be unaware of these so-\ncalled advances being made in the field of biotechnology and the impact \nthose advances will inevitably have on the human race.\n  I come from an agricultural background. I used to be a Secretary of \nAgriculture in Kansas. These are things we commonly do now in plants, \nand we are having research done extensively in animals. People are \ntalking about bringing some of the same technology to humans. It has to \nbe stopped and should be stopped.\n  Many of the advances promise great achievement for mankind and a \nbetterment of human conditions. Some of the advancements in \nbiotechnology do not. Human germline gene manipulation is one of those. \nIt is one of those advances discussed mostly in theoretical terms until \nrecently. More disturbingly, it is the realization of the age-old quest \nto design better people. Germline gene manipulation is the summit of \nthe eugenics movement. One of the groups we have consulted with prior \nto preparing this amendment is a group chaired by Claire Nader, the \nsister of former Presidential candidate Ralph Nader. It is a group she \nhas been associated with, the Council for Responsible Genetics. They \nare unequivocally opposed to human germline gene modification.\n  The Council states this:\n\n       We strongly oppose the use of germline gene modifications \n     in humans.\n\n  They continue:\n\n       Today, public discussion in favor of influencing the \n     genetic constitution of future generations has gained new \n     respectability with the increased possibility for \n     intervention. Although it is once again espoused by \n     individuals with a variety of political perspectives, modern \n     eugenic programs are now defended as driven by individual \n     need, choice. But the doctrine of social advancement through \n     biological perfectibility underlying the new eugenics is even \n     more potent than the older version. Its supporting data seem \n     more scientifically sophisticated and the alignment between \n     the state, through its support of the market and the \n     individual exercising so-called free choice, is \n     unprecedented.\n\n  The Council goes on to state further:\n\n       These considerations make the social and ethical problems \n     raised by germline gene modification very different from \n     those raised by genetic manipulations, that target certain \n     nonreproductive deficiencies in organs of patients, again in \n     somatic cell gene modification.\n\n  As the Council states in very clear terms:\n\n       The underlying political philosophy of those who support \n     germline gene modification has been sanitized with new terms, \n     but is in reality the same old eugenic message with which the \n     20th century was deeply and direly afflicted. In numerous \n     conversations that I have had with Dr. Francis Collins, who \n     heads the National Human Genome Research Institute here in \n     Washington, who has had a fantastic report that was out last \n     year on the Human Genome Project, reported out a beautiful \n     array of the complexity of the genetic structure in each and \n     every one of our 10 trillion cells and if we printed out that \n     genetic structure and had it in front of us, it would be a \n     stack of paper 100 feet taller than the Washington monument.\n\n  We have talked about the beauty of the human genome and also talked \nabout the potential for problems in its manipulation, as that could be \ncarried onto future humans.\n  Madam President, human germline gene modification is not needed to \nsave lives or alleviate suffering of existing people. Its target \npopulation is prospective people who have not been conceived. The \ncultural impact of treating humans as biologically perfectible \nartifacts would be entirely negative. People who fall short of some \ntechnically achievable ideal would be seen as damaged goods, while the \nstandards for what is genetically desirable would be those of the \nsociety's economically and politically dominant group. We have heard \nthese themes before. This will only increase prejudices and \ndiscrimination in a society which already has too many of these.\n\n[[Page S7068]]\n\n  There is no way to be accountable to those in the future generations \nwho are going to be harmed or stigmatized by the wrongful or \nunsuccessful human germline gene modification of their ancestors. The \nnegative effects of human germline modification would not be fully \nknown for generations, if ever, meaning that countless people will have \nbeen exposed to harm, probably often fatal, as a result of only a few \ninstances of germline manipulations.\n  All people have the right to be conceived, gestated, and born without \ngenetic manipulation. Human germline gene manipulation will only serve \nto turn human beings into commodities with traits that are bought and \nsold, with attributes that are determined by technicians, and parents \nwho want to exert genetic tyranny over their offspring. This is a step \ntoo far. This is grossly unethical for it to happen. I urge the Senate \nto adopt my amendment to prohibit it once and for all.\n  Again I put forward, in layman's terms, what this is about. This is \nabout getting and adding outside genetic material into the human \nspecies, whether it be plant--tomato--or animal--chicken--from a tree \nsomewhere that a snippet of genetic material would be added in, at the \negg or the sperm level. Once added in there, when the union occurred it \nwould be in that human and also then passed on to future generations. \nThat is what we are talking about here. It is not about any sort of \ngene therapy or any of the other issues. It is not about cloning \neither, which is the identical replication. This is adding in the \noutside genetic material.\n  I think everybody would look at this and say that is not a road we \nwant to go down. Yet some people today are contemplating doing this.\n  I want to add a couple of other points. The European Council on \nBiomedics has stated its opposition to this human germline gene \nmodification. I think the civilized world really needs to step up right \nnow, before people get going and moving forward, saying: We could make \npeople taller. We could make people live longer by this modification. \nWe found a gene line in trees that we could put in earlier, to the \nhuman species, and cause this to happen. We have a way to manipulate or \nchange this--without knowing in any way down in future generations what \nthis impact is.\n  We can send a strong, clear signal at this point in time that we want \nnothing to do with this, that this is wrong, this is eugenics, this is \nthe height of eugenics, and it should not take place. The Europeans are \nmoving that way. We should as well as much of the rest of the civilized \nworld, and say we want no part of this, and we can do that with a \nclear, I hope unanimous, vote of the Senate, saying this is wrong.\n  I know people differ on some of these other biotechnology issues, \nsuch as cloning. That is left for another day. The language in this \nbill is clear, specific; it is easy to understand. We may have \ndifferences on some of the other issues we may get into over a period \nof time, but this is one, as I have searched around, where there is a \nbroad coalition, left and right, that says yes, this one should be \nbanned. That is why we worked closely with Ms. Nader's group, consulted \nwith biotechnology groups, who were saying: Yes, this is not a place we \nshould be going either. Here is a place we can stop this.\n  This is the only vehicle I could see where there was some connection \nbringing this up. If we could do it on a freestanding bill at some time \non the floor, I would be happy to do that, but absent that, I would \nlike to get this considered on this bill.\n  I yield the floor. I don't know that there is a time agreement on \nthis amendment. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a time agreement. There is 1 hour \nevenly divided.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I want to express a great deal of \nrespect for my friend and colleague for his concern and interest in a \ngreat variety of different public policy issues, and also their ethical \nimplications. He studies these issues. He is concerned about them. He \nbrings them into the public debate and discussion. We always listen \nwith great interest to his presentations on these matters because he \nhas given this a great deal of thought.\n  Even so, I must rise to oppose this amendment. I can understand the \ngood Senator's frustration that we do not have a real opportunity to \nhave the kind of debate on a freestanding bill that could give the \nSenate the benefit of a good discussion on this issue. Unfortunately, \nwe are here at 20 minutes of 10. There are just a few of us here at \nthis time, and we will only have a few minutes tomorrow to deal with an \nissue of enormous importance and consequence.\n  Millions of American children are born with deadly diseases such as \ncystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy that result from flaws in the \nDNA code. One of the most promising ways to cure these afflictions is \nto correct these DNA errors using gene therapy. If these flaws could be \ncorrected before birth, millions of children could live their entire \nlives free of the debilitating symptoms of cruel genetic disorders.\n  Yet the Brownback amendment would ban any attempt to cure children of \ndeadly disorders such as cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy by \ncorrecting their DNA flaws before birth.\n  It even goes so far as to imprison doctors who try to save their \nlives and relieve their suffering.\n  The Brownback amendment is opposed by a wide range of organizations \nrepresenting patients, doctors, scientists, and the biotechnology \nindustry. They know this amendment would have a chilling effect on the \nbiomedical research that gives hope to millions of Americans at risk \nfor genetic diseases.\n  The amendment is so broad that it will criminalize several promising \nareas of biomedical research, even including gene therapy in adults.\n  This important, complex topic deserves a thoughtful and measured \nresponse, and not the indiscriminate prohibition that the Brownback \namendment proposes.\n  The American people do not support the sweeping prohibitions that the \nBrownback amendment would impose.\n  A recent study funded by the NIH conducted by the University of \nMichigan found that 65 percent of the public opposed a ban on prenatal \ngene therapy, and only one in five of those support such a ban.\n  There are great numbers of genetic diseases, and there are great \nnumbers of inherited diseases. Those that come to mind quickly are \ncystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy, Tay-Sachs, Cooley's disease, \nand many others in the cystic fibrosis area.\n  It is basically an issue involving a single gene. That is also true \nin muscular dystrophy.\n  Just think if we were able to get to the point where a parent would \nbe able to see the alteration of that gene so that the child that was \ngoing to be born would be free from muscular dystrophy or from cystic \nfibrosis by altering the DNA.\n  We can easily understand where the language that is included may not \nbe the purpose of the Senator, but certainly the language I think is \nsufficiently vague as to prohibit some promising research.\n  At this time, I think this is a matter of enormous importance. I \ndon't think we really ought to be dealing with this issue on this bill.\n  I can understand the Senator's frustration in not being able to have \nthe debate in the Senate and to hear the different views on this issue. \nBut I believe we ought to defeat the amendment for now, have additional \nreview and study and hearings, and that we ought to then consider the \nvarious public policy issues and the ethical issues that surround it.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I would like to ask the Senator a question. A couple of \nyears ago when I was chairman of the Democratic Policy Committee, one \nof the issues at the time was cloning, for lack of a better \ndescription. We had a luncheon at the Democratic Policy Committee. This \nmay not be directly in point, but it points up what the Senator is \nsaying. This is a very complex issue. We need more time and medical \nexpertise to respond to this.\n  But the Senator will remember that we had a hematology professor from \nHarvard. We had the leading expert on gene therapy at NIH. The Senator \nwill\n\n[[Page S7069]]\n\nrecall a number of things. The thing that is so vivid in my mind is the \nHarvard professor, who was of course a practicing physician, gave an \nexample of how progress is being made in the medical field and in the \nareas that need more study.\n  He said that a young woman with leukemia was referred to him. I do \nnot know the scientific name nor the type of leukemia. He did the \nexamination and looked at the information he had been given.\n  The Senator will recall that the doctor asked this young lady if she \nhad a brother or sister. She said no. He said that right then he knew \nshe was in big trouble. She probably couldn't make it and would die.\n  The next day, the Senator will recall, another teenager came in with \nleukemia. It was the same process. He asked this young man if he had a \nbrother or sister. He said no, and paused for a second. He said: I am a \ntwin. The doctor said that he knew right then that the young man was \ngoing to live as long as anybody in this room because they could do a \nbone marrow transplant and regenerate those cells.\n  I don't fully understand what the Senator from Kansas is advocating \nwith his amendment. I know he is candid and is well placed. I know \nafter having listened to the woman from NIH and the professor from \nHarvard that I have great hope progress is being made on some of the \nmost dreaded diseases that face especially children in America today.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts and I know how well-intentioned the \nSenator from Kansas is. I think we should defeat this amendment and \nwait for a later day so we can have more opportunity to examine this \nmore closely.\n  The Senator remembers that meeting in the room right down the hall \nhere?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I do remember. All of us as Members of this body get a \nchance to go out to NIH and visit with the researchers and listen, \nwatch, and hear about those extraordinary, dedicated men and women who \nare dealing with so much of the cutting edge research.\n  I think we want to make sure that we are very careful in the steps we \nare going to take that in some way would inhibit research. There are \nobviously strong ethical issues which we constantly have to examine and \nconsider.\n  But I am very much concerned about the kind of prohibition that this \ntype of amendment would include.\n  I want to make it clear that the amendment that the Senator from \nKansas puts forward does not ban cloning, but it would ban similar \ncutting edge research.\n  That is what our concern is and why we will oppose it tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I would like to correct some \nmiscalculation with the Senator from Massachusetts. I want to read from \nthe amendment because he represented a couple of examples that we \nspecifically state in the bill we are not prohibiting.\n  On page 4 of the amendment under ``construction,'' it states \nspecifically that:\n\n       Nothing in this Act is intended to limit somatic cell gene \n     therapy, or to effect research involving human pluripotent \n     stem cells.\n\n  This somatic cell gene therapy is what you are talking about where \nyou have already the sperm and egg, and you have a full chromosome. \nThat is where you may want to make changes, and that is where the \nresearch is focused. Now they can deal with some of the dreaded \ndiseases the Senator from Massachusetts says we should rightly try to \ndeal with. I agree that we should.\n  We specifically added that. We covered that point the Senator raised \nand about which he has concern because we don't want to impact that \narea. We talk about this on page 3. It says:\n\n       The term ``human germline gene modification'' means the \n     intentional modification of DNA in any human cell for the \n     purpose of producing a genetic change which can be passed on \n     to future individuals.\n\n  In this amendment we are saying: Do we really want to change the \nhuman species without knowing what the impact is going to be down the \nroad? Maybe we have a shot at changing this one, but what is it going \nto do to the next generation, the second one, the third one, the fourth \none, and after that?\n  I also point out to the good Senator who has worked tirelessly to get \nthis bill through to passage--I appreciate both his work and the work \nof the Senator from Nevada on just continuing to press forward. They \nhave done a very good job. But I point out to them that we have \nsignificant limitations on doing this to animals. Right now, if you \nwanted to take a fish and put a tomato germline in it, or something \nfrom a tomato gene--actually this is being done--this is a heavily \nregulated area by FDA, and the USDA, as well it should be. My goodness, \ndo we want to get super fish out here that could swim and do things and \ntake over a whole area of species? They are actually concerned. It may \nsound scientific, like this is just off the wall. But this is happening \ntoday.\n  We have these deep concerns within our society. You do not have to \nlisten to me. The Senator from California knows what is taking place \nthis week in southern California. People are deeply concerned about \nthis being done with animals and plants.\n  All I am talking about with this amendment is to say, the careful \nthing for us to do right now is to prohibit it in humans.\n  As the Senator from Massachusetts knows, in any future legislative \nsession we can remove that prohibition. We could do that next year. But \nwouldn't the careful, thoughtful thing be to say right now: ``We don't \nwant to modify the human species''? It has no regulation, no \nlimitation, no review on it today. People are out there doing these \nthings.\n  Wouldn't the really thoughtful position be that we should stop this \nbecause we don't know its impact down the road--stop this now--and \nthen, if the researchers really convince us this is the right thing to \ndo, we can open it back up? I think we open up an incredible Pandora's \nbox if we allow this unregulated area of human experimentation to \ncontinue at this time. And that is what is being defended here.\n  I think this should give us some thoughtful consideration. This is \nlimited in its drafting. We have worked with a number of groups on its \ndrafting. It is very specific. This has to do with it being passed down \nto future generations. This is something that we should prohibit at \nthis time.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, there are several organizations that \ndraw different conclusions about the Senator's amendment. You have the \nBiotechnology Industry Organization that says:\n\n       Unfortunately, the Brownback amendment reaches far beyond \n     germ line gene modification. It attempts to regulate genetic \n     research--a complex and dynamic field of science that holds \n     great potential for patients with serious and often life-\n     threatening illnesses.\n\n  And from the Association of American Medical Colleges:\n\n       Much more troubling, however, the amendment reaches far \n     beyond germ line therapy. Taken on its face, the amendment \n     would prohibit other areas of research into gene therapy as \n     well.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent an analysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n                                                    June 28, 2001.\n     To: Michael Werner, Esquire, BIO Bioethics Counsel.\n     From: Edward L. Korwek, Ph.D., J.D.\n     Re: Some Initial Comments/Analysis of the Brownback \n         Amendment.\n       The Brownback Amendment is poorly worded and confusing as \n     to its precise coverage. It uses a variety of scientific \n     terms and other complex language both to prohibit and allow \n     certain gene modification activities. Many of the sentences \n     are composed of language that is incorrect or ambiguous from \n     a scientific standpoint. A determination needs to be made of \n     what each sentence of the Amendment is intended to \n     accomplish.\n       As to a few of the important definitions, the term \n     ``somatic cell'' is defined in proposed section 301(3) of \n     Chapter 16, as ``a diploid cell (having two sets of the \n     chromosomes of almost all body cells) obtained or derived \n     from a living or deceased human body at any stage of \n     development.'' What does ``of almost all body cells'' mean? \n     Is this an oblique reference to the haploid nature of human \n     sex cells, i.e., sperm and eggs? Also, why is it important to \n     describe in such confusing detail from where the cells are \n     derived (in contrast to simply saying, for example, a\n\n[[Page S7070]]\n\n     somatic cell is a human diploid cell)? From a scientific \n     standpoint, the definition of a somatic cell is not dependent \n     on whether the cell is from living or dead human beings. More \n     importantly, as to this human source issue, when does a \n     ``human body'' exist such that its status as ``living'' or \n     ``dead'' or its ``stages of development'' become relevant \n     criteria for determining what is a ``somatic cell.''\n       Similarly, the definition of ``human germline \n     modification,'' especially the first sentence, is very \n     convoluted. The first sentence states:\n       ``The term `human germline gene modification' means the \n     intentional modification of DNA of any human cell (including \n     human eggs, sperm, fertilized eggs (i.e., embryos, or any \n     early cells that will differentiate into gametes or can be \n     manipulated to do so) for the purpose of producing a genetic \n     change which can be passed on to future individuals, \n     including DNA from any source, and in any form, such as \n     nuclei, chromosomes, nuclear, mitochondrial, and synthetic \n     DNA.''\n       Among other problems, which of the examples listed are \n     ``sources'' or ``forms'' of DNA and why does it matter? \n     Moreover, the sentence ends by referring to ``including DNA \n     from any source, and in any form, such as nuclei, \n     chromosomes, nuclear, mitochondrial, and synthetic DNA.'' To \n     what part of the first sentence defining ``human germline \n     modification'' is this language referring? Does the last \n     sentence of the definition, ``Nor does it include the change \n     of DNA involved in the normal process of sexual \n     reproduction'' prohibit in vitro fertilization? Does any \n     other part of the Amendment prohibit or allow in vitro \n     fertilization? What genetic technologies does ``normal'' \n     cover, if any?\n       Similarly, the second sentence in the definition, stating \n     what is not covered by the definition of ``human germline \n     modification,'' contains three ``not'' words, leaving the \n     reader to decipher what exactly is ``not'' ``human germline \n     modification'': ``The term does not include any modification \n     of cells that are not a part of and will not be used to \n     construct human embryos'' (emphasis added). Also, what is an \n     ``embryo'' for purposes of this Amendment and what does \n     ``part of'' mean? Are (fertilized) sex cells ``part of'' an \n     embryo?\n       These and other problems leave the bill unsupportable in \n     its current form. Due to this imprecision, the amendment's \n     impact is unclear and seemingly far reaching.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, a memorandum by Hogan & Hartson says:\n\n       The Brownback Amendment is . . . confusing as to its \n     precise coverage. It uses a variety of scientific terms and \n     other complex language both to prohibit and allow certain \n     gene modification activities.\n\n  And it gives a several-page analysis of this.\n  The fact is, as I understand it, there is a moratorium now at NIH. \nNIH does not permit any of the research in transferring of the \nmaterials in terms of genes at the present time.\n  I just mention quickly, on page 3 of the amendment, on lines 10 and \n11, it talks about ``for the purpose of producing a genetic change \nwhich can be passed on to future individuals . . .'' That ought to be a \nmatter of concern to parents because that is an area of very great \npotential in terms of parents who have the gene--in terms of cystic \nfibrosis, muscular dystrophy--in trying to impact that kind of DNA so \nthat they will not pass this on. Yet this is talking about restricting \nthe research for ``producing a genetic change which can be passed on to \nfuture individuals . . .'' That very area is a matter of enormous \nimportance and consequence.\n  I know the Senator has given this a lot of thought. It is enormously \nimportant. I respect him for it. I know that he revisits these issues \ncontinuously. We will look forward to continuing to work with him. I \nknow he is incredibly concerned about the broad areas of ethical \nissues. In those areas of ethical concerns there are no simple, easy \nanswers. There is enormous division, significant divisions, in many \ndifferent areas.\n  But it does seem to me that in the time that we have available to \nconsider this, and on this particular legislation, and with the very \nstrong opposition of the research community generally, that it would be \nunwise for us to add this at this time to the legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I would just note once more for my \ncolleagues that the area of genetic manipulation, germline therapy, is \nregulated in animals and in plants but is completely unregulated--there \nis nothing on it--in humans.\n  Is that a responsible way for us to go? There is nothing on it. If we \nwant to do it right now on the human species in the United States, go \nahead, fine. If you want to do that, release that into us, into the \nhuman species, fine, go ahead. If you want to do it in fish, we have a \nseries of hoops that you have to jump through and filings that you have \nto make and limitations on where this can take place all up and down, \neverywhere. But for humans, fine. I guess if we are going to eat it, we \nare concerned about it. But if it is one of us, OK.\n  I have deep respect for the Senator from Massachusetts. He is very \nthoughtful and one of the most productive Members of this body, \nprobably in the history of this body. But I would really seriously ask \nhim to look at this area. Is this something we want to do in this \nsociety? This is not only technically or theoretically feasible today; \nit can be done today. It has been done in the animal line for years \nnow. This has been going on for 10 years-plus, 15 years in animals. The \ngenetic lineup in animals versus humans is not that much different. \nTotally unregulated, no limitations--go ahead and do it in humans, not \nin cattle.\n  I would hope we could at least get some agreement that this is going \nto be further considered sometime during this legislative session. If \nwe want more limited language, I am more than happy to work with \nindividuals in drafting more limited language. If there is concern \nabout gene therapy on it, I am willing to draft it as tight as they \nwant to on gene therapy. That would be just fine by me. But to let this \ngo on now, you are inviting people to step up. If we need to work with \nthe groups the Senator listed to draft it more tightly, I am happy to \ndo that.\n  This is a serious matter. We have more and more people in the streets \nprotesting about this very thing. I think we should wake up on that \nparticular point, if nothing else. We saw the protest that took place \nin Seattle. We saw what it did to the World Trade talks. That was on \nfood. We are seeing what is taking place in the Biotechnology Expo in \nSouthern California right now. That is on humans.\n  This issue is not going away. It is something that we are going to \nhave to confront. I would hope and I would think we would be far wiser \nto do it sooner rather than later. I am happy to work with anybody on \ndrafting the language to see that that takes place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will include the regulations which are in existence \nnow. I ask unanimous consent they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n [From pages 90-92--NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant \n                             DNA Molecules]\n\n       Appendix K-VII-K. Pathogen. A pathogen is any \n     microbiological agent or eukaryotic cell containing \n     sufficient genetic information, which upon expression of such \n     information, is capable of producing disease in healthy \n     people, plants, or animals.\n       Appendix K-VII-L. Physical Barrier. A physical barrier is \n     considered any equipment, facilities, or devices (e.g., \n     fermentors, factories, filters, thermal oxidizers) which are \n     designed to achieve containment.\n       Appendix K-VII-M. Release. Release is the discharge of a \n     microbiological agent or eukaryotic cell from a containment \n     system. Discharges can be incidental or accidental. \n     Incidental releases are de minimis in nature; accidental \n     releases may be de minimis in nature.\n     Appendix L. Gene Therapy Policy Conferences (GTPCs)\n       In order to enhance the depth and value of public \n     discussion relevant to scientific, safety, social, and \n     ethical implications of gene therapy research, the NIH \n     Director will convene GTPCs at regular intervals. As \n     appropriate, the NIH Director may convene a GTPC in \n     conjunction with a RAC meeting. GTPCs will be administered by \n     NIH/OBA. Conference participation will not involve a standing \n     committee membership but rather will offer the unique \n     advantage of assembling numerous participants who possess \n     significant scientific, ethical, and legal expertise and/or \n     interest that is directly applicable to a specific gene \n     therapy research issue. At least one member of RAC will serve \n     as Co-chair of each GTPC and report the findings of each GTPC \n     to RAC at its next scheduled meeting. The RAC representative \n     for each GTPC will be chosen based on the participant's area \n     of expertise relative to the specific gene therapy research \n     issue to be discussed. All RAC members will be invited to \n     attend GTPCs. GTPCs will have representation from other \n     Federal agencies, including FDA and OPRR. GTPCs will focus on \n     broad overarching policy and scientific issues related to \n     gene therapy research. Proposals for GTPC topics may be \n     submitted by members\n\n[[Page S7071]]\n\n     of RAC, representatives of academia, industry, patient and \n     consumer advocacy organizations, other Federal agencies \n     professional scientific societies, and the general public. \n     GTPC topics will not be limited to discussion of human \n     applications of gene therapy research, i.e., they may include \n     basic research on the use of novel gene delivery vehicles, or \n     novel applications of human gene transfer. The RAC, with the \n     Director's approval, will have the primary responsibility for \n     planning GTPC agendas. GTPC findings will be transmitted to \n     the NIH Director and will be made publicly available. The NIH \n     Director anticipates that this public policy forum will serve \n     as a model for interagency communication and collaboration, \n     concentrated expert discussion of novel scientific issues and \n     their potential societal implications, and enhanced \n     opportunity for public discussion of specific issues and \n     potential impact of such applications on human health and the \n     environment.\n     Appendix M. Points to Consider in the Design and Submission \n         of Protocols for the Transfer of Recombinant DNA \n         Molecules into One or More Human Research Participants \n         (Points to Consider)\n       Appendix M applies to research conducted at or sponsored by \n     an institution that receives any support for recombinant DNA \n     research from NIH. Researchers not covered by the NIH \n     Guidelines are encouraged to use Appendix M (see Section I-C, \n     General Applicability).\n       The acceptability of human somatic cell gene therapy has \n     been addressed in several public documents as well as in \n     numerous academic studies. In November 1982, the President's \n     Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and \n     Biomedical and Behavioral Research published a report, \n     Splicing Life, which resulted from a two-year process of \n     public deliberation and hearings. Upon release of that \n     report, a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee held \n     three days of public hearings with witnesses from a wide \n     range of fields from the biomedical and social sciences to \n     theology, philosophy, and law. In December 1984, the Office \n     of Technology Assessment released a background paper, Human \n     Gene Therapy, which concluded that civic, religious, \n     scientific, and medical groups have all accepted, in \n     principle, the appropriateness of gene therapy of somatic \n     cells in humans for specific genetic diseases. Somatic cell \n     gene therapy is seen as an extension of present methods of \n     therapy that might be preferable to other technologies. In \n     light of this public support, RAC is prepared to consider \n     proposals for somatic cell gene transfer.\n       RAC will not at present entertain proposals for germ line \n     alterations but will consider proposals involving somatic \n     cell gene transfer. The purpose of somatic cell gene therapy \n     is to treat an individual patient, e.g., by inserting a \n     properly functioning gene into the subject's somatic cells. \n     Germ line alteration involves a specific attempt to introduce \n     genetic changes into the germ (reproductive) cells of an \n     individual, with the aim of changing the set of genes passed \n     on to the individual's offspring.\n       The RAC continues to explore the issues raised by the \n     potential of in utero gene transfer clinical research. \n     However, the RAC concludes that, at present, it is premature \n     to undertake any in utero gene transfer clinical trail. \n     Significant additional preclinical and clinical studies \n     addressing vector transduction efficacy, biodistribution, and \n     toxicity are required before a human in utero gene transfer \n     protocol can proceed. In addition, a more thorough \n     understanding of the development of human organ systems, such \n     as the immune and nervous systems, is needed to better define \n     the potential efficacy and risks of human in utero gene \n     transfer. Prerequisites for considering any specific human in \n     utero gene transfer procedure include an understanding of the \n     pathophysiology of the candidate disease and a demonstrable \n     advantage to the in utero approach. Once the above criteria \n     are met, the RAC would be willing to consider well \n     rationalized human in utero gene transfer clinical trials.\n       Research proposals involving the deliberate transfer of \n     recombinant DNA, or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA, \n     into human subjects (human gene transfer) will be considered \n     through a review process involving both NIH/OBA and RAC. \n     Investigators shall submit their relevant information on the \n     proposed human gene transfer experiments to NIH/OBA. \n     Submission of human gene transfer protocols to NIH will be in \n     the format described in Appendix M-1, Submission \n     Requirements--Human Gene Transfer Experiments. Submission to \n     NIH shall be for registration purposes and will ensure \n     continued public access to relevant human gene transfer \n     information conducted in compliance with the NIH Guidelines. \n     Investigational New Drug (IND) applications should be \n     submitted to FDA in the format described in 21 CFR, Chapter \n     1, Subchapter D, Part 312, Subpart B, Section 23, IND Content \n     and Format.\n       Institutional Biosafety Committee approval must be obtained \n     from each institution at which recombinant DNA material will \n     be administered to human subjects (as opposed to each \n     institution involved in the production of vectors for human \n     application and each institution at which there is ex vivo \n     transduction of recombinant DNA material into target cells \n     for human application).\n       Factors that may contribute to public discussion of an \n     human gene transfer experiment by RAC include: (i) new \n     vectors/new gene delivery systems, (ii) new diseases, (iii) \n     unique applications of gene transfer, and (iv) other issues \n     considered to require further public discussion. Among the \n     experiments that may be considered exempt from RAC discussion \n     are those determined not to represent possible risk to human \n     health or the environment. Full RAC review of an individual \n     human gene transfer experiment can be initiated by the NIH \n     Director or recommended to the NIH Director by: (i) three or \n     more RAC members, or (ii) other Federal agencies. An \n     individual human gene transfer experiment that is recommended \n     for full RAC review should represent novel characteristics \n     deserving of public discussion. If the Director, NIH, \n     determines that an experiment will undergo full RAC \n     discussion, NIH/OBA will immediately notify the Principal \n     Investigator. RAC members may forward individual requests for \n     additional information relevant to a specific protocol \n     through NIH/OBA to the Principal Investigator. In making a \n     determination whether an experiment is novel, and thus \n     deserving of full RAC discussion, reviewers will examine the \n     scientific rationale, scientific context (relative to other \n     proposals reviewed by RAC), whether the preliminary in vitro \n     and in vivo safety data were obtained in appropriate models \n     and are sufficient, and whether questions related to relevant \n     social and ethical issues have been resolved. RAC \n     recommendations on a specific human gene transfer experiment \n     shall be forwarded to the NIH Director, the Principal \n     Investigator, the sponsoring institution, and other DHHA \n     components, as appropriate. Relevant documentation will be \n     included in the material for the RAC meeting at which the \n     experiment is scheduled to be discussed. RAC meetings will be \n     open to the public except where trade secrets and proprietary \n     information are reviewed (see Section IV-D-5, Protection of \n     Proprietary Data). RAC prefers that information provided in \n     response to Appendix M contain no proprietary data or trade \n     secrets, enabling all aspects of the review to be open to the \n     public.\n       Note: Any application submitted to NIH/OBA shall not be \n     designated as `confidential;' in its entirety. In the \n     event that a sponsor determines that specific responses to \n     one or more of the items described in Appendix M should be \n     considered as proprietary or trade secret, each item \n     should be clearly identified as such. The cover letter \n     (attached to the submitted material) shall: (1) clearly \n     indicate that select portions of the application contain \n     information considered as proprietary or trade secret, (2) \n     a brief explanation as to the reason that each of these \n     items is determined proprietary or trade secret.\n       Public discussion of human gene transfer experiments (and \n     access to relevant information) shall serve to inform the \n     public about the technical aspects of the proposals, meaning \n     and significance of the research, and significant safety, \n     social, and ethical implications of the research. RAC \n     discussion is intended to ensure safe and ethical conduct of \n     gene therapy experiments and facilitate public understanding \n     of this novel area of biomedical research.\n       In its evaluation of human gene transfer proposals, RAC \n     will consider whether the design of such experiments offers \n     adequate assurance that their consequences will not go beyond \n     their purpose, which is the same as the traditional purpose \n     of clinical investigation, namely, to protect the health and \n     well being of human subjects being treated while at the same \n     time gathering generalizable knowledge. Two possible \n     undersirable consequences of the transfer of recombinant DNA \n     would be unintentional: (i) vertical transmission of genetic \n     changes from an individual to his/her offspring, or (ii) \n     horizontal transmission of viral infection to other persons \n     with whom the individual comes in contact. Accordingly, \n     Appendices M-I through M-V request information that will \n     enable RAC and NIB/OBA to assess the possibility that the \n     proposed experiment(s) will inadvertently affect reproductive \n     cells or lead to infection of other people (e.g., medical \n     personnel or relatives).\n       Appendix M will be considered for revisions as experience \n     in evaluating proposals accumulates and as new scientific \n     developments occur. This review will be carried out \n     periodically as needed.\n     Appendix M-I. Requirements for Protocol Submission, Review, \n         and Reporting--Human Gene Transfer Experiments\n\n     Appendix M-I-A. Requirements for Protocol Submission\n       The following documentation must be submitted (see \n     exemption in Appendix M-VI-A, Footnotes of Appendix M) in \n     printed or electronic form to the: Office of Biotechnology \n     Activities, National Institutes of Health, 6705 Rockledge \n     Drive, Suite 750, MSC 7985 Bethesda, MD. 20892-7985 (20817 \n     for non-USPS mail), 301-496-9838, 301-496-9839 (fax), E-mail: \n     rosenthg@od.nih.gov.

Finally, the reason there is a moratorium is there isn't \nreason to believe that this kind of research is safe today. But it may \nvery well be safe tomorrow or the next day. And the possibilities, as I \nsay, are unlimited. The action of the Senator may effectively close \nthat window, close that door. I do not think that we ought to be in the \nposition of doing that. So I have included the current state of the \nregulations that are in effect now in NIH and the reasons for those \nregulations.\n  Unless there is someone else who wants to speak on this----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I would like to respond on that point \nas well. The FDA is saying they have authority over this. One of the \ngroups they are seeking to regulate is saying they do not have \nauthority, and they are going to sue them to keep the FDA from \nregulating them.\n  So regulations have been proposed, but it is a very open question \nabout whether or not this applies to groups that are seeking to do this \nor seeking legal injunction prohibiting the FDA from regulating this. \nSo we can put those on forward.\n  The fact is, this has not been dealt with, and it is of utmost \nimportance to people in this country and around the world, and it \nshould be. This should not happen during our watch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield the remainder of his \ntime?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been requested.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I yield back the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Massachusetts yield back \nhis time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from Nevada \nis recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 849\n\n          (Purpose: To provide for genetic nondiscrimination)\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 849 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 849.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, the amendment that I have proposed \nreally is entitled the ``protection against genetic discrimination \nact.'' The Senator from Massachusetts is one of the cosponsors of a \nbill that contains this particular amendment, along with 22 other \nSenators.\n  The mapping of the human genome is one of the most amazing scientific \nbreakthroughs in recent history. Information that is embedded in the \ngenome holds the key to understanding the illnesses and diseases that \naffect millions of people across the world every day.\n  I would like to note, this has nothing to do with the amendment that \nSenator Brownback just proposed. We want to keep the controversies \nseparate. What our amendment deals with is whether you can take this \ngenetic information and use it to determine whether or not to provide \nhealth insurance coverage.\n  When the map of the human genome is completed, we will have all of \nthe information that is contained in the 23 pairs of chromosomes in the \nhuman body. This information will be instrumental for finding the cure \nfor diseases such as breast cancer, cystic fibrosis, Alzheimer's \ndisease, and hundreds of other debilitating illnesses.\n  However, this breakthrough also carries great dangers. Current law \ndoes not provide any protections for individuals to keep their own \ngenetic information private. Currently there is no law prohibiting a \nhealth plan from requiring an applicant to provide genetic information \nprior to the approval for insurance. In other words, any individual \nwith a genetic marker for a specific disease would most likely not be \nable to receive health insurance coverage for the treatment of that \ndisease.\n  A joint report by the Department of Labor, Department of Health and \nHuman Services, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the \nDepartment of Justice summarized the various studies on discrimination \nbased on genetic information and argued for the enactment of Federal \nlegislation.\n\n  The report stated that:\n\n       Genetic predisposition or conditions can lead to work force \n     discrimination, even in cases where workers are healthy and \n     unlikely to develop disease, or where the genetic condition \n     has no affect on the ability to perform work.\n       Because an individual's genetic information has \n     implications for his or her family members and future \n     generations, misuse of genetic information could have \n     intergenerational effects that are broader than any \n     individual incident of misuse.\n\n  Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Human Genome \nResearch Institute, has stated:\n\n       While genetic information and genetic technology hold great \n     promise for improving human health, they can always be used \n     in ways that are fundamentally unjust. Genetic information \n     can be used as the basis for insidious discrimination.\n       The misuse of genetic information has the potential to be, \n     and is, a very serious problem both in terms of people's \n     access to employment and health insurance and the continued \n     ability to undertake important genetic research.\n\n  This amendment takes the first step toward providing individuals with \nthe protections they need for their individual genetic information.\n  This amendment, as I mentioned before, is part of a larger bill that \nSenator Daschle has introduced on this very same subject. Simply put, \nthis amendment prohibits health insurance companies from using genetic \ninformation when deciding whether or not to provide health insurance \nfor an individual.\n  Insurance companies would not be able to use genetic information to \ndeny an individual's application for coverage or charge excessive \npremiums.\n  Think about diseases such as Tay-Sachs, sickle-cell anemia, breast \ncancer, colon cancer, cystic fibrosis, and other diseases in which we \nhave identified genes that predispose people to these diseases. Just \nthink about how many Americans this affects now and will affect in the \nfuture as we discover new genes that predispose people to certain \ndiseases. It is because of this that we must include this amendment if \nwe are truly going to call this bill a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Madam President, my wife and I helped co-found the Breast Cancer \nCoalition of Nevada. Many of the women who are actively involved in \nthis wonderful organization are breast cancer survivors or family \nmembers of women who have died from breast cancer. A wonderful friend \nof my wife and I, one of the most incredible women I have ever met, \ndied in my wife's arms several years ago. She died of breast cancer. To \nthink about women such as her who have had a gene identified, or maybe \nher daughter the same, to think about her someday being discriminated \nagainst getting health insurance is just unconscionable.\n  I encourage all of my Senate colleagues, including the sponsors of \nthe bill, to accept this amendment. It is the right thing to do. I urge \nits adoption.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, we yield back the remainder of our time.\n\n[[Page S7073]]\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time on \nthis amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 848\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 848 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 848.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide that health care professionals who provide pro \nbono medical services to medically underserved or indigent individuals \n                       are immune from liability)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. IMMUNITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, no health care professional shall be liable for the \n     performance of, or the failure to perform, any duty in \n     providing pro bono medical services to a medically \n     underserved or indigent individual.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Health care professional.--The term ``health care \n     professional'' has the meaning given the term in section 151.\n       (2) Medically underserved or indigent individual.--The term \n     ``medically underserved or indigent individual'' means an \n     individual that does not have health care coverage under a \n     group health plan, health insurance coverage, or any other \n     health care coverage program, or who is unable to pay for the \n     health care services that are provided to the individual.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, this next amendment I am offering comes \nonce again from personal experience. I have a very close friend, Dr. \nTony Alamo. He is a few years younger than me, and is an internist in \nLas Vegas. Our parents have known each other for a long time. He \ngraduated from USC medical school. I don't know that I have ever seen \nanybody work harder.\n  Internists today don't make nearly the money that a lot of surgical \nspecialists make, but the compassion that they have for their patients \nis just incredible. I remember a few years ago talking to him and what \nhe had to tell me was amazing. As a practicing veterinarian, we get to \nchoose who we take, who we don't take, and when they come into our \noffices. But as a physician, when he happens to be there treating \nanother patient, if somebody comes in and he happens to be the \nattending physician, he has to treat that person, regardless of whether \nthey have insurance or no insurance, can pay or cannot pay.\n  When he takes that person on as a patient, he cannot get rid of that \npatient. So he has to continue through the course of the disease, if he \nis in the hospital, has a heart condition, he has to continue \nregardless of whether he gets reimbursed or not.\n  The purpose of my amendment is to say we want them to continue that \nkind of care, but if out of the goodness of their heart they are \ntreating for free, we just want to eliminate the possibility that they \ncan be sued for such a matter.\n  We are looking at this as a situation that is similar to Good \nSamaritan laws. For example, when somebody stops on the side of the \nfreeway because somebody is hurt and they don't know exactly what to do \nbut they want to help and they happen to do more harm than good, we \nhave passed laws across the country that helps a Good Samaritan in that \nregard.\n  The practice of medicine, as anybody who has practiced knows, whether \nit is veterinary medicine or human medicine, is both an art and a \nscience. As a matter of fact, it is more art than science. Things go \nwrong. Sometimes things go wrong that may look like malpractice. And \nsometimes it is something the doctor had nothing to do with, yet they \ncan still be taken to court.\n  Our amendment says that if health care professionals are going to do \nthis, we want to protect those people from lawsuits.\n  It seems to me that if somebody is providing something out of the \ngoodness of their heart on a pro bono basis, they could not be sued. In \nfact, I would support a similar proposal that granted lawyers the same \nprotection. If they are providing pro bono services, they could not be \nsued. I think if this was a lawyer's bill of rights, we would include \nthat as well. But this happens to be a Patients' Bill of Rights, and \nfor the physicians that are treating these patients, we want to make \nsure they are protected.\n  We have spoken to Senator McCain's staff and, apparently, they think \nthe language is acceptable. I think in the long run this is going to go \na long way. I have spoken to Senator Frist who, as many of you know, is \na heart surgeon. He does volunteer work in clinics, both overseas and \nalso here in the United States. He doesn't get paid for these services. \nYet, he has to maintain medical malpractice insurance. He pays premiums \nout of his pocket each year so that if he gets sued, he is covered.\n  This is probably the only amendment in this entire bill that actually \nwill lower--it will only lower it slightly--the cost of health \ninsurance. It would help lower both the cost of medical malpractice \npremiums and eventually the cost of coverage premiums for consumers as \nwell.\n  Mr. President, I don't know if anybody is going to oppose this \namendment. I can't understand why they would. I would be more than \nhappy to engage in a debate on this if anybody has a problem with it.\n  I yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. First, I say to the Senator from Nevada that Senator \nCoverdell had a bill that he passed called the Volunteer Protection Act \nof 1997. It specifically provides protection for volunteers, including \nphysicians, who provide pro bono services. So I suggest to my \ncolleague, I don't know if he thinks there is a problem with that law \nor the way it is written. There is no way for me to know that based on \nthis amendment. But a specific law already covers this subject matter. \nIt was passed by the Senate and signed into law in 1997. So, first, I \nsuggest that my colleague look at that law and make sure what he is \nconcerned about is not covered by it.\n  Second, this Bipartisan Patient Protection Act is about HMO reform. \nIt is not about physician liability or the lack thereof--either of \nthose. We would certainly have a problem with adding an amendment to \nthis legislation that is not related to the issue of HMO reform.\n  So I say to my colleague, again, understanding that we are just \nseeing his amendment, in fairness, I will be happy to talk with him \nabout it, but those were my immediate concerns. There appears to be a \nlaw that already covers this subject matter. We would always be \nconcerned, of course, even under those circumstances, about a health \ncare provider who acted recklessly. I don't know whether his amendment \ncovers that or not.\n  Third, the general issue of adding these kinds of provisions to an \nHMO reform bill, which is what this bill is about, would also be a \nconcern.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. First of all, physicians I have spoken to do not think \nthe bill the Senator is talking about adequately covers them. That is \nwhy they still have to carry medical malpractice insurance, similar to \nwhat Senator Frist has to carry. My amendment would help lower the cost \nof this type of coverage, so we think this bill is necessary. I don't \nunderstand--if this is already covered in law, why would it be a \nproblem to include it to make sure we are saying to the courts that we \nabsolutely want to cover people who are providing pro bono services to \nthe needy.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I say to my colleague that if there is already a law in \nplace that covers this issue, it seems as a matter of procedure that \nthe appropriate thing to do would be to amend the already existing law \nthat covers the subject matter, as opposed to adding this measure to an \nHMO reform piece of legislation.\n  So I guess, just as a matter of orderly process, that would make \nsense to me.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. We have been looking for a vehicle to include this in. We \nhave wanted to deal with this for some time.\n\n[[Page S7074]]\n\n This is a Patients' Bill of Rights, and I know it deals mostly with \nHMOs, but we are looking at our health care system and providing rights \nto patients. This is part of the health care bill that I think \nappropriately should have an amendment such as this, simply because I \ndon't think there is any question that we are driving up health care \ncosts in this country. If anything can help drive down, even a small \namount, the cost of health care, I think we should do it.\n  If between now and tomorrow morning, if there is other language the \nSenator thinks we need to massage into our amendment, I would be more \nthan happy to work with the Senator from North Carolina. But as it \nstands, we think this is an important amendment.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, I appreciate his \ncomments. He and I are friends, and I would like to find a way to work \non this. I will be happy to talk to him about this when we adjourn.\n  Having said that, I continue to have a significant concern about \nraising an issue on the HMO reform bill that is not related to HMO \nreform. We have pretty consistently throughout this debate opposed and \ndefeated amendments unrelated to the coverage of this bill. There are \nobviously many subject matters that are related to the general area of \nhealth reform and health care. If we start adding amendments on all \nsubjects of health care, we would never get this legislation completed \nand passed. I continue to have that concern.\n  I am happy to work with my colleague and listen to his concerns and \nwork on language, although at this moment this is an amendment we would \nbe compelled to oppose.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate \nresumes consideration of the Patients' Bill of Rights on Friday, June \n29, at 9 a.m., the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the following \namendments, and it be disposed of in the following order, with no \nsecond-degree amendments in order prior to the votes; further, that \nthere be 4 minutes of debate prior to each vote, and that the first \nrollcall vote be 15 minutes in length and subsequent rollcall votes be \n10 minutes in length. The order of the votes tomorrow morning would be: \nSantorum, DeWine, Grassley, Nickles, Brownback, Ensign No. 849, and \nEnsign No. 848.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I indicated earlier in this debate that I \nwould complete reading into the Record the names and titles of \norganizations that support the Patient Protection Act.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nBipartisan Patient Protection Act of 2001. Put simply, I believe this \nis a good bill.\n  If the Senate approves this bill, we could offer health care \nprotections to all 190 million Americans in private health plans within \na week. It's that simple.\n  Congress has a duty to pass a comprehensive Patients' Bill of Rights \nto make HMOs accountable to patients, and to ensure less HMO \ninterference with medical decision making. We need to ensure, for \nexample, access to emergency rooms, specialists, and clinical trials. \nPatients should be able to go to the emergency room closest to their \nhome in the event of a medical emergency. This bill does just that.\n  Each day, 10,000 physicians see patients harmed because a health plan \nhas refused services. Patients and doctors feel that getting quality \ncare is a constant battle. It is time for this to stop. And the time is \nnow.\n  Each day we wait to approve a comprehensive Patients' Bill of Rights, \n35,000 patients are denied access to the speciality care they need to \nmanage or diagnose their illness.\n  I want to read to you a heart-wrenching letter I received from a \nCalifornia mother who has had difficultly getting her health plan to \napprove medically necessary services for her disabled daughter.\n  I believe this letter really highlights the humane reasons Congress \nmust enact a strong Patients' Bill of Rights this year. This mother \nwrites:\n\n       My daughter is a total-care patient. She was in a terrible \n     car accident approximately 14 years ago and sustained brain \n     stem injuries and is a quadriplegic. I chose to keep her at \n     home. Her licensed care coverage is to be 24-hour care. In \n     the past two years, her insurance company has unilaterally \n     cut back on her nursing care to 5.5 hours a day.\n       This is one of many unilateral decisions the insurance \n     provider has made regarding her care--disregarding her \n     doctor's and other medical providers' assessments.\n       I, as her mother and conservator, who is not trained in \n     medical practices or care, am expected to cover the remainder \n     of the 18.5 hours a day. This has caused me to quit my job, \n     file bankruptcy, and most importantly, it has seriously \n     affected my health.\n       I am a senior citizen and am not supposed to lift, however, \n     because of the practices of the insurance company, I have no \n     choice. I cannot tell you when I last had a full night's \n     sleep in the past several years.\n       The insurance company not only cut back on her nursing \n     care, they stopped approving her therapy which included \n     physical, speech, and occupational.\n       I received a letter from her current insurance carrier \n     stating that she was considered to be a normal employee and \n     in August of 2001 all the aforementioned items would be \n     stopped.\n       This is not based on my daughter's current doctor's orders \n     nor her needs. This is not based on an assessment from an \n     independent medical establishment or by an experienced, \n     licensed nurse that was selected by the insurance company for \n     a complete assessment which supported the necessity of 24-\n     hour nursing care.\n       This decision is being made unilaterally by the insurance \n     company officials. Is this what insurance companies can do to \n     critically ill patients without any accountability or \n     liability on their part?\n\n  I commend this mother for her commitment to providing her daughter \nwith the best care available.\n  This letter highlights the importance of giving doctors the power to \nmake medical decisions about coverage and care rather than the ``green \neye shade'' of the insurance companies.\n  I strongly believe that doctors should be making the medical \ndecisions. This bill includes several provisions to help physicians \ndetermine what is medically necessary and to prevent insurance plans \nfrom defining medical necessity.\n  These provisions are necessary because doctor after doctor has told \nme their ``horror stories'' of how plans try to arm twist, coerce, \ncountermand, interfere with and even deny treatments that they have \ndetermined are medically necessary and appropriate.\n  The bill prohibits plans from punishing providers for advising \npatients about their options for medical treatment.\n  The bill also establishes, as the standard for review, that decisions \nshould be made based on the medical condition of the patient and valid, \nrelevant scientific evidence and clinical evidence and expert opinion.\n  It also requires internal and external reviews of appeals of medical \nnecessity to be made by physicians with expertise in the area of \nmedicine being appealed.\n  It requires reviewers in the independent review process to be a \nphysician or health care professional who is licensed and ``typically \ntreats the condition, makes the diagnosis, or provides the type of \ntreatment under review.''\n  On prescription drugs, the bill requires plans to make exceptions to \nrestrictive drug formularies for medical necessity, if prescribed by \nthe treating physician.\n  It is my hope that these provisions will give doctors and other \nproviders the legal underpinnings they need to make the professional \nmedical judgments they are trained to make in their effort to give \npatients the best care possible.\n  I also want to briefly speak to two other very important provisions \nincluded in this bill: First, this bill provides coverage to all 190 \nAmericans in private health plans. The competing bill in the Senate \n(Frist-Breaux) excludes approximately 20 million Americans because they \nare enrolled in a self-insured State and local government health plans. \nIt is important we pass a bill that provides protections to all \nAmericans.\n  Second, I believe this bill offers a responsible approach to \nliability.\n  Today, patients have few opportunities for recourse against the \nhealth plans that harm them. This is wrong.\n  This bill gets rid of a health plan's special privileges. A health \nplan would bear responsibility only if it makes a medical decision and \nthe patient dies or is harmed as a result.\n  Doctors and other health practitioners are already held accountable \nfor their mistakes under State law. If a ``green eye-shade'' overrules \na doctor's medical judgement and harms a patient, the plan too should \nbe held responsible.\n  At the same time, this bill protects employers. If an employer does \nnot make medical decisions, the employer can't be held liable. It is \nthat simple.\n  This bill does not overturn or preempt existing State liability laws. \nIt specifically exempts doctors and hospitals from new causes of \naction. These are reasonable provisions. In States like California that \nhave strong patient protections there has not been an explosion of \nlawsuits.\n  In fact, since the inception of California's right-to-sue law in \nJanuary 2001 and the unlimited damage it provides for, there has not \nbeen a single lawsuit filed.\n  Instead, HMOs appear to be deferring more to patients' requests for \ntreatment, according to the first data to emerge from the State's HMO \nregulator.\n  California has the longest history in managed care and the highest \nnumber of insured people in HMOs nationwide. Over 70 percent of \nCalifornians are enrolled in either a commercial HMO or a preferred \nprovider organization, PPO. Approximately 20 million non-elderly \nCalifornians have access to health insurance through their job or \nprivately purchase coverage.\n\n[[Page S7076]]\n\n  So for California, these protections are critical.\n  Due in part to the high penetration of managed care, California's \nhealth care system is on the verge of collapse. Resources are stretched \nto the limit and patients, as a result, are not getting the services \nthey need.\n  For example, California's capitation rate, the rate paid to doctors \nfor treatment, is one of the lowest in the Nation. The average \ncapitation rate in California reached its peak in 1993 at $45 per \nmonth. Last year, the rate dropped to $29 (PriceWaterhouse Coopers).\n  These low reimbursement rates undoubtedly impact quality of care and \naccess to services.\n  Many California hospitals and other health care providers have been \nforced to limit hours of operation and discontinue services. The burden \nto provide care is put on those that have remained open, and many of \nthese facilities are now facing financial problems of their own.\n  I know that California's health care system is not unlike other \nsystems across the country. The bottom line is that patients should not \nbe the one's made to suffer at the hands of a failing health care \nsystem.\n  People pay monthly premiums. They expect their health insurance to be \nthere when they need it. That is what insurance is. It insures against \nloss from an unforeseen illness or injury.\n  But with HMOs today, the certainty of good health care is being \nseriously eroded. Many people feel that every time they need care, it \nis a tremendous hassle.\n  The bottom line is that people feel they have to fight to get the \nquality care they have paid for. Americans are tired of jumping through \nhoops to get good care.\n  People should not have to fight for their health care. They pay for \nit out of their monthly paycheck. It should be there for them when they \nneed it.\n  I would like to close with a very tragic story about a young, 16 year \nold girl from Irvine, California who did not get the care she needed \nfrom her HMO in a timely manner. I think her story provides a poignant \nsummary of the problem with managed care providers. Unfortunately, her \nstory does not have a happy ending.\n  Serenity Silen was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, in \nlate February 1998. She had gone to her HMO four times, to four \ndifferent HMO doctors, since the beginning of 1998. Each time she \ncomplained of the exact same symptoms, all of which could indicate \nleukemia.\n  Over the course of the four visits, Serenity's condition was never \ndiagnosed. Finally, in the middle of February 1998, Serenity was taken \nto the emergency room of an out-of-network hospital because her mother \nwas so frustrated with the care at their HMO.\n  The emergency room doctor was the first doctor, in the five weeks \nsince the symptoms arose, to order a complete blood count test. The \nblood count test indicated a dangerously high white blood cell count \nthat was symptomatic of leukemia. With a much delayed diagnosis, \nSerenity's leukemia was now going to be much more difficult to treat.\n  Fed up with the HMO, Serenity's parents sought a second opinion from \na highly recognized oncologist at an out-of-network hospital. Serenity \nwas transferred to that hospital to be under the oncologist's care. \nAfter being at the new hospital only a few days, Serenity explained to \nher parents that she did not realize how much pain she was in until the \nnew hospital helped to take it away. After 2\\1/2\\ months at the new \nhospital, Serenity died. The disease had not been diagnosed in time.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Support this bill for the \nchildren like Serenity in your State. The constituents who battle with \ntheir HMOs daily to get the quality care they need and deserve. Many of \nthese patients are too sick to fight with their HMOs to get access to \nthe services necessary to treat their illnesses. How many more lives \nare we going to have to lose to the HMO battle before Congress wises up \nand passes a Patients' Bill of Rights that protects the patient?\n  This bill has been a long time in the making. Let's get it done this \nsession.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/28/senate-section/article/S7076-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     ADJOURNMENT OF THE TWO HOUSES OVER THE FOURTH OF JULY HOLIDAY\n\n  Mr. REID.

The clerk will state the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 117) honoring John J. Downing, Brian \n     Fahey, and Harry Ford, who lost their lives in the course of \n     duty as firefighters.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \nhonoring John J. Downing, Brian Fahey, and Harry Ford, who gave their \nlives this past Father's Day while protecting the lives of others. \nTogether, these brave men left behind three widows and eight children \nwhom we also honor today for their sacrifice.\n  On June 17, as a treacherous five-alarm fire raged at the Long Island \nGeneral Supply Company in Queens, NY, without hesitation, as they have \ndone countless times before, nearly 350 firefighters and numerous \npolice officers responded to the call for help. Two civilians and \ndozens of firefighters and police officers were injured. And three \ncourageous fathers lost their lives. It\n\n[[Page S7077]]\n\nwas the last time their children would be able to spend Father's Day \nwith them.\n  John Downing was 40 years old, an 11-year veteran of the New York \nFire Department when he responded to the five-alarm blaze. He was a \nvaliant public servant who had been recognized for his bravery. John \nleft behind his wife Anne, his 7-year-old daughter Joanne, and his \nthree-year-old son Michael.\n  Brian Fahey, 46 years old, and a 14-year veteran of the department \nfrom East Rockaway, NY, was also a husband and father of three. His \nyears of service to his community were made proud by his courage. He is \nsurvived by his wife Mary and their three sons: Brendan, 8; and twins, \nPatrick and James, 3\\1/2\\ years old.\n  Harry Ford, age 50, gave nearly three decades of service to the New \nYork City Fire Department. During his exemplary career, he received \nnine bravery citations. He is survived by his wife Denise; his daughter \nJanna O'Brien, age 24; and two sons, Harry, 12, and Gerard, 10.\n  Mr. President, I paid a call on the two firehouses early Sunday \nmorning who had lost these brave compatriots, and I spent time talking \nto the men who go to work every day not knowing what is going to be \nasked of them, who sometimes go for, thankfully, days, or weeks, or \nmonths, and even years without ever having to put themselves in danger. \nBut when the call comes, they are ready. And whether it is a call to \nrespond to an emergency need because of an illness, an accident, or a \nhuge raging fire that is about to get out of control, they represent \nthe very best we have in our society.\n  We live in a society that seems to be in perpetual search for heroes, \nwhether in the form of sports figures or screen idols. But to find true \nheroes, sometimes we don't have to look so very far from home. We \ncertainly don't have to look any farther than the brave men we are \nhonoring today.\n  The unmistakable courage and the incalculable sacrifices that they \nand their families have made for the good of their neighbors and their \ncommunity are the kinds of virtues and values that should be held up to \nour children and ourselves as something we should all aspire to.\n  Finally, in so honoring these men, we honor the hundreds of thousands \nof public safety officers across this country that, every single day, \nrisk their lives and put them and their families at risk to keep us \nsafe from harm. Their strong tradition of bravery and sacrifice keeps \nour communities safe and fills our hearts with pride for their selfless \nacts of courage for others.\n  I hope that next year when Father's Day comes around, the children \nwho have lost their fathers in this fire and those who have lost \nfathers and mothers because they were serving us will know how grateful \nwe are for their sacrifice. I hope all of my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting this resolution.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Clinton's \nresolution honoring the fallen firefighters of New York and to join \nwith her in acknowledging the bravery and commitment of Harry Ford, \nBrian Fahey, and John Downing. These men were firefighters--\nfirefighters who risked their lives and gave their lives to protect the \npublic. These men died on Sunday, June 17th, while fighting a fire in \nQueens, New York. The price they paid on our behalf was as great a \nprice as any citizen can pay. We owe these men our deepest appreciation \nand respect.\n  On Sunday, the 17th--Father's Day--Firefighters Ford, Fahey and \nDowning worked quickly to fight a fire in a local hardware store. \nThirty minutes after leaving the fire station, responding to what they \nthought was a routine call, an explosion buried the men under a pile of \nrubble. Dozens of firefighters worked to rescue the men, but they could \nnot be reached in time.\n  These men were husbands and fathers. Harry Ford leaves behind his \nwife, Denise and two sons, Harry, age 12, and Gerard, age 10. Brian \nFahey leaves us with his wife, Mary and three sons: Brendan, who is 8 \nyears old, and 3-year-old twins, Patrick and James. John Downing is \nsurvived by his wife Anne, his daughter Joanne, age 7, and his son \nMichael, who is 3. My thoughts and prayers are with these families.\n  I am humbled by their devotion to public service. Their deaths \nrepresent the ultimate sacrifice a person can make for his or her \nfellow human beings. They died while fighting a fire and it is not \nhyperbole to say that they died while making America a safer place to \nlive.\n  I am always saddened to realize that it takes a tragedy like this to \nbring attention to the needs of fire departments and firefighters \nnationwide. I hope that the memory of these three men will help \nAmericans realize the impact of firefighters on our daily lives.\n  Firefighters are almost always the first in a community to respond to \na call for help. They are on the scene of traffic accidents and \nconstruction accidents. When a natural or man-made calamity strikes--\nfrom hurricanes to school shootings to bombings--firefighters are there \nwithout fail, restoring order and saving lives.\n  Unfortunately, fire departments across the Nation struggle to find \nresources to help keep our communities safe. As the demands placed on \nfire departments have grown in volume and magnitude, the ability of \nlocal residents to support them has been put to a severe test. As a \nresult, towns and cities throughout the country are struggling mightily \nto provide the fire departments with the resources they require.\n  For these reasons I have strongly supported helping localities meet \ntheir critical objectives. Communities need more firefighters and \ncommunity firefighters need the resources to ensure that they have the \ntraining and equipment to protect themselves and the public.\n  Last year we passed an important piece of legislation called the \nFirefighter Investment and Response Enhancement Act which authorized \nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide grants to local \nfirefighters so they could purchase the equipment they need. Congress \nappropriated $100 for the program last year and the FEMA has just \ncompleted the first grant competition under the program. The demand is \nextraordinary. FEMA received nearly $3 billion worth of grant \napplications--that's 30 times more in requests that is currently \navailable.\n  No amount of funding can bring back Firefighters Ford, Fahey, and \nDowning. New fire trucks or better training programs or even more \nfirefighters cannot even begin to compensate for the loss suffered by \nthe people of Queens and the families of these brave men. For their \nlives, we are forever indebted. But for their cause, we can dedicate \nourselves to help ensure that no firefighter ever enters a burning \nbuilding without the best possible training and equipment.\n  So I stand here before you, Mr. President, and the members of this \nchamber to say that these men and their families shall not be \nforgotten. They have sacrificed their lives for us, and for this they \ndeserve no less than the highest degree of honor and respect. We here \ntoday cannot compare our own deeds to those of Harry Ford, Brian Fahey, \nand John Downing, but we can bring honor to ourselves and justice to \ntheir memories by keeping them and the needs of the fire service in \nmind as we perform our own duties.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution and preamble be agreed to en bloc, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Mr. President, a new poll conducted by the Opinion \nResearch Corporation International and released by the Brady Campaign \nto Prevent Gun Violence confirms once again that the American people \nsupport sensible gun safety legislation. Eighty-three percent of those \npolled said they support criminal background checks on all gun \npurchases at gun shows. Nearly four out of five respondents voiced \nsupport for preventing gun dealers from selling guns to anyone who has \nnot passed a background check, even if it takes more than 3 days to \ncomplete the check. And more than 8 out of every 10 people polled \nbelieve that all guns should be sold with childproof safety locks.\n  The message here is clear. People are fed up with the reports of gun \nviolence that dominate the front page and the evening news. America \nwants action.\n  The Brady Campaign's poll and countless other studies demonstrate our \nmandate. The incidents of gun violence that plague our neighborhoods \nand endanger our children confirm our moral obligation.\n  We should ignore neither. We cannot let another Congress go by \nwithout action. Let's close the loopholes in our gun laws and remember \nthe 107th Congress as a time when we made America a safer place for our \nchildren and our grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/28/senate-section/article/S7078-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7078-S7079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE REPORT ON DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISES \n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, when the 105th Congress passed the \nTransportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, TEA-21, there was a \nvigorous and close debate about whether to convert the Disadvantaged \nBusiness Enterprise Program into a race neutral program helping all \nsmall disadvantaged businesses. It troubled many members of both Houses \nthat we lacked basic information about the characteristics of DBEs and \nnon-DBEs and about alleged discrimination in the transportation \nindustry. Consequently, I introduced, with widespread bi-partisan \nsupport, an amendment to TEA-21, requiring the GAO to gather the \ninformation Congress was missing that is essential to understanding the \nDBE program. As Congressman Shuster, Chair of the House Committee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure and the floor manager for the \ntransportation bill, emphasized during the House debate, the Act ``also \nrequires a GAO study that would examine whether there is continued \nevidence of discrimination against small business owned and controlled \nby socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. I believe such \na study will lay the groundwork for future reform.''\n  Three years later, the GAO has produced a comprehensive report on the \nquestions Congress asked it to investigate. This objective, impartial \nreport entitled, ``Disadvantaged Business Enterprises: Critical \nInformation is needed to Understand Program Impact,'' GAO Report GAO-\n01-586, June 2001, is highly significant to the continuing legislative \nand judicial debate over the DBE program. Professor George R. La Noue, \none of the distinguished scholars in this field, has analyzed the GAO's \nreport. He notes that the ``DBE program has been continuously subject \nto litigation during its almost two decades of existence.'' Professor \nLa Noue concludes that ``the picture of the DBE program that emerges \nfrom the GAO report is one of essential information that is missing, or \nif available, does not support any finding of a national pattern of \ndiscrimination against DBEs.'' I am pleased to provide Professor La \nNoue's analysis of the GAO report, and I request that it be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     An Analysis of ``Disadvantaged Business Enterprises: Critical \n          Information Is Needed to Understand Program Impact''\n\n                   GAO Report [GAO-01-586 June 2001]\n\n         (By George R. La Noue, Professor of Political Science)\n\n\n Director, Project on Civil Rights and Public Contracts, University of \n                       Maryland, Baltimore County\n\n       During the 1998 consideration of the Transportation Equity \n     Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), there was extensive debate \n     in both Houses about whether to make the DBE program race-\n     neutral. In the end, a compromise was reached to retain a \n     race conscious DBE program, while requiring the General \n     Accounting Office to make a three year study of the \n     characteristics of the DBEs and non-DBEs participating in \n     federal transportation programs and to gather existing \n     evidence of discrimination against DBEs. Such information was \n     intended to provide a solid basis of facts for courts, \n     legislators, and others grappling with the complex issues of \n     the constitutionality of the DBE program.\n       The GAO study now has been released and its conclusions are \n     highly significant. GAO performed its three year study by \n     obtaining data from 52 state DOT recipients (including the \n     District of Columbia and Puerto Rico) and 31 of the largest \n     (accounting for two-thirds of transit grant funds obligated \n     in 1999) transportation districts in the country. In addition \n     GAO staff interviewed representatives of interest groups on \n     both sides of the DBE question and analyzed the results of 14 \n     transportation related disparity studies.\n       Following are GAO's major conclusions.\n\n\n                      1. Discrimination complaints\n\n       GAO conducted a survey of discrimination complaints \n     received by USDOT and recipients. GAO found that, while USDOT \n     sometimes receives written complaints of discrimination, the \n     agency does not compile or analyze the information in those \n     complaints. GAO could not supply information on the number of \n     complaints filed, investigations launched, or their outcomes. \n     (p. 33) GAO also asked state and local transit recipients \n     about complaints they received and they had better data. \n     During 1999 and 2000, 81 percent of the recipients had no \n     complaints, while a total of 31 complaints were received by \n     the other recipients. Of these, 29 were investigated and \n     findings of discrimination were made only 4 times across the \n     nation .\n       The report concluded: Other factors may also limit the \n     ability of DBEs to compete for USDOT-state assisted \n     contracts. The majority of states and transit districts we \n     surveyed had not conducted any kind of analysis to identify \n     these factors. Using anecdotal information, we identified a \n     number of factors, or barriers, such as a lack of working \n     capital and limited access to bonding, that may limit DBEs' \n     ability to compete for contracts. However, there was little \n     agreement among the officials we contacted on whether these \n     factors were attributable to discrimination. (p.7)\n       In fact GAO reported there were few if any studies by \n     government agencies or industry groups regarding barriers to \n     DBE contracting. ``USDOT officials, however, stated that they \n     believe contract bundling is one of the largest barriers for \n     DBEs in competing for transportation contracts.'' (p. 35) \n     That, of course, is not a problem caused by discrimination.\n\n\n                          2. Disparity studies\n\n       GAO also reviewed 14 transportation-specific disparity \n     studies completed between 1996 and 2000. GAO examined these \n     studies because they might be a source of evidence \n     about discrimination against DBEs and because USDOT \n     permits recipients to use disparity studies to set annual \n     goals and to determine the level of discrimination these \n     goals purportedly are remedying. GAO found that about 30 \n     percent of the recipients surveyed used disparity studies \n     to set their fy 2000 goals. (p. 29).\n       GAO found that: the limited data used to calculate \n     disparities, compounded by the methodological weaknesses, \n     create uncertainties about the studies findings. . . . While \n     not all studies suffered from every problem, each suffered \n     enough problems to make its findings questionable. We \n     recognize there are difficulties inherent in conducting \n     disparity studies and that such limitations are common to \n     social science research; however, the studies we reviewed did \n     not sufficiently address such problems or disclose their \n     limitations. (p.29)\n       GAO then detailed disparity study problems, particularly in \n     calculating DBE availability. These problems are important \n     not only because they undermine the validity of the disparity \n     studies involved, but because these same problems exist in \n     the regulations USDOT issued regarding annual goal setting. \n     USDOT as a practical matter permits recipients to use a wide \n     variety of sources to measure availability on which goals are \n     then based.\n       GAO made other specific criticisms of the studies. For \n     example, the studies did not have information on firm \n     qualifications or capacities; they failed to analyze both the \n     dollars and contracts awarded and sometimes did not have \n     subcontracting data. This\n\n[[Page S7079]]\n\n     was important: Because MBE/WBEs are more likely to be awarded \n     subcontracts than prime contracts, MBEs/WBEs may appear to be \n     underutilized when the focus remains on prime contractor \n     data. Furthermore, although some studies did include \n     calculations based on the number of contracts, all but two \n     based their determination of disparities on only the dollar \n     amounts of the contracts. Because MBEs/WBEs tend to be \n     smaller than non-MBEs/WBEs, they often are unable to perform \n     on larger contracts. Therefore, it would appear that they \n     were awarded a disproportionately smaller amount of contract \n     dollars. (p. 32) (see data on contracting awards on p. 51)\n       GAO's conclusion here is significant because the USDOT \n     regulations measure utilization only in dollars, not \n     contracts, and annual goals are set based on total dollars \n     rather than on the DBE share of subcontracting dollars.\n       Finally GAO notes that although USDOT advised recipients \n     that disparity studies should be ``reliable,'' USDOT provided \n     no guidance on what would be a reliable study. GAO concluded \n     that: USDOT's guidance does not, for example, caution against \n     using studies that contain the types of data and \n     methodological problems that we identified above. Without \n     explicit guidance on what makes a disparity study reliable, \n     states and transit authorities risk using studies that may \n     not provide accurate information in setting DBE goals. (p. \n     32)\n       GAO's finding about the unreliability of disparity studies \n     is consistent with the findings of every court that has \n     examined the merits of such studies after discovery and \n     trial.\n\n\n                       3. Discontinuing Programs\n\n       One of the arguments used in the TEA-21 debates and \n     defendant's trial briefs is the assertion, often anecdotal, \n     that without goals, DBE participation would decline \n     precipitously. The difficulty with that assertion, even if \n     true, is that the decline in DBE participation may be the \n     result of previous overutilization caused by goals set too \n     high or because when a program is struck down DBEs may have \n     little incentive to seek or maintain certification.\n       But is the basic assertion true? It turned out that 10 of \n     12 recipients with discontinued programs did not know what \n     the DBE participation result was. For instance, although \n     Michigan was cited by DBE proponents in the TEA-21 debate as \n     an example of DBE utilization decline after Michigan Road \n     Builders Assn. v. Millikin (1987) struck down the state \n     highway MBE program, GAO reports: Michigan could not provide \n     us with minority and women owned business participation data \n     in state highway contracting for the years immediately before \n     and after it discontinued its program. Furthermore, Michigan \n     officials stated that the analysis showing the decline \n     that is often cited was a one-time-only analysis and that \n     analysis is no longer available. Consequently we can not \n     verify the number cited during the debate (p.37)\n\n\n                         4. Missing information\n\n       Much of the above criticisms GAO cast in terms of a lack of \n     information, but there were other key items missing as well. \n     GAO had planned to survey all transit authorities receiving \n     federal funds, but FTA does not have a complete list. (p. 74) \n     When the 83 state and transit recipients were surveyed, only \n     40% or less of the respondents could report the gross \n     revenues of the DBEs that won contracts. Less than 25% of the \n     respondents could report the gross revenues of the DBEs that \n     did not win contracts. (pp. 52-55) Only about a third of the \n     agencies could report data on the personal net worth of DBE \n     owners, although TEA-21 regulations require that such owners \n     net worth not exceed $750,000.\n       Only a handful of respondents could report data on the \n     gross revenues or owner net worth characteristics of non-DBE \n     firms. (p. 64) While 79 respondents could report data about \n     subcontracts awarded DBEs, only 28 respondents could report \n     similar data for non-DBEs. That means that most respondents \n     did not regard comparing DBE and non-DBE subcontractor \n     utilization relevant in setting goals or in determining \n     whether discrimination exists.\n       Nor are respondents acquiring relevant information: 98.8% \n     have not conducted any study determining if awarding prime or \n     sub contracts to DBEs affects contract costs; 67.5% no study \n     on discrimination against DBE firms; 84.2% no study of \n     discrimination against DBEs by financial credit, insurance or \n     bond markets; 79.5% no study of factors making it difficult \n     for DBEs to compete; and 92.8% no study on the impact of the \n     DBE program on competition and the creation of jobs. (pp. 66-\n     68). Only 26.5% of the respondents have developed and \n     implemented use of a bidders list, although the regulations \n     require such.\n       The DBE program has been continuously subject to litigation \n     during its almost two decades of existence. Overall, the \n     picture of the DBE program that emerges from the GAO report \n     is one of essential information that is missing, or if \n     available, does not support any finding of a national pattern \n     of discrimination against DBEs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/28/senate-section/article/S7079-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, earlier this month I introduced the \nRailroad Crossing Delay Reduction Act, S. 1015, with my colleagues, \nSenators Levin and Stabenow. \n  This legislation would accelerate efforts at the U.S. Department of \nTransportation to address the issue of rail safety by requiring the \nSecretary of Transportation to issue specific regulations regarding \ntrains that block automobile traffic at railroad crossings. Currently, \nthere are no Federal limits on how long trains can block crossings. The \nRailroad Crossing Delay Reduction Act would simply minimize automobile \ntraffic delay caused by trains blocking traffic at railroad grade \ncrossings.\n  In northeastern Illinois, there are frequent blockages at rail \ncrossings. These blocked crossings prevent emergency vehicles, such as \nfire trucks, police cars, ambulances, and other related vehicles from \ngetting to their destinations during the times of need. This is a \nserious problem and one I hope to address by passage of this important \nlegislation.\n  Blocked rail crossings also delay drivers by preventing them from \ngetting to their destinations. Motorists, knowing they will have to \nwait for a train to move at blocked crossings, sometimes try to beat \nthe train or ignore signals completely. This is a threat to public \nsafety, and one that must stop. Motorists must act responsibly, but we \ncan reduce the temptation by reducing delays.\n  Trains stopped for long periods of time also tempt pedestrians to \ncross between the train cars. I've heard from local mayors in my State \nthat children, in order to get home from school, cross between the rail \ncars. This is a terrible invitation to tragedy.\n  Trains blocking crossings cause traffic problems, congestion, and \ndelay. These issues are very real. They are serious. And more \nimportantly, they are a threat to public safety. To address these \nproblems, I've introduced with my colleagues the Railroad Crossing \nDelay Reduction Act. I'm hopeful this legislation will provide for a \nsafer Illinois and a safer Nation. I urge my colleagues to join the \neffort to reduce blocked rail-grade crossings by cosponsoring and \nsupporting S. 1015.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/28/senate-section/article/S7079-3", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7079-S7080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

This selfless leadership has been \nrecognized by many organizations, including his alma maters--Indiana \nUniversity of Pennsylvania and Purdue University. Both of these \ninstitutions awarded him their distinguished alumni awards. In \naddition, he was selected one of the top fifty community college \npresidents in the United States by the Community College Leadership \nProgram at the University of Texas at Austin.\n  I hope my Senate colleagues will join me in saluting Dr. McDowell for \nhis career of public service, particularly the commitment to education \nwhich he has exhibited for the last two decades.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/28/senate-section/article/S7080-3", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONCRETE CANOE COMPETITION\n\n Mr. SESSIONS.

HOY AS PRESIDENT OF THE NEW ENGLAND BOARD OF \n                            HIGHER EDUCATION\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor today to recognize \nthe outstanding accomplishments of John C. Hoy, president of the New \nEngland Board of Higher Education, who is retiring this month. Mr. Hoy \nhas dedicated the past twenty-three years to serving the higher \neducation institutions of New England, and his leadership will be \ngreatly missed.\n  Since he became president of the Board in 1978, Mr. Hoy has led the \neffort to provide an accessible and affordable education for every New \nEnglander. To accomplish this goal, he established reforms in his own \norganization, and he also involved individuals and businesses \nthroughout New England in effective partnerships that served students \nand institutions alike.\n  Among his primary achievements was the publication of numerous \nimportant books, including studies on the relationship between higher \neducation and economic well-being in New England, the links between \nU.S. competitiveness and international aspects of higher education, and \nthe effects of legal education on the New England economy.\n  In addition, John Hoy offered much-needed support to minority \ncommunities. He encouraged greater participation by Blacks and \nHispanics in higher education, and he worked effectively to increase \nthe number of ethnic minorities completing PhD programs. He also \ncreated a scholarship program for Black South African students at South \nAfrica's open universities under apartheid.\n  John Hoy also cared deeply about the way technology was changing \nhigher education, in New England and around the country. Under his \ninitiative, the Board explored the promise of biotech industries and \nmanufacturing in New England, and worked to improve technical \neducation, with the help of both professional educators and the private \nsector. In addition, he worked with other regional boards of higher \neducation to coordinate telecommunications among higher educational \ninstitutions.\n  John C. Hoy deserves great credit for all he has done to enhance \nhigher education in New England. His accomplishments are deeply \nappreciated by all of us who know him, and I welcome this opportunity \nto wish him a long and happy retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/28/senate-section/article/S7080-5", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7080-S7081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING DR.

A bill to amend the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act of 1991 to identify certain routes in New Mexico as part \nof the Ports-to-Plains Corridor, a high priority corridor on the \nNational Highway System; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \npromote the future economic vitality of the communities in Union and \nColfax Counties, and throughout Northeast New Mexico. Our bill \ndesignates the route for New Mexico's section of the Ports-to-Plains \nHigh Priority Corridor, which runs 1000 miles from Laredo, Texas, to \nDenver, Colorado. I am pleased to have my colleague, Senator Domenici, \nas a cosponsor.\n  I am certain every senator recognizes the importance of basic \ntransportation infrastructure to economic development in their State. \nRoads and airports link a region to the world economy.\n  In New Mexico, it is well known that regions with four-lane highways \nand economical commercial air service will most readily attract new \njobs. I have long pressed at the Federal level to ensure our \ncommunities have the roads and airports they need for their long-term \neconomic health. That is why this bill I am introducing today is so \nimportant. With the passage of NAFTA, the Ports-to-Plains corridor is \ncentrally situated to serve international trade and promote economic \ndevelopment along its entire route.\n  In 1998 Congress identified the corridor from the border with Mexico \nto Denver, CO, as a High Priority Corridor on the National Highway \nSystem. Last year, a comprehensive study was undertaken to determine \nthe feasibility of creating a continuous four-lane highway along the \ncorridor. Alternative highway alignments for the trade corridor were \nalso developed and evaluated. The study was conducted under the \ndirection of a steering committee consisting of the State departments \nof transportation in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Colorado.\n  It is important to note that public input was an important facet at \nevery stage of the study. The steering committee sponsored public \nmeetings in May of last year in Clayton, NM, and five other locations \nalong the corridor. A final series of seven public meetings was held \nthis year. I note that the level of public interest and participation \nwas highest in New Mexico. Over 600 citizens attended the public \nmeeting in Raton, NM, on March 6, 2001, while a total of only 700 \npeople attended all six of the other public meetings in Texas, \nOklahoma, and Colorado clearly demonstrating the importance of this \ntrade corridor designation to Northeast New Mexico. A final report has \njust been prepared and a summary can be found on the web at \nwww.wilbursmith.com/portstoplains.\n  The study evaluated two routes for the trade corridor between \nAmarillo, TX, and Denver, CO. One route ran along U.S. Highway 64/87 \nbetween Clayton and Raton, NM. The other followed U.S. Highway 287, \nbypassing New Mexico. The feasibility study found that either route \nbetween Amarillo and Denver would result in favorable conditions. \nHowever, the alignment through New Mexico, from Clayton to Raton, along \nU.S. Highway 64/87, was dramatically more favorable than the \nalternative in terms of travel efficiency, benefits and feasibility, \nincluding travel time savings and accident cost reduction. In \nparticular:\n  The benefit-to-cost ratio of the New Mexico route was 75 percent \nbetter than for the route bypassing New Mexico.\n  The traffic volume in 2025 would be 150 percent higher on the New \nMexico corridor than on the alternative, including 25 percent more \ntrucks.\n  Two thirds of the New Mexico alignment is already four lanes wide or \nis soon slated to be widened to four lanes, compared to only one-third \nof the alternative alignment.\n  The alternative would require acquisition of more than twice the \nright-of-way and would displace nearly three times more residential and \ncommercial facilities.\n  The New Mexico alignment would serve a population of nearly 2 million \npersons, compared to 1.5 million for the alternative.\n  Finally, the construction costs of the New Mexico alignment are $175 \nmillion less than the route bypassing New Mexico.\n  The alternative route had a very slight advantage over the New Mexico \nalignment only in economic development benefits.\n  With the feasibility study results now complete, The New Mexico \nHighway Commission last week voted unanimously to support the \ndesignation New Mexico's portion of the Ports-to-Plains Trade High \nPriority Corridor along U.S. Highway 64/87 between Clayton and Raton. \nThe designated route connects into Texas along Highway 87 to Dumas, and \nto Denver along Interstate 25.\n  Very simply, this bill advances the same goal, to designate the route \nbetween Clayton and Raton in New Mexico as part of the Ports-to-Plains \nCorridor. As the huge turnout for the public meeting in Raton in March \nclearly demonstrates, there is overwhelming public support for this \nroute throughout Union and Colfax Counties in New Mexico. There is also \nvery strong support in neighboring Las Animas and Pueblo Counties in \nColorado, including the cities of Trinidad and Pueblo.\n  In Texas, the state already plans to widen to four lanes its portion \nof the route between Dumas and the New Mexico state line. In New \nMexico, the Citizens' Highway Assessment Task Force identified the \nroute between Clayton and Raton as a priority to upgrade to four lanes. \nThe initial needs and purposes study for the project is currently \nlisted in New Mexico's five-year Statewide Transportation Improvement \nStudy, STIP.\n  In addition to possible routes north of Amarillo, TX, I should also \nnote that the feasibility study considered a variety of alternative \nroutes south of Amarillo, on down to Laredo. However, Congress already \nindicated its preferred southern leg in the Omnibus Appropriations Act \nof 2001, though the\n\n[[Page S7086]]\n\nCongressional designation of the southern route was enacted long before \nwe had the results of the feasibility study. The Texas Transportation \nCommission is voting today to confirm Congress' designation of the \nsouthern leg.\n  The studies have now been completed. The results are in. The route \nsouth of Amarillo has been set. Congress should now complete the \ndesignation of the final leg of the Ports-to-Plains Trade Corridor by \npassing our bill.\n  The time to act is now. Once the route is established the States can \nmove forward with their regional and statewide transportation plans, \nenvironmental studies, design work, acquisition of rights of way, and \ninitial construction of the most critical segments.\n  I thank Senator Domenici for cosponsoring the bill, and I hope all \nsenators will join us in support of this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the New Mexico State Highway \nCommission's resolution and the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1118\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The first alternative \n     designated N1, goes from Amarillo (following U.S. 287) to \n     Dumas, Texas, then follows U.S. 87 and U.S. 64/87 from Dumas, \n     through Clayton, New Mexico, to Raton, New Mexico, and then \n     continues to Denver following I-25 through Trinidad, Pueblo, \n     and Colorado Springs, Colorado. The second alternative, \n     designated N4, bypasses New Mexico by following U.S. 287 \n     through Boise City, Oklahoma to Lamar and Limon, Colorado and \n     then follows I-70 to Denver; and\n       Whereas, the public participation process of the Study \n     reflects overwhelming support in the communities and related \n     areas of Clayton, Raton, Trinidad, and Pueblo for the N1 \n     alternative; and\n       Whereas, the N1 alternative will better serve the intent of \n     Congress in creating the High Priority Corridor program \n     because it will integrate more regional population centers \n     and provide greater opportunities for economic development \n     than the N4 alternative, which bypasses these population \n     centers and thus limits the potential for economic \n     development; and\n       Whereas, the N4 alternative will cost more to construct \n     than the N1 alternative because the N4 alternative will \n     require the construction of more new four land highway, \n     including the cost of right of way acquisition; and\n       Whereas, portions of I-25 in alternative N1 from Denver to \n     Colorado Springs are being improved and need additional \n     improvements to better serve current needs and this \n     Commission understands that a bypass on the Interstate \n     Highway System for Colorado Springs is in conceptual plans of \n     the Colorado Department of Transportation: Now, therefore it \n     is\n       Resolved by the State Highway Commission, That it supports \n     the N1 alternative to bring the Ports to Plains Corridor \n     through New Mexico on U.S. 64/87, including upgrading U.S. \n     64/87 in New Mexico to a four-lane highway, in order to \n     achieve the intent of Congress in the High Priority Corridor \n     program to integrate regional population centers and provide \n     opportunities for economic development; and it is further\n       Resolved, That the State Highway Commission supports \n     additional federal funding for improvements to I-25 in \n     Colorado and a bypass of Colorado Springs if that plan is \n     adopted by the Colorado Department of Transportation; and it \n     is further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be provided to the \n     Ports to Plains Project Steering Committee and feasibility \n     study consultant, the Texas, Oklahoma, and Colorado \n     Departments of Transportation, the Federal Highway \n     Administration, New Mexico, Division, the governing bodies of \n     the municipalities of Trinidad, Pueblo, and Colorado Springs, \n     Colorado, Clayton, Des Moines, Raton, Springer, Cimarron, \n     Eagle Nest, Angel Fire, Taos, Questa, and Red River, New \n     Mexico and Union, Colfax, and Taos Counties, New Mexico, the \n     New Mexico Municipal League, the New Mexico Association of \n     Counties, all members of the New Mexico Congressional \n     delegation, and all members of the New Mexico Legislative \n     leadership.\n       Adopted in open meeting by the State Highway Commission on \n     June 21, 2001.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Ports-to-\nPlains NAFTA corridor designation through New Mexico, along U.S. \nHighway 64/87 from Clayton to Raton.\n  From the beginning, I have vigorously supported the proposed route \nthrough New Mexico. In fact, while a member of the Senate \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, I worked to make the \nproposed route through New Mexico a possibility.\n  Further, representatives from my office attended a public comment \nmeeting on the route in Raton, New Mexico in March 2001. I thought it \nimportant that the more than three hundred New Mexicans in attendance \nknow that I was behind them.\n  I have supported the route from the beginning because I knew that it \nwould be good for the people of my state and good for the country.\n  The conclusions of the feasibility study give clear and convincing \nevidence supporting what I had suspected all along. The route through \nNew Mexico, known as the N-1 route, is the best choice.\n  In order to demonstrate that a particular infrastructure best meets \nthe public interest over another, one must consider a host of factors.\n  Those factors include considering the public's preferences, the cost \nof the competing projects, and the relative efficiency of implementing \neach project.\n  The feasibility study concluded that the Ports-to-Plain route best \nmeets this criteria.\n  The traveling public overwhelmingly prefers the route through New \nMexico, which carries 28,000 vehicles per day. The competing proposal \nonly has traffic flows of 11,000 vehicles each day.\n  The N-1 route through New Mexico represents the best deal for the \ntaxpayer since it costs $175 million less than the competing route.\n  Last, the route through New Mexico would be the most efficient to \nimplement since sixty-seven percent of the highway has already been \nprogrammed for four-lane expansion. The competing route has only \nprogrammed thirty-seven percent of the road for crucial four-lane \nimprovements.\n  Furthermore, the State of New Mexico is committed to securing the \nPorts-to-Plains designation. Evidencing that commitment, the State's \nHighway Commission recently passed a resolution supporting the Ports-to \nPlains designation from Dumas, Texas to Raton, New Mexico.\n  I pledge to continue working to ensure that the Ports-to-Plains \ncorridor is designated through New Mexico. The route through Raton, New \nMexico is the most efficient and cost effective\n\n[[Page S7087]]\n\noption for the U.S. taxpayer, furthers the interest of the people of my \nState, and is supported by the State government.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Cochran, \n        Mrs. Carnahan, Ms. Snowe, and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 1119. A bill to require the Secretary of Defense to carry out a \nstudy of the extent to the coverage of members of the Selected Reserve \nof the Ready Reserve of the Armed Forces under health benefits plans \nand to submit a report on the study of Congress, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce important \nlegislation that will impact the health and readiness of the Selected \nReserve. The Selected Reserves includes over 900,000 dedicated men and \nwomen divided between the National Guard and the Reserves. Over the \npast ten years, this force has become increasingly critical to carrying \nout our Nation's defense, whether deploying to far-flung regions of the \nglobe or backfilling for other units making those deployments.\n  The country simply cannot meet its commitments without these proud \ncitizen-soldiers. It follows, then, that steps to increase the \nreadiness of the Selected Reserves will have a positive effect on the \nreadiness of the entire force. It was this goal in mind that I \nintroduce the Health Care for Selected Reserve Act.\n  This legislation will ensure that all members of the drilling \nreserves have adequate health insurance. The legislation acknowledges \nour reserves' continuing contributions to the defense of the Nation and \nexpresses the need for full medical coverage. The legislation will \ncommission an independent study on the extent of insurance shortfalls \nand examine the feasibility of extending the TRICARE or FEHBP program \nto the reserves.\n  Currently, when a member of the Selected Reserve goes on active duty \nover 60 days, they are provided full coverage under the TRICARE Prime \nprogram conducted through the active military's medical treatment \nfacilities. But when reservists are not on active duty, they are left \nto gain insurance through their civilian employers. Like the rest of \nsociety, most gain adequate coverage through their employers like the \nrest of society, but, mirroring broader shortfalls in the wider \npopulation, many go without any health coverage at all. This shortfall \nhas an even more noticeable affect on the country because it affects \nmilitary readiness.\n  There is also an underlying issue of fairness here. It seems wrong to \nme that one week someone can be patrolling the skies over Iraq with \nfull coverage and the next week they can have no health coverage at \nall. That situation gives the impression that the National Guard and \nthe Reserves are the poorly-paid subcontractor to the active duty \nforce. If we really believe in the idea of the Total Force, we cannot \nlet these health coverage shortfalls exist.\n  I want to thank the other sponsors of this bill for helping me craft \nthis bill. Senators DeWine, Daschle, Cochran, Carnahan, Snowe, and \nJohnson are deeply interested in this issue, and I look forward to \nworking with them to develop a set of concrete steps to meet this \nproblem. I urge the legislation's adoption.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1119\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve of the Armed \n     Forces is the element of the Armed Forces of the United \n     States that has the capability quickly to augment the active \n     duty forces of the Armed Forces successfully in times of \n     crisis.\n       (2) The Selected Reserve has been assigned increasingly \n     critical levels of responsibility for carrying out the \n     worldwide military missions of the Armed Forces since the end \n     of the Cold War.\n       (3) Members of the Selected Reserve have served proudly as \n     mobilized forces in numerous theaters from Europe to the \n     Pacific and South America, indeed, around the world.\n       (4) The active duty forces of the Armed Forces cannot \n     successfully perform all of the national security missions of \n     the Armed Forces without augmentation by the Selected \n     Reserve.\n       (5) The high and increasing tempo of activity of the \n     Selected Reserve causes turbulence in the relationships of \n     members of the Selected Reserve with their families, \n     employers, and reserve units.\n       (6) The turbulence often results from lengthy, sometimes \n     year-long, absences of the members of the Selected Reserve \n     from their families and their civilian jobs in the \n     performance of military duties necessary for the execution of \n     essential missions.\n       (7) Family turbulence includes the difficulties associated \n     with vacillation between coverage of members' families for \n     health care under civilian health benefits plans and coverage \n     under the military health benefits options.\n       (8) Up to 200,000 members of the Selected Reserve, \n     including, in particular, self-employed members, do not have \n     adequate health benefits.\n\n     SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that steps should be taken to \n     ensure that every member of the Selected Reserve of the Ready \n     Reserve of the Armed Forces and the member's family have \n     health care benefits that are adequate--\n       (1) to ease the transition of the member from civilian life \n     to full-time military life during a mobilization of reserve \n     forces;\n       (2) to minimize the adverse effects of a mobilization on \n     the member's ability to provide for the member's family to \n     have ready access to adequate health care; and\n       (3) to improve readiness and retention in the Selected \n     Reserve.\n\n     SEC. 3. STUDY OF HEALTH CARE BENEFITS COVERAGE FOR MEMBERS OF \n                   THE SELECTED RESERVE.\n\n       (a) Requirement for Study.--The Secretary of Defense shall \n     enter into a contract with a federally funded research and \n     development center to carry out a study of the needs of \n     members of the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve of the \n     Armed Forces and their families for health care benefits.\n       (b) Report.--(1) Not later than March 1, 2002, the \n     Secretary shall submit a report on the results of the study \n     to Congress.\n       (2) The report shall include the following matters:\n       (A) Descriptions, and an analysis, of how members of the \n     Selected Reserve and their dependents currently obtain \n     coverage for health care benefits, together with statistics \n     on enrollments in health care benefits plans.\n       (B) The percentage of members of the Selected Reserve, and \n     dependents of such members, who are not covered by any health \n     insurance or other health benefits plan, together with the \n     reasons for the lack of coverage.\n       (C) Descriptions of the disruptions in health benefits \n     coverage that a mobilization of members of the Selected \n     Reserve causes for the members and their families.\n       (D) At least three recommended options for cost-effectively \n     preventing or reducing the disruptions by means of extending \n     health care benefits under the Defense Health Program or the \n     Federal Employees Health Benefits program to all members of \n     the Selected Reserve and their families, together with an \n     estimate of the costs of individual coverage and family \n     coverage under each option.\n       (E) A profile of the health status of members of the \n     Selected Reserve and their dependents, together with a \n     discussion of how that profile would affect the cost of \n     providing adequate health benefits coverage for that \n     population of beneficiaries.\n       (F) An analysis of the likely effects that providing \n     enhanced health benefits coverage to members of the Selected \n     Reserve and their families would have on recruitment and \n     retention for, and the readiness of, the Selected Reserve.\n       (3) In formulating the options to recommend under paragraph \n     (2)(D), the Secretary shall consider an expansion of the \n     TRICARE program or the Federal Employees Health Benefits \n     program to cover the members of the Selected Reserve and \n     their families.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I join with several important \nleaders of the Senate's National Guard Caucus to introduce S. 1119, \nwhich we believe will one day result in improved health care for Guard \nand Reserve members and their families.\n  It is appropriate that we introduce this now, during a week in which \nSenate floor debate has focused almost exclusively on health care, with \nseveral lively discussions about the importance of expanding health \ncoverage to the uninsured.\n  Unfortunately, Guard members and leaders in South Dakota tell me that \nmany of the uninsured serve in the National Guard. Many of them work \nfor small businesses that cannot afford to offer health insurance to \ntheir employees. Some of them have insurance for themselves, but cannot \nafford to insure their dependents.\n  Meanwhile, this Nation is utilizing the Guard more heavily than at \nany other time in our Nation's history. During the Cold War, a Guard \nmember\n\n[[Page S7088]]\n\nmight serve and retire without ever being called to active duty. \nStaring with the Persian Gulf War and continuing to this day in Bosnia, \nKosovo and Iraq, reservists are serving alongside the active duty \nmilitary during deployments that can last 6 months or more.\n  Each of these deployments strains the Guard member's employer, who \ntemporarily gives up a valued employee. And it strains individual \nsoldiers and their families, even if they have health insurance, \nbecause employer-provided coverage often lapses during periods of \nactive duty.\n  The premise of our bill is that health coverage can help the Guard \nattract and retain top-flight personnel and also improve readiness; \nthat it can help service members and their families, especially in \ncoping with mobilization; and that it can relieve some of the burdens \nfaced today by National Guard employers, particularly small businesses.\n  This bill lays the groundwork for a solution. S. 1119 would authorize \na study by a non-government research center to explore the extent of \nthe problem and recommend at least three cost-effective solutions, \nincluding the possibility of opening the TRICARE program or the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Program to reservists and their families. The \nstudy would look at disruptions to health coverage caused by \nmobilizations and analyze the likely impact of enhanced health care on \nrecruitment and retention.\n  We have developed this bill in consultation with the Military \nCoalition and several of its members. I appreciate their concern for \nthis problem and their work to help develop a solution. In this regard, \nI would particularly like to acknowledge the role of the Enlisted \nAssociation of the National Guard of the United States, the Reserve \nOfficers Association, the National Guard Association of the United \nStates, and the Retired Officers Association.\n  I hope and believe that today's bill introduction can be an important \nstep toward providing adequate health care for members of the South \nDakota National Guard and other reservists around the Nation, who do so \nmuch on behalf of their communities, their States, and this Nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mr. Smith of Oregon):\n  S. 1120. A bill to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to \nincrease the authorization of appropriations for fiscal year 2002, and \nto authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2003, to combat HIV and \nAIDS, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this week, as the United Nations meets to \nprepare a global strategy to combat the growing worldwide HIV-AIDS \ncrisis, I am proud to introduce legislation aimed at ensuring that the \nUnited States continues to be a leader in the fight against this deadly \ndisease.\n  I am pleased to once again join my good friend and colleague from \nOregon, Senator Smith, in introducing this bill. Last year, we teamed \nup to offer the Global AIDS Prevention Act that doubled funding for the \nUnited States Agency for International Development's HIV-AIDS programs. \nNot only was this legislation included in broader international health \nlegislation which became law, it was also fully funded for the current \nfiscal year. This year, we are looking to build upon last year's \nsuccess by again doubling the amount USAID spends on fighting the \nglobal HIV-AIDS epidemic.\n  The Global AIDS Research and Relief Act would authorize $600 million \nin each of the next two fiscal years. It is designed to complement \ninternational HIV-AIDS relief efforts so that a truly global response \ncan be implemented in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, Southeast \nAsia, Russia, and all places where people are suffering from this \nepidemic.\n  In the 20 years since AIDS was first recognized, 22 million people \nworldwide have died from the disease, and 36 million more are living \nwith HIV or AIDS today. Of those living with the disease, 95 percent \nlive in the developing world where advanced technology to combat AIDS \nis not readily available. It is predicted that AIDS will soon become \nthe deadliest infectious epidemic in world history, surpassing the \nPlague, which killed an estimated 25 million people.\n  This new chapter in the AIDS epidemic is especially tragic because \nits growth is preventable. While there is no cure for this horrible \ndisease, progress is being made. New medical breakthroughs afford HIV-\npositive people a much greater life expectancy than they would have had \nten years ago. Unfortunately, these efforts are not reaching the \nNations whose people need help the most. By increasing authorization \nfor USAID to establish and expand these valuable initiatives in \ndeveloping countries, our bill helps to remedy this disparity in the \nquality of care.\n  Specifically, the bill addresses the need for increased voluntary \ntesting and counseling, so that we can educate people and keep its \nspread in check. With this funding authorization, the USAID will be \nable to provide more for the most vulnerable constituencies, children \nand young adults. The money will be used for drugs like neviropine, \nwhich is given to expectant HIV-positive mothers to prevent the spread \nof the infection to their unborn children.\n  The United States is a trendsetter in efforts to address the pandemic \nof HIV-AIDS. Through the work of USAID, we have instituted prevention, \ncare, and treatment programs in some of the hardest-hit countries in \nsub-Saharan Africa. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has \nworked with partners in other countries to expand treatment programs. \nOther agencies such as the Department of Labor, the Department of \nAgriculture and the Department of Defense are contributing to the \neffort to end the spread of AIDS. But far more remains to be done.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure and ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1120\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Global AIDS Research and \n     Relief Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) AIDS.--The term ``AIDS'' means the acquired immune \n     deficiency syndrome.\n       (2) Association.--The term ``Association'' means the \n     International Development Association.\n       (3) Bank.--The term ``Bank'' or ``World Bank'' means the \n     International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.\n       (4) HIV.--The term ``HIV'' means the human immunodeficiency \n     virus, the pathogen, which causes AIDS.\n       (5) HIV/AIDS.--The term ``HIV/AIDS'' means, with respect to \n     an individual, an individual who is infected with HIV or \n     living with AIDS.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the Surgeon General of the United States, \n     the epidemic of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune \n     deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) will soon become the worst \n     epidemic of infectious disease in recorded history, eclipsing \n     both the bubonic plague of the 1300s and the influenza \n     epidemic of 1918-1919 which killed more than 20,000,000 \n     people worldwide.\n       (2) According to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/\n     AIDS (UNAIDS), more than 36,100,000 people in the world today \n     are living with HIV/AIDS, of which approximately 95 percent \n     live in the developing world.\n       (3) UNAIDS data shows that among children age 15 and under \n     worldwide, more than 4,300,000 have died from AIDS, more than \n     1,400,000 are living with the disease; and in 1 year alone--\n     2000--an estimated 600,000 became infected, of which over 90 \n     percent were babies born to HIV-positive women.\n       (4) Although sub-Saharan Africa has only 10 percent of the \n     world's population, it is home to more than 25,300,000--\n     roughly 70 percent--of the world's HIV/AIDS cases.\n       (5) Worldwide, there have already been an estimated \n     21,800,000 deaths because of HIV/AIDS, of which more than 80 \n     percent occurred in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (6) According to UNAIDS, by the end of 1999, 13,200,000 \n     children have lost at least one parent to AIDS, including \n     12,100,000 children in sub-Saharan Africa, and are thus \n     considered AIDS orphans.\n       (7) At current infection and growth rates for HIV/AIDS, the \n     National Intelligence Council estimates that the number of \n     AIDS orphans worldwide will increase dramatically, \n     potentially increasing threefold or more in the next 10 \n     years, contributing to economic decay, social fragmentation, \n     and political destabilization in already volatile and \n     strained societies. Children without care or hope are often \n     drawn into prostitution, crime, substance abuse, or child \n     soldiery.\n\n[[Page S7089]]\n\n       (8) The discovery of a relatively simple and inexpensive \n     means of interrupting the transmission of HIV from an \n     infected mother to the unborn child--namely with nevirapine \n     (NVP), which costs $4 a tablet--has created a great \n     opportunity for an unprecedented partnership between the \n     United States Government and the governments of Asian, \n     African, and Latin American countries to reduce mother-to-\n     child transmission (also known as ``vertical transmission'') \n     of HIV.\n       (9) According to UNAIDS, if implemented this strategy will \n     decrease the proportion of orphans that are HIV-infected and \n     decrease infant and child mortality rates in these developing \n     regions.\n       (10) A mother-to-child antiretroviral drug strategy can be \n     a force for social change, providing the opportunity and \n     impetus needed to address often longstanding problems of \n     inadequate services and the profound stigma associated with \n     HIV-infection and the AIDS disease. Strengthening the health \n     infrastructure to improve mother-and-child health, antenatal, \n     delivery, and postnatal services, and couples counseling \n     generates enormous spillover effects toward combating the \n     AIDS epidemic in developing regions.\n       (11) A January 2000 United States National Intelligence \n     Estimate (NIE) report on the global infectious disease threat \n     concluded that the economic costs of infectious diseases--\n     especially HIV/AIDS--are already significant and could reduce \n     GDP by as much as 20 percent or more by 2010 in some sub-\n     Saharan African nations.\n       (12) The HIV/AIDS epidemic is of increasing concern in \n     other regions of the world, with UNAIDS estimating that there \n     are more than 5,800,000 cases in South and Southeast Asia, \n     that the rate of HIV infection in the Caribbean is second \n     only to sub-Saharan Africa, and that HIV infections have \n     doubled in just 2 years in the former Soviet Union.\n       (13) Russia is the new ``hot spot'' for the pandemic and \n     more Russians are expected to be diagnosed with HIV/AIDS by \n     the end of 2001 than all cases from previous years combined.\n       (14) Despite the discouraging statistics on the spread of \n     HIV/AIDS, some developing nations--such as Uganda, Senegal, \n     and Thailand--have implemented prevention programs that have \n     substantially curbed the rate of HIV infection.\n       (15) Accordingly, United States financial support for \n     medical research, education, and disease containment as a \n     global strategy has beneficial ramifications for millions of \n     Americans and their families who are affected by this \n     disease, and the entire population, which is potentially \n     susceptible.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) help prevent human suffering through the prevention, \n     diagnosis, and treatment of HIV/AIDS; and\n       (2) help ensure the viability of economic development, \n     stability, and national security in the developing world by \n     advancing research to--\n       (A) understand the causes associated with HIV/AIDS in \n     developing countries; and\n       (B) assist in the development of an AIDS vaccine.\n\n     SEC. 3. ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE AUTHORITIES TO COMBAT HIV AND \n                   AIDS.\n\n       Paragraphs (4) through (6) of section 104(c) of the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151b(c)) are amended to \n     read as follows:\n       ``(4)(A) Congress recognizes the growing international \n     dilemma of children with the human immunodeficiency virus \n     (HIV) and the merits of intervention programs aimed at this \n     problem. Congress further recognizes that mother-to-child \n     transmission prevention strategies can serve as a major force \n     for change in developing regions, and it is, therefore, a \n     major objective of the foreign assistance program to control \n     the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic.\n       ``(B) The agency primarily responsible for administering \n     this part shall--\n       ``(i) coordinate with UNAIDS, UNICEF, WHO, national and \n     local governments, other organizations, and other Federal \n     agencies to develop and implement effective strategies to \n     prevent vertical transmission of HIV; and\n       ``(ii) coordinate with those organizations to increase \n     intervention programs and introduce voluntary counseling and \n     testing, antiretroviral drugs, replacement feeding, and other \n     strategies.\n       ``(5)(A) Congress expects the agency primarily responsible \n     for administering this part to make the human \n     immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the acquired immune \n     deficiency syndrome (AIDS) a priority in the foreign \n     assistance program and to undertake a comprehensive, \n     coordinated effort to combat HIV and AIDS.\n       ``(B) Assistance described in subparagraph (A) shall \n     include help providing--\n       ``(i) primary prevention and education;\n       ``(ii) voluntary testing and counseling;\n       ``(iii) medications to prevent the transmission of HIV from \n     mother to child;\n       ``(iv) programs to strengthen and broaden health care \n     systems infrastructure and the capacity of health care \n     systems in developing countries to deliver HIV/AIDS \n     pharmaceuticals, prevention, and treatment to those afflicted \n     with HIV/AIDS; and\n       ``(v) care for those living with HIV or AIDS.\n       ``(6)(A) In addition to amounts otherwise available for \n     such purpose, there is authorized to be appropriated to the \n     President $600,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2002 and \n     2003 to carry out paragraphs (4) and (5).\n       ``(B) Of the funds authorized to be appropriated under \n     subparagraph (A), not less than 65 percent is authorized to \n     be available through United States and foreign \n     nongovernmental organizations, including private and \n     voluntary organizations, for-profit organizations, religious \n     affiliated organizations, educational institutions, and \n     research facilities.\n       ``(C)(i) Of the funds authorized to be appropriated by \n     subparagraph (A), priority should be given to programs that \n     address the support and education of orphans in sub-Saharan \n     Africa, including AIDS orphans and prevention strategies for \n     vertical transmission referred to in paragraph (4)(A).\n       ``(ii) Assistance made available under this subsection, and \n     assistance made available under chapter 4 of part II to carry \n     out the purposes of this subsection, may be made available \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law that restricts \n     assistance to foreign countries.\n       ``(D) Of the funds authorized to be appropriated by \n     subparagraph (A), not more than 7 percent may be used for the \n     administrative expenses of the agency primarily responsible \n     for carrying out this part of this Act in support of \n     activities described in paragraphs (4) and (5).\n       ``(E) Funds appropriated under this paragraph are \n     authorized to remain available until expended.''.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague \nSenator Boxer to introduce the ``Global AIDS Research and Relief Act of \n2001.'' This important legislation increases the authorization for \nUSAID to carry out its prevention, treatment and care programs to $600 \nmillion for fiscal years 2002 and 2003. These additional resources will \nhelp prevent human suffering through the prevention, diagnosis and \ntreatment of HIV/AIDS.\n  The world is facing a global health problem of disastrous proportions \nin the global HIV/AIDS pandemic. In the past year, this issue has \nreceived much needed attention from the international community and the \nU.S. Government. But, unfortunately, our efforts and the efforts of \nother governments, the private sector, and foundations have not been \nenough and the pandemic continues to wreak havoc on the lives of \nmillions of people around the world. The United States plays a key role \nin the global effort and our bill seeks to strengthen those efforts.\n  Over 58 million people have already been infected with HIV/AIDS and \n36 million people are living today with HIV/AIDS. Of those living with \nthe disease, over 95 percent live in the developing world where the \neconomic and social structures in those countries are being destroyed. \nSub-Saharan Africa is truly an epicenter for this disease, but \nincreasingly, people are becoming infected in Asia, the Caribbean, and \nEastern Europe. Soon, HIV/AIDS will become the worst infectious disease \nepidemic in recorded history, causing more deaths than both the bubonic \nplague of the 1930s and the influenza epidemic of 1918-1919.\n  Young adults and children have been particularly hard hit by the \npandemic. Among children under the age of 15, more than 4.3 million \nhave died of AIDS and more than 1.4 million are living with AIDS. Just \nlast year, 600,000 young people became infected and over 90 percent \nwere babies born to HIV-positive mothers.\n  HIV/AIDS is also hitting those between the ages of 15--24. In some \nsub-Saharan African countries, the infection rates are more than 40 \npercent in this population. These high infection rates will have a \nsignificant impact on the social and economic health of developing \nnations. The United States Census Bureau has found the life expectancy \nin sub-Saharan Africa has fallen almost 30 years within a decade. By \n2010, it is estimated that the average life expectancy in Botswana will \nbe 29 years of age, 30 years in Swaziland, 33 years in Namibia, and 36 \nyears in South Africa. Millions of young adults are losing their lives \nand this will significantly impact the economic and political viability \nof these Nations. Some Nations are estimated to have a reduced GDP of \nat least 20 percent or more by 2010 due to decreased productivity of \nits workers. Over the past thirty years, the United States has invested \nmillions of dollars in democracy building programs and economic \nstabilization programs. HIV/AIDS has quickly erased much of this \nprogress.\n  As we look to the future of the world, we are also confronted by the \nproblem of AIDS orphans. USAID estimates that there will be 44 million \norphans by 2010. Without a parent or family to\n\n[[Page S7090]]\n\ncare for them, many will be drawn into prostitution, crime, substance \nabuse or child soldiery. Furthermore, without stability many of these \nchildren will not seek help when they are sick. AIDS threatens to \nreverse years of steady progress of child survival in developing \ncountries.\n  The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the young will have a significant \nimpact on the economic future of the world. The pandemic is \ncontributing to economic decay, social fragmentation, and political \ndestabilization in already strained and volatile societies. These \nfactors are of particular concern in South and Southeast Asia, the \nCaribbean, Eastern Europe, and the former Soviet Union where the \npandemic is just beginning to become a problem. It is estimated that \nthere are more than 5.8 million cases in South and Southeast Asia and \nthe rate of HIV infection in the Caribbean is second only to sub-\nSaharan Africa. Russia is the new ``hot spot'' for HIV/AIDS. More \nRussians are expected to be diagnosed with HIV/AIDS by the end of 2001 \nthan all cases from previous years combined. Many of these countries do \nnot yet have prevention, treatment and care programs in place and we \nmust equip our federal agencies with the resources and flexibility \nneeded to address the pandemic in all of these areas.\n  The United States is seen as a leader in efforts to address the \nepidemic. We contributed almost $500 million to fight HIV/AIDS in \nfiscal year 2001. Through programs at the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment, we have instituted prevention, care and treatment programs \nin some of the worst hit countries in sub-Saharan Africa. At the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, we have worked with \npartners in other countries to expand treatment and home-based care \nprograms. Other agencies, including the Department of Labor, the \nDepartment of Defense, and the Department of Agriculture have \ncontributed in their areas of expertise.\n  This legislation recognizes the growing problems encountered by \nchildren around the world and instructs USAID to make efforts to \nprevent mother-to-child transmission and orphan programs a major \nobjective of their program. Through coordination with UN agencies, \nnational and local governments, non-governmental organizations and \nfoundations, the U.S. government shall implement effective strategies \nto prevent vertical transmission of HIV. Further, the bill states that \nthe agency must strengthen and expand all of its primary prevention and \neducation programs.\n  This bill also calls on USAID to continue to provide support to \nresearch that will help the world to understand the causes associated \nwith HIV/AIDS in developing countries and assist in the development of \nan effective AIDS vaccine.\n  I believe the ``Global AIDS Research and Relief Act of 2001'' can \nmake a profound difference in the lives of millions of people facing \nthe HIV/AIDS epidemic. I ask all my colleagues to join us and support \nthis legislation at this critical moment in the spread of the disease.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Craig, and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 1123.

Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senator \nCraig and Senator Kohl to introduce a modified version of the ``Dairy \nPromotion Fairness Act,'' which I introduced earlier this year. This \nlegislation provides equity to domestic producers who have been paying \ninto the Promotion Program while importers have gotten a free ride.\n  I introduce a revised version of this legislation, after I received \nsuggestions on how to improve this legislation from America's dairy \nfarmers. Their input is vital to enacting effective dairy legislation, \nand I thank all the dairy producers of my State not only for their \nviews, but also their work to strengthen Wisconsin's rural economy.\n  Since the National Dairy Promotion and Research Board conducts only \ngeneric promotion and general product research, domestic farmers and \nimporters alike benefit from these actions. The Dairy Promotion \nFairness Act requires that all dairy product importers contribute to \nthe program.\n  Unlike other agricultural commodity checkoff promotion programs, such \nas beef, cotton and eggs, the dairy checkoff program collects funds \nsolely from domestic producers. Importers of dairy products do not have \nto pay into the program, yet they reap the benefits of dairy promotion.\n  I would also like to make sure my colleagues are aware that June is \nDairy Month. This tradition of honoring our hard working dairy farmers, \nbegan as ``National Milk Month'' first held in the summer of 1937. \nWisconsin celebrates this proud heritage every June by honoring our \npast accomplishments of Wisconsin as America's Dairy State.\n  Wisconsin became a leader in the dairy industry after the first dairy \ncow came to Wisconsin in the 1800's and by 1930 it earned the nickname, \nAmerica's Dairyland. Dairy history and the State's history have been \nintertwined from the beginning. The people of Wisconsin are defined by \nthe image of dairy farmers: hardworking, honest and the heirs of a \ngreat tradition.\n  I would like to share with you some of the accomplishments of \nWisconsin's Dairy Farmers. Wisconsin is the No. 1 cheese-producing \nState in the country, with 28 percent of the total annual U.S. cheese \nproduction. Wisconsin's 130 cheese plants produce more than 350 \nvarieties, types and styles of Wisconsin cheese.\n  We produce more than 2 billion pounds of cheese annually. We have \nmore licensed cheese makers than any other state with some of the most \nstringent state standards for cheesemaking and overall dairy product \nquality. We lead the nation in the production of specialty cheeses, \nsuch as Gorgonzola, Gruyere (gru-yure), Asiago, Provolone, Aged \nCheddar, Gouda, Blue, Feta and many others. In fact, we are the only \nproducer of Limburger cheese in the country.\n  Colby, Wisconsin is the home Colby cheese. And Brick cheese was \ninvented in Wisconsin, Brick is named for its shape, and because cheese \nmakers originally used bricks to press moisture from the cheese.\n  Wisconsinites have recognized this proud tradition by holding over \n100 dairy celebrations across our State, including dairy breakfasts, \nice cream socials, cooking demonstrations, festivals and other events. \nThese events are all designed to make the public aware of the quality, \nvariety and great taste of Wisconsin dairy products and to honor the \nproducers who make it all possible.\n  We must follow the lead of Wisconsin, and honor our dairy farmers by \npassing this legislation and halting the free ride dairy importers \ncurrently receive.\n  The Dairy Promotion Fairness Act supports the dairy marketing board's \nefforts to educate consumers on the nutritional value of dairy \nproducts. It also treats our farmers fairly by asking them not to bear \nthe entire financial burden for a promotional program that benefits \nimporters and domestic producers alike.\n  We have put our own producers at a competitive disadvantage for far \ntoo long. It's high time importers paid for their fair share of the \nprogram.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Allard, Mr. Bayh, \n        Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Edwards, Mr. \n        Fitzgerald, Mr. Frist, Mr. Graham, Mr. Helms, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Leahy, \n        Mr. Levin, Mr. Reed, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Smith of New \n        Hampshire, Mr. Specter, Mr. Torricelli, and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 1125. A bill to conserve global bear populations by prohibiting \nthe importation, exportation, and interstate trade of bear viscera and \nitems, products, or substances containing, or labeled or advertised as \ncontaining, bear viscera, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, incredibly, there is a good chance that \ntoday someone will put on a facial cream, apply a medicine, or even eat \na\n\n[[Page S7091]]\n\nsoup that contains bear parts. Bear bile, gallbladders, paws and claws \nare found in culinary delicacies, cosmetics and traditional ethnic \nmedicines in Asia, and these parts often fetch thousands of dollars. A \ncup of bear paw soup has sold for up to $1,500 in Taiwan, and wildlife \nexperts say that a gallbladder can command tens of thousands of dollars \non the Asian market. Not surprisingly, the lure of astronomical profits \noverseas has spawned rampant poaching of American bears. The United \nStates Fish and Wildlife Service continues to find bear carcasses \nrotting with their gallbladders ripped out and their paws sliced off. \nJust today, creator Jack Elrod chronicled this heinous act in his \nwildlife preservation comic strip, ``Mark Trail.''\n  The slaughter of American black bears and the sale of their parts is \na deliberate and dastardly plot hatched by a black market of poachers, \ntraders, and smugglers who have been known to transport bear parts in \ncans of chocolate syrup or bottles of scotch. Because certain Asian \nbear populations are being poached to near extinction, poachers and \nsmugglers often target American black bears to meet the demand for bear \nparts in Asia and even within certain communities here at home. In \nOregon alone, one poaching-for-profit ring reportedly killed between \n50-100 black bears a year for 5 to 10 years simply to harvest their \ngallbladders. While the bear population in North America presently is \nstable, the growth of illegal and inhumane poaching, coupled with the \ndifficulty of anti-poaching enforcement efforts, could pose a real \nthreat to our resident bear population. We should not stand by and \nallow American bears to be decimated by poachers.\n  The depleted bear populations in Asia suffer a different, but equally \ncruel, fate as they are ``protected'' to meet the demand for their \nbile. National Geographic, U.S News and World Report and The Los \nAngeles Times each have reported that Asiatic bears in China have been \ntrapped in bear ``farms'' and milked for their bile through catheters \ninserted into their gallbladders. Bears in other countries often fare \nno better. In South Korea, for example, bears have been bludgeoned to \ndeath or boiled alive in front of patrons to prove they are purchasing \nauthentic Asian bear parts.\n  Some States in America prohibit trading in bear parts. But others do \nnot. And to make matters more complicated, some States prohibit such \ntrading only if the bear was killed within that State. It hardly takes \na lawyer to quickly find the loophole in such a law, poachers and black \nmarket profiteers can simply kill a bear in another State and take it \nback across State lines to sell the parts. And because it is almost \nimpossible to tell where a bear was killed just by looking at its \nparts, traders and smugglers can always claim that the bear was killed \nout of State. So, as you can see, our conflicting web of State laws \ndoes little to deter poachers from their prey. In fact, the confusing \nlabyrinth of laws may make it easier for poachers to slaughter still \nmore bear.\n  To help bring the complex, sometimes criminal, and inhumane trade in \nbear parts to an end, I am once again introducing the Bear Protection \nAct. This legislation always has enjoyed broad, bipartisan support \nsince I first introduced the bill in the 103rd Congress. Last year the \nbill passed this chamber by unanimous consent, only to be returned by \nthe House under the blue-slip rule. I am proud to be joined by 25 \noriginal cosponsors of the bill today, including 14 Democrats, 10 \nRepublicans and an Independent, and I hope that others soon will join \nme to help shepherd this important legislation to passage.\n  My legislation is straightforward. It prohibits the import, export, \nor sale of bear viscera, or any products containing bear viscera, and \nit imposes criminal and civil penalties for violators. Enacting a \nuniform Federal prohibition on the trade in bear parts is necessary to \nclose the loopholes left open by the patchwork of State laws that have \nfacilitated the illegal trade of bear parts in the United States and \noverseas.\n  This legislation will in no way affect the rights of sportsmen to \nhunt bears legally in any State. Illegal bear poaching and legal \nrecreational hunting are separate and distinct acts. Indeed, we should \nremember that every bear poached for illegal profiteering of bear parts \nis a bear taken away from sportsmen. A former chief enforcement officer \nfor the United States Fish and Wildlife Service has estimated that \napproximately 40,000 bears are hunted legally each year, but an almost \nequal number are poached illegally. Many States understand this \nproblem, as over two-thirds of the States that allow bear hunting also \nban the trade of bear parts.\n  This bill is another example of what I like to call consensus \nconservation. The legislation does not pit hunters against \nenvironmentalists. Nor does it pit States against the heavy hand of the \nFederal Government on wildlife management or sporting laws. Indeed, I \nam happy to report that there are no political fireworks in this bill. \nOne look at the cosponsor list should indicate that.\n  Instead, what we have is a bill that targets a specific legislative \ngoal, to protect bears from illegal and inhumane poaching and black \nmarket profiteering. By carefully crafting this legislation with that \nsingle goal in mind, we have an opportunity to pass a common sense bill \nthat is supported by wildlife enthusiasts and conservationists while \nprotecting the autonomy of states and the rights of sportsmen.\n  I continue to believe that these types of targeted, bipartisan \nconservation efforts that are rooted in consensus goals, rather than \nconflicting politics, can, in the end, make the most noticeable strides \ntoward protecting our national wildlife and environmental treasures.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord, and I further ask unanimous consent that the Record include \nletters of support from the Humane Society of the United States, the \nSociety for Animal Protective Legislation, and the American Zoo and \nAquarium Association.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1125\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Bear Protection Act of \n     2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) all 8 extant species of bear--Asian black bear, brown \n     bear, polar bear, American black bear, spectacled bear, giant \n     panda, sun bear, and sloth bear--are listed on Appendix I or \n     II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered \n     Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (27 UST 1087; TIAS 8249);\n       (2)(A) Article XIV of CITES provides that Parties to CITES \n     may adopt stricter domestic measures regarding the conditions \n     for trade, taking, possession, or transport of species listed \n     on Appendix I or II; and\n       (B) the Parties to CITES adopted a resolution in 1997 \n     (Conf. 10.8) urging the Parties to take immediate action to \n     demonstrably reduce the illegal trade in bear parts;\n       (3)(A) thousands of bears in Asia are cruelly confined in \n     small cages to be milked for their bile; and\n       (B) the wild Asian bear population has declined \n     significantly in recent years as a result of habitat loss and \n     poaching due to a strong demand for bear viscera used in \n     traditional medicines and cosmetics;\n       (4) Federal and State undercover operations have revealed \n     that American bears have been poached for their viscera;\n       (5) while most American black bear populations are \n     generally stable or increasing, commercial trade could \n     stimulate poaching and threaten certain populations if the \n     demand for bear viscera increases; and\n       (6) prohibitions against the importation into the United \n     States and exportation from the United States, as well as \n     prohibitions against the interstate trade, of bear viscera \n     and products containing, or labeled or advertised as \n     containing, bear viscera will assist in ensuring that the \n     United States does not contribute to the decline of any bear \n     population as a result of the commercial trade in bear \n     viscera.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to ensure the long-term \n     viability of the world's 8 bear species by--\n       (1) prohibiting interstate and international trade in bear \n     viscera and products containing, or labeled or advertised as \n     containing, bear viscera;\n       (2) encouraging bilateral and multilateral efforts to \n     eliminate such trade; and\n       (3) ensuring that adequate Federal legislation exists with \n     respect to domestic trade in bear viscera and products \n     containing, or labeled or advertised as containing, bear \n     viscera.\n\n     SEC. 4.

DISCUSSIONS CONCERNING BEAR CONSERVATION AND THE BEAR \n                   PARTS TRADE.\n\n       In order to seek to establish coordinated efforts with \n     other countries to protect bears, the Secretary shall \n     continue discussions concerning trade in bear viscera with--\n       (1) the appropriate representatives of Parties to CITES; \n     and\n       (2) the appropriate representatives of countries that are \n     not parties to CITES and that are determined by the Secretary \n     and the United States Trade Representative to be the leading \n     importers, exporters, or consumers of bear viscera.\n\n     SEC. 8. CERTAIN RIGHTS NOT AFFECTED.\n\n       Except as provided in section 5, nothing in this Act \n     affects--\n       (1) the regulation by any State of the bear population of \n     the State; or\n       (2) any hunting of bears that is lawful under applicable \n     State law (including regulations).\n                                  ____\n\n\n          HSUS Statement in Support of the Bear Protection Act\n\n       The Humane Society of the United States, the nation's \n     largest animal protection organization with over seven \n     million members and constituents, strongly supports Senator \n     McConnell's Bear Protection Act.\n       The Bear Protection Act would eliminate the patchwork of \n     state laws in the U.S. and improve protection of America's \n     bears. Thirty-four states already ban commerce in bear \n     viscera. The remaining states fall into three categories: six \n     allow trade in gallbladders taken from bears legally killed \n     in-state; eight allow trade in gallbladders from bears killed \n     legally outside the state; and two states do not have \n     pertinent laws. This current patchwork of state laws creates \n     loopholes that are exploited by those engaged in the bear \n     parts trade. The loopholes enable poachers to launder \n     gallbladders through states that permit their sale. The Bear \n     Protection Act would eliminate this patchwork of state laws, \n     replacing it with one national law prohibiting import, \n     export, and interstate commerce in bear viscera.\n       Bear viscera, particularly the gallbladder and bile, have \n     been traditionally used in Asian medicines to treat a variety \n     of illnesses, from diabetes to heart disease. Today, bear \n     viscera is also used in cosmetics and shampoos. Asian demand \n     for bear viscera and products has increased with growing \n     human populations and increased wealth. Bear gallbladders in \n     South Korea are worth more than their weight in gold, \n     potentially yielding a price of about $10,000 each.\n       While demand for bear viscera and products has grown, Asian \n     bear populations have dwindled. Seven of the eight extant \n     species of bears are threatened by poaching to supply the \n     increasing market demand for bear viscera and products. Most \n     species of bears, and all Asian bear species, are afforded \n     the highest level of protection under the Convention on \n     International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and \n     Flora (CITES). CITES has noted that the continued illegal \n     trade in bear parts and derivatives of bear parts undermines \n     the effectiveness of the Convention and that if CITES parties \n     do not take action to eliminate such trade, poaching may \n     cause declines of wild bears that could lead to the \n     extirpation of certain populations or even species.\n       Dwindling Asian bear populations have caused poachers to \n     look to American bears to meet market demand for bear parts \n     and products. While each year nearly 40,000 American black \n     bears are legally hunted in thirty-six states and Canada, it \n     is estimated that roughly the same number are illegally \n     poached each year, according to a former chief law \n     enforcement officer with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n       The U.S. Senate passed this legislation in the 106th \n     Congress and we hope swift action will be taken again this \n     year. We also hope that the House will follow the Senate's \n     wise lead and act to protect bears across the globe before \n     it's too late. The Humane Society of the United States \n     applauds Senator McConnell and the quarter of the United \n     States Senate that has signed onto the Bear Protection Act as \n     original cosponsors. With Senator McConnell's leadership, \n     there may come a day when bear poachers and bear parts \n     profiteers no longer are able to ply their cruel trade \n     unpunished.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 Bear Protection Act Is Urgently Needed\n\n       The Society for Animal Protective Legislation strongly \n     supports Senator Mitch McConnell in his effort to pass the \n     Bear Protection Act once again. This bill would end the \n     United States' involvement in the trade of bear viscera by \n     prohibiting the import, export and interstate commerce in \n     bear gallbladders and bile. Bears are targeted for their \n     internal organs, which fetch enormous profits for the \n     poachers who illegally kill them and the merchants who sell \n     their organs for use in traditional medicine remedies.\n       The insatiable, growing demand for bear viscera contributed \n     mightily to the decimation of the Asiatic black bear and may \n     do the same to the stable population of American black bears \n     if a law is not passed to eliminate the United States' role \n     in supplying this devastating bear parts trade.\n       There is a price on the head of every bear in this country \n     and Senator Mitch McConnell deserves high praise for \n     introducing proactive legislation protecting bears from the \n     looming threat of the gallbladder trade.\n       The current patchwork of state laws addressing the trade in \n     bear gallbladders and bile allows an illegal trade to \n     flourish. It is impossible to distinguish visually the \n     dissociated gallbladder of one state's black bear from \n     another. This enables smugglers to acquire gallbladders \n     illegally in one state, transport them to a state where \n     commercialization of bear parts is legal, and sell the \n     gallbladders under false pretenses. These gallbladders are \n     also smuggled out of the country, providing a laundering \n     opportunity for the sale of gallbladders from highly \n     endangered bears.\n       Enactment of Senator McConnell's Bear Protection Act will \n     ensure that those who seek to profit by the reckless \n     destruction of America's bears can be punished appropriately \n     for their illegal and immoral activity.\n\n[[Page S7093]]\n\n       Mr. McConnell's bill does not impact a state's ability to \n     manage its resident bear population or a lawful hunter's \n     ability to hunt bears in accordance with applicable state \n     laws and regulations. The Bear Protection Act is not about \n     bear hunting--it's about ending bear poaching. This is a \n     laudable goal that all Americans should support.\n       American citizens should not sit by helplessly while bears \n     are slaughtered, their gallbladders ripped out and the \n     carcass unceremoniously left to rot. It's time to take a \n     stand against bear poachers and profiteers. Congratulations \n     to Senator McConnell for taking up the charge.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                        American Zoo and Aquarium Association,\n\n                                 Silver Spring, MD, June 26, 2001.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I am writing on behalf of the 196 \n     accredited members of the American Zoo and Aquarium \n     Association (AZA) in support of your proposed Bear Protection \n     Act of 2001.\n       AZA institutions draw over 135 million visitors annually \n     and have more than 5 million zoo and aquarium members who \n     provide almost $100 million in support. Collectively, these \n     institutions teach more than 12 million people each year in \n     living classrooms, dedicate over $50 million annually to \n     education programs, invest over $50 million annually to \n     scientific research and support over 1,300 field conservation \n     and research projects in 80 countries.\n       In addition, AZA member institutions have established the \n     Species Survival Plan (SSP) program--a long-term plan \n     involving genetically-diverse breeding, habitat preservation, \n     public education, field conservation and supportive research \n     to ensure survival for many threatened and endangered \n     species. Currently, AZA member institutions are involved in \n     96 different SSP programs throughout the world, including \n     four species of bear--sloth, sun, spectacled and the giant \n     panda.\n       It is in this context that AZA expresses its support for \n     the Bear Protection Act. There is little question that most \n     populations of the world's eight bear species have \n     experienced significant declines during this century, \n     particularly in parts of Europe and Asia. Habitat loss has \n     been the major reason for this decline, although overhunting \n     and poaching have also been factors in some cases, especially \n     in Asia. In recent years, the commercial trade of bear body \n     parts, in particular gallbladders and bile, for use in \n     traditional Asian medicines has been implicated as the \n     driving force behind the illegal hunting of some bear \n     populations. Analyses by the US Fish and Wildlife Service \n     (USFWS), TRAFFIC and other organizations have documented the \n     existence of illicit commercial markets and smuggling rings \n     for bear body parts.\n       Recent information suggests that this is not only an \n     overseas issue but a domestic one as well. The American black \n     bear is listed on Appendix II of CITES due to the similarity \n     of appearance to other listed bear species, and conservation \n     and management of black bear populations remains largely in \n     the hands of the states. Most states prohibit commercial \n     trade in bear parts but there are some states that still \n     allow commercial trade of products from bears taken within \n     their borders. Several other states do not explicitly \n     prohibit the commercial trade in parts from bears taken \n     within the borders of other jurisdictions. This has raised \n     concerns that inconsistent state laws may facilitate illegal \n     trade and laundering of bear parts.\n       The relatively high value of the wild bear parts, \n     particularly viscera, on the international market warrants \n     that continued action be taken to minimize the threat or \n     potential threat of illegal trade. Your bill provides the \n     necessary first step for closing the potential loopholes that \n     are afforded to bear poachers and dealers by fragmented state \n     laws. Equally important, the bill encourages dialogue between \n     the U.S. and countries known to be leading importers, \n     exporters, and consumers of bear viscera in an attempt to \n     coordinate efforts to protect threatened and endangered bear \n     populations worldwide.\n       AZA applauds your efforts in this important wildlife \n     conservation matter. In addition, AZA stands ready to work \n     with you to ensure that the necessary funds are authorized \n     and appropriate for the effective administration and \n     enforcement of this critical work.\n       Please feel free to contact AZA if you have any question or \n     comments.\n           Regards,\n                                                 Sydney J. Butler,\n                                               Executive Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 1126. A bill to facilitate the deployment of broadband \ntelecommunications services, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 1127. A bill to stimulate the deployment of advanced \ntelecommunications services in rural areas, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, next week our nation will celebrate \nIndependence Day. Yet, as we celebrate the land of opportunity that is \nAmerica, we must keep in mind those who, even in this great nation, do \nnot have the same opportunities as everyone else. In rural communities \nacross the nation, an entire segment of our population does not have \nthe opportunity to access powerful broadband communications services \nrepresenting the high-speed, high-capacity on-ramps to the information \nsuper highway. Why? Because for all intents and purposes broadband does \nnot exist in most of rural America.\n  Broadband is increasing the speeds and capacity with which consumers \nand businesses alike access the Internet, and opening up a whole new \nworld of information, e-commerce, real-time high quality telemedicine, \ndistance learning, and entertainment. The power of broadband will level \nthe playing field between rural and urban communities in a global \neconomy.\n  Today I rise to introduce the Rural Broadband Deployment Act of 2001 \nand the Broadband Deployment and Competition Enhancement Act of 2001. \nTwo bills designed to ensure that all Americans have access to the \nadvantages of broadband connections. I would like to thank my colleague \nfrom Wyoming, Senator Enzi, for his cosponsorship and support. These \ntwo bills, together or individually, will ensure broadband deployment \nin our nation's rural areas, and will enable us to renew our long-\nstanding commitment that rural communities have access to the same \ntelecommunications resources as urban communities.\n  My singular objective, in both bills, is high-speed Internet access \nfor everybody in America by 2007.\n  This is a bipartisan objective. The Democratic party has announced \nits intention to ensure universal access to broadband by the end of \nthis decade. I commend my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for \ntheir recognition of the importance of broadband and I look forward to \nworking with them to achieve our common goal.\n  New approaches will be needed to achieve universal broadband \navailability. Some of my colleagues have introduced legislation \nconsisting of tax incentives or loan subsidies. Programs such as these \ncan help to deliver on the commitment to make broadband universally \navailable, but these proposals alone will not achieve that goal. \nDeregulation has a key role to play in this effort.\n  Deregulation has been the driver of broadband deployment to date: \ncable companies, largely deregulated by the 1996 Telecommunications \nAct, have invested almost 50 billion dollars in upgrades to their \nnetworks. These upgrades have in turn enabled them to deploy broadband, \nand cable companies now serve 70 percent of the broadband market. \nSatellite companies, also unregulated in the broadband market, are \ndeploying one-way high-speed Internet access and are working to deploy \ntwo-way broadband services. Some companies are utilizing wireless cable \nlicenses to deploy broadband, and they too are unregulated in the \nbroadband market.\n\n  Deregulation is a powerful motivator for the deployment of new \ntechnologies and services. Unregulated small cable companies, and all \nbut unregulated rural and small telephone companies are taking \nadvantage of their regulatory status to deliver broadband to rural \nconsumers.\n  The broadband market, distinct from the local telephone market, is \nnew. Yet, federal and State regulators are placing local telephone \ncompetition regulations on broadband-specific facilities deployed by \nincumbent local exchange carriers, ILECs, the only regulated broadband \nservice providers, as if they were part and parcel of their local \ntelephone service. This is simply not the case. The local telephone \nmarket is not synonymous with the broadband market. The disparate \nregulatory treatment of phone companies deploying broadband and all \nother broadband service providers is serving to deny broadband to many \nrural communities.\n  Broadband facilities being deployed by ILECs throughout our cities \nand towns require billions of dollars of capital investment in new \ninfrastructure that must be added to the existing telephone network. \nThe sparse populations of rural communities already diminish\n\n[[Page S7094]]\n\nthe return on infrastructure investment so that, when combined with \nlocal telephone market regulations, ILEC broadband deployment has not \nproven to be cost effective.\n  As a result, rural telephone exchanges owned by regulated telephone \ncompanies are not being upgraded for broadband services even while \nunregulated companies seem to be capable of making that substantial \ninvestment. In Wellington, Kansas, a rural community with around 10,000 \nresidents, a small unregulated cable company called Sumner Cable has \ndeployed broadband service. Yet, Southwestern Bell, the local regulated \ntelephone company and a Bell operating company, is not deploying \nbroadband. Different regulatory treatments of these companies creates \nthe incentive for one to deploy broadband, but not the other. This is \nbeing seen throughout our nation's rural communities, and is \nparticularly disappointing. The Bell operating companies serve \napproximately 65 percent of rural telephone lines like those found in \nWellington.\n  Broadband is certainly being deployed at a much faster rate in urban \nmarkets than rural markets. But that does not mean all is well in our \nnation's cities. Today, broadband deployment in urban markets is being \ncharacterized by the market dominance of the cable TV industry, \nunregulated in the broadband market, which serves approximately 70 \npercent of all broadband subscribers. This is good for consumers. Cable \ncompanies have taken full advantage of their deregulated status, and \nthe inherent economic incentives, to deploy new technologies and \nprovide new services to consumers. But while the cable industry \nfinishes rebuilding its entire infrastructure with digital technology \nthat permits it to offer broadband, ILECs are, in many instances, not \nmaking the same investment to rebuild their infrastructure.\n  The Broadband Deployment and Competition Enhancement Act of 2001 \npromotes broadband deployment in rural markets by requiring ILECs to \ndeploy to all of their telephone exchange subscribers within 5 years. \nIn exchange, ILEC broadband services are placed on a more level-playing \nfield with their broadband competitors. This is achieved by \nderegulating only those new technologies added to the local telephone \nnetwork that make broadband possible over telephone lines. By \npermitting ILECs to compete on a level playing field with their \nbroadband competitors in their urban markets, we can create the proper \nbalance between requirements and incentives.\n  The limited deregulation in this legislation will not affect \ncompetition in the local telephone market. CLECs will still have access \nto the entire legacy telephone network to use as they see fit, and they \nwill still be permitted to combine their own broadband equipment with \nthe telephone network to compete in the broadband market. In those \nparts of the local telephone network where new network architecture \nmust be deployed to make broadband possible, CLECs are free to add \ntheir own facilities to the network so they can compete for every \npotential broadband subscriber in a market.\n  In Kansas, we have many farms and small rural communities. I grew up \non a farm near Parker, Kansas. My hometown has 250 people. My singular \ngoal in introducing this legislation is to facilitate rural broadband \ndeployment. Given the importance of ensuring broadband is deployed in \nrural communities, I have elected to introduce two different bills on \nthe same issue. I am willing to pursue either approach depending on \nwhich one will get us to the day of ubiquitous broadband.\n  It seems clear that, no matter how worthy broad-based deregulation is \nin the broadband market, any such effort must navigate through the \ntypical back and forth between the baby Bells, long distance companies, \nand now CLECs. If a more limited approach can avoid the traditional \n``phone wars'' then I am happy to put forth such an alternative.\n  The Rural Broadband Deployment Act of 2001 is a more geographically \nlimited approach to spurring broadband deployment. It includes broader \nderegulation of ILEC broadband services, but limits that deregulation \nonly to rural communities. By ramping up the deregulation, yet \nrestricting the size of the market where that deregulation is applied, \nit is my intention to create the same balance of requirements that I \npreviously mentioned.\n  I realize that introducing two pieces of legislation on the same \nissue on the same day is a bit unorthodox. But given the clear need and \nimportance of universal broadband, I feel it is my duty to do anything \nI can to move this debate forward. Providing alternatives for the \nconsideration of my colleagues is part of this process.\n  I urge my colleagues to give consideration to either of these bills, \nand I urge your cosponsorship.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise as an original cosponsor of Senator \nBrownback's Broadband Deployment and Competition Enhancement Act of \n2001. I thank my colleague from Kansas for drafting this innovative \nlegislation to help solve the problem of the lack of availability of \nadvanced telecommunications services in rural areas.\n  Telecommunications has come a long way from the days of the party \nline and operator assisted calls. Telecommunications services have \nallowed entrepreneurs to locate their business anywhere they can get a \ndial tone and have helped to bring jobs to rural America. I have been \nworking to encourage more infrastructure development as a way of \ncreating a business environment that will attract new jobs to the \nplaces that need them.\n  The 20th Century has seen the economy of the United States and the \nworld change from an industrial economy to an information economy. We \nare only at the beginning of the ``Information Revolution'' and now is \nthe best time for private industry and government to take a pro-active \nrole in helping to create the business and regulatory conditions \nnecessary to encourage the widespread deployment of advanced \ntelecommunications services.\n  Since 1995, the State of Wyoming has been attempting to create a \ncompetitive local phone market that would have a multitude of \ncompetitors and result in lower rates. The cost of providing service in \nWyoming is significantly higher than in other areas of the Nation due \nto our low population and long distances between towns. This has caused \nmany companies to pass Wyoming by in search of easier profits in urban \nareas and leave many of our towns with only one choice for broadband \nservice, if they have a provider at all.\n  One of the reasons why advanced services have been slowly deployed is \nthat Wyoming's wide open spaces make the telecommunications needs of \nour residents very different than people in urban areas. The economic \nmodel of the industry is to serve areas with a high population density \nin order to keep costs low. In the West, it's harder to make that model \nwork, but the independent telephone companies, Qwest and the cable \ncompanies are working hard to offer their customers a full complement \nof services at a reasonable price, many services that urban telephone \ncustomers take for granted.\n  High speed Internet access has been delayed for two reasons, cost and \navailability. Advanced telecommunications services can help to build \nWyoming's economy. Companies are beginning to realize that our State \nhas a ready work force and the lower costs of doing business are making \ncompanies choose Wyoming. Many existing businesses are taking advantage \nof the Internet to bring their products and services to the world. \nWhere once a store was limited to only being able to serve those within \ndriving distance of it, now it can bring Wyoming to the world. This \ncannot take place without the continued roll out of broadband business \nservices.\n  Wyoming has for many years been promoting the benefits of \ntelecommuting. People living around the State have been able to connect \nto their office via computer and remain in contact with clients. \nTelecommuting now requires high speed access and that is available in \nsome limited areas. In other areas, the only data access is via a \nregular dial-up modem. There are companies that are deploying digital \nsubscriber lines and cable modems, but those locations are limited and \nthe price is too high to be adopted by a majority of Wyoming residents. \nOver time that price will come down, but this is not a call for public \nsubsidies or government mandates, but a call for more competition and \nderegulation. Competition will bring lower prices and\n\n[[Page S7095]]\n\ngreater deployment of services to even the smallest of towns.\n  That is why I am an original cosponsor of Senator Brownback's bill. \nHis bill creates a deregulatory regime that is backed by specific \nperformance requirements and strong enforcement provisions.\n  The bill requires Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers, ILEC's, to be \nable to provide advanced services to all of its customers within 5 \nyears of the enactment of this legislation in order to receive the \nbenefits of deregulation. This ensures that companies will bring \nadvanced services and competition to rural areas by giving a hard \ndeadline for companies to complete their build-out.\n  Advanced services would be deregulated by exempting them from the \nrequirements that ILECs make packet switching and fiber available to \ncompetitors at below cost rates. This would specifically deregulate the \nequipment that makes it possible to provide advanced services over \ntraditional phone lines. The bill also exempts fiber optic lines owned \nby ILECs from below cost pricing if the fiber is deployed either to the \nhome or in areas that never had telephone infrastructure before. I \nbelieve that this will be key to making the economics of rural advanced \nservices more favorable for companies wanting to invest in rural \nbroadband deployment.\n\n  The bill would also give ILECs the necessary pricing flexibility for \ntheir broadband services. I believe that we should not hamstring a new \ntechnology in a very competitive marketplace with outdated regulations \non price. It is important that Congress ensure that in addition to the \nwholesale pricing relief contained in this legislation, it also \nincludes retail pricing flexibility to further make the economics more \nfavorable.\n  The bill does not change the requirements that ILECs allow \ncompetitors to collocate their equipment in an ILEC facility. \nCollocation is very important since it ensures that competitors have \naccess to the network and do not have to build distant links or other \nconnections to the ILEC network.\n  The bill also does not eliminate the requirement that ILECs give \ncompetitors access to local loops. In fact, if an ILEC does not grant a \ncompetitor access to local lines the bill gives state regulators the \nright to strip the ILEC of the deregulatory benefits contained in the \nbill.\n  The bill's enforcement provisions are very strong and explicit. If a \ncompany does not meet the build-out requirement, does not permit a \ncompetitor to collocate and/or grant competitors access to local loops, \nstate regulators have the authority to return an ILEC to the old \nregulatory regime. Deregulation without proper enforcement mechanisms \ndoes not benefit consumers and competitors. It is important that we \nhold ILECs accountable if they are granted relief from the pricing \nrequirements.\n  I have been working with my colleagues to create a mix of \nderegulation and incentives to encourage private infrastructure \ndevelopment. Government cannot force private firms to make unprofitable \ninvestments, but government can work to make investments in rural \ninfrastructure more favorable. The Broadband Deployment and Competition \nInvestment Act helps to make investment in advanced services in rural \nareas possible.\n  The great strides made by both Qwest, the smaller phone companies and \nthe cooperatives show that rural areas can support fiber optic based \nservices. The Wyoming Equality Network, the fiber based network linking \nall of Wyoming's high schools, has been a great advancement for \neducation and I applaud the State's foresight for undertaking such a \nfar reaching project. The WEN has had the added effect of showing other \ncompanies that it is possible to link rural areas with fiber, bringing \nhigh speed data services and other advanced services to homes and \nbusinesses.\n  I am pleased to see that Qwest and several smaller companies have \nworked together to close the inter-office fiber loop, linking all local \nphone exchanges with a fiber optic connection. This will allow for \ngreater capacity and new services like DSL and other high speed \nbroadband services. This connection will help many areas of Wyoming \novercome many of the service problems they have been experiencing for \nthe last several years.\n  The objective of telecommunications policy should be to bring as many \nplayers into the marketplace and allow them to compete in the \nmarketplace. Congress should not tie a company's hands in a continually \nchanging and competitive marketplace. We should ensure that all parties \nare on a level playing field and that all services are regulated in the \nsame manner regardless of the company that is offering the service or \nthe technology they are using. This legislation will help bring some \nneeded consistancy to the regulation of advanced services and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this vital legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER:\n  S. 1129. A bill to increase the rate of pay for certain offices and \npositions within the executive and judicial branches of the Government, \nrespectively, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \ntoday to provide relief from the pay compression affecting career \nFederal employees serving in the Senior Executive Service, SES. It is \nnearing a decade since Senior Executive Service members have seen a \nmeaningful adjustment in pay.\n  The salaries earned by these employees are, on average, well below \nthose earned by their peers in private industry. Pay caps for the \nSenior Executive Service and certain other positions in the government \nare tied to the Executive Schedule which includes senior level \nofficials as well as Members. Pay freezes for positions on the \nExecutive Schedule in five of the past eight years has resulted in pay \ncompression so severe that 60 percent of the entire executive corps \nearns essentially the same salary despite differences in obligation and \nexecutive level. Over the past eight years, pay increases for these \nexecutives would average 1 percent per year. There is not much of an \nincentive to accept a higher position with added responsibilities and \nincreased work hours for little or no increase in pay.\n  Many senior executives leave Federal service to begin second careers \nin the private sector because of the salary compression. Others find \nthat retirement is a more sensible option, whereas Federal annuitants \nreceive an average two and a half percent cost of living adjustment \nevery year compared to the average one percent per year pay increase a \nsenior executive may receive if she or he remained in Federal service.\n  I have heard from many SES employees relating their own stories as to \nhow the problem of pay compression has affected them. I would like to \nshare a few of these personal accounts.\n  From an ES-6 with the Department of Defense: ``My pay has been capped \nand I have not been receiving raises. This year I received a surprise. \nI turned 55 and I subsequently experienced a $115.16 decrease in pay in \nJanuary because my life insurance increased considerably, along with \nthe contribution to retirement increase. Age 55 is not old! I expect to \nwork a few more years and I expect my pay to increase so that I can \nenjoy my retired years with a reasonable retirement income that has not \nbeen eroded by the pay cap.''\n  A Senior Executive at the Department of Health and Human Services: \n``The highest career Deputy General Counsel position in my agency \nbecame vacant, and I was called by the General Counsel to seriously \nconsider taking it. Aside from the many family issues involved in any \nmove to Washington, an overriding aspect is the fact that I am already \nat the pay cap. Thus, a move into a position with more responsibility \nwould provide no financial incentive. Although I'm obviously not in \ngovernment serve for any huge financial rewards, I don't want to go \nbackward financially. Thus, I have decided to forgo this very \nchallenging opportunity that would be a fitting pinnacle to my career \nwith the Federal Government.''\n  Private Contractor, Department of Defense: ``I turned down a job at \nthe US Nuclear Command and Control System Support Staff, where I'd been \nstationed on active duty as a Regular Air Force Officer. I retired from \nthe NSS four years ago after over 23 years in the Air Force, and was \nhonored to get offered a Civil Service position back at the office. \nInstead, I reluctantly turned\n\n[[Page S7096]]\n\ndown the job. The reason was primarily monetary. In order to take the \njob, it would have been necessary to give up part of my Air Force \nretirement pay because I retired as a regular officer. To make matters \nworse, my pay would have been capped. The bottom line is I would have \ntaken a pay cut with no prospect of a pay raise in the foreseeable \nfuture. My family and I were asked to sacrifice pay and time together \nwhich we willingly did for over 23 years. Instead, I'm supporting the \ngovernment in the role of a private sector contractor, where I'm fairly \ncompensated for my expertise.''\n  These are just a few examples which illustrate how the freeze on \nexecutive pay and resulting pay compression have seriously eroded the \ngovernment's ability to attract and retain the most highly-competent \ncareer executives. This is a very timely issue for the Federal \nGovernment, seventy percent of the SES corps is eligible to retire over \nthe next four years and almost half are expected to retire upon \neligibility. Agencies are being forced to make special requests to \nincrease salaries for their managers and supervisors. They recognize \nthat when someone leaves Federal service, their knowledge and \nexperience goes with them.\n  The legislation I am introducing increases base pay for Senior \nExecutives from Executive Level IV to Executive Level III, extends \nlocality pay to the Executive Schedule, increases the locality cap from \nExecutive Level III to Executive Level III plus locality pay, and \nincreases the overall limit on compensation that can be received in a \nsingle year by career executives from Executive Level I to the Vice-\nPresidential level. The bill also includes certain positions in the \nFederal judiciary which have been impacted by the pay caps. The actual \nraises career executives would receive would continue to be determined \nat the President's discretion.\n  The legislation does not, in and of itself, raise senior executive \npay and does not increase the salaries of Members of Congress.\n  It is also my intention to ensure that this issue remains a priority \nfor the incoming Director at the Office of Personnel Management. During \nthe confirmation hearing before the Senate Governmental Affairs \nCommittee last week for Mrs. Kay Coles James, President Bush's nominee \nto head the Office of Personnel Management, Mrs. James indicated her \nwillingness to work with Members to address the problem of pay \ncompression.\n  Pay compression within the Senior Executives Service is one of the \nmore pressing issues facing the Federal employee workforce and must be \naddressed as the situation will only get worse. The only means to \nalleviate pay compression for the Senior Executives at this time is \nthrough legislation. Therefore, I encourage my Senate colleagues to \nsupport the bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1129\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n      SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of Energy to develop a plan \nfor a magnetic fusion burning plasma experiment for the purpose of \naccelerating the scientific understanding and development of fusion as \na long\n\n[[Page S7097]]\n\nterm energy source, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill of great \nsignificance to our energy future, the Fusion Energy Sciences Act of \n2001. I am especially pleased that my colleague from California, \nSenator Feinstein, is joining me as the primary cosponsor of this \nlegislation. This bill is designed to strengthen the fusion program at \nthe Department of Energy and to accelerate planning for the next major \nstep in fusion energy science development.\n  In recent months, the news has been dominated by energy concerns. \nAlthough there may be differences of opinion about the causes of our \ncurrent energy problems and what the appropriate solutions might be, \nthere is general agreement that energy forms a vital link to our \neconomic prosperity and provides the means by which the conduct of our \ndaily lives is made easier and more comfortable. While we grapple with \nshort term remedies, we need to stay focused on long term investment in \nthose endeavors which have the potential to help secure our energy \nfuture. I believe that fusion energy has this potential.\n  Fusion is the energy source that powers the sun and the stars. At its \nmost basic, it is the combining or fusion of two small atoms into a \nlarger atom. When two atomic nuclei fuse, tremendous amounts of energy \nare released.\n  If we can achieve this joining of atoms, and successfully contain and \nharness the energy produced, fusion will be close to an ideal energy \nsource. It produces no air pollutants because the byproduct of the \nreaction is helium, it is safe and its fuel source, hydrogen, is \npractically unlimited and easily obtained.\n  In the technical community, the debate over the scientific \nfeasibility of fusion energy is now over. During the past decade, \nsubstantial amounts of fusion energy have been created in the \nlaboratory setting. I am proud to note that some of this underlying \nscientific work has been conducted at the Idaho National Engineering \nand Environmental Laboratory in my State, which has been selected by \nthe Department of Energy to lead efforts on fusion safety.\n  Although certain scientific questions remain, the primary outstanding \nissue about fusion energy at this point is whether fusion energy can \nmake the challenging step from the laboratory into a practical energy \nresource. Achieving this goal will require high quality science, \ninnovative research and international collaboration, and the resources \nto make this possible. That is the goal to which this legislation is \ndirected.\n  According to the scientific experts, the path to practical fusion \nwill involve three steps. First, there is a need to conduct a ``burning \nplasma'' experiment. Second, this effort would be further developed in \nan engineering test facility. The third step would be a demonstration \nplant. If taken in series, each of these steps would take approximately \nfifteen years, but through international collaboration, it may be \npossible to accelerate this process. In addition to these steps, \ncontinued investment in a strong underlying program of fusion science \nand plasma physics will still be necessary.\n  Therefore, this bill instructs the Secretary of Energy to transmit to \nthe Congress by July 1, 2004 a plan for a ``burning plasma'' \nexperiment, which is the next necessary step towards the eventual \nrealization of practical fusion energy. At a minimum, the Secretary \nmust submit a plan for a domestic U.S. experiment, but may also submit \na plan for U.S. involvement in an international burning plasma \nexperiment if such involvement is cost effective and has equivalent \nscientific benefits to a domestic experiment. The bill also requires \nthat within six months of the enactment, the Secretary of Energy shall \nsubmit a plan to Congress to ensure a strong scientific base for the \nfusion energy sciences program. Finally, for ongoing activities in the \nDepartment of Energy's fusion energy sciences program and for the \npurpose of preparing the plans called for, the bill authorizes \n$320,000,000 in fiscal year 2002 and $335,000,000 in fiscal year 2003.\n\n  As we suffer through near term challenges in the energy sector and \nmeeting our immediate needs, it is more crucial than ever that we \ninvest in those items that hold the promise for long term solutions. \nRecent accomplishments in the laboratory demonstrate that fusion energy \nhas this long term potential. The Fusion Energy Sciences Act of 2001 \nwill bring this promise closer to reality for future generations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1130\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act my be cited as the ``Fusion Energy Sciences Act of \n     2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) economic prosperity is closely linked to an affordable \n     and ample energy supply;\n       (2) environmental quality is closely linked to energy \n     productions and use;\n       (3) population, worldwide economic development, energy \n     consumption, and stress on the environment are all expected \n     to increase substantially in the coming decades;\n       (4) the few energy options with the potential to meet \n     economic and environmental needs for the long-term future \n     must be pursued aggressively now, as part of a balanced \n     national energy plan;\n       (5) fusion energy is a long-term energy solution that is \n     expected to be environmentally benign, safe, and economical, \n     and to use a fuel source that is practically unlimited;\n       (6) the National Academy of Sciences, the President's \n     Committee of Advisers on Science and Technology, and the \n     Secretary of Energy Advisory Board have each recently \n     reviewed the Fusion Energy Sciences Program and each strongly \n     supports the fundamental science and creative innovation of \n     the program, and has confirmed that progress toward the goal \n     of producing practical fusion energy has been excellent;\n       (7) each of these reviews stressed the need for the Fusion \n     Energy Sciences Program to move forward to a magnetic fusion \n     burning plasma experiment, capable of producing substantial \n     fusion power output and providing key information for the \n     advancement of fusion science;\n       (8) the National Academy of Sciences has also called for a \n     broadening of the Fusion Energy Sciences Program research \n     base as a means to more fully integrate the fusion science \n     community into the broader scientific community; and\n       (9) the Fusion Energy Sciences Program budget is inadequate \n     to support the necessary science and innovation for the \n     present generation of experiments, and cannot accommodate the \n     cost of a burning plasma experiment constructed by the United \n     States, or even the cost of key participation by the United \n     States in an international effort.\n\n     SEC. 3. PLAN FOR FUSION EXPERIMENT.\n\n       (a) Plan for United States Fusion Experiment.--The \n     Secretary of Energy (in this Act referred to as `the \n     Secretary'), on the basis of full consultation with, and the \n     recommendation of, the Fusion Energy Sciences Advisory \n     Committee (in this Act referred to as ``FESAC''), shall \n     develop a plan for United States construction of a magnetic \n     fusion burning plasma experiment for the purpose of \n     accelerating scientific understanding of fusion plasmas. The \n     Secretary shall request a review of the plan by the National \n     Academy of Sciences, and shall transmit the plan and the \n     review to the Congress by July 1, 2004.\n       (b) Requirements of Plan.--The plan described in subsection \n     (a) shall--\n       (1) address key burning plasma physics issues; and\n       (2) include specific information on the scientific \n     capabilities of the proposed experiment, the relevance of \n     these capabilities to the goal of practical fusion energy, \n     and the overall design of the experiment including its \n     estimated cost and potential construction sites.\n       (c) United States Participation in an International \n     Experiment.--In addition to the plan described in subsection \n     (a), the Secretary, on the basis of full consultation with, \n     and the recommendation of, FESAC, may also develop a plan for \n     United States participation in an international burning \n     plasma experiment for the same purpose, whose construction is \n     found by the Secretary to be highly likely and where United \n     States participation is cost effective relative to the cost \n     and scientific benefits of a domestic experiment described in \n     subsection (a). If the Secretary elects to develop a plan \n     under this subsection, he shall include the information \n     described in subsection (b), and an estimate of the cost of \n     United States participation in such an international \n     experiment. The Secretary shall request a review by the \n     National Academies of Sciences and Engineering of a plan \n     developed under this subsection, and shall transmit the plan \n     and the review to the Congress no later than July 1, 2004.\n       (d) Authorization of Research and Development.--The \n     Secretary, through the Fusion Energy Sciences Program, may \n     conduct any research and development necessary to fully \n     develop the plans described in this section.\n\n     SEC. 4. PLAN FOR FUSION ENERGY SCIENCES PROGRAM.\n\n       Not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary, in full\n\n[[Page S7098]]\n\n     consultation with FESAC, shall develop and transmit to the \n     Congress a plan for the purpose of ensuring a strong \n     scientific base for the Fusion Energy Sciences Program and to \n     enable the experiment described in section 3. Such plan shall \n     include as its objectives--\n       (1) to ensure that existing fusion research facilities and \n     equipment are more fully utilized with appropriate \n     measurements and control tools;\n       (2) to ensure a strengthened fusion science theory and \n     computational base;\n       (3) to encourage and ensure that the selection of and \n     funding for new magnetic and inertial fusion research \n     facilities is based on scientific innovation and cost \n     effectiveness;\n       (4) to improve the communication of scientific results and \n     methods between the fusion science community and the wider \n     scientific community;\n       (5) to ensure that adequate support is provided to optimize \n     the design of the magnetic fusion burning plasma experiments \n     referred to in section 3; and\n       (6) to ensure that inertial confinement fusion facilities \n     are utilized to the extent practicable for the purpose of \n     inertial fusion energy research and development.\n\n     SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary \n     for the development and review of the plans described in this \n     Act and for activities of the Fusion Energy Sciences Program \n     $320,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 and $335,000,000 for fiscal \n     year 2003.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, \nSenator Larry Craig, in introducing this legislation to accelerate the \ndevelopment of fusion energy as a practical and realistic alternative \nto fossil fuels for our nation's energy needs.\n  I would also like to commend my colleague, Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, \nwho introduced the ``Fusion Energy Sciences Act of 2001'' on the House \nside as H.R. 1781.\n  Since the beginning of the Manhattan Project, scientists have been \ntrying to harness energy from fusion to produce electricity. This \nlegislation will help the scientific community expedite the development \nof fusion as a viable option for our energy needs.\n  To help fusion science move from the lab to the grid, this bill fast-\ntracks a key experimental fusion project. This bill also authorizes \n$320 million for Fiscal Year 2002 and $335 million for Fiscal Year 2003 \nto speed up fusion's current estimated 45-year implementation \ntimetable.\n  I have spoken frequently to my colleagues on California's current \nenergy situation.\n  Last week the Department of Energy predicted the State will suffer \nfrom around 110 hours of rolling blackouts this summer. Experts say \n$21.8 billion of economic output will be lost and over 135,000 workers \nwill lose their jobs because of this summer's blackouts.\n  I will continue to try to help California and the rest of the West in \nthe short-term. Making rolling blackouts less frequent, lowering \nelectricity costs on the wholesale market, keeping natural gas prices \nreasonable, and bringing new supplies of power online are the key \nobjectives I have been working toward to bring stability to the Western \nEnergy Market.\n  While I work on the short-term problems in California, I join my \ncolleague from Idaho on this bill to develop a key long-term solution \nto our current energy problems.\n  As world populations grow, and as civilization advances, we need to \npursue new energy sources beyond traditional fossil fuels.\n  It is no secret that fossil fuels are finite and polluting. Beyond \nexpanding renewable energy sources such as those from the sun and the \nwind, fusion holds a great deal of potential to expand our nation's \nenergy supply.\n  Fusion is a safe, almost inexhaustible energy source with major \nenvironmental advantages. As a co-sponsor of this legislation, I hope \nto see fusion move quickly from an experiment in the lab to a reality \nfor our homes and businesses.\n  We have already succeeded in using scientific advancements to harness \nenergy occurring elsewhere on our planet. Solar panels collect the \nsun's rays to heat pools and power homes. Windmills transfer nature's \ngusts into electrical currents. Water running from mountaintops to the \nsea can produce significant amounts of hydroelectric power.\n  And now, with fusion energy, we will be able to harness the power of \nthe stars to create an almost unlimited and clean form of energy.\n  Fusion energy is the result of two small hydrogen atoms combining \ninto a larger atom. The energy released from this fusion of the atoms \ncan be harnessed to generate electricity.\n  Unlike nuclear power, which uses radioactive materials for fuel, \nfusion uses hydrogen from water. Unlike fossil fuels, which pollute the \nair when burned, the only byproduct in a hydrogen fusion reaction is \nhelium, an element already plentiful in the air.\n  Besides being environmentally benign, fusion is a practically \nunlimited fuel source. In fact, scientists predict that using 1 gallon \nof sea water, fusion can yield the energy produced from 300 gallons of \ngasoline. And with fusion, 50 cups of sea water can be the energy \nequivalent of 2 tons of coal.\n  Fusion energy has been proven to be a practical energy endeavor, \nworthy of more investment for research and development. So just where \ndo we go from here? How do we harness the power of the stars?\n  A 1999 review by the Department of Energy's task force on Fusion \nEnergy concluded: one, substantial scientific progress has been made in \nthe science of fusion energy; two, the budget for fusion research needs \nto grow; and three, a burning plasma experiment needs to be carried \nout.\n  To expedite the use of fusion to meet our energy needs, we need to \nstrengthen the efforts already underway in fusion research and \ndevelopment and create new programs financed by the government.\n  Scientists agree that at current funding levels, fusion is \napproximately 45 years away from entering the marketplace as a viable \nenergy source.\n  This timetable is based upon a three step process in which the \nscientific community can: first, carry out a burning plasma experiment; \nsecond, build a fusion energy test facility; and third, establish a \nfusion demonstration plant to generate electricity.\n  Since practical fusion energy generation is still three stages from \nreal implementation, the first thing we can do is fund the development \nof a burning plasma experiment.\n  This legislation will ensure this project will happen soon, carried \nout either by the scientific community in the United States, or in \ncollaboration with an international effort. The bill requires the \nSecretary of Energy to develop a plan by 2004 for a magnetic fusion \nburning plasma experiment.\n  It is important to point out that this bill adds the burning plasma \nexperiment in addition to, and not at the expense of, other ongoing \nprojects.\n  The goal of fusion energy is to create a continually burning fuel \nlike a fire refueling itself. Developing a magnetic fusion plasma \nexperiment will help the scientific community demonstrate how the heat \nfrom the fusion reaction can maintain the reaction as a self-generating \nfuel. Strong magnetic fields allow the hydrogen plasma to be heated to \nhigh temperatures for fusion.\n  This legislation will help the scientific community overcome the key \nstumbling block to fusion development. By authorizing $320 million for \nFiscal Year 2002 and $335 for Fiscal Year 2003 the fusion plasma \nexperiment will be carried out and fusion funding that peaked in the \n1970s, but has since tapered off, will be restored.\n  Let me just take a moment to mention where this funding is going, \nbecause it is particularly important for me to point this out.\n  Annual Federal funding for fusion energy has averaged around $230 \nmillion in the last few years. In Fiscal Year 2001, Congress \nappropriated $248.49 million for fusion research.\n  This money has provided approximately 1,100 jobs in California at the \nfollowing U.S. Fusion Program Participant locations: UC Davis, UC \nBerkeley, Stanford, UCLA, UC Santa Barbara, Cal Tech, UC San Diego, UC \nIrvine, Occidental College, Lawrence Livermore National Lab, Sandia \nNational Lab, Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, Lawrence Berkeley \nNational Lab, TSI Research Inc. and General Atomics.\n  Despite all of the past advancements at these facilities and others, \nthe Fusion Energy Science Advisory Committee has concluded that lack of \nfunding is hindering the technological advance towards fusion energy \ndevelopment. And the Department of Energy's task force on Fusion Energy \nhas concluded that, ``In light of the promise of fusion,'' funding \nremains ``subcritical.''\n  Currently, the international community is outpacing us on the road to \nrealizing the myriad benefits of this new energy resource. The Japanese \nbudget for this type of research is about 1.5\n\n[[Page S7099]]\n\ntimes that of the U.S., and the European budget is about 3 times \ngreater.\n  It is critical that we be the leader in the renewable energy \nresources sector.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Craig and me in supporting \nfusion energy as a clean, safe, and abundant energy source for our \nNation's long-term energy supply.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 1131. A bill to promote economically sound modernization of \nelectric power generation capacity in the United States, to establish \nrequirements to improve the combustion heat rate efficiency of fossil \nfuel-fired electric utility generating units, to reduce emissions of \nmercury, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, oxides, and sulfur dioxide, to \nrequire that all fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating units \noperating in the United States meet new sources review requirements, to \npromote the use of clean coal technologies, and to promote alternative \nenergy and clean energy sources such as solar, wind, biomass, and fuel \ncells; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Administration finally released its \nNational Energy Policy last month. As I noted at the time, I have \nserious concerns about several of its recommendations, not the least of \nwhich was its proposal to build 1,300 to 1,900 new electric power \nplants many of them burning relatively dirty fossil fuels, while, at \nsame time, questioning the enforcement of clean air laws that protect \nthe public from excess power plant emissions.\n  Today, fossil fuel-fired power plants constitute the largest source \nof air pollution in the United States. Every year, they collectively \nemit approximately 2.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide, 13 million tons \nof acid rain-producing sulfur dioxide, 7 million tons of acid rain- and \nsmog-producing nitrogen oxides, and 43 tons of highly toxic mercury.\n  How could pollutants still be dumped into our atmosphere at this \nscale? One reason that cannot be ignored is that more than 75 percent \nof the fossil-fuel fired power plants in the United States are still \n``grandfathered,'' or exempt from modern Clean Air Act standards. When \nthe Clean Air Act and its amendments were passed, Congress assumed that \nold, 1950's era power plants would be retired over time and replaced by \nnewer, cleaner plants within 30 years. They were not. Unfortunately, \nutilities have kept these inefficient, pollution-prone power plants on \nline because they are inexpensive. Those grandfathered plants continue \nto burn cheap fuel and refuse to invest in emissions control \ntechnologies that protect air quality.\n  The continuing harm to our atmosphere, lands, waters, State \neconomies, and public health by excess power plant emissions is well \ndocumented. In my home state of Vermont, acid deposition caused by \nemissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide has scarred our forests \nand poisoned our streams. Emissions of mercury have contaminated our \nrivers and lakes to the point that statewide advisories against fish \nconsumption are necessary to protect citizens. Emissions of greenhouse \ngas threaten to negatively change the climate for Vermont maple trees \nthe source of Vermont maple syrup and other economic Vermont crops. And \ndespite Vermont's tough air laws and small population, out-of-state \nparticulates and smog lower our air quality, endanger our health, and \nruin views of our Green Mountains.\n  Earlier this year, I cosponsored bipartisan legislation, the ``Clean \nPower Act of 2001,'' that strictly capped national power plant \nemissions and ended ``grandfather'' loophole exemptions. To promote \nrapid and reliable changes in the utility industry, that legislation \nalso gave utilities the regulatory tools needed to make those changes \nwith incentives for free market trading of emissions credits, a so-\ncalled ``cap-and-trade'' mechanism. I remain a supporter of the Clean \nPower Act of 2001 and hope it becomes key to energy policy negotiations \nin Congress. However, I believe we can do even more.\n  So today I am introducing a second piece of legislation covering \npower plant emissions that I also intend to promote during the energy \ndebate. The ``Clean Power Plant and Modernization Act of 2001'' again \nstrictly caps emissions and ends the ``grandfather'' loophole on old \nplants. Instead of providing utilities the incentive of free market \ntrading, however, my bill creates strong financial incentives, in the \nform of accelerated tax depreciation, for older utilities that cut \nemissions and upgrade their plants to 45 percent to 50 percent \nefficiency. With current average energy efficiency of U.S. power plants \nat only 33 percent, this bill is another proposal that protects the \nenvironment and public health while providing the energy industry with \na comprehensive and predictable set of long-term regulatory \nrequirements.\n  Under this bill, mercury emissions would be cut by 90 percent, annual \nemissions of sulfur dioxide would be cut by more than 6 million tons \nbeyond Phase II Clean Air Act Amendments requirements, and nitrogen \noxide emissions would be cut by more than 3 million tons per year \nbeyond Phase II requirements. This bill would also prevent at least 650 \nmillion tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year.\n  And this bill goes beyond emissions caps and transition incentives to \nrecognize the emergence of energy technologies that are more \nenvironmentally sustainable. It provides substantial funding for \nresearch, development, and commercial demonstrations of renewable and \nclean energy technologies such as solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, and \nfuel cells. It also authorizes expenditures for implementing known ways \nof biologically sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere such as \nplanting trees, preserving wetlands, and soil restoration.\n  The bill emphasizes the importance of immediately capping, if not \ntotally eliminating, the release of mercury from power plants. In \nDecember, the EPA finally determined to regulate mercury emissions from \nelectric utility power plants, an action I strongly commended. However, \nsuch regulations are years away, and it is uncertain what form they \nwill take. Yet, just last year, 41 states issued more than 2,200 fish \nconsumption advisories because of mercury contamination. Eleven states, \nincluding Vermont, issued statewide advisories. In 2000, the National \nAcademy of Sciences confirmed the health risks of mercury, emphasizing \nthe special vulnerability of unborn and young children. I believe we \nneed to do something now.\n  As the energy landscape of our nation changes, this bill also \nrecognizes the need to train a new national energy work force. As U.S. \npower plants become more efficient and more power is produced by \nrenewable technologies, less fossil fuel will be consumed. This will \nhave an impact on the workers and communities that produce fossil \nfuels. These effects are likely to be greatest for coal, even with \nsignificant deployment of clean coal technology. The bill provides \nfunding for programs to help workers and communities during the period \nof transition. I am eager to work with organized labor to ensure that \nthese provisions address the needs of workers, particularly those who \nmay not fully benefit from retraining programs.\n  Finally, this bill holds the electric power industry, and Congress, \naccountable for any and all taxpayer dollars used to aid the transition \nto cleaner electric generation facilities. To assess how well clean air \nlaws and emissions reductions are working, our nation must have robust, \nnationwide monitoring networks capable of generating reliable, \nconsistent, long-term data about natural ecosystems. Networks such as \nthe National Atmospheric Deposition Program currently provide the \nnational data needed by scientists and Federal agencies to accurately \nassess the trends in pollutant deposition. Yet, over the past 30 years, \nthese networks have struggled to survive with ever-decreasing funding. \nMy bill provides modest appropriations for both operational support and \nmodernization of scientific sites that are so critical to understanding \nof our ecosystems and our public health.\n  The American public overwhelmingly supports the environmental \ncommitments that we have made since the early 1970s. It is our \nresponsibility to preserve the environment for our children and \ngrandchildren, and it is our duty to protect their health as well. The \nproposed energy policy of this administration needs to be less about \ndrilling and more about energy efficiency and protection of air \nquality. This bill will, I hope, add another way\n\n[[Page S7100]]\n\nin which we can ensure reliable, affordable electric power while \nmodernizing energy efficiency and protecting our national resources.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, and the section-\nby-section overview of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1131\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States is relying increasingly on old, \n     needlessly inefficient, and highly polluting power plants to \n     provide electricity;\n       (2) the pollution from those power plants causes a wide \n     range of health and environmental damage, including--\n       (A) fine particulate matter that is associated with the \n     deaths of approximately 50,000 Americans annually;\n       (B) urban ozone, commonly known as ``smog'', that impairs \n     normal respiratory functions and is of special concern to \n     individuals afflicted with asthma, emphysema, and other \n     respiratory ailments;\n       (C) rural ozone that obscures visibility and damages \n     forests and wildlife;\n       (D) acid deposition that damages estuaries, lakes, rivers, \n     and streams (and the plants and animals that depend on them \n     for survival) and leaches heavy metals from the soil;\n       (E) mercury and heavy metal contamination that renders fish \n     unsafe to eat, with especially serious consequences for \n     pregnant women and their fetuses;\n       (F) eutrophication of estuaries, lakes, rivers, and \n     streams; and\n       (G) global climate change that may fundamentally and \n     irreversibly alter human, animal, and plant life;\n       (3) tax laws and environmental laws--\n       (A) provide a very strong incentive for electric utilities \n     to keep old, dirty, and inefficient generating units in \n     operation; and\n       (B) provide a strong disincentive to investing in new, \n     clean, and efficient generating technologies;\n       (4) fossil fuel-fired power plants, consisting of plants \n     fueled by coal, fuel oil, and natural gas, produce more than \n     two-thirds of the electricity generated in the United States;\n       (5) since, according to the Department of Energy, the \n     average combustion heat rate efficiency of fossil fuel-fired \n     power plants in the United States is 33 percent, 67 percent \n     of the heat generated by burning the fuel is wasted;\n       (6) technology exists to increase the combustion heat rate \n     efficiency of coal combustion from 35 percent to 50 percent \n     above current levels, and technological advances are possible \n     that would boost the net combustion heat rate efficiency even \n     more;\n       (7) coal-fired power plants are the leading source of \n     mercury emissions in the United States, releasing more than \n     43 tons of this potent neurotoxin each year;\n       (8) in 1999, fossil fuel-fired power plants in the United \n     States produced nearly 2,200,000,000 tons of carbon dioxide, \n     the primary greenhouse gas;\n       (9) on average, fossil fuel-fired power plants emit \n     approximately 2,000 pounds of carbon dioxide for every \n     megawatt hour of electricity produced;\n       (10) the average fossil fuel-fired generating unit in the \n     United States commenced operation in 1964, 6 years before the \n     Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) was amended to \n     establish requirements for stationary sources;\n       (11)(A) according to the Department of Energy, only 23 \n     percent of the 1,000 largest emitting units are subject to \n     stringent new source performance standards under section 111 \n     of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7411); and\n       (B) the remaining 77 percent, commonly referred to as \n     ``grandfathered'' power plants, are subject to much less \n     stringent requirements;\n       (12) according to available scientific and medical \n     evidence, exposure to mercury and mercury compounds is of \n     concern to human health and the environment;\n       (13) according to the report entitled ``Toxicological \n     Effects of Methylmercury'' and submitted to Congress by the \n     National Academy of Sciences in 2000, and other scientific \n     and medical evidence, pregnant women and their developing \n     fetuses, women of childbearing age, children, and individuals \n     who subsist primarily on fish are most at risk for mercury-\n     related health impacts such as neurotoxicity;\n       (14) although exposure to mercury and mercury compounds \n     occurs most frequently through consumption of mercury-\n     contaminated fish, such exposure can also occur through--\n       (A) ingestion of breast milk;\n       (B) ingestion of drinking water, and foods other than fish, \n     that are contaminated with methylmercury; and\n       (C) dermal uptake through contact with soil and water;\n       (15) the report entitled ``Mercury Study Report to \n     Congress'' and submitted by the Environmental Protection \n     Agency under section 112(n)(1)(B) of the Clean Air Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 7412(n)(1)(B)), in conjunction with other scientific \n     knowledge, supports a plausible link between mercury \n     emissions from combustion of coal and other fossil fuels and \n     mercury concentrations in air, soil, water, and sediments;\n       (16)(A) the Environmental Protection Agency report \n     described in paragraph (15) supports a plausible link between \n     mercury emissions from combustion of coal and other fossil \n     fuels and methylmercury concentrations in freshwater fish;\n       (B) in 2000, 41 States issued health advisories that warned \n     the public about consuming mercury-tainted fish, as compared \n     to 27 States that issued such advisories in 1993; and\n       (C) the number of mercury advisories nationwide increased \n     from 899 in 1993 to 2,242 in 2000, an increase of 149 \n     percent;\n       (17) pollution from power plants can be reduced through \n     adoption of modern technologies and practices, including--\n       (A) methods of combusting coal that are intrinsically more \n     efficient and less polluting, such as pressurized fluidized \n     bed combustion and an integrated gasification combined cycle \n     system;\n       (B) methods of combusting cleaner fuels, such as gases from \n     fossil and biological resources and combined cycle turbines;\n       (C) treating flue gases through application of pollution \n     controls;\n       (D) methods of extracting energy from natural, renewable \n     resources of energy, such as solar and wind sources;\n       (E) methods of producing electricity and thermal energy \n     from fuels without conventional combustion, such as fuel \n     cells; and\n       (F) combined heat and power methods of extracting and using \n     heat that would otherwise be wasted, for the purpose of \n     heating or cooling office buildings, providing steam to \n     processing facilities, or otherwise increasing total \n     efficiency;\n       (18) adopting the technologies and practices described in \n     paragraph (17) would increase competitiveness and \n     productivity, secure employment, save lives, and preserve the \n     future; and\n       (19) accurate, long-term, nationwide monitoring of \n     atmospheric acid and mercury deposition is essential for--\n       (A) determining deposition trends;\n       (B) evaluating the local and regional transport of \n     emissions; and\n       (C) assessing the impact of emission reductions.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to protect and preserve the environment while \n     safeguarding health by ensuring that each fossil fuel-fired \n     generating unit minimizes air pollution to levels that are \n     technologically feasible through modernization and \n     application of pollution controls;\n       (2) to greatly reduce the quantities of mercury, carbon \n     dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides entering the \n     environment from combustion of fossil fuels;\n       (3) to permanently reduce emissions of those pollutants by \n     increasing the combustion heat rate efficiency of fossil \n     fuel-fired generating units to levels achievable through--\n       (A) use of commercially available combustion technology, \n     including clean coal technologies such as pressurized \n     fluidized bed combustion and an integrated gasification \n     combined cycle system;\n       (B) installation of pollution controls;\n       (C) expanded use of renewable and clean energy sources such \n     as biomass, geothermal, solar, wind, and fuel cells; and\n       (D) promotion of application of combined heat and power \n     technologies;\n       (4)(A) to create financial and regulatory incentives to \n     retire thermally inefficient generating units and replace \n     them with new units that employ high-thermal-efficiency \n     combustion technology; and\n\n[[Page S7101]]\n\n       (B) to increase use of renewable and clean energy sources \n     such as biomass, geothermal, solar, wind, and fuel cells;\n       (5) to establish the Clean Air Trust Fund to fund the \n     training, economic development, carbon sequestration, and \n     research, development, and demonstration programs established \n     under this Act;\n       (6) to eliminate the ``grandfather'' loophole in the Clean \n     Air Act relating to sources in operation before the \n     promulgation of standards under section 111 of that Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 7411);\n       (7) to express the sense of Congress that permanent \n     reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases that are \n     accomplished through the retirement of old units and \n     replacement by new units that meet the combustion heat rate \n     efficiency and emission standards specified in this Act \n     should be credited to the utility sector and the owner or \n     operator in any climate change implementation program;\n       (8) to promote permanent and safe disposal of mercury \n     recovered through coal cleaning, flue gas control systems, \n     and other methods of mercury pollution control;\n       (9) to increase public knowledge of the sources of mercury \n     exposure and the threat to public health from mercury, \n     particularly the threat to the health of pregnant women and \n     their fetuses, women of childbearing age, and children;\n       (10) to decrease significantly the threat to human health \n     and the environment posed by mercury;\n       (11) to provide worker retraining for workers adversely \n     affected by reduced consumption of coal;\n       (12) to provide economic development incentives for \n     communities adversely affected by reduced consumption of \n     coal;\n       (13) to promote research concerning renewable energy \n     sources, clean power generation technologies, and carbon \n     sequestration; and\n       (14) to promote government accountability for compliance \n     with the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) and other \n     emission reduction laws by ensuring accurate, long-term, \n     nationwide monitoring of atmospheric acid and mercury \n     deposition.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Combustion Heat Rate Efficiency Standards for \n         Fossil Fuel-Fired Generating Units\n       Fossil fuel-fired power plants in the United States operate \n     at an average combustion efficiency of 33%. This means that, \n     on average, 67% of the heat generated by burning the fuel is \n     wasted. Without changing fuels, increasing combustion \n     efficiency is the best way to reduce carbon dioxide \n     emissions. Section 4 lays out a phased two-stage process for \n     increasing efficiency. In the first stage, by 10 years after \n     enactment, all units in operation must achieve a combustion \n     heat rate efficiency of not less than 45%. In the second \n     stage, with expected advances in combustion technology, units \n     commencing operation more than 10 years after enactment must \n     achieve a combustion heat rate efficiency of not less than \n     50%. Carbon dioxide emission reductions on the order of 650 \n     millions tons per year are expected, and the potential exists \n     for even larger reductions.\n       If, for some unforeseen reason, technological advances do \n     not achieve the 50% efficiency level, Section 4 contains a \n     waiver provision that allows the owners of new units to \n     offset any shortfall in carbon dioxide emission reductions \n     through implementation of carbon sequestration projects.\n     Section 5. Air Emission Standards for Fossil Fuel-Fired \n         Generating Units\n       Subsection (a) eliminates the ``grandfather'' loophole in \n     the Clean Air Act and requires all units, regardless of when \n     they were constructed or began operation, to comply with \n     existing new source review requirements under Section 111 of \n     the Clean Air Act.\n       Subsection (b) sets mercury, carbon dioxide, sulfur \n     dioxide, and nitrogen oxide emission standards for units that \n     are subject to the 45% thermal efficiency standard set forth \n     in Section 4. For mercury, 90% of the mercury contained in \n     the fuel must be removed. For carbon dioxide, the emission \n     limits are set by fuel type (i.e., natural gas = 0.9 pounds \n     per kilowatt-hour of output; fuel oil = 1.3 pounds per \n     kilowatt-hour of output; coal = 1.55 pounds per kilowatt-hour \n     of output). 95% of sulfur dioxide emissions and 90% of \n     nitrogen oxide emissions are to be removed, and emissions may \n     not exceed 0.3 pounds of sulfur dioxide and 0.15 pounds of \n     nitrogen oxides per million BTUs of fuel consumed.\n       Subsection (c) sets emission standards for units that are \n     subject to the 50% thermal efficiency standard set forth in \n     Section 4. Standards for mercury, sulfur dioxide, and \n     nitrogen oxides are the same as those in Subsection (b). \n     Greater combustion efficiency results in lower emissions of \n     carbon dioxide, and the fuel-specific emission limits are \n     lowered accordingly (i.e., natural gas = 0.8 pounds per \n     kilowatt-hour of output; fuel oil = 1.2 pounds per kilowatt-\n     hour of output; coal = 1.4 pounds per kilowatt-hour of \n     output).\n     Section 6. Extension of Renewable Energy Production Credit\n       Section 45(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is \n     amended to include solar power and geothermal power and to \n     extend the renewable energy production credit through 2015. \n     (This credit is currently set to expire in 2001.)\n     Section 7. Megawatt-Hour Generation Fees and Section 8. Clean \n         Air Trust Fund\n       To offset the impact to the Treasury of the incentives in \n     Sections 9 and 10, the bill establishes the Clean Air Trust \n     Fund. The Trust Fund is similar to the Highway Trust Fund or \n     the Superfund. The revenue for the Trust Fund will be \n     provided by assessing a fee of 30 cents per megawatt-hour of \n     electricity produced by covered electric generating units.\n       The Trust Fund will also be used to pay for assistance to \n     workers and communities adversely affected by reduced \n     consumption of coal, research and development for renewable \n     power generation technologies (e.g., wind, solar, and \n     biomass), and carbon sequestration projects.\n     Section 9. Accelerated Depreciation for Investor-Owned \n         Generating Units\n       Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, utilities can \n     depreciate their generating equipment over a 20 year period. \n     Section 9 amends Section 168 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to allow for depreciation over a 15 year period for \n     units meeting the 45% efficiency level and the emission \n     standards in Section 5(b). Section 9 also amends Section 168 \n     to allow for depreciation over a 12 year period for units \n     meeting the 50% efficiency level and the emission standards \n     in Section 5(c).\n     Section 10. Grants for Publicly Owned Generating Units\n       No federal taxes are paid on publicly-owned generating \n     units. To provide publicly-owned utilities with comparable \n     incentives to modernize, Section 10 provides for annual \n     grants in an amount equal to the monetary value of the \n     depreciation deduction that would be realized by a similarly \n     situated investor-owned generating unit under Section 9. \n     Units meeting the 45% efficiency level and the emission \n     standards in Section 5(b) would receive annual grants over a \n     15 year period, and units meeting the 50% efficiency level \n     and the emission standards in Section 5(c) would receive \n     annual grants over a 12 year period.\n     Section 11. Recognition of Permanent Emission Reductions in \n         Future Climate Change Implementation Programs\n       This section expresses the sense of Congress that permanent \n     reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides \n     that are accomplished through the retirement of old \n     generating units and replacement by new generating units that \n     meet the efficiency and emission standards in the bill, or \n     through replacement with non-polluting renewable power \n     generation technologies, should be credited to the utility \n     sector and to the owner/operator in any climate change \n     implementation program enacted by Congress.\n     Section 12. Renewable and Clean Power Generation Technologies\n       This section provides a total of $750 million over 10 years \n     to fund research and development programs and commercial \n     demonstration projects and partnerships to demonstrate the \n     commercial viability and environmental benefits of electric \n     power generation from biomass, geothermal, solar, and wind \n     technologies. Types of projects may include solar power tower \n     plants, solar dishes and engines, co-firing biomass with \n     coal, biomass modular systems, next-generation wind turbines \n     and wind verification projects, and geothermal energy \n     conversion.\n     Section 13. Clean Coal, Advanced Gas Turbine, and Combined \n         Heat and Power Demonstration Program\n       This section provides a total of $750 million over 10 years \n     to fund research and development programs and commercial \n     demonstration projects and partnerships to demonstrate the \n     commercial viability and environmental benefits of electric \n     power generation from clean coal technologies, advanced gas \n     turbine technologies, and combined heat and power \n     technologies.\n     Section 14. Evaluation of Implementation of This Act and \n         Other Statutes\n       Not later than 2 years after enactment, DOE, in \n     consultation with EPA and FERC, shall report to Congress on \n     the implementation of the Clean Power Plant and Modernization \n     Act. The report shall identify any provisions of other laws \n     that conflict with the efficient implementation of the Clean \n     Power Plant and Modernization Act. The report shall include \n     recommendations for legislative or administrative measures to \n     harmonize and streamline these other statutes.\n     Section 15. Assistance for Workers Adversely Affected by \n         Reduced Consumption of Coal\n       Beginning 3 years after enactment, this section provides a \n     total of $975 million over 13 years to provide assistance to \n     coal industry workers who are adversely affected as a result \n     of reduced consumption of coal by the electric power \n     generation industry. The funds will be administered under the \n     economic dislocation and worker adjustment assistance program \n     of the Department of Labor authorized by Title III of the Job \n     Training Partnership Act.\n     Section 16. Community Economic Development Incentives for \n         Communities Adversely Affected by Reduced Consumption of \n         Coal\n       Beginning 3 years after enactment, this section provides a \n     total of $975 million over 13 years to provide assistance to \n     communities adversely affected as a result of reduced \n     consumption of coal by the electric power generation \n     industry. The funds will be administered under the economic \n     adjustment program of the Department of Commerce authorized \n     by the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965.\n     Section 17. Carbon Sequestration\n       This section authorizes $45 million over 3 years for DOE to \n     conduct research and development in support of a national \n     carbon sequestration strategy. This section also authorizes \n     $300 million over 10 years for EPA and USDA to fund carbon \n     sequestration projects such as soil restoration, tree \n     planting, wetlands protection, and other ways of biologically \n     sequestering carbon.\n     Section 18. Atmospheric Monitoring\n       This section authorizes $13.6 million over 10 years to \n     support the operation of existing instrument networks that \n     monitor the deposition of sulfates, nitrates, mercury, and \n     other pollutants, as well as the effects of these pollutants \n     of ecosystem health. This section also authorizes a one-time \n     expenditure of $13.6 million for equipment modernization for \n     these instrument networks.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO:\n  S. 1132. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \nrelating to the distribution chain of prescription drugs; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill designed \nto\n\n[[Page S7105]]\n\nprevent a serious disruption in the distribution of prescription drugs \nacross America. Unless changed by this legislation, or modified by the \nagency itself, a regulation issued by the Food and Drug Administration \nwill drive out of business thousands of small and medium sized drug \nwholesalers. Tens of thousands of small nursing homes, clinics, \ndoctor's offices, drug stores, and veterinary practices, especially in \nrural areas, would be forced to find new suppliers of prescription \ndrugs, who would almost certainly charge higher prices. Consumers, \nespecially the sickest and the least able to pay, would be even further \nhard-pressed to afford the prescription drugs they need to maintain \ntheir health.\n  There is no real health or safety reason behind the FDA's action, \nwhich is simply a lack of understanding of how the wholesale \ndistribution of drugs actually works. The agency's regulation would \ncomplete the implementation of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, \nwhich was enacted in April 1988. That statute, which was designed to \nstop the misuse of drug samples, prevent various types of resale fraud, \nstop the importation of counterfeit drugs, and establish minimum \nnational standards for the storage and handling of drugs by \nwholesalers, has worked well.\n  However, the FDA's regulation, which will go into effect on April 1, \n2001, created two problems for wholesalers, neither of which were \npresent when the agency issued its initial policy guidance on the \nstatute in 1988. The first problem relates to the sales history of drug \nproducts which wholesalers must provide their customers. A wholesaler \nwho does not purchase directly from a manufacturer must provide their \ncustomer with a detailed history of all prior sales of that product \nback to the wholesaler who did purchase the drugs from the \nmanufacturer. This provision was designed to prevent the introduction \nof counterfeits or other drugs from questionable or unknown sources \ninto the marketplace. The FDA's initial guidance was that resellers who \ndid not purchase drugs directly from a manufacturer had to trace the \nproduct back to the wholesaler who did purchase directly from the \nmanufacturer. This wholesaler is known as an authorized distributor.\n  Not withstanding the fact that this system has produced a drug \ndistribution system of exceptional quality, the FDA has changed its \nmind as to what the statute required and proposed that a reseller now \nbe required to trace the product history all the way back to the \nmanufacturer. At the same time, however, the agency also concluded that \nthe statute does not require either the manufacturer or the authorized \ndistributor to provide this sales history to the secondary reseller. \nBut without this very detailed sales history, it will be illegal for \nthe secondary wholesaler to resell products. Since it is economically \nand logistically impractical for manufacturers or authorized \ndistributors to keep track of the huge volume of product in the extreme \ndetail required by the FDA rule, thousands of secondary wholesalers \nwill be forced to cease business.\n  Fortunately, there is a simple solution. In 1990, the FDA finalized a \nregulation implementing another part of the PDMA, which requires \nwholesalers to keep very detailed records of all purchases, sales, or \nother dispositions of the drugs they obtain. These records, which are \nvery similar to the detailed sales history in the FDA's latest \nregulation, are also subject to audit by the agency, by state \nregulators, and must be made available to law enforcement agencies if \nneeded. Thus, there is really no need for a secondary wholesaler to try \nand assemble the detailed and virtually unobtainable sales history now \ndemanded by the FDA and to pass it on to their customers. Instead, the \nbill I am introducing today requires only that secondary wholesalers \nprovide a written statement to their customers that the drug products \nwere first purchased from a manufacturer or authorized distributor. \nSubstituting the written statement would prevent a serious disruption \nin the wholesale drug sector while preserving the original intent of \nthe PDMA, which was to guard the network of licensed and inspected \nwholesalers from counterfeits or drugs from questionable sources. It \nwould be a simple matter for a secondary wholesaler to determine that a \nshipment of drugs was first purchased by an authorized wholesaler, and \nthe written statement would be subject to criminal penalties if \nfalsified under existing law. Substituting the written statement for \nthe paper trail requirement would also reduce selling costs, which \ncould be passed on to the consumer.\n  This bill is a companion to H.R. 68, introduced on January 3, 2001, \nby Representatives Jo Ann Emerson and Marion Berry. That bill now has \n45 co-sponsors who represent an especially diverse geographical and \nideological cross section of the House and is supported by nine major \ntrade and professional organizations representing most companies that \nwholesale or retail prescription drugs in the U.S. I invite my \ncolleagues in the Senate to add their names to this commonsense \nmeasure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mrs. Carnahan, and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 1133. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to preserve \nnonstop air service to and from Ronald Reagan Washington National \nAirport for certain communities in case of airline bankruptcy; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, last week the Bush Administration \neliminated the only nonstop air service between Los Angeles \nInternational Airport, LAX, and National Airport, DCA, in Washington, \nDC. The elimination of the flight makes Los Angeles the largest U.S. \ncity without nonstop air service to this vital airport in the Nation's \ncapital.\n  Since the DCA to lax flight began 10 months ago, 45,000 passengers \nhave taken the flight. Not only is it popular, but many small and mid-\nsized communities throughout the state, including Bakersfield, Fresno, \nMonterey, and San Luis Obispo, rely on this flight. They have \nconnecting flights into LAX specifically designed so that passengers \ncan take the LAX-DCA nonstop flight. These communities will suffer \nbecause of this decision.\n  This happened because TWA, which operated the flight, went bankrupt. \nEven though American Airlines purchased the assets of TWA and was \nwilling to continue the flight, the Administration gave the LAX slot at \nNational Airport to another city.\n  This was an unfortunate decision, and one that was both unnecessary \nand unjustified. Therefore, today, I am introducing legislation to \nreinstate the service. It is narrowly crafted to address the unique \nsituation we have here.\n  My bill only applies in cases where a community loses service to DCA \nbecause the airline operating the flight went bankrupt. In those cases, \nthe air carrier that purchases the assets of the bankrupt airlines has \na right to continue the nonstop service. In exchange, however, the air \ncarrier must give up one of its several slots that it uses to fly to \nits hub airport.\n  In this way, my bill would not create any additional flights to \nNational Airport. Nor would it take away any of the long-distance \nnonstop flights now in operation, including to the city that just \nreceived the slot originally granted to Los Angeles. But, it would \nallow the very popular nonstop air service between LAX and DCA to \ncontinue.\n  It seems to me that this is a fair compromise to ensure that service \nbetween National Airport and Los Angeles continues. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to address this problem before the end of \nthe summer.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 1134. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe rules applicable to qualified small business stock; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto provide an incentive for capital formation for entrepreneurs.\n  This incentive is tailor-made to form capital for entrepreneurial \nfirms so they can spur economic growth, create high wage jobs, and \nensure American competitiveness into the 21st Century. It focuses on \nequity investments as this is the only form of capital most \nentrepreneurial firms secure to fund research and development; most \nsuch firms are unable to secure debt capital.\n  Because this incentive applies to founders stock and employee stock \noptions, and not just stock offered to outside investors, it provides a \npowerful\n\n[[Page S7106]]\n\nincentive for the human infrastructure and culture that drives and \ngrows our nation's entrepreneurial firms.\n  This legislation could not be more timely given the drought we see in \nequity capital for entrepreneurs. Nationwide we saw 850 Initial Public \nOfferings of stock, IPOs, in 1996, 610 in 1997, 362 in 1998, 501 in \n1999, and 379 in 2000. So far in 2001 we have seen only 50. The total \nvalue of these offerings was $47 billion in 1996, $39 billion in 1997, \n$37 billion in 1998, $53 billion in 1999, and $54 billion in 2000. So \nfar in 2001, it's only $20 billion. Entrepreneurs are starved for \ncapital and this incentive is tailor made to provide an incentive to \ninvestors to provide it to them.\n  The details of our proposal are straight forward. They call for a 100 \npercent exclusion, a zero capital gains rate, for new, direct, long-\nterm investments in the stock of a small corporation. ``New'' means \nthat the stock must be offered after the effective date of the bill and \ndoes not apply to sale of previously acquired equity shares. ``Direct'' \nmeans the stock must have been acquired from the firm and not in \nsecondary markets, so it includes founders stock, stock options, \nventure capital placements, IPOs, and subsequent public stock \nofferings. ``Long-term'' means the stock must be held for three years. \n``Stock'' includes any type of stock, including convertible preferred \nshares. ``Small corporation'' means a corporation with $300 million or \nless in capitalization (not valuation, but paid-in capital). The \nincentive applies to both individual and corporate taxpayers. And the \nexcluded gains are not a preference item for the Alternative Minimum \nTax.\n  I am pleased that Senator Hatch has agreed to serve as the lead \ncosponsor of the legislation. He and I worked closely together from \n1995 through 1997 to restore the capital gains incentive. There were \nmany Members involved with that effort, but Senator Hatch and I were \npleased to be the leaders of the legislative coalition that proved to \nbe so effective. Our work now on this venture capital gains legislation \nis a continuation of that long and successful partnership.\n  I am pleased that Representatives Jennifer Dunn and Robert Matsui are \nintroducing the same bill in the other body.\n  I have long championed this approach to capital gains incentives. \nMost recently, this proposal was included as Section 4 of S. 798, the \nProductivity, Opportunity, and Prosperity Act of 2001. The first \nproposal on this subject was introduced on April 7, 1987 in the 100th \nCongress by Senator Dale Bumpers as S. 932. I was an early supporter of \nthis proposal and I cosponsored a version of this proposal introduced \nin 1991 by Senator Bumpers as S.1932. A version of that bill was \nenacted as part of the 1993 tax bill, Section 1202, but it was laden \nwith technical requirements that limited its effectiveness. In the \n104th Congress sent amendments to strengthen Section 1202 to President \nClinton in the tax bill vetoed he vetoed in 1996. In the 105th Congress \nthese amendments were included in all of the key capital gains, \nincluding S. 2 (Roth), S. 20 (Daschle), S. 66 (Hatch-Lieberman), S. 501 \n(Mack), and S. 745 (Bumpers). These amendments were sent to the \nconference on that bill but did not emerge from it. A broad-based \ncapital gains incentive, which I supported, was enacted into law and a \nrollover provision was enacted with regard to Section 1202 stock. In \nthe 106th Congress, amendments to strengthen Section 1202 were \nintroduced in the House by Representatives Jennifer Dunn and Bob \nMatsui, H.R. 2331. Then I introduced the incentive as part of S. 798 \nand we are today introducing it again as a stand-alone bill.\n  Today I am pleased to cosponsor S. 818, the capital gains proposal \nintroduced by Senator Hatch and Torricelli and others. That proposal \ncalls for a reduction in the current 20 percent capital gains tax rate \nfor a broad class of investments, simplifies the capital gains tax, and \nprovides special benefits to low income taxpayers. This bill and the \nbill we introduce today are complementary and should both be enacted.\n  I recognize that the Joint Committee on Taxation, which determines \nthe ``cost'' of all tax proposals, will determine that our proposal \ntoday, and S. 818, will lose revenue. I believe this finding to be \nshort-sighted given the dramatic effect that these incentives will have \non entrepreneurs and therefore on economic growth, but there is no way \nto appeal these determinations. There is no revenue remaining available \nunder the budget resolution to tap to finance these proposals. \nAccordingly, I fully accept the obligation to find a way to pay for \nthese and other tax proposals, an offset, so that we do not adversely \naffect the deficit.\n  The reasons for setting a special capital gains rate for venture \ncapital are compelling. Entrepreneurial firms are the ones which can \ndramatically change our whole health care system, clean up our \nenvironment, link us in international telecommunication networks, and \nincrease our capacity to understand our world. The firms are founded by \ndreamers, adventurers, and risk-takers who embody the best we have to \noffer in our free-enterprise economy.\n  Entrepreneurship drives growth and small, emerging companies need \ncapital investment to innovate, create jobs, and create wealth. \nAccording to the National Commission on Entrepreneurship, a small \nsubset of entrepreneurial firms that comprise only 5-15 percent of all \nU.S. businesses created about two-thirds of new jobs between 1993-96. \nAlthough venture capital is critical to the transition from a fledgling \ncompany to a growth company, only a small share of it is associated \nwith small and new firms. In addition, we are currently experiencing a \nventure capital slow down that makes it even more difficult for small \nand new firms to attract capital. According to the National Venture \nCapital Association, NCVA, investment in the fourth quarter of last \nyear slowed by more than 30 percent from the previous quarter.\n\n  The primary goal of the Productivity, Opportunity, and Prosperity Act \nand this venture capital incentive is to protect, stimulate and expand \neconomic growth. Government's role is not to create jobs but to help \ncreate the environment in which the private sector will create jobs. \nThis legislation helps to create the right context for private sector \ngrowth by providing incentives for investment in training, technology, \nand small entrepreneurial firms. These investments are critical to \neconomic growth and the creation of jobs and wealth.\n  The Productivity, Opportunity, and Prosperity Act of 2001, including \nthis venture capital proposal, is a tax plan with a purpose. And that \npurpose is, above all else, to stimulate private sector economic \ngrowth, to raise the tide that lifts the lot of all Americans. In the \nspirit of the ``New Economy,'' where the fundamentals of our economy \nhave changed through entrepreneurship and innovation, this package \nincludes business tax incentives that will spur the real drivers of \ngrowth: innovation, investment, a skilled workforce, and productivity.\n  Ten years from now we will be judged by the economic policy decisions \nwe make today. People will ask, did we fully understand the awesome \nchanges taking place in our economy and in our society? Did we give our \nindustry and workers the environment and the tools they need to seize \nthe opportunities that an innovation economy offers? I believe that a \ntrue Prosperity Agenda is within our grasp. Never before has America \nbeen in a stronger position, economically, socially, or politically, to \nshape our future. But it will take strong and focused leadership. I am \nconfident that if we in the public sector in Washington work in \npartnership with the private sector throughout our country, we can \ntruly say of America's future that the best is yet to come. I believe \nthat the Productivity, Opportunity, and Prosperity Act and this venture \ncapital incentive are an important step toward that future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nsection analysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                                S. 1134\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

        ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Conrad, Mrs. Lincoln, \n        Mr. Miller, Mr. Rockefelelr, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. \n        Carper):\n  S. 1135. A bill to amend title XVII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide comprehensive reform of the Medicare program, including the \nprovision of coverage of outpatient prescription drugs under such \nprogram; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today joined by my colleagues to \nintroduce the Medicare Reform Act of 2001.\n  Today we are in the midst of a major health-care debate on the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. This crucial bill should be the beginning, \nnot end, of reform in the health care system. Now we need to take this \nmomentum and turn to Medicare reform.\n  Reform is not a word to be tossed around lightly. When we bat around \nthe term Medicare reform, this is what we need to be talking about, \nideas that go to the very heart of the existing Medicare program and \nreform it.\n  The Medicare Reform Act offers such ideas. It keeps what is best \nabout Medicare intact. Under this bill the program will remain, as it \nhas always been, reliable and affordable. But the Medicare Reform Act \nalso does just what it says. It reforms the program to reflect new \nrealities both scientific and economic, that the program's creators \ncould not possibly have planned for in 1965.\n  One of these realities is that prescription drugs are a crucial part \nof any modern health care regime. In fact it is unthinkable that \nprescription drugs would be excluded if Medicare were created today.\n  The Medicare Reform Act offers a benefit that, like the existing \nMedicare program, is both affordable and available for all seniors, \nregardless of income. The benefit also harnesses the power of today's \ncompetitive health care marketplace to keep costs down and offer \nseniors choices.\n  Perhaps most importantly, the benefit offered by the Medicare Reform \nAct has no gaps, no caps and no gimmicks.\n  This is our line-in-the-sand.\n  Other plans being discussed have major gaps.\n  Let's look at one: the bill the House Republicans passed last year \noffers seniors a benefit of a scant $1,050-a year.\n\n[[Page S7108]]\n\nOnce they hit that cap, coverage stops. It picks up again only if the \nbeneficiary spends $6,000 a year.\n  Imagine this scenario: An 85-year-old woman pays her monthly \nprescription drug premium. For the first 6 months of the year, she goes \nto the drugstore each month to pick up her cholesterol medication and \npays $25.\n  But then she comes to the 7th month, and has hit her benefit cap. Now \nshe has to pay $50 for the same prescription. She's still paying her \npremium, but she's getting no benefit. Under this benefit, Medicare \nsays ``Sorry. Can't help. Come see me if you have a catastrophe.''\n  I call plans like this donuts, substance around the edges, giant hole \nin the middle. I also call them pointless. Who needs insurance you \ncan't be sure of?\n  No caps, no gaps, no gimmicks. That is set in stone. What is not set \nis stone is the exact level of the coinsurance or deductible. We're \ngoing to be listening to seniors as we move toward a markup, and if we \nhear they would prefer a lower premium in exchange for higher cost-\nsharing, we can turn those dials, as long as it's within the parameter \nof $300 billion.\n  In structure, the Medicare Reform Act represents a true compromise. \nIt takes the best ideas of all engaged in this issue.\n  One school of thought has been that the private sector is best \nequipped to offer an affordable prescription drug benefit.\n  We agree, up to a point. We do not believe that private insurers \nshould assume all of the risk for this benefit. We do not believe this \nbecause private insurers have told us they want no part of this type of \nsystem. And we know that we can pass all the laws we want, but we can't \nmake private companies take on Medicare patients.\n  Rather than foreign the private sector to attempt to do something \nthey do not want to do, we take advantage of the fact that we already \nhave an efficient, workable mechanism in place. That mechanism is the \npharmacy benefit manager of PBM. These businesses operate successfully \ntoday in every ZIP code of the country. They are in a perfect position \nto manage the Medicare prescription drug benefit--and to offer seniors \na choice.\n  The Medicare Reform Act would allow multiple PBMs in each geographic \nregion to administer, manage and deliver the prescription drug benefit. \nThey would be allowed to use all of the methods they use currently in \nthe private sector to provide benefits economically, including the use \nof formularies, preferred pharmacy networks, and generic drug \nsubstitution. Additionally, PBMs would be allowed to use mechanisms to \nencourage beneficiaries to select cost-effective drugs, including the \nuse of disease management and therapeutic interchange programs.\n  Beneficiareis in every part of the country would have access to \ncoverage provided by PBMs that would not assume full insurance risk for \ndrug costs. In this way, adverse selection and inappropriate incentives \nwould be avoided.\n  However, to ensure that PBMs pursue and are held accountable for high \nquality beneficiary services, improved health outcomes, and managing \ncosts, we require PBMs to put a substantial portion of their management \nfees at risk for their performance. Performance goals would include \nprice discounts and generic substitution rates, timely action with \nregard to appeals, sustained pharmacy network access and notifications \nto avoid adverse drug reactions.\n\n  Although all PBMs would be required to offer the standard benefit at \na minimum, payments received on the basis of their performance could be \nused to reduce beneficiary cost-sharing or to waive the deductible for \ngeneric drugs.\n  Requiring PBMs to share risk provides a middle ground between \nproposals that have included no risk being assumed by the private \nsector, and proposals that have required the assumption of insurance \nand selection risk for the cost of drugs.\n  This arrangement would bring us the benefits of private sector \ncompetition without the instabilities that would be associated with a \nfull risk-bearing model. It would take advantage of the fact that the \nprivate sector has provided an efficient, workable, stable system for \nthe delivery of prescription drugs, and the management of drug costs, \nand would allow beneficiaries to choose between multiple vendors.\n  Prescription drugs are not all that is missing from Medicare.\n  We live in a world of near miracles. We can stop disease in its \ntrack. We can keep a health problem from becoming a health crisis. We \ncan make the lives our seniors better. We can make their bodies \nstronger. We have the technology.\n  It's time to let our seniors have it as well.\n  The ``Medicare Reform Act'' would shift the focus of Medicare from \nsimply treating illness to promoting wellness.\n  Several proven-effective preventive benefits, like cholesterol \nscreening and smoking cessation counseling, would be added to package. \nThese benefits could save lives.\n  We also provide a new process for changes to the preventive benefit \npackage. As a member of the Finance Committee, I have sat through \nhours-long discussions on coverage of screening for colorectal cancer. \nI've heard debated the relative benefits of barium x-rays v. \ncolonscopies in minute details. I'm not qualified to make these \ndecisions. A new ``fast-track'' process would move members of Congress \nout of the picture of making decisions about the clinical and \nscientific merits of different benefits, and move the doctors and \nscientists in.\n  The Medicare Reform Act is not just about adding benefits. It's also \nabout changing the way we do business.\n  We've looked to the private sector for lessons on how to run the fee-\nfor-service program. We allow Medicare to use the same competitive \ntools insurance companies have in place to control costs. This will \nsave the Medicare program money, in contrast to some other competition \nproposals.\n  We've looked to the private sector and learned that to serve seniors \nand providers better, we need to make an investment in the program, and \nprovide additional administrative funds. Our bill gives the agency \nresponsible for these programs the money to truly serve their clients, \nour seniors.\n  We've turned again to the medical and scientific experts. We've taken \nthe decision about what Medicare should and shouldn't cover out of the \nhands of bureaucrats and given it to independent medical, clinical and \nscientific experts who have the skills to assess new technologies and \nprocedures.\n  We also need to prepare for the future. The Medicare program is in \nthe best shape it has been in over a quarter century. But, the baby-\nboomers are going to be joining the program soon.\n  We need to begin to fortify the program now, so that we are ready for \nthem. Our bill takes modest steps in that direction by indexing the \nPart B deductible to inflation, and providing the Part B premium \nsubsidy on a sliding scale basis.\n  While I think we need to spend the lion's share of our efforts on \nreforming the part of the program with the lion's share of the \nbeneficiaries, we also need to take a close look at the Medicare+Choice \nprogram. There are several different proposals on the table to replace \nthe current payment system with one based on competitive bidding, and \nwe face a lot of questions regarding which of the proposals would work \nbest.\n  In 1997, Senators Breaux and Mack proposed a Medicare Competitive \nPricing Demonstration Project; the Project was included in the Balanced \nBudget Act. The purpose of the demonstration project was to test a new \nmethod of paying plans based on a competitive market approach. It has \nnot yet been implemented.\n  This demonstration project is exactly what we need to learn how to \ndesign and implement a competitive system. It is not sound to undertake \na wholesale restructuring of the Medicare+Choice system without knowing \nwhat would, and would not, work.\n  The ``Medicare Reform Act of 2001'' would lay the groundwork for a \nsound, workable, competitive system by moving forward with the \nDemonstration project in the state of Florida.\n  Taken together these disparate pieces represent real reform.\n  Before the recess, I hope we will have passed legislation to protect \nbasic rights of managed-care patients.\n  Then we need to pick up that ball and run with it.\n  The time is now. The money is there. The plan exists. Our seniors are \nwaiting.\n\n[[Page S7109]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Cleland, \n        Mr. Corzine, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Reid, Mr. Schumer, \n        Ms. Snowe, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Thompson, and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 1136. A bill to provide for mass transportation in certain \nFederally owned or managed areas that are open to the general public; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nhelp protect our nation's natural resources and improve the visitor \nexperience in our National Parks and Wildlife Refuges. The Transit in \nParks Act, or ``TRIP,'' will establish a new Federal transit grant \ninitiative to support the development of mass transit and alternative \ntransportation services for our national parks, wildlife refuges, \nFederal recreational areas, and other public lands. I am pleased to be \njoined by Senators Baucus, Bayh, Cleland, Corzine, Dodd, Feinstein, \nReid, Schumer, Snowe, Stabenow, Thompson, and Wyden, who are cosponsors \nof this legislation.\n  Let me begin with a little history. When the National parks first \nopened in the second half of the nineteenth century, visitors arrived \nby stagecoach along dirt roads. Travel through parklands, such as \nYosemite or Yellowstone, was long, difficult, and costly. Not many \npeople could afford or endure such a trip. The introduction of the \nautomobile gave every American greater mobility and freedom, which \nincluded the freedom to travel and see some of our Nation's great \nnatural wonders. Early in this century, landscape architects from the \nNational Park Service and highway engineers from the U.S. Bureau of \nPublic Roads collaborated to produce many feats of road engineering \nthat opened the National park lands to millions of Americans.\n  Yet greater mobility and easier access now threaten the very \nenvironments that the National Park Service is mandated to protect. The \nongoing tension between preservation and access has always been a \nchallenge for our national park system. Today, record numbers of \nvisitors and cars has resulted in increasing damage to our parks. The \nGrand Canyon alone has almost five million visitors a year. As many as \n6,000 vehicles arrive in a single summer day. They compete for 2,400 \nparking spaces. Between 32,000 and 35,000 tour buses go to the park \neach year. During the peak summer season, the entrance route becomes a \ngiant parking lot.\n  In 1975, the total number of visitors to America's national parks was \n190 million. By 1999, that number has risen to 287 million annual \nvisitors, almost equal to one visit by every man, woman, and child in \nthis country. This dramatic increase in visitation has created an \noverwhelming demand on these areas, resulting in severe traffic \ncongestion, visitor restrictions, and in some instances vacationers \nbeing shut out of the parks altogether. The environmental damage at the \nGrand Canyon is visible at many other pars: Yosemite, which has more \nthan four million visitors a year; Yellowstone, which has more than \nthree million visitors a year and experiences such severe traffic \ncongestion that access has to be restricted; Zion; Acadia; Bryce; and \nmany others. We need to solve these problems now or risk permanent harm \nto our nation's natural, cultural, and historical heritage.\n  Visitor access to the parks is vital not only to the parks \nthemselves, but to the economic health of their gateway communities. \nFor example, visitors to Yosemite infuse $3 billion a year into the \nlocal economy of the surrounding area. At Yellowstone, tourists spend \n$725 million annually in adjacent communities. Wildlife-related tourism \ngenerates an estimated $60 billion a year nationwide. If the parks are \nforced to close their gates to visitors due to congestion, the economic \nvitality of the surrounding region would be jeopardized.\n  The challenge for park management has always been twofold: to \nconserve and protect the Nation's natural, historical, and cultural \nresources, while at the same time ensuring visitor access and enjoyment \nof these sensitive environments. Until now, the principal \ntransportation systems that the Federal Government has developed to \nprovide access into our national parks are roads, primarily for private \nautomobile access. The TRIP legislation recognizes that we need to do \nmore than simply build roads; we must invest in alternative \ntransportation solutions before our national parks are damaged beyond \nrepair.\n  In developing solutions to the parks' transportation needs, this \nlegislation builds upon the 1997 Memorandum of Understanding between \nSecretary of Transportation Rodney Slater and Secretary of the Interior \nBruce Babbitt, in which the two Departments agreed to work together to \naddress transportation and resource management needs in and around \nNational Parks. The findings in the MOU are especially revealing: \nCongestion in and approaching many National Parks is causing lengthy \ntraffic delays and backups that substantially detract from the visitor \nexperience. Visitors find that many of the National Parks contain \nsignificant noise and air pollution, and traffic congestion similar to \nthat found on the city streets they left behind. In many National Park \nunits, the capacity of parking facilities at interpretive or scenic \nareas is well below demand. As a result, visitors park along roadsides, \ndamaging park resources and subjecting people to hazardous safety \nconditions as they walk near busy roads to access visitor use areas. On \noccasion, National Park units must close their gates during high \nvisitation periods and turn away the public because the existing \ninfrastructure and transportation systems are at, or beyond, the \ncapacity for which they were designed.\n  In addition, the TRIP legislation is designed to implement the \nrecommendations from a comprehensive study of alternative \ntransportation needs in public lands that I was able to include in the \nTransportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, TEA-21, as section \n3039. The study is nearing completion, and is expected to confirm what \nthose of us who have visited our National parks already know: there is \na significant and well-documented need for alternative transportation \nsolutions in the national parks to prevent lasting damage to these \nincomparable natural treasures.\n  The Transit in Parks Act will go far toward meeting this need. The \nbill's objectives are to develop new and expanded mass transit services \nthroughout the national parks and other public lands to conserve and \nprotect fragile natural, cultural, and historical resources and \nwildlife habitats, to prevent or mitigate adverse impact on those \nresources and habitats, and to reduce pollution and congestion, while \nat the same time facilitating appropriate visitor access and improving \nthe visitor experience.\n  The new Federal transit grant program will provide funding to the \nFederal land management agencies that manage the 379 various sites \nwithin the National Park System, the National Wildlife Refuges, Federal \nrecreational areas, and other public lands, including National Forest \nSystem lands, and to their state and local partners. The program will \nprovide capital funds for transit projects, including rail or clean \nfuel bus projects, joint development activities, pedestrian and bike \npaths, or park waterway access, within or adjacent to national parks \nand other public lands. The bill authorizes $65 million for this new \nprogram for each of the fiscal years 2002 through 2007. It is \nanticipated that other resources, both public and private, will be \navailable to augment these amounts.\n\n  The bill formalizes the cooperative arrangement in the 1997 MOU \nbetween the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of the \nInterior to exchange technical assistance and to develop procedures \nrelating to the planning, selection and funding of transit projects in \nnational park lands. The bill further provides funds for planning, \nresearch, and technical assistance that can supplement other financial \nresources available to the Federal land management agencies. The \nprojects eligible for funding would be developed through the TEA-21 \nplanning process and prioritized for funding by the Secretary of the \nInterior in consultation and cooperation with the Secretary of \nTransportation. It is anticipated that the Secretary of the Interior \nwould select projects that are diverse in location and size. While \nmajor National\n\n[[Page S7110]]\n\nparks such as the Grand Canyon or Yellowstone are clearly appropriate \ncandidates for significant transit projects under this section, there \nare numerous small urban and rural Federal park lands that can benefit \nenormously from small projects, such as bike paths or improved \nconnections with an urban or regional public transit system. No single \nproject will receive more than 12 percent of the total amount available \nin any given year. This ensures a diversity of projects selected for \nassistance.\n  In addition, I firmly believe that this program will create new \nopportunities for the Federal land management agencies to partner with \nlocal transit agencies in gateway communities adjacent to the parks, \nboth through the TEA-12 planning process and in developing integrated \ntransportation systems. This will spur new economic development within \nthese communities, as they develop transportation centers for park \nvisitors to connect to transit links into the national parks and other \npublic lands.\n  The ongoing tension between preservation and access has always been a \nchallenge for the National Park Service. Today, that challenge has new \ndimensions, with overcrowding, pollution, congestion, and resource \ndegradation increasing at many of our national parks. This \nlegislation--the Transit in Parks Act--will give our Federal land \nmanagement agencies important new tools to improve both preservation \nand access. Just as we have found in metropolitan areas, transit is \nessential to moving large numbers of people in our national parks--\nquickly, efficiently, at low cost, and without adverse impact. At the \nsame time, transit can enhance the economic development potential of \nour gateway communities.\n  As we begin a new millennium, I cannot think of a more worthy \nendeavor to help our environment and preserve our national parks, \nwildlife refuges, and Federal recreational areas than by encouraging \nalternative transportation in these areas. My bill is strongly \nsupported by the American Public Transportation Association, the \nNational Parks Conservation Association, Environmental Defense, \nCommunity Transportation Association, Friends of the Earth, National \nAssociation of Counties, American Planning Association, Surface \nTransportation Policy Project, Smart Growth America, Scenic America, \nNational Center for Bicycling and Walking, National Association of \nRailroad Passengers, Great American Station Foundation, and others.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation and to recognize the enormous environmental and economic \nbenefits that transit can bring to our national parks.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill, a section-by-section analysis, \nand letters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1136\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A ``qualified project'' is a planning \n     or capital mass transportation project, including rail \n     projects, clean fuel vehicles, joint development activities, \n     pedestrian and bike paths, waterborne access, or projects \n     that otherwise better protect the eligible areas and increase \n     visitor mobility and accessibility. ``Eligible areas'' are \n     lands managed by the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and \n     Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Land Management, as well \n     as any other Federally-owned or -managed park, refuge, or \n     recreational area that is open to the general public. \n     Qualified projects may be located either within eligible \n     areas or in gateway communities in the vicinity of eligible \n     areas.\n     Section 5: Federal Agency cooperative arrangements\n       This section implements the 1997 Memorandum of \n     Understanding between the Departments of Transportation and \n     the Interior for the exchange of technical assistance in mass \n     transportation, the development of mass transportation policy \n     and coordination, and the establishment of criteria for \n     planning, selection, and funding of projects under this \n     section.\n     Section 6: Types of assistance\n       This section gives the Secretary of Transportation \n     authority to provide Federal assistance through grants, \n     cooperative agreements, inter- or intra-agency agreements, or \n     other agreements, including leasing under certain conditions, \n     for a qualified project under this section.\n     Section 7: Limitation on use of available amounts\n       This section specifies that the Secretary may not use more \n     than 5% of the amounts available under this section for \n     planning, research, and technical assistance; these amounts \n     can be supplemented from other sources. In addition, to \n     ensure a broad distribution of funds, no project can receive \n     more than 12% of the total amount available under this \n     section in any given year.\n     Section 8: Planning process\n       This section requires the Secretaries of Transportation and \n     the Interior to cooperatively develop a planning process \n     consistent with TEA-21 for qualified participants which are \n     Federal land management agencies. If the qualified \n     participant is a State or local governmental authority, the \n     qualified participant shall comply with the TEA-21 planning \n     process and consult with the appropriate Federal land \n     management agency during the planning process.\n     Section 9: Department's share of the costs\n       This section requires that in determining the Department's \n     share of the project costs, the Secretary of Transportation, \n     in cooperation with the Secretary of the Interior, must \n     consider certain factors, including visitation levels and \n     user fee revenues, coordination in project development with a \n     public or private transit provider, private investment, and \n     whether there is a clear and direct financial benefit to the \n     qualified participant. The intent is to establish criteria \n     for a sliding scale of assistance, with a lower Departmental \n     share for projects that can attract outside investment, and a \n     higher Departmental share for projects that may not have \n     access to such outside resources. In addition, this section \n     specifies that funds from the Federal land management \n     agencies can be counted toward the local share.\n     Section 10: Selection of qualified projects\n       This section provides that the Secretary of the Interior, \n     in cooperation with the Secretary of Transportation, shall \n     prioritize the qualified projects for funding in an annual \n     program of projects, according to the following criteria: (1) \n     project justification, including the extent to which the \n     project conserves resources, prevents or mitigates adverse \n     impact, and enhances the environment; (2) project location to \n     ensure geographic diversity and both rural and urban \n     projects; (3) project size for a balanced distribution; (4) \n     historical and cultural significance; (5) safety; (6) the \n     extent to which the project would enhance livable \n     communities, reduce pollution and congestion, and improve the \n     mobility of people in the most efficient manner; and (7) any \n     other considerations the Secretary deems appropriate, \n     including visitation levels, the use of innovative financing \n     or joint development strategies, and coordination with \n     gateway communities.\n     Section 11: Undertaking projects in advance\n       This provision applies current transit law to this section, \n     allowing projects to advance prior to receiving Federal \n     funding, but allowing the advance activities to be counted \n     toward the local share as long as certain conditions are met.\n     Section 12: Full funding agreement; project management plan\n       This section provides that large projects require a project \n     management plan, and shall be carried out through a full \n     funding agreement to the extent the Secretary considers \n     appropriate.\n     Section 13: Relationship to Other Laws\n       This provision applies certain transit laws to projects \n     funded under this section, and permits the Secretary to apply \n     any other terms or conditions he or she deems appropriate.\n     Section 14: Innovative financing\n       This section provides that a project assisted under this \n     Act can also use funding from a State Infrastructure Bank or \n     other innovative financing mechanism that is available to \n     fund other eligible transit projects.\n     Section 15: Asset management\n       This provision permits the Secretary of Transportation to \n     transfer control over a transit asset acquired with Federal \n     funds under this section to a qualified government\n\n[[Page S7113]]\n\n     participant in accordance with certain Federal property \n     management rules.\n     Section 16. Coordination of research and deployment of new \n         technologies\n       This provision allows the Secretary, in cooperation with \n     the Secretary of the Interior, to enter into grants or other \n     agreements for research and deployment of new technologies to \n     meet the special needs of eligible areas under this Act.\n     Section 17: Report\n       This section requires the Secretary of Transportation to \n     submit a report on projects funded under this section to the \n     House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the \n     Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, to be \n     included in the Department's annual project report.\n     Section 18: Authorization\n       $65,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated for the \n     Secretary to carry out this program for each of the fiscal \n     years 2002 through 2007.\n     Section 19: Conforming amendments\n       Confirming amendments to the transit title, including an \n     amendment to allow 0.5% per year of the funds made available \n     under this section to be used for project management \n     oversight.\n     Section 20: Technical amendments\n       Technical corrections to the transit title in TEA-21.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   American Public\n\n\n                                   Transportation Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 6, 2001.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: Thank you for sharing with us a copy \n     of the ``Transit in Parks (TRIP) Act'' which would amend the \n     federal transit law at chapter 53, title 49 U.S.C.\n       The Act would authorize federal assistance to certain \n     federal agencies and state and local entities to finance mass \n     transportation projects generally for the purpose of \n     addressing transportation congestion and mobility issues at \n     national parks and other eligible areas. In addition, the \n     legislation would encourage enhanced cooperation between the \n     Departments of Transportation and Interior regarding joint \n     efforts of those federal agencies to encourage the use of \n     public transportation at national parks.\n       I am pleased to support your efforts to improve mobility in \n     our national parks. Public transportation clearly has much to \n     offer citizens who visit these national treasures, where \n     congestion and pollution are significant--and growing--\n     problems. Moreover, this legislation should broaden the base \n     of support for public transportation, a key principle APTA \n     has been advocating for many years. In that regard, we will \n     review your bill with APTA's legislative leadership.\n       I applaud you for writing the legislation, and look forward \n     to continuing to work with you and your staff. Let us know \n     what we can do to help your initiative!\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                William W. Millar,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    National Parks\n\n\n                                     Conservation Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 23, 2001.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: On behalf of the National Parks \n     Conservation Association (NPCA) and its over 400,000 members, \n     I want to thank you for proposing the Transit in Parks Act \n     that will enhance transit options for access to and within \n     our national parks. NPCA applauds your leadership and \n     foresight in recognizing the critical role that mass transit \n     can play in protecting our parks and improving the visitor \n     experience.\n       Visitation to America's national parks has skyrocketed \n     during the past two decades, from 190 million visitors in \n     1975 to approximately 286 million visitors last year. \n     Increased public interest in these special places has placed \n     substantial burdens on the very resources that draw people to \n     the parks. As more and more individuals crowd into our \n     national parks--typically by automobile--fragile habitat, \n     endangered plants and animals, unique cultural treasures, and \n     spectacular natural resources and vistas are being damaged \n     from air and water pollution, noise intrusion, and \n     inappropriate use.\n       As outlined in your legislation, the establishment of a \n     program within the Department of Transportation dedicated to \n     enhancing transit options in and adjacent to the national \n     parks will have a powerful, positive effect on the future \n     ecological and cultural integrity of the parks. Your \n     initiative will boost the role of alternative transportation \n     solutions for national parks, particularly those most heavily \n     impacted by visitation such as Yellowstone-Grand Teton, \n     Yosemite, Grand Canyon, Acadia, and the Great Smoky Mountains \n     national parks. For instance, development of transportation \n     centers and auto parking lots outside the parks, complemented \n     by the use of buses, vans, or rail systems, and/or bicycle \n     and pedestrian pathways would provide much more efficient \n     means of handling the crush of visitation. The benefit of \n     such systems has already been demonstrated in a number of \n     parks such as Zion and Cape Cod.\n       Equally important, the legislation will provide an \n     excellent opportunity for the National Park Service (NPS) to \n     enter into public/private partnerships with states, \n     localities, and the private sector, providing a wider range \n     of transportation options than exists today. These \n     partnerships could leverage funds that NPS currently has \n     great difficulty accessing.\n       NPCA wholeheartedly endorses your bill as a creative new \n     mechanism to fulfill the primary mission of the National Park \n     System: ``to conserve the scenery and the natural and \n     historic objects and the wildlife therein, and to provide for \n     the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as \n     will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future \n     generations.''\n       We look forward to working with you to move this \n     legislation to enactment\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Thomas C. Kiernan,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         Friends of the Earth,\n\n                                                    June 27, 2001.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: On behalf of Friends of the Earth, I \n     want to thank you for proposing the Transit in Parks Act. \n     This important bill will enhance transit options for access \n     to and within our national parks. Your leadership in this \n     matter is greatly appreciated.\n       Americans are visiting our national parks at an \n     unprecedented rate, with visitation growing from 190 million \n     visitors in 1975 to approximately 286 million visitors last \n     year. With increased visitation comes an increased burden on \n     the parks. As more and more individuals take their cars into \n     our national parks, fragile habitat, endangered plants and \n     animals, unique cultural treasures, and spectacular natural \n     resources and vistas are being damaged from air and water \n     pollution, noise intrusion, and inappropriate use.\n       Your innovative legislation would establish a program \n     within the Department of Transportation dedicated to \n     enhancing transit options in and adjacent to the national \n     parks. This is of vital importance for the future of our \n     national parks. Your initiative will boost the role of \n     alternative transportation solutions for national parks, \n     particularly those most heavily impacted by visitation. For \n     instance, development of transportation centers and auto \n     parking lots outside the parks, complemented by the use of \n     buses, vans, or rail systems, and/or bicycle and pedestrian \n     pathways would provide much more efficient means of handling \n     the crush of visitation. The benefit of such systems has \n     already been demonstrated in a number of parks such as Zion \n     and Cape Cod.\n       We look forward to working with you to move this \n     legislation to enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     David Hirsch,\n     Transportation Policy Coordinator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Environmental Defense,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 22, 2001.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: I am writing on behalf of the \n     Environmental Defense Fund and our 300,000 members to express \n     support for your bill, the Transit in Parks Act, which will \n     provide dedicated funding for transit projects in our \n     national parks. Too many of our parks suffer from the \n     consequences of poor transportation systems; traffic \n     congestion, air and water pollution, and disturbance of \n     natural ecosystems.\n       Increased funding for attractive and effective transit \n     services to and within our national parks is essential to \n     mitigating these growing problems. A good working transit \n     system in a number of our national parks will make the park \n     experience not only more enjoyable for the many families that \n     travel there, it will help improve environmental conditions. \n     Air pollutants that exacerbate respiratory health problems, \n     damage vegetation, and contribute to haze which too often \n     obliterates the views at our parks, will be abated by \n     decreasing the number of cars and congestion levels in the \n     parks. Improved transit related to our parks is key to \n     diversifying transportation choices and access for the \n     benefit of all who might visit our national park system. It \n     is also vital to assuring equal access for all citizens to \n     our parks, including those without cars.\n       We appreciate your leadership on this issue and your \n     dedication to the health of our national parks and expanded \n     choices in our transportation systems. We look forward to \n     working with you to move your legislation forward.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Michael Replogle,\n     Transportation Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Community Transportation\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 7, 2001.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: The Community Transportation \n     Association continues to support your efforts to provide \n     alternative transportation strategies in our national parks \n     and other public lands. Our association's 3,400 members \n     provide public and community transportation services in many \n     of the smaller communities that border these\n\n[[Page S7114]]\n\n     national parks, monuments, and recreational areas, and our \n     association has members actively involved in providing \n     transportation services at several national parks.\n       All of us know the danger that congestion and increases in \n     traffic pose for the future of these sites and locations. \n     Your continued sponsorship of the Transit in Parks Act is an \n     important step in helping ensure that America's natural \n     beauty and historic treasures remain a continuous part of our \n     nation's future. We have members throughout the country whose \n     experiences support the principle that public transit \n     investments in and near national parks and public lands can \n     improve mobility, support the economic vitality of these \n     parks' ``gateway communities,'' and make dramatic \n     improvements in the experiences of park visitors, employees, \n     and community residents alike.\n       As an illustration of this point, enclosed is an article \n     recently published in our Community Transportation magazine \n     that discusses public transportation as part of the solution \n     to traffic congestion and mobility issues in Acadia, Yosemite \n     and Zion National Parks. These success stories could be \n     replicated in many other communities under your Transit in \n     Parks proposal.\n       We appreciate your dedicated efforts and initiative in this \n     regard, and look forward to helping you advance this \n     important piece of legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Dale J.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Human Germline gene modification is not needed to save \n     lives, or alleviate suffering, of existing people. Its target \n     population is ``prospective people'' who have not been \n     conceived.\n       (2) The cultural impact of treating humans as biologically \n     perfectible artifacts would be entirely negative. People who \n     fall short of some technically achievable ideal would be seen \n     as ``damaged goods'', while the standards for what is \n     genetically desirable will be those of the society's \n     economically and politically dominant groups. This will only \n     increase prejudices and discrimination in a society where too \n     many such prejudices already exist.\n       (3) There is no way to be accountable to those in future \n     generations who are harmed or stigmatized by wrongful or \n     unsuccessful human germline modifications of themselves or \n     their ancestors.\n       (4) The negative effects of human germline manipulation \n     would not be fully known for generations, if ever, meaning \n     that countless people will have been exposed to harm probably \n     often fatal as the result of only a few instances of germline \n     manipulations.\n       (5) All people have the right to have been conceived, \n     gestated, and born without genetic manipulation.\n\n     SEC.    03. PROHIBITION ON HUMAN GERMLINE GENE MODIFICATION\n\n       (a) In General.--Title 18, United States Code, is amended \n     by inserting after chapter 15, the following:\n\n                ``Chapter 16--Germline Gene Modification\n\n``Sec.\n``301.

Definitions\n\n       ``In this chapter:\n       (1) Human germline gene modification.--The term `human \n     germline modification' means the intentional modification of \n     DNA in any human cell (including human eggs, sperm, \n     fertilized eggs, zygotes, blastocysts, embryos, or any \n     precursor cells that will differentiate into gametes or can \n     be manipulated to do so) for the purpose of producing a \n     genetic change which can be passed on to future individuals, \n     including inserting, deleting or altering DNA from any \n     source, and in any form, such as nuclei, chromosomes, \n     nuclear, mitochondrial, and synthetic DNA. The term does not \n     include any modification of cells that are not a part of and \n     will not be used to create human embryos. Nor does it include \n     the change of DNA involved in the normal process of sexual \n     reproduction.\n       ``(2) Human haploid cell.--The term `haploid cell' means a \n     cell that contains only a single copy of each of the human \n     chromosomes, such as eggs, sperm, and their precursors.\n       ``(3) Somatic cell.--The term `somatic cell' means a \n     diploid cell (having two sets of the chromosomes of almost \n     all body cells) obtained or derived from a living or deceased \n     human body at any stage of development.

Sponsor: Senator Rockefeller.\n  S. 1093: Miscellaneous veterans' benefits provisions (based on \ninformal input from VA):\n\n\n                               Compensation\n\n  a. Eliminate compensation for incarcerated persons--We previously \nenacted legislation to reduce compensation to incarcerated veterans to \nthe equivalent of 10 percent, disability compensation (or, if they only \nreceived 10 percent, to the equivalent of 5 percent). Veterans that \nwere already incarcerated were grandfathered out of the reduction. This \nchange would stop only future payments to these veterans.\n  b. Reduce benefits for fugitive felons--Currently, veterans who are \nfugitive from justice are eligible to receive VA benefits. This would \nbar them from receiving benefits while a fugitive (fleeing prosecution, \nconfinement for a felony, or in violation of a condition of probation \nor parole).\n  c. Duty to assist (technical corrections).\n\n\n                        vocational rehabilitation\n\n  Eliminate the cap of 500 veteran participants in Voc Rehab's \n``Independent Living'' program. The cap was set when the program was \ninitially piloted. While the time limit on the program was repealed, \nthe cap on participants was not. VA has not turned any one away from \nthe program, but has been exceeding 500 veterans in the last couple of \nyears. The goal of the program is to assist a veteran who is too \ndisabled to retrain for employment to achieve and maintain a stated \nindependent living outcome.\n\n\n                              loan guaranty\n\n  Increase the home loan guaranty amount to $63,175 from the current \n$50,750, to keep pace with FHA (and the even higher Fannie Mae or \nFreddie Mac). The VA amount has not been increased since 1994.\n\n\n                                education\n\n  Overturn court decision eliminating the delimiting date for use of \nchapter 35 educational benefits by surviving spouses. The spouse would \nbe allowed to choose the beginning date of the eligibility period. It \ncould be any date between the effective date of the rating of the \nveteran's service-connected disability as permanently and totally \ndisabling, and the date VA notified the veteran of this fact. A 10-year \nperiod would run from the date the spouse chose.\n\n\n                                 pension\n\n  a. Excludes life insurance proceeds from countable income for \ndetermination of nonservice-connected death pension eligibility for \npoor surviving spouses of wartime veterans. Currently, counting life \ninsurance could make the spouse ineligible for a year. Modifies \neffective date of beginning benefits.\n  b. Modifies the requirement for pensioners to report changes in \nincome at the end of the month, to the end of the year.\n  S. 131: To increase the rate of the basic benefit of MGIB to the \naverage cost of tuition next fiscal year, and then modify the annual \nCOLA to be pegged to educational inflation.
