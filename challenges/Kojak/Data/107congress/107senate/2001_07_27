Madam President, the majority leader has asked I advise \neveryone that the Senate will resume consideration of the \nTransportation Appropriations Act under postcloture conditions. Cloture \nwas invoked yesterday by a margin of 70-30.\n  We hope to be able to work out an agreement on this matter today, if \npossible. If we can't, we would have a vote tonight on the matter now \nbefore the Senate dealing with cloture at approximately 8:45. There \nwill be votes throughout the day on other matters if we are not able to \nwork something out.\n  As we announced yesterday, we very much hope we can move to the \nagricultural emergency supplemental authorization bill. It is extremely \nimportant that be done prior to the August recess. We also have, as my \nfriend, the ranking member of the Banking Committee, knows, concern \nabout moving forward on the Export Administration Act, which also \nshould be done before our August recess because that law expires in \nmid-August. The high-tech industry throughout America has been calling \nour offices asking that we do this. With the slowdown of the high-tech \nindustry, we need to move this legislation.\n  As I indicated, there will be rollcall votes throughout the day. We \nhope we can move forward on other matters, but we understand the Senate \nrules and will abide by whatever Senators McCain and Gramm think is \nnecessary.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, the Senate is now considering the \nTransportation appropriations bill that has now been before the Senate \nfor a week. There are a number of provisions in this bill that are \nextremely important to our Nation's infrastructure. This is a bill that \nI have been very proud to work on in a bipartisan way with the ranking \nmember of my committee, Senator Shelby. I will take a moment this \nmorning to recognize the tremendous work and help of Senator Shelby and \nhis staff and our staff. They have spent long nights negotiating this \nbill this week, working to a\n\n[[Page S8302]]\n\npoint where we could get this bill out and do it in a way that provides \nthe infrastructure we think is so important, whether it is for our \nairports, our railways, whether it is for our roads or waterways.\n  There are extremely important provisions in this bill for many \nMembers of the Senate. We have had considerable requests from every \nMember of the Senate for important infrastructure improvements in their \nState. I am very proud of the work Senator Shelby and I have done. We \nhave worked extremely hard for the last 5 months to put this bill \ntogether. I think we have done a very good job. We have met and \nexceeded every request of this President, unlike the House, and we have \ndone a good job, I believe, of meeting the transportation requirements \nof every Senator who has come to us.\n  I was pleased yesterday we were able to come to cloture on this \nmeasure on a very strong vote from the Senate of 70-30. I realize there \nare some Members of the Senate who think the provisions do not meet \ntheir requirements, but I think we have done a very good job of not \ndoing what the House did, which was to absolutely prohibit any truck \nfrom coming across the border, and not do what the President has asked, \nwhich was to simply open up the borders and let trucks come through at \nwill, but to put together a comprehensive piece of legislation which I \nbelieve will clearly mean we will be able to have a bill that is passed \nthat assures constituents, whether they live in Washington State or \nconstituents living in border States, when they see a truck with a \nMexican license plate, they will know that truck has been inspected, \nthat its driver has a good record, that it is safe to be on our \nhighways, as we now require of Canadian trucks and American trucks.\n\n  Can we do better for all trucks on our highways? Absolutely. But it \nis clear we need to make sure, as NAFTA provisions go into place and we \ndo start getting cross-border traffic, we can assure our moms who are \ndriving kids to school, or our families who travel on vacation, or each \none of us as we drive to work today, that we know our highways are \nsafe. I believe the provisions we have put into this bill do make sure \nthat happens.\n  I understand from the Senator from Nevada we will have a vote \nsometime this morning. I will take some time between now and then to \nwalk through again what the compromise provisions are. I think they are \nvery solid and give a lot of assurance. It is important we understand \nwhat we are passing out of the Senate.\n  The DOT plans to issue conditional operating authority to Mexican \ntruck companies based on a simple mail-in questionnaire. All that \nMexican truck companies will need to do is simply check a box saying \nthey have complied with U.S. regulations and then their trucks will \nstart rolling across the border. In fact, under the Department of \nTransportation plan, Mexican trucking companies will be allowed to \noperate for at least a year and a half before they are subjected to any \ncomprehensive safety audit by the DOT.\n  So under the committee provisions that we have written in a \nbipartisan manner with the members of Senator Shelby's staff, under the \nsubcommittee's unanimous vote, and under the full committee's unanimous \nvote, no Mexican trucking firm will be allowed to operate beyond the \ncommercial zone until inspectors have actually performed a compliance \nreview on that trucking company. This review will look at the \nconditions of the truck and the recordkeeping. They are going to \ndetermine whether the company actually has the capacity to comply with \nUnited States safety regulations, and once they have begun operating in \nthe United States, Mexican trucking firms will undergo a second \ncompliance review within 18 months. That second review will allow the \nDepartment of Transportation to determine whether the Mexican trucking \nfirm has, in fact, complied with United States safety standards, and it \nwill allow them to review accident breakdown rates, their drug and \nalcohol testing results, and whether they have been cited frequently \nfor violations.\n  The ratification of NAFTA 7 years ago anticipated a period when \ntrucks from the United States, Canada, and Mexico would have free rein \nto service clients across all three countries. This was not really a \nchange in policy as it pertained to Canada since the United States and \nCanada had reciprocal trucking agreements in place long before NAFTA \nwas ever required. But it did, as we know, require a change when it \ncame to truck traffic between the United States and Mexico.\n  Let me say that again. We have had a long-time policy that pertains \nto Canada because we have had reciprocal agreements in place for some \ntime. But with the ratification of NAFTA, and now with the January \ndeadline coming upon us, we knew we had to take action when it came to \ntruck traffic between the United States and Mexico.\n  For several years the opening up of the border between these two \ncountries was effectively put on hold by the administration because \nthey had great concern over the absence of reasonable safety standards \nfor trucks that were operating in Mexico. While Mexican trucks have \nbeen allowed to operate between Mexico and a very defined commercial \nzone along the border--20 miles--the safety record of those trucks has \nbeen abysmal. In fact, the Department of Transportation's own inspector \ngeneral, the General Accounting Office, and many others have published \na number of reports that have documented the safety hazards that have \nbeen presented by the current crop of Mexican trucks crossing the \nborder.\n  At a hearing of the Commerce Committee just last week, the inspector \ngeneral came to that committee hearing and testified about instances \nwhere trucks have crossed the border literally with no brakes. Think \nabout the impact of that, if you are a mom driving your kids to school, \nor if you are driving a bus carrying a busload of kids to school, or \ndriving on vacation, or if you are going to work: A truck that has no \nbrakes and it has crossed the border because we have lack of \ninspectors, we have lack of inspection, and we have the lack of ability \nto assure the safety of those Mexican trucks.\n  Officials with that IG office visited every single border crossing \nbetween the United States and Mexico, and they have documented case \nafter case of Mexican trucks entering the United States that were \ngrossly overweight, that had no registration or insurance, and that had \ndrivers with no licenses. We have an obligation to assure that the \ntrucks that drive on our roads have registration, have insurance, have \ndrivers with licenses, and that meet our weight requirements. These are \nsimple, basic safety measures that we have to reassure every family who \ndrives in our country.\n\n  In fact, according to the Department of Transportation's most recent \nfigures, Mexican trucks are 50 percent more likely to be ordered off \nthe road for severe safety deficiencies than United States trucks. And \nMexican trucks are more than 2\\1/2\\ times more likely to be ordered off \nthe road than Canadian trucks. Equally troubling to all of us is the \nfact that Mexican trucks have been routinely violating the current \nrestrictions that limit their area of travel to the 20-mile commercial \nzones.\n  Knowing these things, we knew we had an obligation as we passed this \nbill in the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee to make sure we \nput in safety requirements. Knowing that Mexican trucks are 50 percent \nmore likely to be ordered off the road, we knew we had to put in safety \nrequirements to assure, as trucks begin to travel beyond that 20-mile \nlimit, even though as some of our colleagues have pointed out they are \nalready doing so illegally--but once they are allowed to do that under \nthe President's order, we need to make sure those trucks are safe \nbefore they come in.\n  The DOT inspector general found that 52 Mexican trucking firms have \noperated improperly in over 26 States outside the four southern border \nStates. Already, in 26 States of our country, we have these trucks \ncoming in. That is one reason Senator Shelby, the ranking member of the \nTransportation Subcommittee, and I put the money into this bill that \nthe House had stripped out--$15 million more than the administration \nhad requested--in order to ensure that we have inspectors in place and \ninspection stations and weigh stations, so we can monitor the traffic \ncrossing our southern border.\n  An additional 200 trucking firms violated the restrictions to stay \nwithin\n\n[[Page S8303]]\n\nthat commercial zone in the border States. We know Mexican trucks have \nbeen found operating illegally as far away from the Mexican border as \nNew York State in the Northeast and my own State of Washington in the \nNorthwest. We know the trucks are coming in now illegally to 26 States \nfrom 200 trucking firms. We want to make sure that as it becomes legal \nfor them to be crossing the border, they are safe; that is a basic \nsafety requirement, that we have an obligation as Senators to be able \nto go home and say to our constituents as the NAFTA provisions take \neffect.\n  Let me just take a moment to remind my colleagues, I supported NAFTA. \nI support free trade. I believe this NAFTA provision will raise the \nsafety and health standards and labor standards for all three countries \nas it goes into place. But it will not do that if we lessen the safety \nrequirements of the United States as it is implemented. That is why \nthis provision is so critical.\n  One thing I found shocking was that the inspector general reported on \none case where a Mexican truck was found, on its way to Florida to \ndeliver furniture, and when that vehicle was pulled over, that driver \nhad no logbook and no license. As I said, this is not unique; there \nhave been experiences such as this in half of the States of the \ncontinental United States.\n  Given that kind of deplorable safety record, the official position of \nthe U.S. Government since the ratification of NAFTA was that the border \ncould not be opened to cross-border trucking because of the safety \nrisks involved.\n  Why has that changed? Why are we now dealing with this provision on \nthe floor of the Senate? Two things have basically changed that policy \nof restricting those trucks to within that 20-mile border.\n  First of all, of course, a new administration has come into power and \nthey have said they want our borders opened.\n  Second, the Mexican Government successfully brought a case before the \nNAFTA arbitration panel. That panel has ruled the U.S. Government must \ninitiate efforts to open the border to cross-border traffic. So in \norder to do that, a frenzy of activity occurred at the Department of \nTransportation so the border could be open to cross-border trucking, as \nsoon as this autumn, they said.\n  The Department of Transportation has cobbled together a series of \nmeasures that was sort of intended to give us, as United States \ncitizens, a sense of security, but I really saw it as a false sense of \nsecurity as this new influx of Mexican trucks is coming across the \nboarder.\n  Both the House and the Senate Transportation Appropriations \nSubcommittees have looked at what the Department of Transportation is \ndoing very hastily to allow these trucks in, and we determined it was \nwoefully inadequate.\n  When the House debated the Transportation appropriations bill for \nfiscal year 2002, its concerns about the inadequacy of the Department \nof Transportation's safety measures were so grave that it resulted in \nan amendment being adopted on the floor of the House that prohibited \nthe Department of Transportation from granting operating authority to \nany Mexico-domiciled trucking company during fiscal year 2002.\n  That amendment passed by a 2-to-1 margin. It is an amendment that \nprohibits the Department of Transportation from granting operating \nauthority to any Mexican domiciled truck. That amendment passed 2 to 1 \nby a vote of 285-143. By the time the Transportation bill left the \nHouse, it was in pretty bad shape. Not only did they pass that \namendment 2 to 1 to prohibit any truck from coming across, but they \nstripped every penny of the $88 million the administration requested to \nimprove the truck safety inspection capacity of the United States-\nMexico border.\n  That bill, I believed, and Senator Shelby believed, and others who \nworked with us believed, was simply the approach that went too far by \ntaking all of the money away so there were no inspectors, no inspection \nstations, no weigh stations, and no ability to allow the NAFTA \nprovisions to go through. We believed that the administration's \nposition, on the other hand, was also woefully inadequate. Their \nposition was to allow Mexican trucks to come in, come across our \nborders, traverse all our States, and inspect them later. The House has \none extreme and the White House has another extreme.\n  That is why Senator Shelby and I sat down and worked with members of \nthe appropriations subcommittee and the full committee. I commend \nSenator Stevens and Senator Byrd who have been working diligently with \nboth of us. They care deeply about the many provisions in this bill, \nfrom the infrastructure improvements that affect all of our highways \nand our waterways. The Coast Guard and the FAA have worked with us to \nmove this bill to a point so we can get it passed in the Senate, get it \nto conference, work out the differences between us and the White House, \nand move to a point where we can fund the critical infrastructure, as \nmany of our constituents sit in traffic this morning and listen to this \ndebate.\n  What Senator Shelby and I have done is to really write a commonsense \ncompromise that will inspect all Mexican trucks and then let them in.\n  Let me say that again. The compromise position between the House at \none extreme and the White House at another is to make sure that all \nMexican trucks are inspected, and then let them in. Just as we require \nAmericans to pass a driving test before they get a license, the \nbipartisan Senate bill requires Mexican trucks to pass an inspection \nbefore they can operate on our roads.\n  As I said, our bill includes the $103 million. That is $15 million \nmore than the President's request.\n  The reason I say that again pointedly is the administration has said \nthat with the provisions Senator Shelby and I have put into this bill, \nthey will not have the money to implement it.\n  I remind the administration that they asked for $15 million less than \nwe appropriated. We put $103 million into this bill for border truck \nsafety initiatives. If the Department of Transportation, the OMB, and \nthe President determine when this bill gets to conference that we do \nnot have enough money for the truck safety activities and that should \nbe part of our discussion, they need to request more money in order to \nput that in place. We are happy to work with them on that request. But \njust to say we have not appropriated enough money and we can't ensure \nthe safety of trucks coming in, to me, is a woefully inadequate \nresponse.\n  The bill we have before us establishes a number of enhanced truck \nsafety requirements that really are intended to ensure that this new \ncross-border trucking activity doesn't pose a safety risk to our \nfamilies and the people traveling on our highways, whether it is in a \nsouthern border State or a northern border State.\n\n  None of us wants to be sitting here several months from now or a year \ndown the road and have a horrendous accident occur in our States and \nfind after the fact the truck that was involved in the accident was \nnever inspected at our border because of lack of inspections, was never \nweighed, or that the driver had an invalid operating license or a poor \nsafety record. None of us wants to face our constituents with that kind \nof tragedy.\n  Senator McCain has been a wonderful help to me in the past. We worked \ntogether on a bill on pipeline safety after a tragedy occurred in my \nState where three young people were killed when a pipeline broke. Oil \nfrom that pipeline traveled down along a 1-mile stretch of river in \nBellingham, WA. Three young boys were fishing by that river and playing \nby that river. Tragically, one of them lit a match and the entire mile \nof that river burst into flames. Three young boys were tragically \nkilled on that day.\n  As the ranking member of the Commerce Committee, Senator McCain has \nbeen just absolutely wonderful in working with us on that provision and \nworking to pass a bill out of the Senate. But, unfortunately, it is now \nhung up in the House, and it has been for some time. I hope they can \nmove it forward to ensure that our pipelines are safe. But we did that \nafter a tragic accident.\n  I think it is much more effective, much more wise, and the right \nthing to do to put the safety requirements in place before we are \nreacting to a tragic accident.\n\n[[Page S8304]]\n\n  The safety provisions that are included in this Senate bill were \ndeveloped based on the recommendations the committee received from the \nDOT inspector general, the General Accounting Office, and law \nenforcement authorities, including the highway patrols of the States \nalong the border.\n  The provisions we put in this bill didn't just come from matching. We \nworked very closely, looking at what the DOT inspector general \nrecommendations were, the GAO, law enforcement authorities, and highway \npatrols working along the southern border. We used their \nrecommendations to draft and put in place what we believe are very \nstrong safety provisions within the underlying bill.\n  Once again, I was very pleased that 70 Members of the Senate affirmed \nthat we do indeed need to have these safety requirements in place and \nto move this bill along to final passage so we can put in place the \nimportant infrastructure requirements that this country is demanding \nand that our constituents are demanding.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, will the Senator from Washington yield \nfor a question?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am pleased to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Washington please advise Members of \nthe Senate and those who are following this debate where we are in this \ndebate on the Transportation appropriations bill?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I think it was 2 weeks ago that the Senate \nTransportation Subcommittee unanimously passed a Transportation bill. \nThe Senator from Illinois serves on that committee and has been working \nwith us. I appreciate his concern. He has a number of projects in \nIllinois that I know he wants to have put in place, but he doesn't want \nthem hung up by a long and protracted debate over another issue in the \nSenate. I know the Senator from Illinois, who serves on our \nsubcommittee, worked well with Members on the other side several weeks \nago. It was a little more than a week ago that it passed out of the \nfull committee of the Senate Appropriations Committee. We worked in a \nbipartisan way and unanimously voted out the provisions of this bill \nthat fund the infrastructure needs of all 50 States, which include the \nsafety provisions we are discussing this morning. We went to this bill \nlast Friday. I believe it was around 2 in the afternoon.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is the Senator from Washington telling us that we have \nbeen debating this bill for a week?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Yes. This bill has been debated in the Senate for an \nentire week now. We began debate last Friday morning. I made my opening \nremarks. Senator Shelby and I have worked very closely on this bill. He \nmade his opening remarks. We opened it up for debate. We have one \namendment that is now pending on the bill that Senator Shelby and I put \nforward which adds additional safety requirements to the underlying \nbill. It is, frankly, supported by every Member of the Senate, and by \nthe White House, which has been requesting improved safety conditions \nas well. That began last Friday.\n  We asked Members to come to the floor to begin the debate, and we \noffered our bill up for amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I ask the Senator, I am trying to recall how many \ntimes we have voted this week on amendments to this bill. I can't \nrecall more than a handful of times that we have voted.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is correct. Senator Shelby and I have been \nhere. In fact, I got up at 4 o'clock Monday morning to come back from \nmy home State of Washington to be on the floor Monday afternoon and ask \nSenators to bring their amendments forward. We waited. We have had a \nfew amendments. I believe we have had four or five with which Members \ncame to the floor and finally offered. We were here Monday evening:\n  I came back on Tuesday morning, ready and begging and telling \nSenators: We are ready to move this bill along. Offer your amendments. \nWe will vote them up or down. In a week, we have only passed a handful \nof amendments that Senators have brought to the floor. I would have \nbeen happy if there were 20 amendments. Send them forward. We will vote \nthem up or down.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield, I ask the Senator from \nWashington, I believe she believes, as I do, that the nature of this \nlegislative process in the Senate is, if you have an amendment, you \nshould have the right to offer it, debate it, and bring it to a vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Absolutely. The Senator from Illinois is correct. We are \nhere. Senators have a right to offer amendments. We are happy to \nconsider their amendments. In fact, we have had several amendments on \nboth sides that were adopted by voice vote. We have been waiting in \nthis Chamber. Our staffs have been working diligently until 2 or 3 \no'clock in the morning every night in negotiations with Senators \nconcerned about the safety provisions, as well as working with Members \nwho have provisions within the bill. We could have finished this easily \nMonday evening with the number of amendments we have.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield, on this important issue about \nthe inspection of Mexican trucks and drivers coming into the United \nStates, is it not a fact that yesterday we had a procedural vote, known \nas a cloture vote, which basically says that at some point the debate \nhas to end, and we have to come to a vote? Can the Senator from \nWashington tell us what the vote was of the Senate to bring this debate \nto an end and bring this issue to a vote?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Illinois is correct. After sitting here \nall Friday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, it was determined, since \nSenators were unwilling to offer amendments and have them voted up or \ndown, we needed to move along. As the Senator from Illinois knows, \nserving on the Appropriations Committee, we have a number of other \nappropriations bills that need to pass in order to meet the October 1 \ndeadline. There are many other priorities of Senators.\n  We decided the best way to move forward was to have a cloture vote, \nwhich then allows us to move along and finish this debate. Seventy of \nthe 100 Senators said: Yes, it is time to move along; We are done with \noffering amendments; We want to get this bill passed; We want the \ninfrastructure improvements that are in this bill; We support the \nsafety requirements; Move it out of the Senate so we can get to a \nconference and pass this bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Washington if she will yield for \none or two more questions, and then I will yield the floor back to the \nSenator.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is it not true that because we have spent literally a \nweek with very few, if any, amendments being offered, with very little \ndebate on the floor, and really just a slowdown of activity, that we \nhave been unable to consider other important legislation? There is an \nAgriculture supplemental appropriations bill, which is an emergency \nbill that is needed, that we have been unable to bring to the floor, as \nwell as the Export Administration Act, which is important for our \neconomy so we can try to get people back to work and get businesses \nmoving forward.\n  All of this is being delayed because we have been unable to even come \nto a vote on important questions such as the inspection of Mexican \ntrucks and drivers. Is that not correct?\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Illinois is absolutely correct. What is \nin this bill is extremely important to my constituents. We have some of \nthe worst traffic in the Nation. I know the Senator from Illinois has \nsevere traffic problems. We share airport concerns in our home States \nfor which this bill has improvement funding. We are ready to go to \nfinal passage.\n  I would just add, I say to the Senator from Illinois, we have a \nmanagers' package ready to go. We could be done in the next half hour, \nmove this bill out, and go to the Ag bill to which the Senator \nreferred. I am deeply concerned that we have delayed its passage.\n  I have apple farmers and tree fruit farmers in central Washington who \nare in severe financial straits. They have suffered through a drought \nthat has hurt their crops. They have suffered through the impact of an \nAsian market that has declined tremendously in the last several years. \nMany of them are having to sell their farms. To me, it is devastating \nto watch these poor families. We have help for them in that Ag\n\n[[Page S8305]]\n\nbill. We have help for them in it, but they will not have that help \nuntil we pass this bill and move it on. And we need to do that, as the \nSenator from Illinois knows, before we leave next Friday. We have to \nget it to conference.\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada, am I correct that we need to get the \nAg bill to conference, out of conference, and back to the floor?\n  Mr. REID. Absolutely.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. So every minute we delay here means that a family farmer \nin Yakima, WA, who is suffering under severe financial distress, is \ngoing to have to sit through an August break--a month-long August \nbreak--not knowing whether or not they are going to get help from the \nU.S. Government.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Washington, thanks for yielding \nfor those questions. I will fight for any Senator's right to offer an \namendment, and also to debate it and bring it to a vote. That is what a \nlegislative body is all about. What we have seen for the past week is a \nslow dance. There are people who just do not want to see the Senate \nroll up its sleeves and get down to work.\n  We have a lot of things to do, such as for farmers, for exporting, \nand even for important issues such as the ones in the Transportation \nbill.\n  I salute the Senator from Washington for her patience and her \nperseverance and her strength. I hope we can get this job done very \nquickly and this bill passed.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senate from Illinois.\n  I would reiterate, again, that we are ready to go to final passage at \na moment's notice. We could wrap this bill up in the next half hour \nquite easily. We have a managers' package. I do not believe there is \nany other Senator who has any requests out there. We could pass the \nmanagers' package and move to third reading within a few minutes and \nSenators could go home for the weekend.\n  I know many Senators have called and said: Can we finish? I have a \nnoon flight I need to catch. I know that planes are leaving and people \nhave plans for this weekend. I certainly would like them to be able to \ngo home and see their families. I would like to go home and see my \nfamily, of course, but I am willing to stay here if that is what we \nneed to do. And I will stay here because what is in this bill is so \ncritically important to my constituents at home who are now sitting in \ntraffic at 7:30 in the morning.\n\n  Many of them are traveling to work right now, probably sitting in \ntraffic on the Alaskan Way Viaduct or the I-5 corridor because we have \nfailed to do our job.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, will the distinguished Senator, who is the \nmanager of the bill on this side of the aisle, yield for a question?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I would be delighted to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have a brief statement to make. I would like to make that \nstatement and go on to other issues. The distinguished Senator from \nArizona has been waiting. I would like to make my speech and get back \nto my office.\n  Could the Senator tell me about when I might be able to get the \nfloor? How much longer will she need?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that we do \nthis: That the Senator from Arizona have 5 minutes to speak, and that \nfollowing the Senator from Arizona, the Senator from West Virginia \nhave----\n  Mr. McCAIN. As much time as he might consume.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. As much time as he may consume.\n  Mr. GRAMM. We have plenty of time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could we modify that? Could I have 7 minutes?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Absolutely. That the Senator from Arizona have 7 \nminutes, and that following that, the Senator from West Virginia be \nrecognized, and following that I would like to finish my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, other \nthan to alert those Senators here. I have spoken to Senator Murray. She \nhas spoken to Senator Shelby. When these remarks are finished, there is \ngoing to be a motion to table on this amendment. I want to make sure \neveryone understands that or, otherwise, the Senator from Washington \nwill move now to table.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I amend my unanimous consent request to \nstate that following the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from West \nVirginia, Senator Shelby would like----\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask that Senator Shelby have 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Why don't you complete yours and then let me speak.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. And then I will be recognized at that time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object, Madam President, I would \nlike to have an opportunity to speak before the motion to table is put.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time would the Senator like?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I would like to have the opportunity to speak. I don't \nknow exactly how long it is going to take. I will not speak for any \nextended period of time, but I want to hear what else is said.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Texas for a \nspecific period of time. If we can't work that out, then I will make \nthe motion to table.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object to the unanimous consent request.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, then I will continue my remarks at this \ntime.\n  Madam President, in a moment I am going to review the committee's \nsafety recommendations in detail. But first I want to address the issue \nof compliance with NAFTA because it has been an issue that we have been \ntalking about for some time.\n  I have heard it alleged in this Chamber that the provision that was \nadopted unanimously by the committee is in violation of NAFTA. I want \nthe Senators in this Chamber to understand that nothing could be \nfurther from the truth.\n  I voted for NAFTA. I support free trade. My goal in this bill has \nalways been to ensure that free trade and public safety progress side \nby side.\n  Rather than take my opinion on this issue or that of another Senator, \nwe have a written decision by an arbitration panel that was charged \nwith settling this very issue.\n  That arbitration panel was established under the NAFTA treaty. That \npanel's rulings decide what does and does not violate NAFTA.\n  I have heard many Senators say that provisions violate NAFTA or that \nthe President should decide what violates NAFTA. In fact, I believe the \namendment that is pending before the Senate says the President should \ndecide what violates NAFTA. We do not decide that here. The arbitration \npanel decides what violates NAFTA. I will read to the Senate a quote \nfrom the findings of the arbitration panel. That quote is printed right \nhere on this poster. I will take a minute to read it.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Washington yield?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I would like to propound a unanimous consent request.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following the remarks \nof the Senator from Washington, the Senator from Arizona, be recognized \nfor 7 minutes; the Senator from West Virginia for 10 minutes; the \nSenator from Texas be recognized for up to 10 minutes; that the Senator \nfrom North Dakota be recognized for 10 minutes, Mr. Dorgan; and \nfollowing that, the Senator from Alabama be recognized for 5 minutes \nfor the purpose of offering a motion to table the amendment now \npending.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, with that, let me quickly read this and \nremind my colleagues that the arbitration panel has stated that:\n\n       The United States may not be required to treat applications \n     from Mexican trucking firms in exactly the same manner as \n     applications from United States or Canadian firms. . . .\n\n  In other words, we have the ability within this country to write the \nsafety provisions that we have written under these provisions to ensure \nthe safety of the people who travel on our highways. That is the \npremise we have made. The amendment that we will be voting on\n\n[[Page S8306]]\n\nshortly says that the President can decide what violates NAFTA and what \ndoes not.\n  Clearly, the arbitration panel makes that decision. The Senate \neffectively, I remind my colleagues, voted on the pending amendment \nwhen we tabled the Gramm-McCain amendment by a vote of 65-35. That \namendment, as the amendment we will vote on shortly, is really a wolf \nin sheep's clothing. It is designed to gut the safety provisions in \nthis bill by allowing the President to waive whatever safety provision \nin the bill he does not like.\n  If the Appropriations Committee thought that the DOT's plans to \naddress the safety risks posed by Mexican trucks were adequate, we \nwouldn't have put the important safety provisions into this bill.\n  What this amendment does say is, OK, administration, whatever safety \nrequirements in this bill you don't like, find a White House attorney \nwho will say it is a violation of NAFTA.\n  Which provision will they choose to throw away? Will it be the \nrequirement to verify that a Mexican truck driver's licence has not \nbeen revoked? Will it be the requirement to inspect trucks when they \ncome across the border? Will it be a requirement to demonstrate that \nthe Mexican trucks have insurance? Under the amendment we will vote on, \nwe won't know. It simply says we will allow the President to gut \nwhatever safety requirement he would like.\n\n  I voted for NAFTA. My goal is not to stop free trade. My goal is to \nsee that free trade and safety progress side by side.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I am sorry the Senator from Illinois \njust left the floor because he seemed to be deeply concerned about the \nprocess. From a Chicago Tribune editorial, headlined ``Honk If You \nSmell Cheap Politics,'' I will read a couple of quotes. Quoting from \nthe Tribune:\n\n       As political debates go, the one in the Senate against \n     allowing Mexican trucks access to the U.S. is about as \n     dishonest as it gets. The talk is all about safety and \n     concern about how rattletrap Mexican semis, driven by inept \n     Mexicans, would plow into Aunt Bee putt-putting to the \n     grocery store in her Honda Civic somewhere in Pleasantville, \n     U.S.A.\n       Truth is that Teamster truckers don't want competition from \n     their Mexican counterparts, who now have to transfer their \n     loads near the border to American-driven trucks, instead of \n     driving straight through to the final destination. But to \n     admit that would sound too crass and self-serving, so Sen. \n     Patty Murray, and others pushing the Teamster line, instead \n     are prattling on about road safety.\n\n  It ends with:\n\n       President Bush vows to veto this version of the bill, and \n     quite rightly so. In 1993, the U.S. signed and ratified \n     NAFTA. The agreement went into effect in 1994. There is no \n     justification now, more than seven years later, for the U.S. \n     to try to weasel out of some of its provisions.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the complete editorial be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, July 27, 2001]\n\n                    Honk If You Smell Cheap Politics\n\n       As political debates go, the one in the Senate against \n     allowing Mexican trucks access to the U.S. is about as \n     dishonest as it gets. The talk is all about safety and \n     concern about how rattletrap Mexican semis, driven by inept \n     Mexicans, would plow into Aunt Bea putt-putting to the \n     grocery store in her Honda Civic, somewhere in Pleasantville, \n     U.S.A.\n       Truth is that Teamster truckers don't want competition from \n     their Mexican counterparts, who now have to transfer their \n     loads near the border to American-driven trucks, instead of \n     driving straight through to the final destination. But to \n     admit that would sound too crass and self-serving, so Sen. \n     Patty Murray (D-Wash.), and others pushing the Teamster line, \n     instead are prattling on about road safety.\n       The Bush administration--with a surprising assist from \n     Arizona Sen. John McCain--is right to insist that the U.S. \n     comply with its obligations under the North American Free \n     Trade Agreement and allow Mexican trucks full access to our \n     roads, beginning in January.\n       Under NAFTA, which went into effect in 1994, there was \n     supposed to be free access to all trucks within Canada, the \n     U.S. and Mexico by January of last year. That only makes \n     sense: There is no point in freeing up trade but restricting \n     the means to move the goods.\n       But with the 2000 elections looming, President Bill Clinton \n     caved in to pressure from the Teamsters and delayed \n     implementation of the free-trucking part of the agreement. \n     Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore got the Teamsters' \n     endorsement and the Mexican government filed a complaint \n     against the U.S. for violation of NAFTA rules. Mexico won.\n       A spokesman for the U.S.-Mexico Chamber of Commerce and \n     others in Washington have whispered there may be bits of \n     racism and discrimination floating around in this soup, \n     because Canadian trucks and drivers are not subjected to \n     similar scrutiny and can move about freely anywhere in the \n     U.S.\n       It's worthwhile to note, too, that while the U.S. is \n     banning Mexican trucks, Mexico is returning the favor, so \n     neither country's trucks are going anywhere. As it stands, \n     Mexican trucks can come in only 20 miles into the U.S. before \n     they have to transfer their load.\n       Safety need not be an issue. An amendment proposed by \n     McCain and Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) incorporates safety \n     inspection safeguards to be sure drivers and trucks are fit \n     to travel U.S. roads. It's roughly modeled after California's \n     safety inspection system along its own border with Mexico. \n     Presumably, Mexico would inspect the trucks going the other \n     way.\n       Those are reasonable measures to protect motorists on both \n     sides of the border.\n       But Sen. Murray's amendment sets up a series of \n     requirements and hurdles so difficult to implement that they \n     would, in effect, keep the border closed to Mexican trucks \n     indefinitely.\n       President Bush vows to veto this version of the bill, and \n     quite rightly so. In 1993, the U.S. signed and ratified \n     NAFTA. The agreement went into effect in 1994. There is no \n     justification now, more than seven years later, for the U.S. \n     to try to weasel out of some its provisions.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Washington just stated how she had \nreceived requests for Transportation appropriations from every Member \nof this body. I hope she will correct the record. She received no \nrequest from my office. She received no request, nor ever will receive \na request from my office, for any transportation pork-barreling of \nwhich this bill is full.\n  This bill has surpassed the President's total budget request by \nnearly $4 billion. This year's bill contains 683 earmarks totaling \n$3.148 billion in porkbarrel spending. Last year, there was only $702 \nmillion. I congratulate the Appropriations Committee on this.\n  Always in the contract game of porkbarrel spending, some benefit \nsubstantially more than others. The State of West Virginia, for \ninstance, will be the proud recipient of $6,599,062 under the National \nScenic Byways Program. Of that money, $619,000 will be directed towards \n``Promoting Treasures Within the Mountains II'' program; $8,000 will be \ngiven to Virginia's chapel, and $22,640 will go to fund the SP Turnpike \nWalking Tour.\n  The State of Washington will also benefit substantially from the \nNational Scenic Byways Program. Under that portion of the bill, \nWashington will receive $2,683,767, of which $790,680 will fund the \nNorth Pend Orielle Scenic Byway--Sweet Creek Falls Interpretive Trail \nProject; $190,730 will be directed to the Paden Creek Visitor and \nSalmon Access, and $88,000 will fund the Oakcreek wildlife Byway \nInterpretive Site Project.\n  The programs go on and on. Let me tell you the real problem here, how \ngreat this problem gets over time: $4,650,000 is carved out of the \nCoast Guard portion of this bill to ``test and evaluate a currently \ndeveloped 85-foot fast patrol craft that is manufactured in the United \nStates and has a top speed of 40 knots. Fortunately, and I am sure, \ncoincidentally, for the State of Washington, there is only one company \nin the country which produces such a vessel, and it just happens to be \nGuardian Marine International, located in Edmonds, WA. Not only did the \nU.S. Coast Guard not ask for this vessel, they looked at the Guardian \nvessel, considered its merits, and concluded that it would not \nadequately meet the Coast Guard's needs. Taxpayers of America, look at \nthe Guardian fast patrol craft which will be yours whether the Coast \nGuard wants it or not.\n  Yesterday, very briefly, my friend from Nevada said that I was \nmistaken in my comments about setting a precedent. I think his comments \nwere well made. I accept them. There has not been the parliamentary \nmovement as there should have been. I stick to and want to reiterate \nand will continue to reiterate my comments that what we are doing on an \nappropriations bill is precedent setting. We are changing and\n\n[[Page S8307]]\n\nviolating a solemn treaty made between three nations, and we are doing \nit on an appropriations bill.\n  The Senator from Washington just enumerated the wonderful language \nfor safety that they have on an appropriations bill.\n  The authorizers, the committees that are given the responsibility and \nthe duty to authorize, are the ones who should have written this \nlanguage. The Appropriations Committee should only be appropriating \nmoney. Instead, in a precedent-setting procedure, they have now decided \nto include language which, according to the Governments of two \ncountries, Mexico and the United States, two freely elected Governments \nof both of those countries have deemed in violation of this solemn \ntreaty.\n  This language, according to the Mexican Government, according to the \nU.S. Government, is in violation of the North American Free Trade \nAgreement. We are subject, obviously, to significant sanctions but, \nmore importantly, again, the Senator from West Virginia is on the floor \nand he knows the history of this body more than I do. I do not know of \na single other time in the history of this body that a solemn \nagreement, a treaty, has been tampered with on an appropriations bill--\nin fact, abrogated to a large degree.\n  There were great debates over the role of the United States in \nVietnam. That was conducted under the aegis of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. There were other great debates on other foreign policy \nissues. All of them were conducted in this Chamber under the aegis and \nresponsibility of the Foreign Relations Committee and sometimes the \nArmed Services Committee.\n  I know of no time where the great debates on treaties were conducted \nas part of an appropriations bill on Transportation. This debate should \nbe taking place under the responsibility of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee and the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, and \nI allege again this is a precedent-setting move which, if it carries--\nand I still hope that it does not--I am convinced the President can \nmuster 34 votes to sustain a veto. This will have very serious \nconsequences for the way we do business in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I say to my friend from Arizona, who \nmentioned the money for scenic byways in West Virginia, all highways in \nWest Virginia are scenic, all highways. They are all scenic, and the \nmoney in this bill for scenic highways in West Virginia is going to be \nyielded in conference with the House.\n  I take great pride in the fact that all of West Virginia's highways \nare scenic, and I thank the Senator from Arizona for bringing to the \nattention of the Senate these scenic byways.\n  There are scenic byways in Arizona also. My wife and I traveled \nthrough Arizona in 1960 on our way to the Democratic Convention in Los \nAngeles. We took the southern route, and we came back to Washington on \nthe northern route. They are beautiful States that we traveled through.\n  Madam President, the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, went \ninto effect on January 1, 1994. I voted against NAFTA. Now, 6 years \nlater, the costs associated with NAFTA are becoming increasingly clear.\n  On February 6, 2001, a NAFTA dispute resolution panel concluded that \nthe U.S. refusal to approve any applications from Mexican motor \ncarriers who wanted to provide cross-border trucking services is a \nbreach of NAFTA. Even though the panel determined that the Mexican \nregulatory system for trucks was inadequate, they decided that this was \nan insufficient legal basis for the United States to maintain its \nmoratorium on approving cross-border trucking applications. In other \nwords, the panel decided that, even though Mexican trucks barreling \ndown American roads would endanger human health and safety, these \ntrucks must be allowed to enter.\n  This panel's decision has shifted the American public's concern about \nsafety into high gear. The Administration has said that it intends to \nlift the toll-gate to Mexican trucks sometime before January 1, 2002. \nInstead, we ought to downshift and carefully consider our route on this \nissue. Believing that Mexican trucks will suddenly come into compliance \nwith U.S. trucking safety standards within the next six months is like \nbelieving that a car will keep running without gas.\n  Mexican trucking is not well regulated. Mexican truck- and driver-\nsafety standards are nearly nonexistent. Mexican law fails to require \nmany of the fundamentals of highway safety policy that are required by \nU.S. law and regulation, such as enforced hours of service restrictions \nfor truck drivers or the use of log books. There is no Mexican truck \nsafety rating system and no comprehensive truck equipment standards. \nFrom the lack of basic requirements, it is apparent that Mexico is \nmaking little investment, and undertaking no regular maintenance, to \nensure that its trucks operate in accordance with fundamental trucking \nsafety standards. Opening our borders to more Mexican trucks would \nallow Mexico to export more than just goods to the United States; it \nwould export truckloads of danger.\n  Without Mexican investment to ensure that its motor carriers are \noperating safely, the financial burden of ensuring the safety of \nMexico-domiciled motor carriers operating in the United States is \nloaded onto the shoulders of the American taxpayer. From 1995 to the \npresent, the U.S. Department of Transportation has dedicated $22 \nmillion to the border States, above normal allocations, for the purpose \nof enhancing inspection capabilities. The Senate's fiscal year 2002 \nDepartment of Transportation Appropriations bill would appropriate an \nadditional $103.2 million for increased border inspections of Mexican \ntrucks. This amount is $15 million above the level included in the \nPresident's request. Of the more than $103 million provided, $13.9 \nmillion is provided to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration \nto hire 80 additional truck safety inspectors, an amount of $18 million \nis provided for enhanced Motor Carrier safety grants for the border, \nand $71.3 million is provided for the construction and improvement of \nMotor Carrier safety inspection facilities along the border between the \nUnited States and Mexico. Have we taken leave of our senses?\n\n  In addition to the costs associated with an increased need for \ninspection, more Mexican trucks on U.S. roads will compromise safety, \nand could result in serious accidents on our highways. During fiscal \nyear 2000, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration reports show \nfederal and state border inspectors performed 46,144 inspections on \nMexican trucks at the border and within the limited commercial zones \nwhere some Mexican trucks are currently allowed to travel. For those \ntrucks that were inspected, the percentage of trucks taken off the road \nfor serious safety violations, declined from 44 percent in fiscal year \n1997 to 36 percent in fiscal year 2000. Regardless of these \ninspections, the fact remains that more than one in three Mexican \ntrucks is a lemon. And we cannot count on inspections to cull out every \nsingle one of these time bombs and get them off our highways.\n  In February, I wrote to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick and \nTransportation Secretary Norman Mineta to urge that the United States \nnot compromise the safety of America's highways. We cannot, because of \na NAFTA dispute resolution panel decision, subvert U.S. safety \nstandards that have been put in place to protect travelers on our \nNation's roads. Until the United States and Mexico agree on \ncomprehensive safety standards, and until the United States is able to \neffectively enforce those standards, we must stand on the brakes \nagainst efforts that would compromise current U.S.-imposed safeguards \nfor Mexican trucks.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, so many issues have been talked about. I \nwant to begin my short remarks by reading the amendment which is \npending, because we are going to vote on this amendment when a motion \nis made to table it. What the amendment does is it accepts everything \nin the Murray amendment with the following proviso:\n\n       Provided that notwithstanding any other provision of the \n     act, nothing in this act shall be applied in a manner that \n     the President finds to be in violation of the North American \n     Free Trade Agreement.\n\n\n[[Page S8308]]\n\n\n  In other words, unless something is in violation of the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement, every provision in the Murray amendment \nwill stand if this amendment is adopted.\n  Senator Murray and her supporters say nothing in her provision \nviolates NAFTA. If nothing in her provision violates NAFTA, then this \namendment will have no effect. This amendment, in essence, shows the \nemperor has no clothes. We are having a lot of discussion on how tough \na safety standard we want. Under NAFTA, we can impose any safety \nstandards we want on Mexican trucks, but we have to impose the same \nstandards on Canadian trucks and on American trucks. Everyone is in \nagreement; we need to have safer trucks. Our own trucks need to be \nsafer, Canadian trucks need to be safer, and Mexican trucks need to be \nsafe to come into the country.\n  What is at issue is not safety but protectionism. What is at issue \nis, we had a President, George Bush, in 1994, who signed a solemn \nagreement with Mexico and Canada called the North American Free Trade \nAgreement. Then under another President, President Bill Clinton, we \nratified this agreement by enacting a bill in Congress that President \nClinton signed. Now, under another Republican President, President \nGeorge W. Bush, we have an effort to enforce the agreement we entered \ninto. Now we have an effort on an appropriations bill to violate the \ntreaty we negotiated and signed in 1994 and that we ratified under a \nDemocrat President.\n  Our colleagues keep talking about safety, but nothing having anything \nto do with safety would be stricken by this amendment. This amendment \nwould strike provisions that violate NAFTA. What are some of those \nprovisions? Provisions that say Mexican trucks have to carry a \ndifferent type of insurance than American trucks and Canadian trucks. \nProvisions that say Mexican truckers cannot lease their trucks in the \nsame way American truckers and Canadian truckers can lease their \ntrucks; penalty provisions where the penalties are different for \nMexican trucks than they are for American trucks and Canadian trucks; \nprovisions that say until we promulgate regulations that have to do \nwith the bill passed in 1999 that Canadian trucks can operate, American \ntrucks can operate, but Mexican trucks cannot operate. There is no more \nlogic to that provision in the Murray amendment than there would be in \nsaying we are not going to live up to a treaty obligation we made until \nFebruary the 29th occurs on a Sunday. It is totally and absolutely \narbitrary and totally and absolutely illegal, and it violates an \nagreement we entered into and have enforced under three Presidents.\n  What our amendment does is simply say, take everything in the Murray \namendment and it becomes the law of the land unless it violates NAFTA--\nunless it violates an agreement we entered into and Congress ratified. \nThat is exactly what the amendment does; no more, no less.\n  If you vote against this amendment, obviously you stand up on the \nfloor of the Senate and say anything you want to say; it is a free \ncountry. But if you vote against this amendment, you can't say, it \nseems to me, that you believe the Murray provision does not violate \nNAFTA. If you think it doesn't violate NAFTA, why not vote for this \namendment and settle this issue? Obviously, anybody who votes against \nthis amendment believes this amendment, despite all the denials of all \nthe proponents, violates obligations we have in an agreement we entered \nwith Mexico.\n  All over the world we are trying to get countries to live up to their \nagreements they have with us. What kind of credibility are we going to \nhave when we go back on a solemn commitment we made to our neighbor to \nthe south? What kind of credibility are we going to have when we treat \nour northern neighbor in one way, have one set of rules for them, but \nthen we say to our southern neighbor, we have an entirely different set \nof rules for you. In fact, we have to implement laws we passed in the \npast before you are even going to get an opportunity, in violation of \nNAFTA, to ever have a chance to compete.\n\n  The plain truth is, as the Chicago Tribune pointed out this morning, \nTeamster truckers don't want competition from their Mexican \ncounterparts. This is not about safety; this is about raw, rotten \nprotectionism, and it is about a willingness to go back on a solemn \ncommitment that our Nation made. I believe this is very harmful to \nAmerica. I think it undercuts the best ally we have ever had in a \nPresident of Mexico.\n  I reiterate, this may happen, but it is not going to happen until \nevery right that every Member of the Senate has is fully exercised. \nThis is an important issue. Some of our colleagues might wonder; in \nfact, people watching this probably wonder, when Senator McCain and I \nclearly don't have the votes, why don't we give this thing up? Our \nFounding Fathers, in establishing the structure of the Senate, \nunderstood there would be times when there would be issues that were \nimportant to America that were confusing, that people wouldn't \nunderstand, that could be cloaked in other issues. They understood \nthere would be vital national interests at stake. For those \ncircumstances, they gave one Member of the Senate the right to have \nextraordinary powers. It seems to me that having been blessed to have \nthe opportunity to serve here, as we all have, when we believe that a \nfundamentally important issue to the future of America and, in this \ncase, our relationship with our neighbor to the south and our \ncredibility in the world are at stake, any Member has an obligation to \nuse those rights.\n  I don't like inconveniencing my colleagues, but let me make it clear, \nat 8:42 tonight we will be in a position where cloture can occur on the \nbill. I am ready to vote. But I am going to exercise my full rights. \nThe people of Texas hired me to represent their interest and the \nnational interest, and Texas and the national interest are both \nviolated by going back on a treaty we made with Mexico.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from North Dakota is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as I walked on the floor, I heard the \nwords ``raw, rotten protectionism'' used on the floor of the Senate. I \nhad to smile because that is such an ill described position with \nrespect to what the Senate is doing. If you were to try to misdescribe \nwhat is going on in the Senate, you could not do it more aggressively \nthan to use terms such as ``raw, rotten protectionism.'' There is \nnothing protectionist about this issue.\n  This issue is about a trade agreement called NAFTA: a terrible trade \nagreement that, in my judgment, sold out the interests of this country; \na trade agreement that turned a very small surplus with the country of \nMexico into a huge deficit; and turned a moderate deficit with Canada \ninto a large deficit. NAFTA is a trade agreement that has not served \nthis country's interests, and we are now told, as a part of this trade \nagreement, we are required as a country to allow Mexican long-haul \ntrucks into this country. We are told that if we don't let in Mexican \nlong-haul trucks, we are somehow guilty of violating the NAFTA trade \npact. According to my colleague from Texas, if we don't allow Mexican \nlong-haul trucks into America, Mexico intends to retaliate on the \nmatter of corn syrup.\n  Sometimes it is a little too confusing. Mexico is already abusing its \ntrade policies on corn syrup by imposing the equivalent of a tariff \nranging from 43 percent to 76 percent on corn syrup exported from this \ncountry to Mexico. A panel has already ruled against Mexico on the \nissue of corn syrup, and, yet, they are now threatening that they may \ntake action on United States corn syrup if we don't allow Mexican long-\nhaulers into this country.\n  Is someone not thinking straight here? The only question, in my \njudgment, on this issue is, Is it in the interests of the American \npeople to allow Mexican long-haul trucks into this country at this \ntime? If we allow Mexican trucks to operate unfettered throughout the \nUnited States, will it sacrifice highway safety? Will it jeopardize \npeople on American highways? The answer to all of these questions is it \nwill jeopardize safety, it will compromise safety on our highways, and \nthis is not the time to do this.\n\n  Both the United States and Mexico have had 6 years to cogitate about \nthis--6 years. Really almost nothing\n\n[[Page S8309]]\n\nhas been done. We have 27 border crossings where trucks enter the \nUnited States, but a minuscule percent of those trucks are inspected. \nThirty-six percent of the Mexican trucks now coming into this country, \nand are now limited to a 20-mile zone, are turned back for serious \nsafety violations--36 percent. In most cases there are no inspections \nat all. There are no facilities to inspect. In only two of the border \nlocations are there inspection facilities during all commercial hours. \nIn most cases, there are no parking spaces and there are no phone lines \nto verify, for example, commercial driver's license data, and so on.\n  I have said it before, and I will say it again--I know it is \nrepetitious, but it is important to do--the San Francisco Chronicle, \nGod bless them, sent a reporter down to ride with a long-haul trucker. \nHe filed a report. Here is what he said.\n  This trucker he rode with traveled 1,800 miles in 3 days, slept 7 \nhours in 3 days--7 hours in 3 days--and drove a truck with a cracked \nwindshield that would not have passed U.S. inspection. The situation is \nmuch different in Mexico than in the United States. In Mexico, there \nare no standard hours of service in Mexico. There is a logbook \nrequirement, but it is not enforced so truckers do not have them. \nDuring the Chronicle reporter's ride with the Mexican trucker, there \nwere no safety inspections along the way.\n  Now we are told if we do not allow Mexican long-haul trucks into this \ncountry, we are somehow in violation of NAFTA. This is not violating \nanything. I am so tired of a ``blame our country first'' on all these \nissues. We are not going to violate anything if we decide that highway \nsafety in this country is important enough to say we will not, under \nany circumstances, allow Mexican long-haul trucks into this country \nuntil we have a regime of compliance and safety inspections that give \nus the assurance, yes, the assurance that Mexican trucks coming into \nthis country and the drivers are meeting the same rigorous, aggressive \nstandards we apply to American drivers and American trucks.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Do you want yourself, your families, your friends, your \nneighbors looking in the rearview mirror to see an 80,000-pound vehicle \ncoming behind you with a driver who has not slept in 24 hours, who has \nbrakes that may not work, and who has come across the border and has \nnot been inspected? Is that what you want for yourself or your family? \nI do not.\n  Let me just say again, there is not a ghost of a chance by January 1, \nwhen President Bush wants to allow these trucks in, that the inspectors \nnecessary to assure the protection of American drivers on America's \nroads will be in place. How do I know that? Because the Department of \nTransportation's Inspector General testified before the Commerce \nCommittee and said the administration is short of inspectors. Even the \nplan they are proposing will not allow the inspectors to be present to \nmake sure these trucks coming into our country are safe.\n  I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator from North Dakota a \nquestion. I voted for NAFTA, but I voted for it with the understanding \nthat we could impose the same health and safety standards on companies \nand countries exporting to the United States that we impose on American \ncompanies; that that would be fair trade. We would be treating \nourselves the same way as we treat others.\n\n  I want to make it clear for the record, and I think the Senator from \nNorth Dakota has made this point, all we are trying to establish is \nthat Mexican trucks and Mexican drivers will be held to the same \nstandards of safety and competency as American trucks and American \ndrivers. Is that the case?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is exactly the case. Let me just again say that when \nthe term ``raw rotten protectionism'' is used, it is wrong. There is \nnothing about this proposal to require similar standards on Mexican \ntrucks coming into this country as already exists for the American \ntrucking industry--there is nothing raw about that, there is nothing \nrotten about that, and there is nothing that is protectionist about \nthat. It represents common sense, something that is too often obscured \nin these debates in this country in public policy. It is especially \nobscured in trade policy.\n  Let me just say this to my friend from Illinois. I am aware of not \none trade agreement that this country has negotiated that would require \nus as Americans to sacrifice safety on America's roads. There is not \none trade agreement or one word in a trade agreement that requires us \nto do that. We should not do that. We will not do that.\n  When President Bush says on January 1 we are going to remove the 20-\nmile limit, and we are going to have Mexican drivers and trucks come \ninto this country unimpeded, when in fact he has not proposed the \ninspectors and compliance officers necessary to make certain this could \nbe done safely, in my judgment he is saying this trade agreement \nrequires us to diminish standards on America's roads. I will not accept \nthat. I do not support that. None of us in this Chamber, in my \njudgment, should vote for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will please suspend. Please take \nother conversations off the Senate floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Texas is attempting to weaken the \nprovisions in the Murray bill. I happen to think the Murray provisions \nare too weak. I would like a stronger provision. I want the House \nprovision to prevail that simply says during the next fiscal year, no \nfunds will be used for certifying long-haul Mexican trucks to come into \nthis country unimpeded beyond the 20-mile limit. As I said, I happen to \nthink the Murray provision is not strong enough.\n  The amendment that is before us is to try to weaken the Murray \nprovision. In my judgment, it makes no sense. I will not use terms such \nas ``raw, rotten protectionism'' because they are totally inappropriate \nabout this decision. This is not about discrimination. It is not about \ntrade. It is not about protectionism. It is not about anything that is \nraw or rotten. It is about whether we are willing to stand up for \nstandards we have already established in this country for safety on our \nroad dealing with 18-wheel, 80,000-pound trucks.\n  Do you want a driver behind you who has just come across the border \nwho has been awake for 24 straight hours and is driving a truck that is \nunsafe, with no brakes? I don't think so. These standards are radically \ndifferent in the United States. Ten hours of consecutive driving is all \nyou can do in the United States. You have to have logbooks. In Mexico, \nthey have no logbooks.\n\n  Alcohol and drug testing: In the United States, yes; in Mexico, no.\n  The list goes on and on and on.\n  We are nowhere near having equivalent standards and there is not a \nghost of a chance of that happening on January 1. All of us ought to \nrecognize it. This is not about trade. It is about safe hours and it is \nabout common sense. I hope when this vote is taken, common sense will \nprevail.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican assistant leader.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 minutes on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, I have been wanting to \nseek recognition, but I understood we were going to a rollcall. I say \nto the Senator from Oklahoma that if I can have 5 minutes to speak, I \nwill not object.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I have no objection to the Senator speaking. I wish to \nspeak for 5 minutes. If he wishes to, he can ask consent.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask consent that the Senator from Oklahoma and myself \neach be recognized for 5 minutes to speak.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, if I may make a \nparliamentary inquiry, if we add 10 minutes to the time we have \nalready, when will the vote take place?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That will be 11:33.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Shelby also has time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 15 minutes and then the vote. Is \nthere objection? Without objection, it\n\n[[Page S8310]]\n\nis so ordered. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am appreciative of the cooperation of our colleagues \nand also of the quality of the debate. I think we have had an \ninteresting debate. I compliment the participants. I will just make a \ncouple of comments.\n  I am reading this amendment and listening to some of the debate \nyesterday, and looking at this amendment, it says:\n\n       Provided, That notwithstanding any other provision of the \n     Act--\n\n  Talking about the Murray amendment that is included in the \nTransportation bill--\n\n     nothing in this Act shall be applied in a manner that the \n     President finds to be in violation of the North American Free \n     Trade Agreement.\n\n  I know I heard people say yesterday the Murray amendment, the \nunderlying legislation that is in the appropriations bill, is compliant \nwith NAFTA, it is compliant with our treaty, a treaty we have already \nsigned.\n  If that is the case, I think the proponents should adopt this \namendment. I wish they would. I would think they would accept it. It \nwould further clarify that we are going to keep our word in the treaty. \nA treaty is making a commitment on behalf of the United States with \nother countries. We should keep that.\n  If we are going to rewrite the treaty on this appropriations bill, we \nhave a problem. I think we have a couple of problems because clearly \nthis is legislation on an appropriations bill and we made rules that we \nwere not going to do that. Now it turns out the rules are only sort of \napplicable. In other words, you can legislate--if you are in the \ncommittee and you legislate in committee, it is OK, but you cannot \nlegislate on the floor.\n  Maybe we need to probably address that, and we probably will at a \nlater date. But now I look at the legislation, and I have heard some \npeople say that the legislation that came out of committee violates \nNAFTA. The proponents say no, it doesn't. Here is language that says \nnothing in this act should be applied in a manner that the President \nfinds to be in violation of the NAFTA. This is further clarification \nthat we are not going to violate NAFTA. That makes sense.\n  If we are going to rewrite treaties on appropriations bills, \nsomething is wrong. What about the Foreign Relations Committee? What \nabout the Commerce Committee and committees that have jurisdiction over \nNAFTA? What about consulting the NAFTA partners? I have heard they are \nupset about the language that is coming out of the committee and that \ncame out of the House.\n  I urge the proponents of the Murray amendment to adopt this language. \nI think it would further clarify. Maybe it would make a lot of this \nproblem go away. This might make this bill entirely acceptable on all \nparts. This could be the solution.\n  I have heard people say nothing in the underlying bill violates \nNAFTA. Then let's accept this amendment. I believe we could have final \npassage on this bill today, and we could move on towards other \nlegislative agenda items that all of us would like to do, including \nsome nominations.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Is that an offer?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would love to see that happen. I do not know if the \nother proponents will consult other people; maybe we can make that an \noffer. I would love to see that happen.\n  I think adoption of this language further clarifying that we are not \ndoing anything to violate NAFTA would help make this bill much more \npresentable and much more acceptable--both to the administration and \nour trading partners in Mexico and in Canada.\n  I urge my colleagues not to support a tabling motion. Let's pass this \namendment and this bill. Let's go to conference.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. In response to the question from the distinguished \nDemocrat floor leader, I believe the adoption of this amendment would \nmake this debate an honest debate. We would all then agree that it does \nnot affect NAFTA. I think that would be a major step in working out \nthis whole thing. With the adoption of this amendment, I think in a \nfairly short period of time we could probably work this out in a way \nthat, A, the Department of Transportation can implement, and, B, the \nPresident of Mexico and the President of the United States are not \nembarrassed by us abrogating NAFTA. I think this would be the linchpin \nfor working something out, if we adopt it.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Today.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I think if we decided to, we could solve this problem \nwithin 2 hours. Working with the Department of Transportation, we could \ncome up with an agreement that the Department of Transportation could \nmake work. That is the first requirement. And, second, that does not \nviolate our obligations under NAFTA.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I very much appreciate Senator Gramm's \ncomments, and also Senator Reid's suggestion. I think this may help us \nbreak this bottleneck. I think too many people are too dug in to kind \nof look and say how we can fix this problem which we got into by \nlegislating on an appropriations bill and possibly rewriting treaties. \nThat is wrong, at least in this Senator's opinion. This language \nclarifies that we are not going to violate the treaty.\n  Let's pass this amendment and this bill, and let's go to other \nlegislative agenda items.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIllinois is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first I would like to ask the Senator from \nWashington, the chairman of the subcommittee, if she would yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would she comment on the pending Gramm amendment and the \nimpact she believes it will have on establishing standards for safety \nfor Mexican trucks and Mexican truckdrivers?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator for the question. I would be happy \nto enter into negotiations to talk about accepting this amendment if it \ndidn't actually gut the provisions we have before us. This \nadministration basically says to the President--actually the White \nHouse attorney would designate it--the provision of the underlying bill \nviolates NAFTA. That is their position, not ours. It is their decision. \nThey could revoke the Mexican driver's license provision we have, or \nthe inspection of the trucks across the border and the insurance issue \non Mexican trucks. At their whim, they could say we think that violates \nNAFTA.\n  I think the Members of the Senate have spoken quite loudly, 70-30, \nthat we believe the provisions in this Senate bill are ones that we \nbelieve will protect drivers in the country. We have already seen what \nthe DOT protections were. I believe the underlying amendment certainly \nas written is not safe for American drivers.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I agree with the Senator from Washington. If we adopt the \namendment of Senator Gramm of Texas, we are basically saying there are \nno standards when it comes to Mexican trucks and when it comes to \nMexican truckdrivers. It is whatever the White House attorneys decide. \nThat, frankly, is an abdication of the responsibility of the Senate.\n  I hope all Members will join in voting for this Gramm amendment. I \nvoted for NAFTA. When I voted for NAFTA, I was told that the United \nStates would never have to compromise health and safety standards, and, \nthat if we impose standards of safety on American trucks and \ntruckdrivers, the same standards will apply to Canadian and Mexican \ntruckdrivers. If we impose standards of the safety on our trucks, the \nsame standards will be imposed on Mexico and Canada.\n  That is what is known as fair trade and fair standards evenly \napplied. Senator Gramm and those on the other side of the aisle don't \nwant fair trade. They want to have it so the Mexicans and Canadians and \nothers who trade with the United States can establish in the name of \nfree trade their own standards.\n  This weekend when you are on the highways across America and you look \nin the rearview mirror, if the truck coming up behind you is an \nAmerican truck, you can be sure of one thing: It is subject to hours of \nservice requirements so that the truckdriver doesn't stay in that seat \nso long that he is half\n\n[[Page S8311]]\n\nasleep and driving off the road. You know the American truckdriver has \nto keep a logbook so we know where he has been and how long he has been \ndriving. He is subject to inspection. He has been subject to alcohol \nand drug testing. He has had a physical. You know the minimum weight \nlimit for the truck is 80,000 pounds, and so forth. But under the \nstandards imposed by the Mexican Government, none of these apply. There \nare no hours of service requirements. If the truck coming up behind you \non the highway is driven by a Mexican truckdriver, there is no \nprohibition or limitation on the hours he can drive the truck. Under \ntheir law, he has to keep a logbook. He ignores it, as most Mexican \ntruckdrivers do. There is no basic alcohol and drug test, and there is \nno requirement for physicals as in the United States.\n\n  Let me tell you about an accident. If you get involved in an accident \nwith a truck driven by an American driver for an American truck \ncompany, they have to have liability insurance between $750,000 and $4 \nmillion for that accident. The Mexican truckdriver, about $70,000 worth \nof insurance to cover bodily injury as well as physical damage.\n  When we say the Mexicans are going to have an opportunity to trade in \nthe United States and we want to strike down trade barriers, we are not \ntrying to strike down common sense. Common sense says that whether your \nfamily is on the road going to a Virginia vacation, or for business, \nwhen you look in the rearview mirror, or pass a truck, you ought to \nknow that there is a safety standard applied to everybody who wants to \nuse American highways.\n  Senator Murray has put in a reasonable amendment. She established the \nsame standards for Mexican trucking companies and truckdrivers as the \nUnited States. Those who oppose this amendment don't want that to \nhappen. The Gramm amendment gives the widest loophole in the world. \nSome attorney in the White House can declare that the standards for \ninsurance, for example, for Mexico are just fine at $70,000. That is \nwrong. It is wrong for the American families who expect this Senate to \nstand up and protect them when it comes to the use of American \nhighways.\n  I favor free trade. I voted for free trade. But I didn't do it with a \nblindfold. I did it with the knowledge that we ought to have standards \nto protect American companies, American individuals, and American \nconsumers, and that the same standards should apply to those exporting \nto the United States and those producing in the United States. This is \nnot protectionism. This is commonsense. Vote against the Gramm \namendment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican assistant leader.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, just for the information of our \ncolleagues, we will be voting probably within 5 minutes. I believe \nthere will be a motion to table the Gramm amendment. So just for the \nCloakrooms to alert all colleagues, there will be a rollcall vote in 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nAlabama is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, over the course of the past several days, \nwe have heard several Senators explain what they believe the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement does and does not do. I believe this \ndebate would be better served by reviewing the agreement itself.\n  Part Seven, Chapter Twenty, of NAFTA establishes the Free Trade \nCommission which shall resolve disputes that may arise regarding its \ninterpretation or application. NAFTA also establishes a dispute \nsettlement process in the event that the Free Trade Commission is \nunable to resolve a matter or if a third party brings forth a cause of \naction. Under NAFTA in these cases, the Commission ``shall establish an \narbitral panel.'' Again, I am quoting from the agreement.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the North American Free \nTrade Agreement Part Seven: Administrative And Institutional Provision \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  North American Free Trade Agreement\n\n        Part Seven: Administrative and Institutional Provisions\n\n   Chapter Twenty: Institutional Arrangements and Dispute Settlement \n                               Procedures\n\n\n                        Section A--Institutions\n\n                Article 2001: The Free Trade Commission\n\n       1. The Parties hereby establish the Free Trade Commission, \n     comprising cabinet-level representatives of the Parties or \n     their designees.\n       2. The Commission shall:\n       (a) supervise the implementation of this Agreement;\n       (b) oversee its further elaboration;\n       (c) resolve disputes that may arise regarding its \n     interpretation or application;\n       (d) supervise the work of all committees and working groups \n     established under this Agreement, referred to in Annex \n     2001.2; and\n       (e) consider any other matter that may affect the operation \n     of this Agreement.\n       3. The Commission may:\n       (a) establish, and delegate responsibilities to, ad hoc or \n     standing committees, working groups or expert groups;\n       (b) seek the advice of non-governmental persons or groups; \n     and\n       (c) take such other action in the exercise of its functions \n     as the Parties may agree.\n       4. The Commission shall establish its rules and procedures. \n     All decisions of the Commission shall be taken by consensus, \n     except as the Commission may otherwise agree.\n       5. The Commission shall convene at least once a year in \n     regular session. Regular sessions of the Commission shall be \n     chaired successively by each Party.\n\n                     Article 2002: The Secretariat\n\n       1. The Commission shall establish and oversee a Secretariat \n     comprising national Sections.\n       2. Each Party shall:\n       (a) establish a permanent office of its Section;\n       (b) be responsible for\n       (i) the operation and costs of its Section, and\n       (ii) the remuneration and payment of expenses of panelists \n     and members of committees and scientific review boards \n     established under this Agreement, as set out in Annex 2002.2;\n       (c) designate an individual to serve as Secretary for its \n     Section, who shall be responsible for its administration and \n     management; and\n       (d) notify the Commission of the location of its Section's \n     office.\n       3. The Secretariat shall:\n       (a) provide assistance to the Commission;\n       (b) provide administrative assistance to\n       (i) panels and committees established under Chapter \n     Nineteen (Review and Dispute Settlement in Antidumping and \n     Countervailing Duty Matters), in accordance with the \n     procedures established pursuant to Article 1908, and\n       (ii) panels established under this Chapter, in accordance \n     with procedures established pursuant to Article 2012; and\n       (c) as the Commission may direct\n       (i) support the work of other committees and groups \n     established under this Agreement, and\n       (ii) otherwise facilitate the operation of this Agreement.\n\n\n                     section b--dispute settlement\n\n                       Article 2003: Cooperation\n\n       The Parties shall at all times endeavor to agree on the \n     interpretation and application of this Agreement, and shall \n     make every attempt through cooperation and consultations to \n     arrive at a mutually satisfactory resolution of any matter \n     that might affect its operation.\n\n        Article 2004: Recourse to Dispute Settlement Procedures\n\n       Except for the matters covered in Chapter Nineteen (Review \n     and Dispute Settlement in Antidumping and Countervailing Duty \n     Matters) and as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the \n     dispute settlement provisions of this Chapter shall apply \n     with respect to the avoidance or settlement of all disputes \n     between the Parties regarding the interpretation or \n     application of this Agreement or wherever a Party considers \n     that an actual or proposed measure of another Party is or \n     would be inconsistent with the obligations of this Agreement \n     or cause nullification or impairment in the sense of Annex \n     2004.\n\n                 Article 2005: GATT Dispute Settlement\n\n       1. Subject to paragraphs 2, 3 and 4, disputes regarding any \n     matter arising under both this Agreement and the General \n     Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, any agreement negotiated \n     thereunder, or any successor agreement (GATT), may be settled \n     in either forum at the discretion of the complaining Party.\n       2. Before a Party initiates a dispute settlement proceeding \n     in the GATT against another Party on grounds that are \n     substantially equivalent to those available to that Party \n     under this Agreement, that Party shall notify any third Party \n     of its intention. If a third Party wishes to have recourse to \n     dispute settlement procedures under this Agreement regarding \n     the matter, it shall inform promptly the notifying Party and \n     those Parties shall consult with a view to agreement on a \n     single forum. If those Parties cannot agree, the dispute \n     normally shall be settled under this Agreement.\n       3. In any dispute referred to in paragraph 1 where the \n     responding Party claims that its action is subject to Article \n     104 (Relation to Environmental and Conservation Agreements) \n     and requests in writing that the matter be considered under \n     this Agreement, the complaining Party may, in respect of that\n\n[[Page S8312]]\n\n     matter, thereafter have recourse to dispute settlement \n     procedures solely under this Agreement.\n       4. In any dispute referred to in paragraph 1 that arises \n     under Section B of Chapter Seven (Sanitary and Phytosanitary \n     Measures) or Chapter Nine (Standards-Related Measures):\n       (a) concerning a measure adopted or maintained by a Party \n     to protect its human, animal or plant life or health, or to \n     protect its environment, and\n       (b) that raises factual issues concerning the environment, \n     health, safety or conservation, including directly related \n     scientific matters,\n\n     where the responding Party requests in writing that the \n     matter be considered under this Agreement, the complaining \n     Party may, in respect of that matter, thereafter have \n     recourse to dispute settlement procedures solely under this \n     Agreement.\n       5. The responding Party shall deliver a copy of a request \n     made to paragraph 3 or 4 to the other Parties and to its \n     Section of the Secretariat. Where the complaining Party has \n     initiated dispute settlement proceedings regarding any matter \n     subject to paragraph 3 or 4, the responding Party shall \n     deliver its request no later than 15 days thereafter. On \n     receipt of such request, the complaining Party shall promptly \n     withdraw from participation in those proceedings and may \n     initiate settlement procedures under Article 2007.\n       6. Once dispute settlement procedures have been initiated \n     under Article 2007 or dispute settlement proceedings have \n     been initiated under the GATT, the forum selected shall be \n     used to the exclusion of the other, unless a Party makes a \n     request pursuant to paragraph 3 or 4.\n       7. For purposes of this Article, dispute settlement \n     proceedings under the GATT are deemed to be initiated by a \n     Party's request for a panel, such as under Article XXIII:2 of \n     the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1947, or for a \n     committee investigation, such as under Article 20.1 of the \n     Customs Valuation Code.\n     Consultations\n\n                      Article 2006: Consultations\n\n       1. Any Party may request in writing consultations with any \n     other Party regarding any actual or proposed measure or any \n     other matter that it considers might affect the operation of \n     this Agreement.\n       2. The requesting Party shall deliver the request to the \n     other Parties and to its Section of the Secretariat.\n       3. Unless the Commission otherwise provides in its rules \n     and procedures established under Article 2001(4), a third \n     Party that considers it has a substantial interest in the \n     matter shall be entitled to participate in the consultation \n     on delivery of written notice to the other Parties and to its \n     Section of the Secretariat.\n       4. Consultations on matters regarding perishable \n     agricultural goods shall commence within 15 days of the date \n     of delivery of the request.\n       5. The consulting Parties shall make every attempt to \n     arrive at a mutually satisfactory resolution of any matter \n     through consultations under this Article or other \n     consultative provisions of this Agreement. To this end, the \n     consulting Parties shall:\n       (a) provide sufficient information to enable a full \n     examination of how the actual or proposed measure or other \n     matter might affect the operation of this Agreement;\n       (b) treat any confidential or proprietary information \n     exchanged in the course of consultations on the same basis as \n     the Party providing the information; and\n       (c) seek to avoid any resolution that adversely affects the \n     interests under this Agreement of any other Party.\n     Initation of Procedures\n\n   Article 2007: Commission--Good Offices, Conciliation and Mediation\n\n       1. If the consulting Parties fail to resolve a matter \n     pursuant to Article 2006 within:\n       (a) 30 days of delivery of a request for consultations,\n       (b) 45 days of delivery of such request if any other Party \n     has subsequently requested or has participated in \n     consultations regarding the same matter,\n       (c) 15 days of delivery of a request for consultations in \n     matters regarding perishable agricultural goods, or\n       (d) such other period as they may agree,\n\n     any such Party may request in writing a meeting of the \n     Commission.\n       2. A Party may also request in writing a meeting of the \n     Commission where:\n       (a) it has initiated dispute settlement proceedings under \n     the GATT regarding any matter subject to Article 2005(3) or \n     (4), and has received a request pursuant to Article 2005(5) \n     for recourse to dispute settlement procedures under this \n     Chapter; or\n       (b) consultations have been held pursuant to Article 513 \n     (Working Group on Rules of Origin), Article 723 (Sanitary and \n     Phytosanitary Measures Technical Consultations) and Article \n     914 (Standards-Related Measures Technical Consultations).\n       3. The requesting Party shall state in the request the \n     measure or other matter complained of and indicate the \n     provisions of this Agreement that it considers relevant, and \n     shall deliver the request to the other Parties and to its \n     Section of the Secretariat.\n       4. Unless it decides otherwise, the Commission shall \n     convene within 10 days of delivery of the request and shall \n     endeavor to resolve the dispute promptly.\n       5. The Commission may:\n       (a) call on such technical advisers or create such working \n     groups or expert groups as it deems necessary,\n       (b) have recourse to good offices, conciliation, mediation \n     or such other dispute resolution procedures, or\n       (c) make recommendations, as may assist the consulting \n     Parties to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution of the \n     dispute.\n       6. Unless it decides otherwise, the Commission shall \n     consolidate two or more proceedings before it pursuant to \n     this Article regarding the same measure. The Commission may \n     consolidate two or more proceedings regarding other matters \n     before it pursuant to this Article that it determines are \n     appropriate to be considered jointly.\n     Panel Proceedings\n\n              Article 2008: Request for an Arbitral panel\n\n       1. If the Commission has convened pursuant to Article \n     2007(4), and the matter has not been resolved within:\n       (a) 30 days thereafter,\n       (b) 30 days after the Commission has convened in respect of \n     the matter most recently referred to it, where proceedings \n     have been consolidated pursuant to Article 2007(6), or\n       (c) such other period as the consulting Parties may agree,\n\n     any consulting Party may request in writing the establishment \n     of an arbitral panel. The requesting Party shall deliver the \n     request to the other Parties and to its Section of the \n     Secretariat.\n       2. On delivery of the request, the Commission shall \n     establish an arbitral panel.\n       3. A third Party that considers it has a substantial \n     interest in the matter shall be entitled to join as a \n     complaining Party on delivery of written notice of its \n     intention to participate to the disputing Parties and its \n     Section of the Secretariat. The notice shall be delivered at \n     the earliest possible time, and in any event no later than \n     seven days after the date of delivery of a request by a Party \n     for the establishment of a panel.\n       4. If a third Party does not join as a complaining Party in \n     accordance with paragraph 3, it normally shall refrain \n     therefore from initiating or continuing.\n       (a) a dispute settlement procedure under this Agreement, or\n       (b) a dispute settlement proceeding in the GATT on grounds \n     that are substantially equivalent to those available to that \n     Party under this Agreement.\n\n     regarding the same matter in the absence of a significant \n     change in economic or commercial circumstances.\n       5. Unless otherwise agreed by the disputing Parties, the \n     panel shall be established and perform its functions in a \n     manner consistent with the provisions of this Chapter.\n\n                          Article 2009: Roster\n\n       1. The Parties shall establish by January 1, 1994 and \n     maintain a roster of up to 30 individuals who are willing and \n     able to serve as panelists.

Panelists shall normally be selected from the roster. \n     Any disputing Party may exercise a peremptory challenge \n     against any individual not on the roster who is proposed as a \n     panelist by a disputing Party within 15 days after the \n     individual has been proposed.\n       4. If a disputing Party believes that a panelist is in \n     violation of the code of conduct, the disputing Parties shall \n     consult and if they agree, the panelist shall be removed and \n     a new panelist shall be selected in accordance with this \n     Article.\n\n                    Article 2012: Rules of Procedure\n\n       1.

If a complaining Party wishes to argue that a matter has \n     nullified or impaired benefits, the terms of reference shall \n     so indicate.\n       5. If a disputing Party wishes the panel to make findings \n     as to the degree of adverse trade effects on any Party of any \n     measure found not to conform with the obligations of the \n     Agreement or to have caused nullification or impairment in \n     the sense of Annex 2004, the terms of reference shall so \n     indicate.\n\n                Article 2013: Third Party Participation\n\n       A Party that is not a disputing Party, on delivery of a \n     written notice to the disputing Parties and to its Section of \n     the Secretariat, shall be entitled to attend all hearings, to \n     make written and oral submissions to the panel and to receive \n     written submissions of the disputing Parties.\n\n                     Article 2014: Role of Experts\n\n       On request of a disputing Party, or on its own initiative, \n     the panel may seek information and technical advice from any \n     person or body that it deems appropriate, provided that the \n     disputing Parties so agree and subject to such terms and \n     conditions as such Parties may agree.\n\n                 Article 2015: Scientific Review Boards\n\n       1.

The board shall be selected by the panel from among \n     highly qualified, independent experts in the scientific \n     matters, after consultations with the disputing Parties and \n     the scientific bodies set out in the Model Rules of Procedure \n     established pursuant to Article 2012(1).\n       3. The participating Parties shall be provided:\n       (a) advance notice of, and an opportunity to provide \n     comments to the panel on, the proposed factual issues to be \n     referred to the board; and\n       (b) a copy of the board's report and an opportunity to \n     provide comments on the report to the panel.\n       4.

Unless the disputing Parties otherwise agree, the panel \n     shall, within 90 days after the last panelist is selected or \n     such other period as the Model Rules of Procedure established \n     pursuant to Article 2012(1) may provide, present to the \n     disputing Parties an initial report containing:\n       (a) findings of fact, including any findings pursuant to a \n     request under Article 2012(5);\n       (b) its determination as to whether the measure at issue is \n     or would be inconsistent with the obligations of this \n     Agreement or cause nullification or impairment in the sense \n     of Annex 2004, or any other determination requested in the \n     terms of reference; and\n       (c) its recommendations, if any, for resolution of the \n     dispute.\n       3. Panelists may furnish separate opinions on matters not \n     unanimously agreed.\n       4. A disputing Party may submit written comments to the \n     panel on its initial report within 14 days of presentation of \n     the report.\n       5. In such an event, and after considering such written \n     comments, the panel, on its own initiative or on the request \n     of any disputing Party, may:\n       (a) request the views of any participating Party;\n       (b) reconsider its report; and\n       (c) make any further examination that it considers \n     appropriate.\n\n                       Article 2017: Final Report\n\n       1.

No panel may, either in its initial report or its final \n     report, disclose which panelists are associated with majority \n     or minority opinions.\n       3. The disputing Parties shall transmit to the Commission \n     the final report of the panel, including any report of a \n     scientific review board established under Article 2015, as \n     well as any written views that a disputing Party desires to \n     be appended, on a confidential basis within a reasonable \n     period of time after it is presented to them.\n       4. Unless the Commission decides otherwise, the final \n     report of the panel shall be published 15 days after it is \n     transmitted to the Commission.\n     Implementation of Panel Reports\n\n              Article 2018: Implementation of Final Report\n\n       1. On receipt of the final report of a panel, the disputing \n     Parties shall agree on the resolution of the dispute, which \n     normally shall conform with the determinations and \n     recommendations of the panel, and shall notify their Sections \n     of the Secretariat of any agreed resolution of any dispute.\n       2. Wherever possible, the resolution shall be non-\n     implementation or removal of a measure not conforming with \n     this Agreement or causing nullification or impairment in the \n     sense of Annex 2004 or, failing such a resolution, \n     compensation.\n\n        Article 2019: Non-Implementation--Suspension of Benefits\n\n       1. If in its final report a panel has determined that a \n     measure is inconsistent with the obligations of this \n     Agreement or causes nullification or impairment in the sense \n     of Annex 2004 and the Party complained against has not \n     reached agreement with any complaining Party on a mutually \n     satisfactory resolution pursuant to Article 2018(1) within 30 \n     days of receiving the final report, such complaining Party \n     may suspend the application to the Party complained against \n     of benefits of equivalent effect until such time as they have \n     reached agreement on a resolution of the dispute.\n       2. In considering what benefits to suspend pursuant to \n     paragraph 1:\n       (a) a complaining Party should first seek to suspend \n     benefits in the same sector or sectors as that affected by \n     the measure or other matter that the panel has found to be \n     inconsistent with the obligations of this Agreement or to \n     have caused nullification or impairment in the sense of Annex \n     2004; and\n       (b) a complaining Party that considers it is not \n     practicable or effective to suspend benefits in the same \n     sector or sectors may suspend benefits in other sectors.\n       3. On the written request of any disputing Party delivered \n     to the other Parties and its Section of the Secretariat, the \n     Commission shall establish a panel to determine whether the \n     level of benefits suspended by a Party pursuant to paragraph \n     1 is manifestly excessive.\n       4. The panel proceedings shall be conducted in accordance \n     with the Model Rules of Procedure. The panel shall present \n     its determination within 60 days after the last panelist is \n     selected or such other period as the disputing Parties may \n     agree.\n\n\n    section C--domestic proceedings and private commercial dispute \n                               settlement\n\n  Article 2020: Referrals of Matters from Judicial or Administrative \n                              Proceedings\n\n       1. If an issue of interpretation or application of this \n     Agreement arises in any domestic judicial or administrative \n     proceeding of a Party that any Party considers would merit \n     its intervention, or if a court or administrative body \n     solicits the views of a Party, that Party shall notify the \n     other Parties and its Section of the Secretariat. The \n     Commission shall endeavor to agree on an appropriate response \n     as expeditiously as possible.\n       2.

The Subcommittee may address other related standards-\n     related measures as it considers appropriate.\n\n\n                            Annex 913.5.a-2\n\n               Telecommunications Standards Subcommittee\n\n       1.

The Automotive Standards Council, established under \n     Article 913.5(a)(iii), shall comprise representatives of each \n     Party.\n       2. The purpose of the Council shall be, to the extent \n     practicable, to facilitate the attainment of compatibility \n     among, and review the implementation of, national standards-\n     related measures of the Parties that apply to automotive \n     goods, and to address other related matters.\n       3. To facilitate its objectives, the Council may establish \n     subgroups, consultation procedures and other appropriate \n     operational mechanisms. On the agreement of the Parties, the \n     Council may include state and provincial government or \n     private sector representatives in its subgroups.\n       4. Any recommendation of the Council shall require \n     agreement of the Parties. Where the adoption of a law is not \n     required for a Party, the Council's recommendations shall be \n     implemented by the Party within a reasonable time in \n     accordance with the legal and procedural requirements and \n     international obligations of the Party. Where the adoption of \n     a law is required for a Party, the Party shall use its best \n     efforts to secure the adoption of the law and shall implement \n     any such law within a reasonable time.\n       5. Recognizing the existing disparity in standards-related \n     measures of the Parties, the Council shall develop a work \n     program for making compatible the national standards-related \n     measures that apply to automotive goods and other related \n     matters based on the following criteria:\n       (a) the impact on industry integration;\n       (b) the extent of the barriers to trade;\n       (c) the level of trade affected; and\n       (d) the extent of the disparity.\n\n     In developing its work program, the Council may address other \n     related matters, including emissions from on-road and non-\n     road mobile sources.\n       6. Each Party shall take such reasonable measures as may be \n     available to it to promote the objectives of this Annex with \n     respect to standards-related measures that are maintained by \n     state and provincial government authorities and private \n     sector organizations. The Council shall make every effort to \n     assist these entities with such activities, especially the \n     identification of priorities and the establishment of work \n     schedules.\n\n\n                            annex 913.5.a-4\n\n         Subcommittee on Labelling of Textile and Apparel Goods\n\n       1. The Subcommittee on Labelling of Textile and Apparel \n     Goods, established under Article 913(5)(a)(iv), shall \n     comprise representatives of each Party.\n       2. The Subcommittee shall include, and consult with, \n     technical experts as well as a broadly representative group \n     from the manufacturing and retailing sectors in the territory \n     of each Party.\n       3. The Subcommittee shall develop and pursue a work program \n     on the harmonization of labeling requirements to facilitate \n     trade in textile and apparel goods between the Parties \n     through the adoption of uniform labelling provisions. The \n     work program should include the following matters:\n       (a) pictograms and symbols to replace, where possible, \n     required written information, as well as other methods to \n     reduce the need for labels on textile and apparel goods in \n     multiple languages;\n       (b) care instructions for textile and apparel goods;\n       (c) fiber content information for textile and apparel \n     goods;\n       (d) uniform methods acceptable for the attachment of \n     required information to textile and apparel goods; and\n       (e) use in the territory of the other Parties of each \n     Party's national registration numbers for manufacturers of \n     importers of textile and apparel goods.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. The amendment offered by the Senator from Texas that we \nhave been talking about proposes instead to grant to the President of \nthe United States the sole and final authority to determine what \nviolates NAFTA in regard to highway safety. As much as I respect the \noffice of the President of the United States and particularly this \nPresident, the office of the President is not--and should not be--put \nin this position. In addition, it is unnecessary because the \nConstitution, as we all know, already gives the President the power to \nveto legislation.\n  I believe it is a slippery slope to pursue the concept that the \nPresident of the United States, or any other administration official, \nshould determine whether acts of Congress are consistent with treaty \nobligations or other laws.\n  I put my faith in the Founding Fathers and their wisdom to separate \njudicial and executive functions. The Senator from Texas, my good \nfriend, makes some interesting and novel arguments. I would hope that \nhis enthusiasm for his interpretation of NAFTA would not overwhelm our \ncollective support for the constitutional separation of the executive \nand judicial branches of Government.\n  The Senator from Texas has argued on several occasions that the \nMurray-Shelby provision contains what he alleges are four violations of \nNAFTA. While I believe that we should allow the processes set forth in \nthe NAFTA agreement that I quoted from to determine that, let me assure \nthe Senator from Texas that if his amendment is adopted there is \nwithout question one violation of NAFTA--because his amendment clearly \ncreates a new dispute resolution process within the office of the \nPresident that appears to be inconsistent--totally inconsistent--with \nNAFTA itself.\n  Mr. President, we have talked about this issue. I think we know what \nis going on. At this point, I move to table the Gramm amendment and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1180 to Amendment No. 1030\n\n  (Purpose: To require that Mexican nationals be treated the same as \n            Canadian nationals under provisions of the Act)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to \namendment No. 1030 to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1180 to amendment No. 1030:\n       At the end of the amendment add the following:\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, no \n     provision of this Act shall be implemented in a manner that \n     treats Mexican nationals differently from Canadian nationals.\n\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, who has the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be glad to yield to the Senator from Nevada for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. REID. I do not think the Senator wants to. I am going to move to \ntable.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Minnesota. I thank him very much \nfor recognizing me.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. It simply says the \nMexican nationals will be treated exactly the same as Canadian \nnationals. It has nothing to do with requirements on trucks. It has \nnothing to do with requirements. It has nothing to do with how these \nindividuals residing one to our north and one to our south would be \ntreated exactly the same way as citizens of their country and trading \npartners.\n  I hope there will be no question that our neighbors to the north and \nthe south will be treated on an equal and equitable basis.\n  I want to quote from the report again from the NAFTA dispute \nresolution panel.\n  I remind my colleagues, I believe we have 51 second-degree amendments \non file. After this one is dispensed with, we will have 50 amendments \nremaining. They are all important additions. Hopefully, these \nmodifications can be made to this legislation.\n  I point out, as we continue to debate this issue again I quote, since \na number of my colleagues are in the Chamber, an editorial in the \nChicago Tribune. I see my colleague from Illinois. The headline is: \n``Honk if you smell cheap politics.'' That is the headline. I emphasize \nfor my colleagues, I am quoting from an editorial. This is not a \nreflection of my personal views:\n\n       As political debates go, the one in the Senate against \n     allowing Mexican trucks access to the U.S. is about as \n     dishonest as it gets. The talk is all about safety and \n     concern about how rattletrap Mexican semis, driven by inept \n     Mexicans, would plow into Aunt Bea putt-putting to the \n     grocery store in her Honda Civic, somewhere in Pleasantville, \n     U.S.A.\n       Truth is that Teamster truckers don't want competition from \n     their Mexican counterparts, who now have to transfer their \n     loads near the border to American-driven trucks, instead of \n     driving straight through to the final destination. But to \n     admit that would sound too crass and self-serving, so Sen. \n     Patty Murray (D-Wash.), and others pushing the Teamster line, \n     instead are prattling on about road safety. . . .\n       Under NAFTA, which went into effect in 1994, there was \n     supposed to be free access to all trucks within Canada, the \n     U.S. and Mexico by January of last year. That only makes \n     sense: There is no point in freeing up trade but restricting \n     the means to move the goods.\n       But with the 2000 elections looming, President Bill Clinton \n     caved in to pressure from the Teamsters and delayed \n     implementation of the free-trucking part of the agreement. \n     Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore got the Teamsters' \n     endorsement and the Mexican government filed a complaint \n     against the U.S. for violation of NAFTA rules. Mexico won.\n       A spokesman for the U.S.-Mexico Chamber of Commerce and \n     others in Washington have whispered there may be bits of \n     racism and discrimination floating around in this soup, \n     because Canadian trucks and drivers are not subjected to \n     similar scrutiny and can move about freely anywhere in the \n     U.S.\n       It's worthwhile to note, too, that while the U.S. is \n     banning Mexican trucks, Mexico is returning the favor, so \n     neither country's trucks are going anywhere. As it stands, \n     Mexican trucks can come in only 20 miles into the U.S. before \n     they have to transfer their load.\n       Safety need not be an issue. An amendment proposed by \n     McCain and Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) incorporates safety \n     inspection safeguards to be sure drivers and trucks are fit \n     to travel U.S. roads. It's roughly modeled after California's \n     safety inspection system along it own border with Mexico. \n     Presumably, Mexico would inspect the trucks going the other \n     way.\n       Those are reasonable measures to protect motorists on both \n     sides of the border.\n       But Sen. Murray's amendment sets up a series of \n     requirements and hurdles so difficult to implement that they \n     would, in effect, keep the border closed to Mexican trucks \n     indefinitely.\n       President Bush vows to veto this version of the bill, and \n     quite rightly so. In 1993, the U.S. signed and ratified \n     NAFTA. The agreement went into effect in 1994. There is no \n     justification now, more than seven years later, for the U.S. \n     to try to weasel out of some its provisions.\n\n  The amendment, which I guess is going to be shortly tabled--I ask \nthat the amendment be read one more time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Objection. I did not hear the request.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I asked that the amendment be read.\n  Mr. REID. That is fine.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will read it myself. I am more eloquent than the staff \nanyway.\n  Mr. REID. I would love to hear the amendment read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1180\n\n       At the end of the amendment add the following:\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, no \n     provision of this Act shall be implemented in a manner that \n     treats Mexican nationals differently from Canadian nationals.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, do I still have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator lost the floor when he had the \nclerk read.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Very good.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. \nFeinstein) and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nCalifornia (Mrs. Feinstein) would vote ``aye.''\n  Mr. NICKLES.

The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, it seems to me one of the very few \nthings that has been agreed upon in the civilized world over the last \nfew years is the benefits of free trade. It is the source of much of \nthe prosperity we have enjoyed in this country because our advances in \ntechnology have led to increases in productivity. It has put us in a \nvery competitive position with regard to the world. Trade has been an \nintegral part of that. It has lifted millions and millions of people \nout of poverty.\n  As we see around the world, the expansion of free market philosophy \nsometimes leads to more democratic institutions. Very much of it is \nbased on these economies opening up. Very much of that has to do with \nthe benefits of free trade where people make the things that they make \nbest and do the things they do best, open up their borders, turn their \nbacks on protectionism, and engage in free trade with other countries.\n  The most remarkable example of that recently, it seems to me, would \nbe the country of China. We have seen that country under Deng, starting \nback some years ago, opening up that country's economy somewhat, as \nmany problems we have with them. I will not go into that today. That is \na different subject for another day. But we have some very serious \ndifficulties with them in terms of nuclear proliferation, for example. \nThere is a story just today about that in the press that is very \ndisturbing. We will deal with that at the appropriate time.\n  But we have to acknowledge that they have lifted millions and \nmillions of their people out of poverty. They have bought into the \nnotion that in order for them to prosper economically, in order for \nthem to feed the 1.3 billion people they have, they are going to have \nto open up somewhat economically and they are going to have to engage \nin free trade.\n  We believe in the engagement of free trade with them, even to the \nextent of the substantial trade deficit. I think it is about $84 \nbillion in deficit we are now running with them. But it attests to our \ncommitment that we have for the general proposition of the benefits of \nfree trade.\n  A third of the U.S. economic growth during the 1990s came from \nexports. Since the cold war, the United States has championed the \nvalues of democracy and free trade. Global free trade advances the \ndemocratic values of consumer choice, workers' rights, transparency, \nand the rule of law.\n  Therefore, it pains me to see us begin to move away from the \nprinciples of free trade and to hold ourselves open for the criticism \nthat we are violating the agreement into which we entered. The argument \ncan be made that while the world is moving in one direction, we in some \nrespects are moving in another. There are more than, I believe, 133 \ntrade agreements around the world. The United States is a party to two \nof them. One of the ones that has been beneficial to all parties \nconcerned has been NAFTA. It has been beneficial to my State of \nTennessee. I think it has been beneficial to the United States in \ngeneral.\n  It pains me to see us move away from our solemn commitment. I think \nthat is what the Murray provision does. I think that is the primary \nreason for the concern expressed by the Senator from Arizona and the \nSenator from Texas because their opinion--and apparently the opinion of \nthe President of the United States--is that provision violates our \ncommitment under NAFTA; it violates our commitment to free trade. We \nare moving in the wrong direction. We are moving in one direction when \nthe rest of the world seems to finally have been convinced of what we \nare supposed to believe in; that is, benefits of free trade.\n  Trade benefits small businesses. Ninety-seven percent of all \nexporters are small businesses that employ fewer than 500 people. Free \ntrade is an invaluable tool to economic development, oftentimes far \nmore successful than direct aid. Trade encourages investment, creates \njobs, and promotes a more sustainable form of development. Jobs created \nthrough trade often require higher levels of skills and create a higher \nstandard of living for workers.\n  It is to everyone's benefit--and certainly to this country's \nbenefit--to engage in activities that raise the standard of living \nwhich, in turn, often leads, as I say, to demands for individual rights \nin countries where those are so sorely lacking.\n  The combined effects of the Uruguay Round trade agreements and NAFTA \nhave increased U.S. national income by $40 to $60 billion a year. Over \n85 percent of NAFTA trade is manufactured goods, which grew by over 66 \npercent between 1993 and 1998.\n  On the agricultural front, which is important to my State, one of \nevery three acres of U.S. farmland is planted for export.\n  So that is what is going on in the world. That is of what we are a \npart. That is in what we should be taking a leadership role. So when we \nare dealing with the primary trade agreement that we have, and dealing \nwith our own hemisphere, and our own backyard, and our neighbors to the \nnorth and our neighbors to the south, and we, because of domestic, \npolitical, and economic pressure, willy-nilly do things that might be \npleasing to certain, limited constituency groups but not only violate \nthe agreement but violate the principles for which we are supposed to \nstand, when we do that, we are moving in a wrong and dangerous \ndirection.\n  The United States is better off today because of that commitment we \nmade. I think the United States is better off today because of that \nagreement we made. The U.S. economy experienced the longest peacetime \nexpansion in history. That was not because we sat still. That was not \nby accident. All 50 States and the United States territories \nparticipate in NAFTA, and almost all have reaped benefits from more \nliberalized trade with both Mexico and Canada.\n  U.S. trade with NAFTA countries grew faster than the rate of global \ntrade expansion. Overall, NAFTA has benefited the entire continent of \nNorth America through its promotion of competitiveness and lower prices \nfor consumers. We all are very much aware of the fact that some folks \nhave been displaced--some in my own State have been displaced--as we \nhave gone through the adjustment our economy is having to go through \nnow.\n  We all know that as we move from an agricultural economy to an \nindustrialized economy to a very high-tech economy that we have now--as \nwe move from one of those areas to another, there are some \ndisplacements, and it is unfortunate. The Government should be helpful \nin legitimate respects to make sure that, as far as workers are \nconcerned, for example, we are mindful of that.\n  We have passed legislation, some of which workers in my own State \nhave benefited from, to help make this adjustment come about, knowing \nthat we have to make this adjustment, that we have to move from certain \nareas of our economy into other areas that are more competitive in the \nworld economy and the world market that we have now.\n  But overall, from the time NAFTA was signed until last year, the \nfollowing things have happened: U.S. gross domestic product grew by \nover $2 trillion, unemployment in the United States fell from 7 percent \nto 4 percent, real income rose by an average of $2,500 for every \nAmerican. Trade between the United States and Mexico has tripled since \n1993 to over $250 billion in 2000. Total merchandise trade among the \nNAFTA countries was $656 billion in 2000. The United States now trades \nmore with Canada than with the EU. Total United States trade with \nCanada has doubled to $400 billion. Trade with NAFTA countries doubled \nfrom 1993 to 2000, while U.S. trade with the rest of the world grew by \nhalf as much.\n\n  So not only is free trade important, but this particular episode in \nour Nation's history with regard to free trade is especially important. \nThe figures bear that out when looking at the American economy.\n  On another related subject, during the 1994-1995 peso devaluation, \nMexico experienced its worst recession since 1932, with a 7-percent \ndecrease in GDP. During the same time, U.S. exports fell\n\n[[Page S8318]]\n\nby 8.9 percent, while European and Asian exports fell by 20 to 30 \npercent.\n  While in crisis, Mexico raised import tariffs on goods from all of \nits trading partners, with the exception of NAFTA members. NAFTA \nprevented the United States from experiencing the level of loss felt by \nboth Asia and Europe.\n  Trade creates jobs. Over 20 million new jobs were generated by the \nU.S. economy during the 1990s. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates \nthat by 1999 NAFTA had created over 685,000 export-related jobs in the \nUnited States. Over 12 million U.S. jobs now rely on trade in this \ncountry.\n  Economists estimate that the $70 billion increase in United States \nexports to Mexico since NAFTA began created about 1.3 million new jobs. \nThe U.S. Department of Commerce estimates that 6 million U.S. jobs are \ndependent on NAFTA-related exports alone. This gives us some indication \nof the significance of what we are dealing with.\n  Again, it pains me to see us move in a direction, not because we \ndon't have a right to protect ourselves from trucks or anything else--\nwe can enter into agreements that do that. When we deal with the \nagreements to start with, we can enter into those things. We can \nimplement those agreements in ways that protect us. All that is allowed \nunder NAFTA. But we cannot have different requirements for our friends \nin Mexico than we have for our friends in Canada. That is just not \nright, and it is not compliant with NAFTA. With all of these benefits, \nI think it is important that we understand what is at stake.\n  As self-centered as we might want to be--and I hope we are not, but \neven if we were, it is to our benefit to have a stable and a growing \nand a prosperous neighbor to the south, as well as to the north, for \nobvious reasons--for reasons having to do with immigration, for reasons \nhaving to do with the economy. That common border is not going to go \naway. Now that we have new leadership in Mexico, we have the \nopportunity to make progress in a lot of areas that we have not been \nable to for some time.\n  Surpassing Japan, Mexico is now the United States' second largest \ntrading partner. Since the agreement's implementation, Mexico's gross \ndomestic product has increased at an average annual rate of 3.7 \npercent. I think we have a right--the Nation that came up with the \nMarshall plan, the Nation that rebuilt much of Europe and Japan after \nWorld War II--to be proud of that.\n  Mexico's credit has improved as a result of NAFTA. Mexico has \nsuccessfully paid back its loans from the 1995 peso crisis ahead of \nschedule. Early this spring, Mexico paid off all of its IMF loans. This \nsuccessful recovery prompted major credit analysts to upgrade Mexican \nsovereign and corporate debt to investment grade.\n  Thanks in part to the democratic influence of free trade, NAFTA \nplayed a significant part in making Mexico a more democratic country. \nNAFTA helped foster the civil society in economic development that \nenabled Mexico to successfully transition to democratic rule after \nseveral years of a one-party system.\n  Those are some of the benefits of free trade in general. Those are \nsome of the benefits to one of our trading partners. At this point in \nour history, when so much positive is going on in the world in terms of \ntaking down barriers, in terms of intercourse of commerce and the \nflourishing of market principles in places heretofore unknown to them, \nwe should be leading the world in all of these things. We should not be \na part of only two agreements when the rest of the world is moving on. \nThat is bad enough.\n  But now we are doing things, little by little, that are taking us in \none direction while the rest of the world seems to be going in another. \nWe are now in the midst of debating trade or environmental and labor \nstandards. We have entered into an agreement with Jordan, and we are \nvery concerned about their environmental standards. They happen to have \nsome of the better labor and environmental standards already in that \npart of the world. Now, for domestic reasons, we want to impose \nnontrade-related requirements on people with whom we want to trade. \nThey in turn, if we do that, have the right to impose those same things \non us and to take us to court, so to speak, over changes in our own law \npotentially.\n  We don't give our President trade promotion authority. We have heard \nthe debate on fast track over several years now. The President of the \nUnited States has not had the ability to enter into these agreements, \nputting us at a great disadvantage with regard to a large part of the \nworld.\n  Again, why are we so reticent? Why are we moving in one direction? \nWhy are we becoming more closed and raising more barriers at a time \nwhen the rest of the world is doing what we have always said we wanted \nthem to do in taking down barriers, entering into bilateral and \nmultilateral agreements?\n  I don't know why we would want to do that. I don't know why we would \nnot want to give the President trade promotion authority. I do not know \nwhy we would want to hold ourselves up to the accusation of \nprotectionism under these circumstances.\n  Should people of that persuasion succeed in restricting the freedom \nof trade, it will be U.S. consumers and workers who will lose out. \nTrade barriers will never prevent low-wage or low-skilled worker \ndisplacement. New technologies and improved efficiency will always \ndisplace low-wage and low-skilled workers. I am afraid that is an \neconomic reality. We need to be convinced, apparently, of the obvious \nproposition that if we are really concerned about labor standards and \nthe environment in some of these other countries, we need to help them \nlift their economy up so that they can take care of those matters \nthemselves.\n  We are never going to make any permanent improvement because we try \nto coerce some small nation, through a trade agreement, to improve \ntheir labor and environmental laws. What we can do is enter into trade \nagreements with them that will let them participate in this global \neconomy and in this prosperity that so many countries and so many \npeople have enjoyed because of free trade and more open markets and \nwhich, as I said, in many cases leads to more democratic institutions. \nWe are seeing that play out in Mexico as we speak, moving in the right \ndirection. It is all a part of the same picture. It is a picture where \nfree trade has the central role.\n  When I look at the current debate we are having, it is unfortunate \nthat it is taking some time. But as I look at it and as we are required \nas individual Senators to make decisions as to where we stand, we ought \nto think hard about exactly where we stand and where we ought to stand. \nAll these general principles I have been talking about in terms of the \nbenefits of free trade and how it has benefited our country and how it \nhas benefited Canada and Mexico and how this particular free trade \nagreement has benefited all of us, all those principles apply to the \nissue at hand. That is, are we doing something on an appropriations \nbill, almost as an afterthought as it were, that is going to move us \nnot only contrary to the provisions of the solemn undertaking that we \nmade with regard to NAFTA but take us contrary to the philosophical \nbeliefs and longstanding positions that this Nation has had?\n\n  My understanding is that we can make changes or we can have \nrequirements to implement the provisions under these agreements. We are \nfree to do that with regard to Canadian trucks or Mexican trucks or \nanything else. We can implement this agreement in ways that will \nprotect us, but we cannot change the agreement. We can't change the \nrequirements, and we cannot give different treatment to Mexicans than \nwe do Canadians.\n  We just voted down an amendment that said simply that we need to \ntreat Canadians and Mexicans alike because we are all three in the same \nagreement. That was voted down. How anybody could vote against that, I \nhave a hard time understanding.\n  We are getting down to some very core philosophies and beliefs. I am \nwondering what people will think about the United States of America in \nterms of a future trading partner when we cannot even reach a consensus \non something such as that, which is not only the right thing to do, the \nclearly nondiscriminatory right thing to do, but it is the only thing \nto do to be in compliance with the agreement.\n  I appreciate the indulgence of the Chair.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I am happy to yield.\n\n[[Page S8319]]\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. The Senator is a distinguished lawyer. I am not a lawyer, \nmuch less being a distinguished one. But I wanted to read to the \nSenator the language of NAFTA--it is very short--and ask the Senator if \nhe would give to us his interpretation of what it means and what kind \nof parameters it sets.\n  This is in the section of the North American Free Trade Agreement \nthat the President signed in 1994 and then we ratified. A Republican \nsigned it. A Democrat led the ratification, and now we have a \nRepublican President. We are in the third administration committed to \nthis agreement that we entered into.\n  In the area we are discussing, cross-border trade and services, we \nhave simple language as to what we committed to. I ask the Senator to \njust give us a description of what he, as a lawyer, a former U.S. \nattorney, sees this as meaning.\n  The heading on it is ``National Treatment.'' This is what we \ncommitted to, pure and simple:\n\n       Each party shall accord to service providers of another \n     party treatment no less favorable than that it accords in \n     like circumstances to its own service providers.\n\n  That is what we committed to. That is called national treatment.\n  Would the Senator give us sort of a legal and commonsense definition \nof what that is and what that means?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Well, to me it means that we have to treat them and \ntheir people the way we treat ourselves and our people. That is a \nfundamental of trade and trade agreements, and something that is \nfundamental to this particular agreement. It has to do with the concept \nof equality and comity. It doesn't matter that one country is richer \nthan another or has more population than another. It puts countries, \nfrom the standpoint of the agreement, from the standpoint of trade, on \na basis of equal trading partners. We will treat you the way we treat \nour own people.\n  I must say, if we violate that and we treat them worse than our own \npeople or worse than another trading partner or partner to the same \nagreement, such as Canada, then obviously they are going to \nreciprocate. And they are going to treat our people--in this case, our \ntruckers--seemingly, however they feel they are entitled in \nreciprocation of us violating the agreement.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. If I may, I will follow up by again, calling on the \nSenator's knowledge of the law and experience with it. Let me give the \nSenator some examples of provisions in the Murray amendment. In light \nof this provision that President Bush signed and we ratified with the \nsupport of President Clinton and which we are now trying to enforce \nunder the new President Bush, I wanted to get your reading as to \nwhether these provisions would violate the agreement that we made. \nCurrently, Canadian trucks are almost all insured by companies from \nGreat Britain; Lloyd's of London, I think, is the largest insurer of \nMexican trucks.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. You mean Canadian.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yes, Canadian. Some are insured by Canadian companies; \nsome are insured by American companies. Most American trucks are \ninsured by American companies, but not all American trucks. Lloyd's of \nLondon, as I understand it, insures some trucks. Quite frankly, it is \nvery difficult to tell with a modern company where it is domiciled.\n  The Murray amendment says that Mexican trucks, unlike Canadian trucks \nand American trucks, have to have insurance bought from companies that \nare domiciled in the United States. Now, American trucking companies \nare required to have insurance. Mexican trucking companies are required \nto have insurance. The insurance has to meet certain standards. \nCanadian trucking companies are required to have insurance. But the \nMurray amendment says, unlike American trucking companies and unlike \nCanadian trucking companies, Mexican trucking companies have to buy \ninsurance from companies domiciled in the United States of America.\n  In light of the language I just read, would the Senator see that as \nabout as clear a violation of NAFTA as you could have?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes, I would. I would wonder how we would view it if \nCanadians passed a law saying that American trucks had to buy insurance \nfrom companies that were domiciled in Mexico. I can't imagine anything \nthat would be more contrary to the spirit I just described a minute \nago. My understanding is--and the Senator can correct me if I am \nwrong--we can implement the agreement in several different ways. We are \nnot bound; we can even do it different ways with regard to different \ntrading partners, as long as it is an implementation under the \ncircumstances that are presented in order to protect ourselves in ways \nwe think are appropriate and reasonable. But we can't change the \nrequirements of the agreement.\n  That seems to me to be a flatout change of the requirements--basic \nrequirements of the agreement, and it goes contrary to the spirit and \nthe letter of the law with regard to that agreement. Under the \nagreement, you simply can't treat different trading partners in \ndifferent ways or change the terms or the requirements of the \nagreement.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me ask this. Under the Murray amendment, there is a \nprovision that says while American trucks are obviously operating all \nover our country, and Canadian trucks are operating--about a thousand \nof them--and they are operating under current law, because of a bill we \npassed in 1999 called the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act--and I \nwant to read you a short part of this which is relevant. Basically, \nwhat this bill finds is that the Department of Transportation is \nfailing to meet the statutorily mandated deadlines for completing \nrulemaking proceedings on motor carrier safety and in some significant \nsafety rulemaking proceedings, including driver hour of service \nregulations; extensive periods have elapsed without progress toward \nresolution and implementation. Congress finds that too few motor \ncarriers undergo compliance reviews, and the Department's database and \ninformation systems require substantial improvement to enhance the \nDepartment's ability to target inspection and enforcement resources.\n\n  Finding these things, Congress, in 1999, passed a bill mandating that \nthe Department of Transportation promulgate rules related to truck \nsafety nationwide to apply to all trucks operating in America. Under \nPresident Clinton and now under President Bush, those rules, which \nturned out to be time consuming and complicated, have not been \nimplemented. Canadian trucks are still operating even though these \nrules have not been implemented. American trucks are, obviously, \noperating even though these rules have not been implemented, or else we \nwould not be eating lunch today.\n  But the Murray amendment said that because we have not promulgated \nthese rules, until they are promulgated and until this bill is \nimplemented, even though it applies to all trucking in America--until \nthis happens, Canadian trucks would not be allowed into the United \nStates of America. Now I ask, is that any less arbitrary a \ndiscriminatory provision than saying they would not be allowed until a \nfull Moon occurred on a day where the Sun was in eclipse?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I would say this would be worse than the hypothetical \nyou mentioned about the Moon or the Sun because the situation you \ndescribed there is within our discretion. The Sun and the Moon aren't, \nbut, basically, as I understand what you read there, we are setting up \na condition and basically saying we are going to discriminate until we \ncomply with a condition that we have set up for ourselves. Quite \nfrankly, it seems to be--and you might want to reread that original \nlanguage you asked me about. It seems to me----\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will. It says--and this is the national treatment \nstandard, and maybe I should pose this as a question. Is the Senator \naware that the language in the national treatment standard says this? \nAnd this is a commitment we made to Canada and Mexico when the \nPresident signed this agreement in 1994 and the agreement that we \ncommitted ourselves to when we ratified it. The language is simple:\n\n       Each party shall accord the service providers of another \n     party treatment no less favorable than that it accords in \n     like circumstances to its own service providers.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Well, it seems to me that the situation you referred to \na moment ago is pretty directly contrary to that provision you just \nread.\n  (Mr. DAYTON assumed the Chair.)\n\n[[Page S8320]]\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me pose just two more questions. Under the Murray \namendment, a Mexican trucking company--let me start, if I may, by \nstating what the policy is today. As you are probably aware, most \ntrucking companies do not own trucks; they lease trucks. The \ninteresting thing about this whole debate is that we are debating as if \nMexico is going to go out to some junkyard somewhere and put together a \ntruck and drive it to Detroit. The reality is that they are going to \nrent the truck from Detroit just as American companies do. But we have \nthis vast system where companies lease to each other because the last \nthing on Earth they want as a trucking company is to have a quarter-of-\na-million-dollar rig sitting in their parking lot.\n  So if an American company has some restriction put on it, it is \nsubject to some suspension or to some restriction or some limitation. \nAnd there is not a big trucking company in America that at one time or \nanother has not been subject to one of these things.\n  In the United States and in Canada today, if a company is subject to \nsome limitation so they cannot use the truck, then they lease it to \nsomebody else. The Murray amendment says if a Mexican company is \nsubject to some suspension, restriction, or limitation, the Mexican \ncompany cannot lease a truck to anyone else.\n  In light of the fact we committed that each party shall accord to \nservice providers of another party treatment no less favorable than \nthat which it accords, in like circumstances, to its own providers, \ndoes the Senator believe one can possibly justify, under NAFTA, \nallowing Canadian truck operators to lease their trucks and American \ntruck operators to lease their trucks when they are under some \nrestriction or limitation but not allow Mexican trucking companies to \nlease their trucks under exactly the same circumstances? Would the \nSenator not see that as a flagrant violation of NAFTA?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. In other words, there is no such requirement for \nCanadian trucks? There is no such requirement?\n  Mr. GRAMM. No, no such requirement.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. There is no such requirement imposed on trucks in the \nUnited States?\n  Mr. GRAMM. No such requirement.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. There is a requirement on Mexico, and Mexico alone, \nMexican companies; is that what the Senator is saying?\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is right.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. That is, by definition, discriminatory and seemingly \nclearly contrary to the agreement. That is an interesting provision in \nand of itself. I am wondering whether or not an entire Mexican company \nis restricted, even if there is a problem, say, with just one or two \ntrucks.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If they are subject to some limitation, they will be \nunable to lease their trucks to another user, say, in the United States \nor Canada.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I do not know what that limitation would be, but \nobviously that is very broad.\n  I guess what is going through my mind is whether or not, even if we \ncould under the agreement enter into such an arrangement, that would be \na wise or fair thing to do because there is not a trucking company in \nthe world that does not have some violations every once in awhile.\n  It cannot be prevented. There is too much stuff going on, and having \nbeen a truckdriver a little bit myself, I am very much aware that, try \nas one might, one has to have a lot of rules and regulations and a lot \nof difficulties facing them.\n  Obviously, nobody wants any renegades doing business anywhere, but to \nsay any limitations ever placed on a company when they are doing \nbusiness with regard to, say, maybe even one truck at one location, \nthat in effect bans them for the rest of the Nation with regard to any \nother trucks, maybe even other trucks leased from another company, I do \nnot see the wisdom in that, quite frankly. Regardless whether it is a \ngood idea or not, it seems to be clearly discriminatory.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If I could pose the following question: Does it seem to \nthe Senator that it might not only be discriminatory but pernicious in \nthe following sense, that obviously this amendment was written by \nsomebody who knew something about the trucking business?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Sure.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I wonder if it does not strike the Senator as possible \nthat the supporters of this amendment would recognize--and I am not \ntalking about any Member of the Senate; I am talking about interest \ngroups in the country--would recognize one of the ways of assuring no \nMexican trucking company could ever compete with any American trucking \ncompany and Mexican drivers could never compete with American drivers \nwould be to say that if one has any limitation imposed on them, they \nhave to have their fleet sitting out on their tarmac. It seems to me \nthat is more than unfair or a violation of NAFTA. That is a provision I \nbelieve one could argue is simply aimed at saying we are not going to \nallow Mexican trucks to operate, period.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I say to the Senator, that is sad but true. It has a \ngreat deal to do with competition, or the desire for lack of \ncompetition, and when I say I do not see the wisdom in it, I guess I do \nnot see the wisdom in such a provision unless I am a competing trucker \nwho wants to look for any opportunity to make sure they have less \ncompetition. Unfortunately, that is what free trade is all about--\ncompetition.\n  When we entered into NAFTA, we committed ourselves to free and open \ncompetition. So I hope we do not get into a situation where we try to \nhang on technicalities or other provisions that are not only contrary \nto the agreement but are designed to limit competition.\n  I do not think we have a thing in the world to be afraid of. On the \none hand, the implication seems to be that these are all terrible \ntrucks and they do not know how to operate them. On the other hand, we \nare afraid of that kind of competition. It does not seem to make a \nwhole lot of sense to me.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me ask the Senator about the final provision of the \nMurray bill. I could go on and on, but I am trying to make a point by a \npattern. As the Senator knows from having been in the truckdriving \nbusiness for awhile, there are various kinds of penalties one can get. \nOne can get a parking ticket. They can get a speeding ticket. They can \nget a violation they are overloaded. They can get a violation for \nsomething blowing off their truck. They can get a violation if their \nmud flaps have gotten torn off. They can get a violation because of \ntheir tires. They can get a violation because their blinker does not \nwork. It may look as if it is working inside, but it is not working \noutside.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. They have not had enough rest.\n  Mr. GRAMM. They have not had enough rest.\n  As a result, recognizing not all of these violations are equal, in \nthe United States we have a list of penalties one can get, which might \nbe a $50 fine, a $100 fine, and for serious things they might take \nsomeone out of their truck. They might not let one drive for a month. \nThey might penalize the company. They might fix that kind of a problem \nby entering into an agreement with the company.\n  In America and in Canada today, we have a variety of penalties. In \nthe Murray provision, if one is in violation of any of these \nrequirements, one can be forever banned from operating trucks in the \nUnited States of America. Does that sound as if it is complying with \nNAFTA?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. For American trucks?\n  Mr. GRAMM. No, it is not for American trucks. It is not for Canadian \ntrucks. It is for Mexican trucks. In other words, there is one regime \nof penalties for American trucks and Canadian trucks, but there is \nanother regime for Canadian trucks, and the regime is focused on the \ndeath penalty.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Does the Senator mean Mexican trucks?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am sorry. I am focused south from Texas, but in the \nChamber maybe it is obvious from the votes we are focused more north \nfrom here.\n  In any case, A, does the Senator see that as a violation; and, B, \ndoes the Senator see that again as one of these things which goes \nbeyond a violation, where the objective is basically to prevent \ncompetition, more than just discriminate against Mexico but to create \nthese artificial barriers which they cannot overcome?\n\n[[Page S8321]]\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I think clearly so.\n  I have a broader concern in this, and that is, what is the signal \nthat is being received from Mexico and from Mexicans who watch this and \nlisten to this debate and see all of these provisions which are clearly \ndiscriminatory, that we do not treat Canada this way, but we are \ntreating Mexico this way. What kind of signal is that?\n\n  We have a lot of highball rhetoric on the Senate floor about matters \nof discrimination, and worse, but I am wondering, in a situation such \nas this when it comes down to dollars or when it comes down to domestic \ninterest groups that get involved in it, to try to pressure the United \nStates to violate agreements we have entered into, what kind of signal \nthat sends. And I wonder what President Fox, who has come in as a \nbreath of fresh air, who has instituted components of democracy that \nthey have not had, has reached out and is trying to get his arms around \na tough economic situation in a complex culture and heritage, and has a \ngood relationship with our President--I wonder what he must be thinking \nas he looks at all this. I don't think it is good.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Could I pose a question on that? With practical \nexperience, I can only speak within my own lifetime, but in my lifetime \nwe have never had a President of Mexico who was as committed in dealing \nwith Mexico's problems and problems we have between the two countries \nor who was as remotely pro-American as President Fox.\n  This is a President who does not have a majority in his own Congress. \nIn fact, he was elected President defeating the PRI, which is the old \nestablished party, but he does not have a majority in either the House \nor the Senate. He has numerous critics, and he has a coalition \ngovernment where his Foreign Minister opposed NAFTA when NAFTA was \nadopted. He is a person who has, in essence, gotten way out on a limb \nin saying we can be a partner with the United States of America. \nSomething that means more than that in Mexico is, we can be an equal \npartner with America.\n  How do you think it affects him in his political situation where, \nbecause he didn't have a majority in the Congress in either house, and \nhe had been elected in almost a revolutionary election, he felt \ncompelled to put together a coalition government where his Foreign \nMinister opposed NAFTA and who now will simply say, it is an agreement \nwe entered into? That is as far as he will go.\n  What kind of position do you think it puts him in when we are no \nlonger talking about idle speculation? I went through four different \nareas where, based on your legal background, you clearly concluded that \nthere is no question, not even a gray area, that there are four--at \nleast those are the only ones we went to--outright violations of NAFTA \nin the Murray amendment. No question about that, he said.\n  In what kind of position do you think it puts President Fox in when \nthe United States Senate adopts provisions that violate the commitment \nwe made to Mexico when we entered into NAFTA, we said Mexico was an \nequal partner with Canada and the United States, but they are not \nquite?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I imagine his political opponents would see this as an \nopportunity to question his effectiveness and his relationship to this \ncountry.\n  It is coming at a time when he made certain commitments to work with \nus on problems that are very important to us. He has made commitments \nwith regard to the illegal immigration problem knowing, as I believe \nmost of us do, that before we can ultimately deal with that problem, we \nare going to have to have some progress in terms of the Mexican \neconomy.\n  We can't beggar our neighbor and get by with it in this world today. \nWe especially can't with that common border we have of 1,200 miles. We \ncannot solve that problem without a better Mexican economy. NAFTA is at \nthe heart of that. He has to be looking at all of that and seeing us \nmove away from that.\n  I say his political opponents have to be looking at that and seeing \nan excellent opportunity to do harm to NAFTA and the principles of \nNAFTA and to do harm to a new, fresh face on the scene who, as you say, \nis the best friend we have had down there in a long time, and who is \ntrying to do the right thing.\n  For all those reasons, it is extremely unfortunate we are moving in \nthat direction.\n  How much time remains on my hour?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes thirty seconds.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield the \nfloor.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1165 to Amendment No. 1030\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nUtah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his \ncourtesy and accommodation. I appreciate the opportunity to speak at \nthis time. I have been told by a number of my colleagues they \nappreciate the fact that I\n\n[[Page S8323]]\n\nhave the opportunity to speak because it gives them a half hour so they \ncan go back to their offices and do something worthwhile. Some of them, \nas they said that, promised to read my remarks in the Record. I am very \ngrateful for that indication.\n  Mr. President, I hold the seat from the State of Utah that was held \nfor 30 years by Reed Smoot. Senator Smoot rose to be the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee and was one of the leading powers of this body. \nHe did many wonderful things. He was an outstanding Senator in almost \nevery way. However, he had the misfortune of being branded in history \nbecause of his authorship of the Smoot-Hawley tariff, which stands in \nAmerican economic history as something of a symbol of the isolationist-\nprotectionist point of view. I have said to Senator Smoot's relatives, \nwho are my constituents, with a smile on my face, that I have to do my \nbest as a militant free-trader to remove the stigma of protectionist \nfrom this particular seat. I can say that all of Senator Smoot's \nrelatives are equally as excited about free trade as I am, and they \nhave indicated that they approve of that.\n  I rise to talk in that vein because I think much of the debate that \nhas gone on here would be debate that might go all the way back to Reed \nSmoot. There is a protectionist strain in our attitude towards trade in \nthis country, and it is showing itself in this debate--a position that \nsays, well, yes, we believe in free trade, but we can't quite trust our \ntrading partners to do the right thing when free trade begins. Yes, we \nbelieve in allowing Mexican goods and services to enter the country, \nbut we don't quite trust the Mexicans themselves to take the \nresponsibility of providing those services. This is particularly \nfocused now on the issue of Mexican drivers at the wheels of Mexican \ntrucks.\n  I am very interested that in this debate we are being told again and \nagain that this bill does not violate NAFTA; that this is an issue \nabout safety rather than an issue about NAFTA; this is not \nprotectionist; this is not isolationist; this is not an obstruction of \nfree trade; this is just about safety.\n  Of course, if you frame the question about safety, what Senator wants \nto rise on this floor and be against safe trucks? What Senator wants to \nrise on this floor and say, I am in favor of massive highway accidents \ncaused by unsafe drivers? Nobody wants to take that posture. Yet that \nis why the attempts have been made to frame the debate in that \nfashion--so that it will ultimately end up a 100-to-nothing vote in \nfavor of safety. If we were to ask the Senate to vote solely on the \nissue of safety, it would be a 100-to-nothing vote.\n  I would vote in favor of safety. Everybody is in favor of safety. \nHowever, the key vote I think came when the Senator from Texas offered \na very short, one-sentence amendment that would have said nothing in \nthis bill violates NAFTA. That amendment was voted down. Once again, \nnothing in this bill violates NAFTA, says the amendment. And the \namendment gets voted down. How do we interpret that decision? We have \nto interpret that decision as saying that something in the bill absent \nthat amendment does violate NAFTA. Otherwise, the amendment would have \nbeen adopted 100 to nothing because we say we are in favor of safety. \nWe should say we are in favor of NAFTA.\n\n  I can understand those who are opposed to NAFTA voting against that \namendment. But NAFTA passed this body by a very wide margin. It was \nbipartisan. It was supported across the aisle. NAFTA ran into some \ntrouble in the House but not in the Senate. NAFTA has always been \nstrongly supported here. Why didn't an amendment that says nothing in \nthis bill shall be allowed to violate NAFTA pass with the same wide \nmargin? It must be that there is something in this bill that violates \nNAFTA and people do not want to get that exposed. They don't want to \nhave the basis for a lawsuit and someone coming forward and saying \nbecause of the Gramm amendment that says nothing in this bill can \nviolate NAFTA, this provision of the bill has to go, or that provision \nof the bill is in conflict and has to be removed.\n  I think there is a prima facie case here, by virtue of the vote that \nhas been cast, that this bill violates NAFTA. That is the position of \nthe administration. The administration is not antisafety. The \nadministration is anxious for proper inspection. Indeed, the Mexican \nAmbassador and other Mexican officials have said they are in favor of \nproper inspection and they don't want unsafe trucks rolling on the \nroads in America any more than we do.\n  Stop and think about it. Would it be in the Mexicans' self-interest \nto send dangerous trucks into the United States to cause accidents in \nthe United States? Would that be a wise foreign policy move for the \nMexicans as they try to build their friendship with the United States? \nIt is obviously in their self-interest to see to it that the trucks \nthat come across the border are safe. The Mexicans are not stupid. They \nwould not do something so obviously foolish as to send unsafe trucks \nhere.\n  So what are we talking about? We are talking about pressures within \nthe American political system that want NAFTA to fail. We are talking \nabout special interest groups inside the American political \ncircumstance that want to keep Mexican influences out of America for \ntheir own purposes. These are people who were unable to defeat NAFTA in \nthe first place. So they decide they will defeat NAFTA, or the \nimplementation of NAFTA in the second place, by adopting regulations in \nthe name of something that everybody agrees with, such as safety, that \nwill produce the effect of destroying NAFTA and preventing NAFTA from \ntaking place. We know how powerful some of those influences are within \nthe American political circumstance.\n  We have seen how some people around the world are reacting to the new \nreality of a borderless economy. Some people use the phrase \n``globalization.'' I prefer to describe what is happening in the world \nas the creation of a borderless economy.\n  We see how money moves around the world now quite literally with the \nspeed of light. The old days when money was transferred in attache \ncases handcuffed to the wrists of couriers who went in and out of \nairports are over. You can transfer money by sitting down at a PC that \nis connected to the Internet, pushing a few buttons and a few key \nstrokes, and it is done, so that international investors pay no \nattention to artificial geographic borders. They move money. They move \ncontracts. They move goods around the world literally with the speed of \nlight.\n  Now, that upsets people. That upset some people in Seattle. They \nwanted to stop it, and they turned to looting, rioting, and civil \ndisobedience in an attempt to stop it. From my view, that was a very \ndifficult and unfortunate thing that happened in Seattle. The then-\nPresident of the United States was a little less convinced it was an \nunfortunate thing and said: Maybe we ought to listen to these people. \nMaybe there is something to which we ought to pay attention.\n  It got worse. Now it has escalated to the point, in Genoa, where one \nof the demonstrators has been killed--killed because of his attempt to \nsee to it that we go back to the days when there were firm walls around \ncountries, when the borders meant protectionism, where we go back to \nthe attitude that produced the Smoot-Hawley tariff sponsored by the \nSenator in whose seat I now sit.\n  I do not mean to blame Senator Smoot because Senator Smoot was simply \nresponding to the conventional wisdom of his day that said: If you keep \nall economic activity within your own borders, you will be better off. \nSenator Smoot, however well intentioned, was wrong.\n  I remember one historian who said the Smoot-Hawley tariff, contrary \nto conventional wisdom, did not cause the Great Depression; it merely \nguaranteed that it would be worldwide because we had reached a point in \nhuman history where one must trade with somebody other than one's own \ntribe.\n  There was a time when all trade took place in the same valley, among \nmembers of the same family, the tribe descending from a single \npatriarch. All of the trade took place there. Then they discovered they \ncould do better if they started to trade with other tribes, but they \nstayed close to home. That mentality stayed with us. That mentality was \nbehind the Smoot-Hawley tariff. That mentality is comfortable. That \nmentality makes us feel secure. It does not involve any threatening \nrisk of dealing with strangers. It makes you\n\n[[Page S8324]]\n\nfeel really good when you are determined to trade only within your own \ntribe, but if you are going to increase your wealth, you are going to \nhave to start trading with another tribe, and that means that \nartificial borders have to start coming down.\n  The Smoot-Hawley tariff demonstrated the foolishness of trying to \nkeep trade entirely within the borders of a single country. But there \nare those, whether they are at Seattle or Genoa or, frankly, some on \nthe floor of the Senate, who still want to do that, who still want to \nsay: We will not trade outside our borders.\n  They fail to stop the treaties that say we will trade outside our \nborders, so they are saying: All right, if we cannot stop the treaty, \nwe can at least stop the implementation of the treaty by adopting \nregulations that make it impossible for the treaty to work.\n  The fact is, in the United States we produce more than Americans can \nconsume. That comes as a great surprise to many husbands and wives who \nthink their spouses can consume all there is to consume, but it is \ntrue. We produce more than Americans can consume. We produce more food \nthan Americans can eat. No matter how fat Americans seem to get in all \nof the obesity studies, we still cannot eat all the food we produce. We \nhave to sell this food to somebody other than Americans, and that means \nwe have to deal with the borderless economy. As we have taken steps to \ndo that, we have entered into these free trade agreements.\n  We have to allow other people to come into our country with their \ngoods and their food if we are going to send our goods and our food \ninto their country. It is just that fundamental. I wish I could sit \ndown with the demonstrators at Seattle and Genoa and elsewhere and \nexplain that to them because, as nearly as I can tell, they do not \nunderstand that it is in their best interests to allow the borderless \neconomy to grow, just as Senator Smoot did not understand, in his well-\nintentioned attempt to help the economy of the United States, that his \nprotectionist stance was against his own best interests.\n\n  We found that out in the United States. We paid an enormous price for \nthe protectionist attitudes that dominated this Chamber and both \nparties in the 1930s. Understand that the Smoot-Hawley tariff was not \njammed down the throats of a recalcitrant Democratic Party by a \ndominant Republican Party. It was adopted as proper policy all across \nthe country: Let's not trade outside our own borders. Let's protect \nwhat we have here and not expose it to the risk that foreigners might, \nin some way, profit at our loss.\n  As I say, the Smoot-Hawley tariff guaranteed that the Great \nDepression would go worldwide. We are smarter than that. We have \ntreaties that are better than that. Frankly, I believe if Reed Smoot \nwere still in this Chamber, he would endorse that; he would say: Learn \nfrom the mistakes of the past and move forward. He was that kind of a \nforward-thinking individual. But there are those, with regulations in \nthis bill, who say: No. Since we couldn't defeat NAFTA, we will have to \nstop NAFTA another way.\n  The administration has made its position very clear. They intend to \nlive up to the requirements of the treaty that has been signed. They \nintend to see to it that the United States discharges its \nresponsibilities. They have said the language in this bill does not do \nthat. And the President, if absolutely forced to do it--which he does \nnot want to do--if absolutely forced to, has said he will veto this \nbill and send it back to us to rewrite.\n  I know of no one on either side of the aisle who wants that to \nhappen. I know of no one who wants to have a veto. So under those \ncircumstances, why aren't we getting this worked out? Why aren't we \nsaying: All right, the President said he would veto it. The Mexicans \nhave said they believe it violates NAFTA. Let's sit down and see if we \ncan't work this out.\n  We cannot be that far away. I understand meetings have gone on all \nnight trying to work it out: Nope, we can't do it. We won't budge. I am \ntold: Well, go ahead, vote for this. It will be fixed in conference. In \nmy opinion, that is a dangerous thing to try to do. I hope that is what \nhappens. That is what many of the senior members of the Appropriations \nCommittee have told me: Go ahead, vote for it. Let it go through \nwithout a protest. We will fix it in conference. I hope they are \ncorrect, but I want to make it clear that as the bill gets to \nconference the process is going to be watched. There are people who are \ngoing to pay attention to what goes on.\n  If indeed, by the parliamentary power of the majority, this gets to \nconference in its present language, let's not have it go to conference \nwithout any protest; let's not have it go to conference without any \nnotification of the fact that in the minds of many of us, who are free \ntrade supporters, this bill is a modern-day regulatory reincarnation of \nSmoot-Hawley.\n  I do not mean to overemphasize that. It is not going to cause a \nworldwide depression. It is not going to do the damage that Smoot-\nHawley did. But it is crafted in the same view that says: A special \ninterest group in the United States, that has power in the political \nprocess in the Senate, that is opposed to implementation of NAFTA, can, \nby getting Senators to stand absolutely firm on language that clearly \nviolates NAFTA, have the effect of preventing NAFTA from going into \neffect on this issue.\n  So I hope everyone will understand the posture that I am taking.\n  This bill, in my view, clearly violates NAFTA. The vote that was \ntaken against the Gramm amendment signals that people understand that \nit violates NAFTA or the Gramm amendment would have been adopted \noverwhelmingly.\n  I congratulate President Bush for saying, as the Executive Officer of \nthis Government, charged by the Constitution with carrying out foreign \npolicy: I will defend the foreign policy posture taken by the signers \nof NAFTA, and I will veto this bill, if necessary.\n  My being on the floor today is simply to plead with all of those who \nare in charge of the process of the bill and the language of the bill, \nto understand that they have an obligation, as this moves towards \nconference, to see to it that the effect of the Gramm amendment that \nwas defeated takes place; that the bill is amended in conference in \nsuch a way that it does not violate NAFTA and that we do not go back on \nour international commitments; that we do not return to the days of my \npredecessor, Senator Smoot, and export protectionism around the world.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am happy to yield. Might I inquire of the time I have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes remaining.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/27/senate-section/article/S8324-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8324-S8326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    NOMINATION OF JOHN THOMAS SCHIEFFER, OF TEXAS, TO BE AMBASSADOR \n EXTRAORDINARY AND PLENIPOTENTIARY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO \n                               AUSTRALIA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider the nomination of John \nSchieffer to be Ambassador to Australia, reported earlier today by the \nForeign Relations Committee, the nomination be confirmed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid on the table, that any statements be printed in the \nappropriate place in the Record, the President be immediately notified \nof the Senate's action, and the Senate return to legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object, I would like to engage the assistant majority leader. I am \nextremely pleased to see that one of our nominees is moving this \nevening, Mr. Schieffer, to become Ambassador to Australia. I do know \nthat the assistant Republican leader and the assistant majority leader \nhave been working for the last several days to get us to a point of a \ndefinable number of nominees that might be considered before we go out \ntoday and before we go out for the August recess and some time line as \nit relates to the consideration of others that are before us.\n  The Senator from Nevada understands some of our frustration. I am \nlooking at a gentleman now before the Judiciary Committee who has not \nbeen\n\n[[Page S8325]]\n\ngiven a time for hearing and consideration. He has been there since May \n22, Assistant Attorney General for Natural Resources of the \nEnvironment. Yet I am told that he has been told that maybe sometime in \nNovember or December the Judiciary Committee might find time to get to \nhis nomination.\n\n  Clearly the Senator from Nevada, as I understand, is working on this \nissue. Although he and the assistant Republican leader have attempted \nto refine it and define it, that is not a way to treat our President \nand the people he needs to run the executive branch of Government.\n  My question to the assistant majority leader is, To his knowledge, \nwhere are we now in the possibility of numbers as it relates to what we \nwould finish before the August recess and some time line as to others \nthat we could expect to deal with, let's say when we got back in early \nSeptember, following the Labor Day period and on into October?\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator from Idaho, I have had a number of \nlong discussions with my counterpart, Senator Nickles. I think progress \nis being made. We have exchanged lists. We are exchanging scores of \nnominees. I think we are making good progress. There has been a little \nslowdown because of what has been going on on the floor the last few \ndays. Not only have Senator Nickles and I met on several occasions, but \nthe majority and minority leaders have also met and discussed this. We \nhave done very well. We certainly try not to do anything other than let \nthe chairmen move as they believe their committee should move. We have \nhad tremendous movement in most every committee--in fact, all \ncommittees.\n  As I said, we have exchanged with Senator Nickles scores of nominees. \nAnd at the appropriate time, we are happy to sit down and discuss \nfurther with him, as the two leaders have indicated. Once we decide we \nhave something to present to them, we will do that.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. President, as I have said, I will not object. It is important \nthat we move these nominees along. I understand that the new Ambassador \nheaded to Australia must get there for the ASEAN conference that is \nabout to convene in the Asian, sub-Asian area which is critical to us \nand to our country as it relates to climate change and that whole \ndebate, along with the trade debate and the relationships we have with \nAustralia and New Zealand and other nations within that area.\n  I must also say to the assistant majority leader, clearly the debate \non Mexican trucks and the Transportation bill, in my opinion, are an \nissue separate from the nominees.\n  Mr. REID. I agree with the Senator.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I know you had referenced some slowing down of the \nprocess. This process must not slow down. We have decisions that need \nto be made in the field. We have citizens waiting for decisions to be \nmade by agencies of our Government who now are not making them or are \nmaking them not with Bush appointees but with former Clinton \nappointees. I don't think that is the way either of us want that to \nhappen.\n  I hope that clearly we can confirm a substantial number before the \nAugust recess. We are going to pursue this and work certainly with you, \nand I and my colleague from Arizona will work with our leadership and \nwith the assistant Republican leader. Time lines are critical.\n  I must tell the Senator that if what I am told is true, that when a \nnominee engages the staff of one of the committees to ask when he might \nbe scheduled--and he has been there since May 22--and he is told, in \nessence, when we get around to it in November or December, that sounds \nto me like something other than timely scheduling. That sounds to me \nlike a great deal of foot dragging on the part of the Judiciary \nCommittee, its chairman, and its staff. If that is the case, and that \ncan be determined, my guess is, there will be less work done here than \nmight otherwise be done in the course of the next number of weeks, if \nwe can't determine to move these folks ahead with some reasonable \ntimeframe both for hearing and for an understanding of when they can \ncome to the floor for a vote.\n\n  With that, I do not object.\n  Mr. REID. Let me say to my friend, we believe nominees should be \napproved as quickly as possible. I say respectfully to my friend from \nIdaho, this is not payback time. We have indicated, and I have \nindicated to the Senator personally, the majority leader has indicated \nto the minority leader--I spoke to my counterpart, Senator Nickles--\nthis is not payback time. We will not compare what happened to \nPresident Clinton to what has happened to President Bush.\n  We are going to do our very best. We are working as rapidly as we \ncan.\n  I think what we have done is quite commendable. You are going to have \nto work with your side because a number of the holds on some of these \nimportant nominations are on your side.\n  We are doing the best we can. We appreciate your interest. I have \ntaken the assignment given to me by my leader, as Senator Nickles has \nby his leader, as being serious. We are doing our very best to come up \nwith a product that will satisfy the body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to confirmation of the \nnominee? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. REID. I have a parliamentary inquiry. I want to make sure the \ntime is running against the cloture motion. If it is not, then we are \nnot going to bother with this nomination because we don't have the \ntime. Is this counting?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is being charged to the 30 hours \nunder the cloture motion.\n  Mr. KYL. I don't mean to take any time.\n  Mr. REID. We have a lot of time.\n  Mr. KYL. That is not the object. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to ask the assistant majority leader \none, maybe two questions. This nomination is a great nomination, as the \nSenator from Nevada pointed out. It would not be my intention to \nobject. What it demonstrates is, my understanding is that the \nPresident, or someone on his behalf, called and said can't we shake \nthis nominee loose, for the reason the Senator from Idaho indicated. It \nillustrates the fact that we have held up the nominations so long that \nreally important things are beginning to happen that require that we \nput these people in place.\n  Therefore, I think it is commendable to bring this nominee to the \nfloor now. I ask the distinguished assistant majority leader--there are \nalso some important efforts at the United Nations which require the \nattendance of John Negroponte, the nominee for Ambassador of the U.N. \nThe President deserves to have his Cabinet filled out finally. John \nWalters, the nominee for drug czar, is somebody of great importance to \nthe White House. I spoke yesterday with the Attorney General who asked \nif we could please get Tom Sansonetti, an assistant from the Department \nof Justice, confirmed as quickly as possible.\n  I ask the assistant majority leader, since there are 15 nominees who \nI think are on the Executive Calendar now, we can do all of those right \nnow if he would agree not only that we could ask unanimous consent on \nthis one nominee, but the others who are at least pending on the \nExecutive Calendar before us.\n  Mr. REID. I don't think you can list in order of priority which of \nthese nominations are more important than another. If you asked people \nbefore the committee, the Environment and Public Works Committee, it \nmay not be, in the minds of some, as important to some under the \nauspices of the Judiciary Committee because that person is changing \ntheir lives to have a new assignment in life. It is very important. So \nwe are doing everything we can to move through these quickly. We want \nto make sure that the chairmen and the chairwomen of these committees \nand subcommittees have the opportunity to do whatever they need to do \nto make sure it is brought before the Senate in the fashion they \nbelieve appropriate.\n  I say to my friend, in answer to the question, Senator Nickles and I \nhave been working and at an appropriate time we will report to the two \nleaders as to what we expect to happen on both sides in the next few \nhours.\n\n[[Page S8326]]\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, then I will ask for a second question with \nthe indulgence of the Senator. With all due respect, the answer is a \nnonanswer. It doesn't tell us when we might consider these nominees. \nThe distinguished assistant majority leader said phrases such as ``as \nquickly as possible'' and ``as rapidly as we can accommodate.'' Is it \nnot true that there are 15--if I am incorrect, please give the correct \nnumber--15 people pending on the Executive Calendar who don't await \nanything except our action? We can do it now or at the end of the day. \nNothing stands in the way--no committee chairmen, no further vote, \nnothing. As far as I know, there is no controversy with respect to any \nof these.\n  Is there any reason that this number, whether it be 14 or 15, could \nnot be agreed to today?\n  Mr. REID. We hope before the day's end there are more than that on \nthe calendar. Some will be reported today.\n  This is not quite as easy as the Senator from Arizona has indicated. \nThe Department of the Treasury--these four people who have been \nreported out by the committee, by Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus, \nare really important, we think--the Deputy Secretary, Assistant \nSecretary, Under Secretary, and another Under Secretary. These are \nbeing held up on your side. We are trying to work our way through this. \nI say to my friend that we are trying to do our best. We are acting in \ngood faith. That is why we interrupted the proceedings for Mr. \nSchieffer.\n  Senator Nickles and I have been given an assignment. I know you will \naccept what I say. He and I have been working hard, but I ask you to \nmeet with him. We have had a number of discussions relating to the \nnominations. I am confident it is going to bear fruit very quickly.\n  Mr. KYL. I will not object. I appreciate the response of the \nassistant majority leader, although it suggests to me that these \nnominees are being held hostage to the legislative process. I hope we \ncan get these confirmations as quickly as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the confirmation?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The nomination was comfirmed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/27/senate-section/article/S8326-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Utah is recognized for his \nremaining 9 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and the assistant \nmajority leader for his courtesy. I want to conclude by commenting once \nagain on the importance of the United States keeping its international \ncommitment, a commitment made to Canada and Mexico to allow a free \ntrade area to occur on the North American continent. It is in our own \ninterest. It is the intelligent thing to do, and historically it will \nsee to it that the economies of all three of these countries will \nbenefit.\n  Here is the first test we have of whether or not the actual \nregulations of NAFTA will be allowed to work in a way that benefits our \nneighbors to the south, even though it discomfits a powerful political \ngroup in the United States. If we fail that test, we will send a \nmessage to the Mexicans that says we didn't really mean it; we don't \nthink you really should have equal status with the Americans. I can \nthink of no more corrosive a message to send to the Mexicans than that \none. That is why I think we must be as firm as we are trying to be in \nthis debate of making it clear that we are going to hang on to this \nissue until it is resolved satisfactorily.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, it is not often we get an opportunity to \nhave someone speak in the Senate who has built a successful business, \nwho has been engaged in international commerce, who has negotiated \ncontracts for millions of dollars. I would like to take this \nopportunity, since he has a few minutes left, to pose some questions to \nthe Senator about the debate before us.\n  As the Senator is aware, we entered into a free trade agreement with \nCanada and Mexico in 1994. A Republican President signed the agreement \nin San Antonio, TX--George Bush. The agreement was ratified with the \nvigorous support of a Democrat President, Bill Clinton. We are in the \nprocess of implementing it under another Republican President. So this \nis an agreement that was supported on a bipartisan basis by three \nPresidents.\n  In that agreement, in the section having to do with the question \nbefore us, we have chapter 12, which is on cross-border trade and \nservices. The language of the trade agreement is very simple. I would \nlike to read it to you, and I would like to ask you some questions.\n  First of all, the language says very simply what America's obligation \nis under what it calls ``national treatment.'' It is very simple. Our \nobligation to Canada, our obligation to Mexico, and their obligation to \nus is the following:\n\n       Each party shall accord to service providers of another \n     party treatment no less favorable than that it accords in \n     like circumstances to its own service providers.\n\n  First of all, with regard to trucking companies, if you had to \nconvert that legal statement of obligation into English, what do you \nthink it would say?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I say to the Senator from Texas, I think it would say \nthat Mexican trucks coming into the United States, Canadian trucks \ncoming into the United States, or American trucks going into Mexico \nwould all have to comply with the requirements of the States in which \nthey were operating, but that in the process of thus complying, they \nwould not have to change their procedures to a situation different from \nthe procedures that were considered acceptable on both sides.\n  This is something that would require the Americans to say we will \nhonor the Mexican Government's procedures just as we expect the Mexican \nGovernment to honor the American Government's procedures.\n  Mr. GRAMM. We would treat them the same. Whatever requirement we \nwould have, they would have.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I say to the Senator, that would be my understanding of \nthe part of the treaty which he has read.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me raise some issues in the time we have and see if \nthe Senator believes that these issues violate the provision.\n  The Murray amendment says that under the Motor Carrier Safety \nImprovement Act of 1999, which we adopted and which has to do with \nmotor safety in America, in general, Canadian trucks can operate in \nAmerica. Let me explain the problem.\n  We have not yet implemented this law. Under President Clinton and now \nunder President Bush, the difficulty in writing the regulations this \nbill calls for are so substantial that the provisions of this law have \nnot yet been implemented.\n  Even though they have not yet been implemented, a thousand Canadian \ntrucks are operating in the United States under the same regulations \nAmerican trucks are operating. Many thousands of American trucks are \noperating. But under the Murray amendment, until the regulations for \nthis law are written and implemented, no Mexican trucks can operate in \nthe United States on an interstate commerce basis.\n  Would the Senator view that to be equal treatment?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I would not, and I say to the Senator from Texas that I \nam familiar with the American legislation to which he refers because I \nhave had, as I suppose the Senator from Texas has had, considerable \ncomplaints from my constituents about the regulations proposed under \nthat bill and have contacted the administration, both the previous one \nand the present one, to say: Don't implement all aspects of this bill \nuntil you look at the specifics of these regulations; some of the \nthings you are asking for in this bill would, in my opinion, and in the \nopinion of the constituents who have contacted me, make the American \nhighways less safe than they are now.\n  To say we must wait until that is done before we allow Mexican trucks\n\n[[Page S8327]]\n\nin, in my view, would not only be a violation of NAFTA, it would be a \nviolation of common sense because we are not implementing that for our \nown trucks on the grounds that it would not be good, safe procedure for \nour own trucks.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Clearly, we are letting our trucks operate even though \nthat law is not implemented; we are letting Canadian trucks operate \neven though it is not implemented, but in singling out Mexican trucks, \nit seems to me that violates the NAFTA agreement. Does the Senator \nagree with that?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Without the benefit of a legal education, it seems to me \nthat violates the clear language of the NAFTA treaty.\n  Mr. GRAMM. In the time we have, let me pose a couple more questions.\n  Currently, most American trucks are insured by companies domiciled in \nAmerica, though some are insured by Lloyd's of London, which is \ndomiciled in Great Britain. Most Canadian trucks, it is my \nunderstanding, are insured by Lloyd's of London, which is domiciled in \nGreat Britain. Some of them are insured by Canadian insurance companies \ndomiciled in Canada. The Murray amendment says that all Mexican trucks \nmust have insurance from companies domiciled in America, a requirement \nthat does not exist for American trucks, a requirement that does not \nexist for Canadian trucks.\n  Does it not seem to the Senator from Utah that is a clear violation \nof the requirement that each party shall accord the service providers \nof another party treatment no less favorable than that it accords, in \nlike circumstances, to its own service providers?\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. It certainly would appear to me to be a violation. It \nwould seem an interesting anomaly if a Mexican trucking firm had \ninsurance with Lloyd's of London and then was denied the right to \noperate on American highways on the grounds----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the majority leader \nis recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1163 to Amendment No. 1130\n\n  Mr. Daschle. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1163.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1163 to amendment No. 1030.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n              (Purpose: To provide for an effective date)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following: ``Provided, \n     That this provision shall be effective three days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act.''.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nGramm be recognized for 30 minutes, and at the conclusion of that time, \nSenator Daschle or his designee be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Senator Gramm of Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader \nfor allowing me to be recognized.\n  Let me also say that we have a fair number of Members on this side \nwho want to speak before we have our final cloture vote tonight. \nWhatever we can do to provide time for people to speak would be \nappreciated. Obviously, I understand the majority have their rights in \nterms of those.\n  Let me try to explain to my colleagues what this debate is about, at \nleast as I see it. Obviously, the greatness of our individual \npersonalities and of being human is, as Jefferson once observed, that \ngood people with the same facts are prone to disagree.\n  I would like to try to outline how I see the issue before us, why it \nis so important to me, why I believe it is important to Senator McCain, \nand why I want to do this so people will understand what this debate is \nabout.\n  First of all, there is no debate about safety. Senator McCain and I \nhave an amendment that requires every Mexican truck to be inspected--\nevery single one. Under our current procedures, 28 percent of all \nAmerican trucks are inspected at least once during the year. Forty-\neight percent of all Canadian trucks are inspected at least once during \nthe year. Currently, 73 percent of all Mexican trucks coming into the \nborder States--which is the only place they are allowed to operate--are \ninspected.\n  Senator McCain and I believe in establishing our safety standards and \nassuring that Mexican trucks meet every safety standard that every \nAmerican truck and every Canadian truck must meet. We think the logical \nway of doing that, to begin with, until we establish a pattern of \nbehavior and until clear records are established is to inspect every \nsingle truck that comes across the border.\n  Under NAFTA, we cannot impose requirements on Mexican trucks that we \ndon't impose on our own trucks and that we don't impose on Canadian \ntrucks. But we have every right under NAFTA--I believe every obligation \nto our citizens--to assure that Mexican trucks are safe and to be sure \nthey meet every safety standard that we set on our own trucks.\n  Let me also say that if we raise safety standards on our own trucks--\nin some areas I believe that is justified--we then would have every \nright to impose the same standards on Mexican trucks.\n  In 1994, the President of the United States, the President of Mexico, \nand the Prime Minister of Canada met in San Antonio to sign the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement. It was the most historic trade agreement \nin the history of North America.\n  Under President Clinton, and through his leadership and exertion of\n\n[[Page S8328]]\n\nefforts, the Congress ratified the North American Free Trade Agreement \nby adopting enabling legislation which the President signed. We are now \nin the final stages of implementing NAFTA.\n  One President signed NAFTA--a Republican President. A Democrat \nPresident fought for its ratification, and now a Republican is seeking \nto comply with the final procedures of NAFTA that have to do with \ncross-border traded services.\n  Our obligation under the treaty is very simple. It says each party \nshall report the service providers of another party treatment no less \nfavorable than that it accords in like circumstances to its own \nproviders.\n  In fact, the little heading ``National Treatment'' really defines \nwhat we agreed to that day in San Antonio and what we ratified here on \nthe floor of the Senate. We agreed that we have every right to have \nevery safety standard we want. We can impose any safety standard on any \nMexican truck and on any Canadian truck so long as we impose it on \nevery American truck.\n\n  No one disagrees that we can't have a different safety protocol for \nMexico as they establish their pattern of behavior. As I said, Senator \nMcCain and I have proposed that we initially inspect every Mexican \ntruck. But let me explain what is not allowed under the treaty which \nthe Murray amendment does.\n  Under the Murray amendment, there is a provision that says we adopted \na bill in 1999, and that bill had to do with highway safety. In fact, \nit was called the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act. It in essence \nsaid Congress was not happy with motor safety in America and we wanted \nchanges. We wrote that law in 1999.\n  President Clinton found writing the regulations for the laws so \nonerous that those regulations have not yet been written. President \nBush is trying now to comply with this law.\n  We have every right to ask that American law be complied with. But \nthe point is this: We haven't written the regulations. The regulations \nare not being enforced, but yet there are thousands of Canadian trucks \noperating in America. There are thousands of American trucks operating \nin America. The Murray amendment says that until we implement this law \nby writing the regulations and enforcing them--something that probably \ncannot be done for 18 months or 2 years--no Mexican trucks will be \nallowed into America.\n  Under NAFTA, we can say until this law is implemented, no truck shall \noperate in the United States of America--American, Canadian, or \nMexican. That would be NAFTA legal, because we would be treating \nMexican trucks just as we treat American trucks and just as we treat \nCanadian trucks. We would all go hungry tonight. But we could do that.\n  What we cannot do under NAFTA is we can't say that American trucks \ncan operate even though we have not implemented this law, and Canadian \ntrucks can operate even though we have not implemented this law, but \nMexican trucks can't operate because we haven't implemented this law. \nThat is a clear violation of NAFTA; no ifs, ands, buts about it. It is \nno less arbitrary since the law has nothing to do with Mexico or \nMexican trucks. It is no less arbitrary than saying that no Mexican \ntrucks shall come into the United States until a phase of the Moon and \na phase of the Sun reach a certain level on a certain day that might \nnot occur for a million years. That is how arbitrary this is.\n  Unfortunately, it doesn't end there. Senator Murray, while opposing \namendments that say things that violate NAFTA don't have to be enforced \nfrom her amendment, continues to say: My amendment doesn't violate \nNAFTA.\n  Let me give you some other examples.\n  Most Canadian trucks have British insurance. Most Canadian trucks \nhave insurance from Lloyd's of London. Some of them have Dutch \ninsurance. Some American trucks have British insurance, Dutch \ninsurance, German insurance, and American insurance. As long as that \ncompany is licensed in America, and as long as it meets certain \nstandards, those trucks can operate in the United States. In fact, we \nhave Canadian trucks operating today when virtually none of them has \nAmerican insurance. But the Murray amendment says, if you are operating \nMexican trucks, those Mexican trucks must buy insurance from a company \nthat is domiciled in the United States of America.\n  We have every right and obligation to require Mexican trucks to have \ngood insurance. NAFTA allows us to do that. Logic dictates we do it. \nBut we do not have the right to dictate where the company that sells \nthe insurance is domiciled unless we are willing to do that to our own \ntruckers, which we do not do. Currently, most trucking companies lease \ntrucks.\n  The untold story of this whole debate is when Mexican truckers start \noperating in interstate commerce, they are not going to be driving \nMexican trucks. By and large, they are going to be driving American \ntrucks because trucking companies do not own many trucks. They lease \ntheir trucks. The Mexican companies are going to lease the trucks from \nthe same companies that American companies lease their trucks.\n\n  Currently, when a company has leased trucks or purchased trucks, if \nsomething happens and they can't put those trucks on the road--and that \nsomething can be that they lose business or they are under some kind of \nsuspension or restriction or limitation--they lease those trucks out to \nother companies. You can't be in the trucking business by having \n$250,000 rigs sitting in your parking lot.\n  Canadian trucking companies lease trucks when they cannot use them. \nAmerican trucking companies lease trucks when they cannot use them. And \nat any time any big trucking company in America or Canada has at least \none violation--at any time--often many because there are so many \ndifferent things you can be in violation on.\n  The Murray amendment says if you are under any kind of limitation, \nand you are a Mexican trucking company, you cannot lease your trucks. \nWhat that does is not only violate NAFTA--clearly a violation because \nwe do not have the same requirement for American trucking companies; we \ndo not have the same requirement for Canadian trucking companies--and \nif you cannot use your trucks, if you are under any kind of restriction \nor limitation, then, obviously, you cannot be in the trucking business.\n  So what the Murray amendment does is it not only violates NAFTA, it \nwrites a procedure that no one could stay profitably in the trucking \nbusiness if they had to meet that requirement.\n  In the United States, there are a whole range of penalties you can \nget. You can get a penalty if your blinker light does not work. It may \nlook as if it works inside, but it does not work outside. Your right \nmud flap is off. You are hauling too much cargo. Gravel is blowing out \nof the top. There are hundreds--maybe thousands; I don't know, but I \nwill say hundreds--of potential violations you can have.\n  In America, those violations can mean a warning or a fine of $100; \nsome of them that are serious may be more. It may be a warning to the \ncompany; it may be a consent decree with the company.\n  But under the Murray amendment, all that regime stays in place if the \ncompany is an American company, and it all stays in place if they are a \nCanadian company, but if they are a Mexican company, and they are found \nto be in violation, they get the death penalty; they get banned from \noperating in the United States of America.\n  Look, we could write a law that said, if you are in violation on \nanything, you are out of the trucking business in America. That would \nbe crazy. The cost of trucking services would skyrocket, but we could \ndo it, and it would be legal under NAFTA to do it to Mexican trucks. \nBut you cannot have one set of rules for American trucks and another \nset of rules for Mexican trucks or Canadian trucks.\n  The amazing thing is that when so many people are talking about this \ndebate, they write as if Senator McCain and I want lesser safety \nstandards. Senator McCain and I want exactly the same safety standards \nfor Mexican trucks that we have for American trucks, only we are \nwilling to inspect every single truck until they come into compliance.\n\n[[Page S8329]]\n\n  What we are opposed to is not tougher safety standards; what we are \nopposed to is protectionism, cloaked in the cloak of safety, where \nrestrictions are written that, for all practical purposes, guarantee \nthat Mexican trucks cannot operate in the United States--clearly in \nviolation of NAFTA.\n\n  There are a few newspapers that are getting this debate right. The \nChicago Tribune says today, in its lead editorial:\n\n       Truth is that Teamster truckers don't want competition from \n     their Mexican counterparts, who now have to transfer their \n     loads near the border to American-driven trucks, instead of \n     driving straight through to the final destination. But to \n     admit that would sound too crass and self-serving, so Sen. \n     Patty Murray, and others pushing the Teamster line, instead \n     are prattling on about road safety.\n\n  That is the Chicago Tribune. The Chicago Tribune believes this is not \nabout safety, that this is about protectionism, cloaked in the garb of \nsafety.\n  Finally, let me explain to my colleagues why Senator McCain and I \nhave us here on this beautiful Friday afternoon at 4 o'clock. Let me \nsay to my colleagues that I am not calling these votes. In fact, I \nwould be very happy to have no vote until we have the cloture vote \ntonight. The majority leader is calling these votes to try to get \npeople to stay here, which is fine. It is his right.\n  But why we are doing this is because our Founding Fathers, when they \nwrote the Constitution, and they established the rules of the Senate, \nas it evolved, recognized that there would be those issues where the \npublic would be easy to confuse. There would be those issues where \nspecial interest groups were paying attention, and they would be out \nthe door of the Senate Chamber where they have every right to be. They \nwould be lobbying. And there would be issues where you could cloak from \nthe public what the real issue was.\n  Our Founders, in recognizing there would be those issues--and I \npersonally believe this is one of them--gave to the individual Senator, \nwhose views were not in the majority that day on that issue, the right \nto require that there be full debate, the right to require that those \nwho wanted to end the debate get 60 votes. Senator McCain and I are \nusing those rights today because we believe it is wrong and rotten for \nAmerica, the greatest country in the history of the world, to be going \nback on a solemn commitment that it made in NAFTA.\n  We think it hurts the credibility of our great country, when we are \ncalling on people all over the world to live up to the commitments they \nmade to us, for us to be going back on commitments we made to our two \nneighbors. We also think it is fundamentally wrong to treat our \nneighbors differently.\n  To listen to the debate on the other side, you get the idea we are \ntrying to have different standards for Mexico. We want the same \nstandards for Mexico, but we do not want provisions that, in essence, \nprevent Mexico from having its rights under NAFTA. That is what this \nissue is about.\n  I urge my colleagues--I know we are getting late in the day and I \nknow people are pretty well dug in; and I know a lot of commitments \nhave been made--but we need to ask ourselves some simple questions: No. \n1, do we want to go on record in the Senate in passing a rider to an \nappropriations bill that clearly violates a solemn treaty commitment \nthat we made in negotiating NAFTA? And it was not some President who \nmade it. A Republican President signed it. A Democrat President fought \nto ratify it. We ratified it. And now a Republican President is trying \nto implement it. Do we really want to go on record today--on a Friday \nnight--for going back on our word to NAFTA?\n  No. 2, we have a President in Mexico who is the best friend that \nAmerica has ever had in a President in Mexico. He virtually created a \npolitical revolution in Mexico when he defeated a party that had ruled \nMexico for almost all of the 20th century. He is pro-trade and pro-\nAmerican. But he does not have a majority in either the House or the \nSenate in Mexico. He had to put together a coalition government where \nhis Foreign Minister opposed GATT, opposed NAFTA, and the best his \nForeign Minister will say with NAFTA is: Well, we agree to it.\n  What kind of position are we putting President Fox in when we pass a \nbill that violates our agreement in NAFTA and treats Canadians one way \nand Mexicans another? What kind of signal does that send? And does \nanybody here--since we are all involved in politics, and we understand \nthat when you have a vulnerability, your political enemies exploit it--\ndoes anybody doubt that all the ``hate America'' crowds in Mexico--and \nthere are a lot of them--does anybody doubt that they are going to use \nthis as an issue against President Fox, that we violated our agreement, \nthat we are their neighbor but we are not their equal neighbor, that we \ndon't treat them that bad but we don't treat them as good as we treat \nthe Canadians, that the U.S. Congress said what is good enough for \nAmericans and good enough for Canadians is not good enough for \nMexicans?\n  It is not a question of safety. We have every right to force them to \ndo everything we do. We have a right to have a more strict regime until \nthey prove they are doing it.\n  What we do not have a right to do is to have a bunch of things that \nclaim to be safety that really say: You can't operate Mexican trucks in \nthe United States. That is what this issue is about.\n  Obviously, it is frustrating when the word does not get out and \npeople don't necessarily understand what the debate is. Tonight we are \nusing powers that the Founding Fathers thought Senators ought to have. \nIt is up to each individual Senator's conscious as to when they use \nthose powers. We have used those powers on this bill.\n  It is wrong what we are trying to do. It will hurt America. It will \nhurt Texas. It will hurt the 20 million people I work directly for and \nthe 280 million people I try to represent. At least that is my opinion. \nSince that is my opinion and I believe it and believe it strongly, I \nintend to use every power we have.\n  We will have a cloture vote tonight. I hope it will be defeated. I am \nprayerfully hopeful that perhaps a few of our Members will have some \nenlightenment or an enlightening experience between now and the \nappointed hour. But we have three more cloture votes after this one, \nand we intend to use our full rights as Senators to see that if we are \ngoing to abrogate NAFTA, if we are going to slap President Fox in the \nface, if we are going to run over President Bush, we are not going to \ndo it without resistance, without strong, committed resistance. That is \nwhat this debate is about.\n  How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 6\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I will reserve the remainder of my time and \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have been listening to the debate \ntoday and yesterday. I think we have gone beyond the realm of \nreasonableness.\n  This is a debate about safety on American highways. We are voting on \ntechnical amendments that mean nothing. We are not moving the debate \nforward. A lot of people are being inconvenienced by votes that don't \nmean anything. We could all be here voting on substantive amendments \nuntil midnight. That is what we are here to do. But to just have \ntechnical amendments in order to wait it out and see how many people \nwill leave is wrong.\n  I am very interested in safety on American highways. I think we can \ndo it within the terms of NAFTA. We are smart enough to figure that \nout.\n  The question is not whether we have safety on American highways or we \nviolate NAFTA. It is when we make the agreement. Make no mistake about \nit, that is the debate.\n  I ask all of my colleagues to sit down and let's come to a reasonable \nagreement on when we are going to address the merits of this issue. No \none who has an IQ of 25 believes that changing the effective date on \nthis bill every 30 minutes or tabling a motion to change the effective \ndate is moving the ball on the substance one bit further.\n\n[[Page S8330]]\n\n  Mr. President, I think it is time for us to act as a Senate; that all \nof the parties who have quite reasonable substantive arguments to make, \nwho are very close to an agreement, sit down and determine when that \nagreement will be made so that we can come to a reasonable and \nresponsible conclusion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Torricelli). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                coordinated border and corridor program\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Michigan and the distinguished chair \nof the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee. As the chair knows, \nover the past few years, the State of Michigan has competed for funds \nunder the Coordinated Border and Corridor Program of the Transportation \nEquity Act (TEA 21).\n  I ask the distinguished chair to give consideration to a particularly \nimportant project on our U.S.-Canadian border in Michigan. The \nAmbassador Bridge Gateway Project which will provide direct interstate \naccess to the Ambassador Bridge and improve overall traffic flow to and \nfrom our U.S.-Canadian border, needs $10 million this year to keep the \nproject on schedule. To date, there has been a total of $30.2 million \nin Federal funds either spent or committed with a State match of $7 \nmillion. Any consideration that the distinguished Chairwoman can \nprovide is much appreciated.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I join my colleague from Michigan in asking the chair to \ngive this important project consideration in conference, especially \nsince no Michigan project is funded under this account. The Ambassador \nBridge in Detroit, MI is a critical project for the State's trade \ninfrastructure. It is one of the three busiest border crossings in \nNorth America, and more trade moves over this bridge than the country \nexports to Japan. It is crucial that we keep traffic moving safely and \nefficiently at this crossing. The Ambassador Bridge Gateway project \nwill provide direct interstate access to the bridge, and improve \noverall traffic flow to and from the Ambassador Bridge. This project \nalso has a wide range of support from the State, local government, \nmetropolitan planning and the business community.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I will be happy to work with my colleagues in conference \non this matter and to look at the specific corridor project they are \nrecommending.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, for the past few days now, we have been \nhere on the floor of the Senate debating a very basic question: do we \ntrust our trading partners?\n  As I see it, this debate is not about truck safety, but, rather, it \nis about whether or not the United States is willing to honor its trade \nagreements and adhere to the principals of NAFTA.\n  Over the past several years, as my colleagues are aware, the United \nStates has enjoyed one of its longest periods of economic prosperity in \nour history. Vital to this remarkable economic boom has been \ninternational trade. Trade is the economic lifeblood of the United \nStates. Some twelve million American jobs depend directly on exports, \nand countless millions more, indirectly.\n  In fact, the growth in American exports over the last ten years has \nbeen responsible for about one-third of our total economic growth. That \nmeans jobs for Americans and of particular concern to this Senator, \njobs for Ohioans.\n  The United States is the world's single largest exporter of goods and \nservices, accounting for 12 percent of the world's total goods exports \nand 16 percent of the world's total service exports. Goods and services \nexports from the State of Ohio constitute a significant share of \nexports coming from the United States, making the Buckeye State the 8th \nlargest exporter in the nation.\n  Ohio is a textbook example of why international trade is good for \nAmerica. When I was Governor, I had four goals in the area of economic \ndevelopment--agribusiness, science and technology, tourism and \ninternational trade. We pursued each of these aggressively in order to \nmaximize Ohio's business potential, especially in the trade arena.\n  Thanks to trade-stimulating agreements, such as the North American \nFree Trade Agreement (NAFTA), overall Ohio exports have skyrocketed 103 \npercent in just the last decade.\n  When the North America Free Trade Agreement took effect on January 1, \n1994, it brought together three nations and 380 million people to form \nthe world's largest free trade zone, with a collective output of $8 \ntrillion. We in the State of Ohio were so excited about the potential \nof NAFTA, that in order to take advantage of this trade agreement, Ohio \nopened a trade office in Mexico shortly after NAFTA's passage.\n  Thanks to NAFTA, historic trade barriers that once kept American \ngoods and services out of the Canadian and Mexican markets either have \nbeen eliminated or are being phased out. The positive economic effects \nhave been astounding:\n  From 1993 to 1998, U.S. exports to Canada grew 54 percent and U.S. \nexports to Mexico grew 90 percent.\n  Also from 1993 to 1998, Ohio outperformed the nation in the growth of \nexports to America's two NAFTA trading partners. Ohio's exports to \nCanada grew 64 percent and Ohio exports to Mexico grew 101 percent.\n  But, in my view, if the Senate enacts the Murray amendment, we will \nbe jeopardizing one of the most successful trading partnerships that \nthis nation has ever had.\n  It is hard to believe that this legislation, which singles-out just \none nation and holds up one crucial aspect of their trade policy to \nscrutiny, would not violate NAFTA.\n  I cannot fathom how supporters of this legislation ignore this fact.\n  I am every bit as concerned as any other member of this chamber about \nthe safety of tractor trailer trucks. As anyone who has driven through \nmy state of Ohio knows, it is a hub of long-haul trucking.\n  You can be certain that I do not want my constituents endangered by \nunsafe tractor trailer trucks regardless of their city, state or \ncountry of origin.\n  But we must be cognizant of the fact that, if this amendment is \nenacted, we will be unfairly discriminating against our second largest \ntrading partner--Mexico.\n  Mexican trucks are already required to comply with our laws governing \ntruck safety if they want to operate on our highways. The state and \nfederal laws are already in place.\n  Is there room for improvements to safety? Of course. But, I also \nbelieve if these laws were adequately enforced, we would not be having \nthis discussion today.\n  Do I think we should enforce these laws vigorously? Of course. But, I \nam not calling for this nation to enact restrictive laws that single \nout Mexico.\n  However, what the Senate is in the process of doing is raising the \nbar for our Mexican trading partners by requiring an extraordinary \nsafety requirement that does not apply to our other NAFTA trading \npartner, Canada, and establishes a whole new regimen that Mexican \ntrucks will have to follow that most American trucks do not.\n  Make no mistake: Our other trading partners throughout the world are \nwatching what the Senate is doing, and our action--should the Murray \namendment be enacted--could shake their faith in our willingness and \nability to engage in truly ``fair'' trading practices.\n  The stakes are high--higher than I think anyone in this Chamber \nrealizes.\n  The United States has proudly claimed itself a bastion of open \nmarkets for more than 200 years. Indeed, we have set the example of \nconsistently striving to comply with our trade treaty obligations. But, \nhow can we ask and expect other countries to abide by international \ntrade rules if the United States flagrantly disregards them itself? If \nwe want a rules-based system of international trade to work, so that we \ncan have a level playing field across the board on all goods, America \nmust lead by example and not pass xenophobic restrictions on our \nneighbors.\n\n[[Page S8331]]\n\n  How can USTR Ambassador Robert Zoellick successfully negotiate vital \ntrade agreements to open up new markets for American industry that will \nbenefit American workers when the Senate signals that America is \nunwilling to play by the rules? What faith can our partners have? What \ncan we demand of them?\n  If the Murray amendment is enacted, can you imagine the damage that \nwe would bring upon ourselves when we try and negotiate the Free Trade \nof the Americas treaty? Who would trust us?\n  I can just imagine President Cordoza of Brazil--who is not too keen \non the Free Trade of the Americas treaty to begin with--telling all of \nthe Central and South American leaders that they shouldn't get into a \ntreaty with the U.S.\n  He just might say that the U.S. Senate, that ``reasoned, deliberative \nbody'' cannot be trusted, and is fanned by the flames of political \nopportunism.\n  Think also what the amendment will do to the budding relationship \nbetween President Bush and President Vicente Fox? They have worked well \ntogether and I would hate to think that this amendment could set back \nour relationship with the Mexican leader and his nation.\n  President Bush is fully aware of what this amendment would mean, and \nI would like to quote from the Statement of Administration Policy on \nthis bill:\n\n       The Administration remains strongly opposed to any \n     amendment that would require Mexican motor carrier applicants \n     to undergo safety audits prior to being granted authority to \n     operate beyond commercial zones on the U.S.-Mexico border, as \n     this would violate the NAFTA agreement and the President's \n     strong commitment to open the U.S.-Mexico border to free and \n     fair trade.\n\n  This amendment defies logic and reason.\n  If this amendment is enacted, what the Senate would be doing is re-\nopening one of the most significant trade treaties in history by \nlegislative fiat.\n  Mr. President, but we should not be modifying our international \nagreements via a rider to an appropriations bill. This is no way to run \nour foreign policy, nor our trade policy.\n  Senator McCain said the other day that the Commerce Committee, on \nwhich he is ranking and which has jurisdiction over surface \ntransportation, has not considered any legislation on this important \nmatter. This is precisely the kind of complex and delicate matter that \ndeserves full and balanced consideration before we charge ahead and \nmake a decision we most assuredly will regret later.\n  And what about my good friend from Texas, Senator Gramm. His state \nhas more border crossings from Mexico than any other state represented \nin this chamber. He would have every right in the world to oppose \ntrucks from Mexico coming into his state.\n  But the Senator from Texas fully understands the importance of \nadhering to our trade agreements and he has spoken eloquently on this \ntopic.\n  Mr. President, it is of obvious concern to make sure that all trucks \nthat operate on American highways do so in compliance with all \napplicable safety standards.\n  However, this amendment goes too far in trying to ensure those \nstandards, and it is an inappropriate response for the U.S. Senate to \ntake.\n  I urge this body not to jeopardize the benefits of international \ntrade in the haphazard way that this amendment would undertake.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be agreed to and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable en bloc; further, that it be in order for the managers to offer a \nmanagers' amendment, postcloture, which has been agreed upon by the two \nmanagers and the two leaders, notwithstanding the provisions of rule \nXXII.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the time until 6:25 p.m. today \nbe equally divided and controlled and that at 6:25 p.m. the Senate \nproceed to a vote on the motion to invoke cloture on H.R. 2299.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Harkin). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 1025 and 1030) were agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: How much time \nexists on both sides from now until the time for the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten and one-half minutes on each side.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, under the agreement of the managers, I \nrequest the last 3 minutes be reserved for my comments or just before \nthe final comments of the managers, whatever the managers desire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator ask unanimous consent?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes, I ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The understanding of the request is the last 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Either the last 3 minutes before 6:25 or the last 3 \nminutes before the comments of the managers, either one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Be reserved for?\n  Mr. McCAIN. My purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The last 3 minutes.\n  Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, as most Members of the Senate, I have \nlistened to this debate patiently for many hours. I have heard many \nthings said that Senators need to consider before this debate comes to \na close. Mostly I have heard that the United States somehow will be \nviolating our treaty obligations with Mexico if we insist upon the \nsafety of our citizens on our highways from Mexican trucks. I have \nheard that this Senate would be turning its back on the NAFTA treaty. I \nhave heard it not a few times but 5 times or 10 times.\n  For the consideration of my colleagues, I will answer it but once, \nbecause this Government does not violate a treaty obligation and the \nSenate does not violate the law or its obligations. Indeed, it has been \nsaid before, but in a recent arbitration panel decision looking at the \nNAFTA treaty and our obligations to our citizens and truck safety, it \nhas been said:\n\n       The United States may not be required to treat applications \n     from Mexican trucking firms in exactly the same manner as \n     applications from United States or Canadian firms . . . U.S. \n     authorities are responsible for the safe operations of trucks \n     within United States territory, whether ownership is United \n     States, Canadian, or Mexican.\n\n  It is not our intention nor will this law violate our treaty \nobligations. It simply says this: 50 years of efforts to protect \nAmericans on our highways are not abandoned. The facts are clear. \nSenator Murray simply wants to know that Mexican trucks entering \nAmerica will be inspected and they will be safe.\n  Our intentions are well founded. Mexican truck on average are 15 \nyears old; Americans' are 4. Mexican trucks weigh 135,000 pounds; \nAmerican trucks, 85,000 pounds. Mexican drivers are 18 years old; \nAmerican, 21. American trucks are documented for hazardous or toxic \ncargo. Until recently, Mexican trucks were not.\n  Indeed, the evidence supports what Senator Murray is attempting to \ndo. Forty percent of all Mexican trucks now entering the United States \nare failing inspections. This is not an idle problem. One hundred \nthousand Americans a year are being injured, or their children are \ninjured, or their neighbors are injured in serious trucking accidents \nin America. We share our neighborhood roads and our interstate highways \nwith 18-wheel trucks weighing tens of thousands of pounds.\n  For what purpose has this Senate and our State legislatures for all \nthese years required special engineering of trucks if we will not \nrequire it of Mexican trucks? Why do we have weight limitations? Why do \nwe implement laws about special training and driving if we are to \nabandon that effort now? Of the 27 border crossings between Mexico and \nthe United States, 2 have inspectors 24 hours a day.\n  What would the Senator from Texas and the Senator from Arizona do in \nthese hours when Mexican trucks without training, without weight \nrequirements, and without inspections arrive at America's borders if \nthere is no one there to weigh them or inspect them or assure that our \nfamilies are safe? That\n\n[[Page S8332]]\n\nis a difference of what we do today. Senator Murray requires it. The \nSenator from Texas would not.\n  The United States has a right to insist under NAFTA that our citizens \nare safe. No, I say to Senator Gramm, we don't have a right; we have an \nobligation recognized by an arbitration panel looking at Mexican law \nand American law and the NAFTA treaty.\n  I have never seen it more clear that the Senate has operated within \nits obligations and its rights to our citizens than in recognition of \nthis amendment.\n  I do not know how long we will have to be here, but I can tell you \nthis: If it requires tonight, tomorrow night, next week, next month, \nthis Senator will not be responsible for American families losing their \nlives. I will stand for our treaty obligations, but first I will stand \nfor our families.\n  I commend the Senator from Washington for her tenacity and her \nvision.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, let me read from the Chicago Tribune. The headline is \n``Honk if you smell cheap politics.''\n\n       As political debates go, the one in the Senate against \n     allowing Mexican trucks access to the U.S. is about as \n     dishonest as it gets.\n       Truth is that Teamster truckers don't want competition from \n     their Mexican counterparts, who now have to transfer their \n     loads near the border to American-driven trucks, instead of \n     driving straight through to the final destination.\n  We can scream and holler; we can be emotional all we choose to be, \nbut this debate has nothing to do with safety and everything to do with \nraw, rotten protectionism. It has to do with violating NAFTA and \ndestroying the good word of the United States of America.\n  The truth is that Senator McCain and I have offered an amendment that \nwould require every Mexican truck to be inspected, that would require \nevery Mexican truck to meet the same safety standards that the United \nStates of America requires of its own trucks, and that those trucks \nwould not be allowed to come into the United States until they had met \nthose standards.\n  But the Murray amendment is not about safety; it is about \nprotectionism. The Murray amendment says because of a 1999 law that we \npassed, that had nothing to do with Mexico--and was not fully \nimplemented by the Clinton administration, and has not been implemented \nby the Bush administration--that Canadian trucks can operate in the \nUnited States, that American trucks can operate in the United States, \nbut Mexican trucks cannot.\n  So we have not implemented a domestic law and, therefore, we are \nletting Canadian trucks in, we are letting our own trucks operate, but \nwe do not let Mexican trucks in. That violates NAFTA. American truck \ncompanies can lease each other trucks. Nobody objects to that. Senator \nMurray does not object to it. Canadian companies can lease each other \ntrucks. But under the Murray amendment, Mexican companies cannot.\n  Under the Murray amendment, there is only one penalty for Mexican \ncompanies, and that is a ban on operating in the United States of \nAmerica, even though we have numerous different penalties for U.S. \ntrucks than Mexican trucks.\n  Under the Murray amendment, we basically have entirely different \nstandards for Mexico than we have for the United States of America and \nthat we have for Canada.\n  Under the Murray amendment, basically we say: In NAFTA we said we \nwere equal partners, but we didn't mean it. We are equal partners with \nCanada, but our Mexican partners are inferior partners that will not be \ntreated equally.\n  The problem is, NAFTA commits us to equal treatment. This is not \nabout safety; this is about protectionism. We are not here tonight \nbecause Senator McCain and I wanted to be here. We are here tonight \nbecause the majority party would not negotiate with us to come up with \na bill that did not violate NAFTA.\n  We have offered two amendments. The first amendment said that any \nprovision of the Murray amendment that violated NAFTA--a treaty, in the \nwords of the Constitution, the supreme law of the land--that violated a \ncommitment made by three Presidents and by the Congress would not be \nput into place. That was rejected.\n  The Senator from Arizona offered an amendment that said under the \nMurray amendment Mexican nationals and Canadian nationals would be \ntreated the same. That was rejected by our colleagues who are in the \nmajority party in the Senate.\n  So they say the Murray amendment does not violate NAFTA, but when we \noffered an amendment to not enforce the parts of it that do violate \nNAFTA, they rejected it. They say the Murray amendment does not \ndiscriminate against Mexico and Mexicans, but when we offered an \namendment forbidding that they be discriminated against relative to \nCanadians, they rejected it.\n  The truth is, this is about special interest as compared to the \npublic interest. I ask my colleagues--I understand politics; I have \nbeen in it a long time--is it worth it to destroy the good word of the \nUnited States of America on an issue such as this on an appropriations \nbill?\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against cloture.\n  Mr. President, I assume my time has expired. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield our remaining time to Senator \nDorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 4 minutes 53 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, seldom in political debate--especially in \nthe Senate--do you find a bright line between that which you think is \nthoughtful and that which you think is thoughtless. I think I have seen \nsome lines recently.\n  Let me describe my reaction to someone who suggests those of us who \nstand up and worry about highway safety in our country are engaged in \nsomething that is raw, rotten, and protectionist.\n  What we are doing is not raw, not rotten, and has nothing to do with \nprotectionism. If you use the word ``protection'' in the manner I \ndescribe our duties in the Senate, let me plead guilty for wanting to \nprotect the interests of Americans on American highways. Let me plead \nguilty for wanting to protect those interests. I, of course, would \nnever apologize to anyone for standing in the Senate saying this is a \ncritically important issue on behalf of those in our country who travel \nour country's highways.\n  The question is, Shall we allow Mexican long-haul trucks in beyond \nthe 20-mile limit? Senator Murray from Washington has said, the only \ncondition under which they can come in beyond that 20-mile limit is \nwhen they meet the standards that we impose in this country. We have \ncompliance reviews and inspections. We do it in a way that protects the \nAmerican interests.\n  What are the differences between our standards and the standards in \nMexico? We have had 6 years, and both countries have understood we have \ncome to this intersection, but nothing has been done. I wish my friend \nfrom Texas would have had the opportunity I had to sit 3 hours in a \nhearing on this subject and listen to the inspector general tell us \nwhat he found on the U.S.-Mexican border. We know, of course, the \nstandards are different.\n  In Mexico, there is no hours of service requirement. They can drive \n24 hours a day. One newspaper reporter drove with one guy for 1,800 \nmiles. In 3 days, the guy slept 7 hours. This is a truckdriver making \n$7 a day, sleeping 7 hours in 3 days, driving a truck that would not \npass inspection in this country. And we have some in this Senate who \nsay: Let's let that truck into this country, or at least let's let that \ntruck present itself to an inspection station.\n  The inspector general, by the way, says there will not be inspectors \nsufficient at those stations to inspect those vehicles as they come \ninto the United States. So to those who say our goal is to inspect all \nthese vehicles, I say simply look at the numbers. The fuzzy math that \nthe inspector general described for us between the budget requests and \nwhat actually is going to happen to these inspection stations, tell us \nthat those trucks are going to come into this country--and they have \nalready been doing it illegally in 26 States, incidentally, including \nthe State of North Dakota. We have had Mexican long-haul truckers \nviolating that 20-mile limit.\n\n[[Page S8333]]\n\n  My question is this: If you have radically different standards, and \nwe do--no hours of service requirement in Mexico; we do here for 10 \nhours. No logbooks in Mexico. Yes, they have a law, and they don't \ncarry them in their trucks; we have the requirement here. No alcohol \nand drug testing in Mexico; we have it here. Drivers' physical \nconsiderations, there is a requirement here, really none in Mexico.\n\n  The fact is, it is clear we have radically different standards. What \nwe are saying is, we ought not allow long-haul Mexican trucks into this \ncountry until we can guarantee to the American people that the trucks \nor the drivers are not going to pose a safety hazard to American \nfamilies driving on our roads.\n  This is all very simple. It is not raw. It is not rotten. It has \nnothing to do with protectionism. That is just total nonsense. This has \nto do with the question of when and how we will allow Mexican long-haul \ntrucks into this country.\n  What we are saying is, we will allow that to happen when, and if, we \nhave standards--both compliance and reviews and inspections--sufficient \nto tell us that the Mexican trucking industry is meeting the standards \nwe have imposed for over 50 to 75 years in this country in our trucking \nindustry and for our drivers.\n  We have had a lot of talk about a lot of things that have nothing to \ndo with the core of this issue. We are told that NAFTA requires us to \ndo this. No trade agreement--no trade agreement at any time, under any \ncircumstances--ever in this country has required us to sacrifice safety \non our highways. No trade agreement requires us to sacrifice safety \nwith respect to food inspection. No trade agreement requires us to do \nthat.\n  I have heard for 3 days now that the NAFTA trade agreement somehow \nrequires us to allow long-haul Mexican trucking beyond the 20-mile \nlimit. That is simply not the case.\n  In fact, the strangest argument by my friend from Texas was that if \nwe did not do this, the Mexicans say they are going to retaliate on \ncorn syrup. The Mexicans are already in violation of NAFTA in corn \nsyrup. A GATT panel already decided that. I think what we ought to do \nis protect the Murray language. She has done the right thing, and I \nhope, in the end, we will understand this is about safety for Americans \non American roads.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The managers' time has expired.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized for 4 minutes 2 seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, first of all, in regard to the allegation of my friend \nfrom North Dakota, and the description of the regulations and rules in \nthe country of Mexico, the fact is, in our substitute amendment it \ncalls for the inspection of every single truck that comes into the \nUnited States from Mexico.\n  There is a long list of all the requirements of licensing: Insurance, \ncommercial value, safety compliance decals, et cetera, et cetera--a \nlong and detailed set of requirements for Mexican trucks to enter the \nUnited States of America. The difference is, it does not have the same \ncumulative effect that the Murray amendment does, which violates the \nNorth American Free Trade Agreement.\n  I have always enjoyed these billboards that are brought up on the \nfloor that say: Does not violate NAFTA. Does not violate NAFTA. \nUnfortunately, for those who allege that, the Governments of the two \ncountries that are involved have judged that it does violate NAFTA.\n  Perhaps if the election last November had turned out differently, a \nGore administration might have viewed it not in violation of NAFTA. But \nhere is what the President of the United States says: ``Unless changes \nare made to the Senate bill, the President's senior advisers will \nrecommend that the President veto the bill.''\n  So everybody is entitled to their opinions. But if you are the \nPresident of the United States, you are the only one that is entitled \nto veto.\n  The Minister of Economics in Mexico:\n\n       We are very concerned after regarding the Murray amendment \n     and the Administration's position regarding it that the \n     legislative outcome may still constitute a violation of the \n     Agreement.\n  The elected Governments of the two countries say, indeed, this Murray \nlanguage is in violation of NAFTA. They are the ones who are elected by \ntheir people to make the determination, not individual Members of this \nbody.\n  Finally, as we wind up, I apologize for any inconvenience, any \ndiscomfort, any problems this extended debate has caused any of my \ncolleagues. I know many of them had plans and were discomfited. I \nextend my apologies.\n  I hasten to add, I have been involved in a number of major issues \nover the years I have been here. There has always been a willingness to \nnegotiate and work out problems. That was not the case on this issue. I \npledge, no matter what the outcome of this vote, I am still eager to \nsit down and work out what I view are differences that can be resolved \nand should be resolved between the Murray language and what we are \ntrying to do because I don't think we are that far apart.\n  Let's have men and women of good faith and goodwill sit down together \nafter this vote so that we can resolve the differences. No one wants a \nPresidential veto of this bill; I agree. There is a lot of pork I don't \nagree with, but there are also a lot of much-needed projects. We don't \nwant a Presidential veto. We have demonstrated that we have 34 votes \nand can easily sustain a Presidential veto.\n  After this vote, I again promise my colleague from Washington and my \ncolleague from Nevada, who have been here constantly, we want to \nnegotiate and work out our differences. I am convinced we can.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I want to further elaborate on the \ncomments I made just a moment ago. We made the motion to proceed to the \nAgriculture supplemental authorization bill because we could not get \nagreement to bring it up on Monday. As most of my colleagues know, this \nis a very important piece of legislation for just about every State in \nthe country. It has passed in the House. It is important to pass it \nbefore we leave, only because, as most of our colleagues probably \nalready know, if we are not able to utilize and commit these resources \nprior to the August recess, the Congressional Budget Office has \nindicated to us that they will not allow us the use of these resources \nprior to the end of the fiscal year. We will lose $5.5 billion for \nAgriculture if this legislation does not pass prior to the time we \nleave in August.\n  I emphasize I am not making any threats. I am not trying to cajole. I \nam just trying to state the fact that we need to get this legislation \ndone. This is not a partisan bill. The administration supports dealing \nwith Agriculture. On an overwhelming basis, it passed in the House. We \nneed to pass it in the Senate. I am very disappointed we are not \ngetting the cooperation to proceed to this bill because it is such an \nimportant issue. It is for that reason, and only for that reason, that \nI have delayed the cloture vote on the Transportation bill.\n  There will be a cloture vote on the Transportation appropriations \nbill at some point, perhaps early in the week. But, nonetheless, it \nwill happen. If we need to, we will run out the time to get to final \npassage and then vote on the bill. But I needed to get started on the \nAgriculture supplemental. And that is what the procedural motion that \nwe just entered into entails.\n  I appreciate my colleagues' attention.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I wonder if the majority leader will \nyield for a question.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am trying to understand what has happened. My \nunderstanding is that the majority leader is forced to file a cloture \nmotion not to get the bill up but on the motion to proceed to the bill \ndealing with an emergency appropriation for family farmers. My \nunderstanding is in the budget we reserved an amount of money that we \nall understood was necessary to try to help family farmers during a \npretty tough time. Prices have collapsed. Family farmers are \nstruggling. We all understood we were going to have to do an emergency \nappropriation to help them.\n  My understanding at the moment is that you are prevented not only \nfrom going to the bill but you are having to file a cloture motion on a \nmotion to proceed to go to the bill to try to provide emergency help \nfor family farmers.\n  Is that the circumstance we are in and, if so, who is forcing us to \ndo this?\n  I watched this week while for a couple of days nothing happened on \nthe floor. The appropriations subcommittee chair was here wanting \namendments to come, and no amendments came. It looked like the ultimate \nslow motion on the floor of the Senate. Now we are told--those of us \nwho come from farm country--that not only can we not get to the bill \nbut we have to file cloture on the motion to proceed for emergency help \nfor family farmers.\n  What on Earth is that about, and who is forcing us to do this?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, will the leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am forcing it as someone who has stood on this floor for \nthe last 4 years and fought for nearly $8 billion a year for family \nfarmers such as you have. We have stood arm in arm in that. But the \nbill that is coming to the floor is $2 billion over the budget that you \nhave talked about and that slot in the budget that we prepared.\n  I must tell you that this Senator is going to vote for emergency \nfunding for farmers in agriculture, but we are not going to go above a \nvery generous budget to do so.\n  I thought it was most important. Yes, the House has moved. I believe \nthe chairman of the authorizing committee is here, and he can speak for \nhimself.\n  But it is my understanding that this bill will come to the floor \nabout $2 billion ahead of where the House was. The House complied with \nthe budget resolution. We are rapping on that door of spending that \nsurplus in Medicare.\n  I don't care how you use the argument. The reality is very simple. \nThe majority leader is moving us--and he is right--to a very important \ndebate. But it was important for some of us who support farmers but \nalso support fiscal integrity and the budget to stand up and say, Mr. \nLeader, we are out of budget, we are out of line, and we are $2 billion \nbeyond where we ought to be. That is why I objected.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, if I could regain the floor, let me say \nthat I appreciate and respect the position of the Senator from Idaho. I \nam not sure that having this debate on the motion to proceed is the \nappropriate place to\n\n[[Page S8335]]\n\ndo it. It seems to me that it would be an appropriate subject for an \namendment to reduce the amount of emergency assistance from $7.49 \nbillion to $5.5 billion. To say, we don't need to spend $7.49 billion. \nWe could have that amendment and have a debate about it. But having a \nmotion to proceed and then having a debate and a filibuster, if that is \nrequired on the motion to proceed, just delays when we can actually get \ninto the discussion and debate about whether or not it ought to be \n$7.49, or $7.1 billion, or $5.2 billion. But we will finish this \nlegislation only because of the ramifications of not finishing it, \nwhether it is Monday, or Friday, or at some other time.\n  I put my colleagues on notice. I have no other recourse. This is not \na threat. It is simply a fact that this is a piece of must-pass \nlegislation. I hope people understand that.\n  I would be happy to yield to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, if the majority leader will yield for \none additional question, of course, the Senator from Idaho would have \nevery right to come to the floor and protest that the amount of help \nfor family farmers is too much, too generous, and this, that, or the \nother thing. The Senator has every right to do that. But I think that \nis different than trying to delay our ability to consider legislation \nthat responds to an emergency need for family farmers.\n  My question to the majority leader was not about how much money was \ninvolved. My question was who is delaying this and why. I urge my \nfriend from Idaho not to delay us. He has every right to come to the \nfloor of the Senate and try to cut it or try to reduce it if he thinks \nit is too much, but allow us to immediately go to this on Monday \nbecause it is an emergency appropriations bill.\n  We all understood earlier this year that we needed an emergency \nsupplemental. We provided the money for it. Now the Senator from Idaho \nhas a dispute about how much money is going to come to the floor. Allow \nthat bill to come to the floor and then offer an amendment. But don't \nforce the majority leader to file a cloture motion on the motion to \nproceed. Speaking as somebody who represents farm country--I know the \nSenator from Idaho does as well--delaying on the motion to proceed is \nthe worst way, in my judgment, to serve our family farm interests. All \nof us have the same interests.\n\n  I say to majority leader, I hope if there are disagreements about the \namount of aid that we will have a debate about it. But I certainly hope \nthat Members will allow us to get to this bill. It is an emergency \nappropriations supplemental bill designed to address an emergency. It \nill-serves those who we intend to help to have to file a cloture motion \non a motion to proceed to the actual bill.\n  Let's not do that. Let's get it to the floor and have at it on \nMonday, get it passed, and help family farmers.\n  I appreciate the majority leader yielding to me.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would be happy to yield to the distinguished chairman.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the leader for yielding.\n  I say to my friend from Idaho that we enjoyed his being on the \nAgriculture Committee for a number of years. I am sorry that he is not \nnow on the Agriculture Committee. Perhaps if my friend from Idaho were \non the Agriculture Committee and had been involved in our debate and \ndeliberations and the markup of the bill, he might not be holding this \nbill up because it was reported out on a unanimous voice vote. We only \nhad one amendment to take it down to $5.5 billion. That fell on a 12-9 \nvote.\n  Two things: There are farmers who are hurting all over this country--\nnot just in Iowa, or North Dakota, or Kansas but even in Idaho. Quite \nfrankly, this Senator went out of his way to accommodate the wishes of \nSenators in this Chamber representing family farmers in their States to \nput into that bill what was necessary to meet some of those needs.\n  In fact, I say to my friend from Idaho, there are provisions in the \nbill that will help his farmers in Idaho that are not in the bill they \npassed in the House.\n  Second, I say to my friend from Idaho that the budget that was passed \nhere allows in the 2001 fiscal year for the Agriculture Committee to \nspend up to $5.5 billion. It allows the Agriculture Committee to spend \nfor the year 2002 $7.35 billion. The Agriculture Committee in the bill \nwe are trying to consider here adheres to those limits. It is \nabsolutely within the budget. The $5.1 billion goes out before \nSeptember 3.\n  The Agriculture Committee recognized that the crop-year and the \nfiscal year don't coincide. The needs that farmers will have this fall \nas a result of the crop-year happen in the 2002 fiscal year. I think a \nlot of us thought that we could under the budget go into that $7.35 \nbillion in 2002 and spend it in 2002. None of that $2 billion is spent \nin 2001; it is spent in 2002. That is allowed by the budget. We could \nhave gone up to $7.35 billion, but we didn't. We wanted to hold some in \nreserve. By taking that $2 billion, we are able after the first of the \nfiscal year, October 1, we are able to have help for farmers until we \nget a farm bill passed or until we are able to perhaps come again some \nother time and expend the rest of the $7.35 billion.\n\n  I say to my friend from Idaho, this is within the budget the $5.5 \nbillion we spend this year before September 30; the other $2 billion is \nspent in 2002, and there is nothing in the budget that prohibits the \nAgriculture Committee from saying in 2001 how we want that money spent \nin 2002. We have met all the requirements. There will be no budget \npoint of order because we are well within the budget. I point that out \nto my friend from Idaho. He is no longer a member of the committee. I \nknow that. I am sorry he is not. Maybe had the Senator been there he \nwould have realized and recognized how we went about this and how we \nare not busting the budget in 2001.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield to the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank my colleagues for all of those considerations and \nI wish I did serve on the authorizing committee of agriculture. I serve \non the appropriating subcommittee for agriculture, the appropriations, \nso I watch Agriculture budgets closely.\n  What the Senator from Iowa said is absolutely right. It is forward-\nfunding; it is reaching into 2002 and pulling money out for 2001. I \nunderstand that. I know it will be spent in 2002 in a 2001 \nsupplemental. I understand what is being done. I also understand that \nis not necessarily the way it is done. But it is OK if you can get the \nvotes on the floor to do it. It is not necessarily how we work budgets \naround here.\n  I will also say, whether I am holding this up or not, we will be on \nthe Agriculture bill come Monday, and Monday evening you will get \ncloture and we will be there and probably move it quite quickly, \ndepending on the amendments that come. The leaders know this. There are \nseveral amendments that may be very protracted in their debate.\n  The reality is, last year somebody made us file cloture on the \nAgriculture appropriations conference report. I don't believe that was \ntalked about in such dramatic terms, but that is exactly what happened \nlast year. I have it in front of me, Agriculture appropriations, 106th \nCongress. After all the work was done, the bill was ready to be sent to \nthe President and be signed so the money could go out and somebody had \nto file cloture to move the bill.\n  I don't know that this is so unprecedented. Thou doth protest a bit \ntoo much.\n  We will be on the Agriculture bill come Monday. I do appreciate the \nwork the Senator has done. He has worked thoroughly.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would like to try to summarize where we are and see if \nmy leader, the majority leader, can confirm if this is accurate.\n  I think the word of the day is ``delay.'' We are seeing an \nAgriculture bill, an emergency bill, being delayed. We are not going to \nbe on it. We are going to have to debate a motion to proceed. For those \npeople who don't know the rules of the Senate, you can invoke these \nrules and it can go slow. We are seeing a delay in getting help to our \nfarmers; and we are seeing anything but a delay in the day we will have \nthe Mexican trucks come barreling through our highways and byways when \nwe should delay that until\n\n[[Page S8336]]\n\nwe have enough inspectors. We are only inspecting 2 percent of the \ntrucks, and out of that 2 percent, 35 percent of the trucks are failing \nand a lot of them have no brakes.\n\n  I will not reiterate the horror stories and nightmares we heard in \nthe committee.\n  Where we have a delay, we don't want a delay; that is, to help our \nAmerican farmers. And where the other side is trying to do away with \nthe delay is the day that we have trucks coming through our border into \nthe interior of our country that are ill-equipped for those journeys.\n  I wonder if my leader would agree that is where we are right now.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator has described it very well. We have spent a \nweek delaying completion of our work on the Transportation \nappropriations bill, fundamental investments in our Nation's \ninfrastructure. Why have we done that? Because there are those who are \nopposed to the regulatory commitment that we want to make for truck \nsafety in this country. They are willing to sacrifice public investment \nin our Nation's infrastructure not for days but for weeks because they \ndon't think we ought to support a rigorous inspection and a rigorous \nstandard of quality with regard to safety on our Nation's highways.\n  That is what this debate has been about now for several days. I am \ndisappointed that only because of absentee Senators we lost the cloture \nvote tonight, but we will win that vote and inevitably we will win on \nthe final passage of the Transportation bill. This has been nothing \nmore than delay. This delay has been unnecessary, unproductive, and \nvery unfortunate.\n  The Senator from California could not have said it better. She is \nright. There will be another day. We will deal with these issues. I \nwill say, as I said a moment ago, there are some things we must do \nbefore we leave. We have no choice. So we can delay now and we will \ncompound the problems and the circumstances involving our departure \nlater.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the majority leader in the form of a question, we \ndon't have nearly as many farmers--we call them ranchers--in the State \nof Nevada, but we have some. They have benefits from this Agriculture \nbill--not as much as we think they should.\n  I say to the leader, farmers all over America are not concerned about \nthe partisan politics. There are Democrat farmers and Republican \nfarmers. Isn't that right?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. The American public wants us to accomplish results. The \nfact that you have been a leader for a short period of time should not \nmean we cannot move forward with the legislation. Is that fair?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would say that is fair.\n  Mr. REID. We had the Senator from North Dakota, the Senator from \nCalifornia, the Senator from South Dakota, huge producers of food and \nfiber for this country. I know how important it is for your respective \nStates that we move forward on this Agriculture supplemental.\n  I say to the leader, if I had been in my office I would have taken \nmore calls, but I have been here most of the time, and I have had many, \nmany calls from people interested in the high-tech industry, people on \nthe cutting edge of what is going on in America today with computers. \nThey want to be competitive. They think they are unable to be \ncompetitive because we cannot move forward on the Export Administration \nAct. There are Democrat and Republican farmers. There are also Democrat \nand Republican people involved in this high-tech industry. They don't \ncare who gets credit for it.\n\n  Would the leader agree if we can move forward on the Agriculture \nsupplemental and the Export Administration Act, there will be lots of \ncredit to go around for Democrats and Republicans, and it would help \nthis country?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is absolutely right. The Senator has spent a \ngood deal of time on this floor over not only of the past few months \nbut of the past few years trying to pass the Export Administration Act. \nHe ran into the same problems last year that we confront this year. \nThere are those who are unwilling to consider the tremendous, negative \nrepercussions that this country will continue to experience as a result \nof our inability to update the Export Administration Act now.\n  Further delay, and it expires. I might add, it expires in August. \nFurther delay further undermines our ability to be competitive abroad. \nI don't know why anyone would want to be in a position to put this \ncountry into that kind of a situation, but because of objections on the \nother side, we have so far been unable to move the bill.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. As the majority leader well knows, I am new to this \nbody and I think what we have just seen raises, in my mind, serious \nquestions about what it is we are trying to accomplish for the people \nof our States and our country.\n  As I understand the response of the distinguished Senator from Idaho, \nthe delay is because somebody ``unnamed'' delayed something last year. \nThat, to me, is a strikingly inadequate explanation for a delay that is \nholding up our efforts to help our oldest industry and our newest \nindustry.\n  With the fact that New York's largest economic sector is agriculture, \nwhich most people outside New York would have no idea of, I have a \ngreat interest in the Agriculture supplemental bill because we have \nsome aid in there for farmers who are following in the tradition of \nthose having farmed in New York for more than 400 years. Our apple \nfarmers are on the brink of extinction if they do not get some \nemergency help. We had hail last year that destroyed the crop in the \nMid-Hudson River Valley; it took out orchards in the north country. So \nthis is not any geographic issue. This is a national issue that has to \nbe addressed.\n  At the same time, in New York, we have some of the cutting edge high-\ntech industries that are begging for the kind of direction the Export \nAdministration Act will give them, the certainty about what they can \nand cannot export, whether we can be competitive globally. Both of \nthese important pieces of legislation have to be addressed in the next \nweek.\n  It is regrettable that instead of doing the people's business, \ndealing with the agricultural needs and the high-tech needs that really \ncut across every geographic and political line we have in our Nation, \nwe see this kind of delay.\n  But I would ask the majority leader, is it your intention to do \neverything you can possibly do, as our leader, who has done, in my \nview, an absolutely tremendous job since assuming the leadership, to \nmake sure that the people's needs are met? And that includes the \nAgriculture bill and the Export Administration bill.\n  Speaking just as one Senator, I do not think there is anything more \nimportant than doing the work we were sent here to do, casting the \nvotes that will help people, and it is striking that we do not seem to \nhave the cooperation we need on the other side.\n  But I would ask the leader if it is his intention to make sure that \nwe do the people's business before we leave for the recess that is \nscheduled.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator may be new here, but she certainly \nunderstands how this institution must work. It can only work with \ncooperation. As she has so rightfully indicated, the situation today is \nthat on issues of great importance, as she said, to our oldest and our \nnewest industries, there is no question that we cannot put any higher \nof a priority on the work that must be done in the next week than to \naddress both of these bills.\n  The agricultural supplemental package represents, for many of our \nprogram crop farmers, a significant portion of the income they will \nreceive in this calendar year. A large portion of the income they are \ndepending upon rides on whether or not we get this bill done in the \ncoming week. I do not know what percent some of our high-tech companies \nrelate to the ability to export abroad, but I would not be surprised if \nit were not just as great.\n  So she is absolutely right. We cannot leave without addressing these \ncritical pieces of legislation. Why? Because they expire. The \nauthorization literally expires during the month of August. So we can \ndo it Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or we can work into the weekend, or \nthe following week, but we really\n\n[[Page S8337]]\n\nhave to understand that these are critical bills that must be \naddressed. And the only way we can address them, as she correctly \npoints out, is through the cooperative effort of both parties, and I \nwould hope both leaders.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the leader yield just for one more brief question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. There have been comments the last several days about what \nhas happened in the last year. I want the Record to be spread with the \nfact--I want this confirmed by the leader--one of the assignments you \ngave me as assistant leader was that when difficult matters arose on \nthe floor, one of my assignments directly from our leader--Tom Daschle \nto Harry Reid--was to do what you can, Harry Reid, to help move \nlegislation. If it benefited the Republicans, I still had that \nresponsibility. And there are many statements in the Record by Senator \nLott of how he appreciated the work we did--my name was mentioned on \noccasion--to move legislation.\n  I did that because you believed it was the right thing to do to move \nlegislation. That is why we were able to move eight appropriations \nbills last year--does the Senator remember that--before the August \nrecess?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I remember that vividly. I remember how it was that we \nwere able to work through these important matters, because we \nunderstood that October 1st is the deadline to complete all of our work \non appropriations and that when you fall short of that deadline, you \nfind yourself in a very precarious situation, making decisions without \ncareful thought and, in some cases, making mistakes.\n  We want to complete our work on time. We want to be able to finish \nthese bills. I appreciate so much the cooperation, the effort, and the \nleadership shown by the Senator from Nevada in reaching that goal.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator from South Dakota, our distinguished \nmajority leader, agree that when you were the minority leader, one of \nyour primary responsibilities was to move legislation, no matter \nwhether it was sponsored by a Democrat or a Republican, but to move \nlegislation off this floor?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. By and large, that was exactly what we attempted to do. \nObviously, there were many times when there were disagreements, but we \ntried to work through those disagreements. I am hopeful we can do so \nagain in the coming week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I will return the floor to the Senator in just one brief \nminute. I just want to say that I think no one knows more than I do how \npassionately this majority leader, the then-minority leader, worked \nwith us to get legislation passed. That is why I repeat, eight \nappropriations bills were passed in this body last year before the \nAugust recess. That was hard work. It only came as a result of the \ndirection of the majority leader saying, we have to get this stuff \ndone, that is the responsible thing for this country; and we did it.\n  I know there are people who come in and make little snippets about \nthe fact that things have happened in the past. Look at our record. \nLook at our record of how we helped move legislation. Of course, there \nwere disagreements on our side, but they passed quickly. Lots of \namendments were filed on bills. We worked through those.\n  I just say, I hope people will look at what we did and work with us \nto try to move legislation. We want to do that. If we do something that \nis good, there is credit for everyone to go around. If we do not do \nthings, there is blame to go around, as well it should. But the blame \nnow should be with the minority because they simply have not allowed us \nto proceed on important legislation for this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/27/senate-section/article/S8337-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON.

Madam President, I rise today to bring to my colleague's \nattention a terribly distressing, and I am afraid, all too familiar \nsituation; the arrest and detention of American citizens and permanent \nresidents traveling in China. I specifically want to comment on the \ncase of Mr. Liu Yaping. Mr. Liu is a resident of my home State of \nConnecticut and is married to a United States citizen. He has an \nAmerican son and has been granted permanent residency in this country. \nNevertheless, on a trip to his home country of China this past spring, \nhe was abruptly detained and arrested on charges of tax evasion. More \nthan four months after his initial arrest, the evidence against him for \nthis alleged crime has yet to be produced by the Chinese authorities, \nand he has not been officially charged with a crime. In the meantime, \nhe is being detained indefinitely.\n  Liu Yaping has been held in near isolation in Inner Mongolia, and we \nsuspect that he may have been mistreated during his time in prison. He \nhas been unable to contact his family, and because he is a permanent \nresident of the U.S., and not a citizen, he has been denied the right \nto consult with United States diplomats while in detention. He has been \ngranted only very limited access to his attorneys, and has been unable \nto answer the charges against him.\n  The most troubling part of this story is that we have learned that \nMr. Liu is ill and may die at any moment. It has been reported that he \nis suffering from a cerebral aneurysm, possibly caused by torture or \nbeatings, for which he has gone largely untreated. Without immediate \nand appropriate medical attention, the aneurysm will continue to leak, \nand the danger is very real that he will die. His family has asked to \nreview his medical records, but thus far this request has been denied. \nInstead, they receive only bills for medical services performed, \nwithout documentation or description. Mr. Liu's family has asked that \nhe be transferred to a hospital in Beijing, but this request has been \nrejected by the Chinese government.\n  I cannot begin to imagine the toll that this ordeal has taken on Mr. \nLiu's wife, and 15 year-old son. Knowing their loved one is alone and \nin danger, they wait anxiously for any notice from the Chinese \nauthorities indicating that his situation has improved. Mrs. Liu has \nbeen in steady contact with my office and grows increasingly distraught \nwith each day that passes with no news of her husband. The U.S. embassy \nin China, despite their best efforts, has not been able to make inroads \nin this case, and due to Mr. Liu's grave medical condition, time has \nbecome an important factor when considering his case.\n  We cannot allow gross human rights violations to continue on our \nwatch. It is the responsibility of all of us to ensure that our \ncitizens and permanent residents receive just and equal treatment at \nhome and abroad.\n  As my colleagues know, in the past year, several American citizens \nand permanent residents have been detained in China. Gao Zhan, an \nAmerican University researcher, was sentenced to 10 years on July 24, \nafter a\n\n[[Page S8338]]\n\nlengthy detention and a brief trial, during which not a single witness \nwas called. She was arrested on espionage charges and linked to \nrecently convicted business Professor Li Shaomin, who was recently \nordered deported. Mrs. Gao was recently granted medical parole, due to \na worsening heart condition and, as a precedent exists for this type of \nparole, it is my hope that Mr. Liu will be granted a similar clemency. \nUntil such time, though, we must do all we can to fight for the safety, \nbasic human rights, and release of Mr. Liu.\n  As you may know, the Senate has not stayed quiet on this matter. \nAlong with several of my colleagues, I have signed on as a cosponsor to \nSenate Resolution 128, urging the release of Liu Yaping and other \nAmerican permanent residents and U.S. citizens. However, despite the \nefforts of Congress, I believe that this is an issue best dealt with at \nhigher diplomatic levels. As you know, this Saturday, Colin Powell will \nbe arriving in China. Secretary Powell has expressed his frustration \nwith the situation of Mr. Liu, and I hope that he will raise the issue \nof Liu Yaping's incarceration with the Chinese authorities. Although \nthe Chinese government has indicated that it wishes to focus on the \nlarger issues of trade and economic cooperation between our two \ncountries, I feel that a frank discussion on human rights is an equal \npriority. I hope that such a discussion would lead to a better \nunderstanding of American concerns in this case specifically, and the \neventual release of all prisoners wrongfully detained in China.\n  I feel strongly that the Chinese government must understand that \ndetaining our citizens without due process will only exacerbate the \ndiplomatic tensions between our two nations. By creating a climate of \nfear for those Chinese-American citizens who would otherwise seek to \nbring their expertise and knowledge back to their homeland, China is \ndiscouraging the flow of intellectual capital back into its \ncountryside, and compromising any confidence on the part of the United \nStates regarding pledged improvements in human rights.\n  I wish Secretary Powell well on his trip, and urge the Chinese \ngovernment to release Mr. Liu. I have asked Secretary Powell to bring \nthis case up specifically while in China. It is my sincere hope that \nthis action will bear fruit, and this matter will soon be resolved. \nHopefully, Mr. Liu will soon be at home again in Connecticut, safe, and \nin the company and care of his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/27/senate-section/article/S8338-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8338-S8339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MURDERS CANNOT GO UNPUNISHED\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, the murder of American citizens \nabroad is always a cause for concern, and I want to bring the attention \nof my colleagues to the killings of the Bytyqi brothers from New York \nCity. Agron, Mehmet, and Yli were reportedly discovered in a mass grave \nin Petrovo Selo, Serbia with their hands bound and gunshots wounds to \ntheir chests.\n  This heinous crime should be of particular concern to all of us. Not \nonly were the Bytyqi brothers American citizens, but they were also of \nAlbanian origin. We know well the brutal treatment of Albanians in \nKosova and Serbia during the war. My heart goes out to all the victims \nand their families.\n  I recently wrote to Attorney General John Ashcroft asking for the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation to become involved in this case. Human \nrights workers and investigators, including from the United Nations, \nshould assist in delivering justice to the Bytyqi family.\n  There are reports that the brothers were murdered by policemen. I \nknow my colleagues will agree that the murder of Americans overseas \ncannot go unpunished. I will continue to closely follow developments in \nthis case--as well as the continued detention of political prisoners in \nSerbian jails.\n  I ask that an article from the July 15th edition of the Washington \nPost detailing this crime appear in the Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 15, 2001]\n\n            Three Americans Found in Serbian Mass Grave Site\n\n                  (By R. Jeffrey Smith and Peter Fin)\n\n       Pristina, Yugoslavia, July 14--The three young American men \n     had their hands tied with wire. Their heads were covered by \n     black hoods, and they were dressed in civilian clothes. They \n     were each shot at close range, and their bodies were dumped \n     in a pit dug in the Yugoslav national forest near the Serbian \n     town of Petrovo Selo.\n       The men--all brothers of ethnic Albanian origin--had worked \n     with their father as painters and made pizzas on Long Island \n     before going to fight in the Kosovo war with the so-called \n     Atlantic Brigade, a group of about 400 Albanian Americans who \n     volunteered to join the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. But \n     they disappeared into a Serbian prison 17 days after the end \n     of NATO's bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999, when \n     hostilities had ceased.\n       For nearly two years, neither their family nor the U.S. \n     government was able to learn their whereabouts. Then, last \n     week, their bodies were discovered in a mass grave by Serbian \n     police investigators. Together with officials of a Belgrade-\n     based human rights group, the police have begun to assemble a \n     picture of how the men, born in Illinois, lost their lives \n     during the violence that raged in and around the Serbian \n     province of Kosovo in the spring and summer of 1999.\n       Serbian officials and others monitoring the probe say the \n     three--Ylli, Agron and Mehmet Bytyqi, ethnic Albanians ages \n     24, 23 and 21 at the time of their death--appear to have been \n     murdered by policemen. Their bodies were placed in the grave \n     with 13 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, not far from a special \n     police training center 120 miles east of the capital of \n     Belgrade. A second grave nearby contains 59 bodies, and \n     investigators suspect they will find many other sites as they \n     begin to probe the forest more carefully.\n       The Bytyqis are the first Americans to turn up in a Serbian \n     mass grave. ``Believe me, this is going to be a very \n     important case for us,'' the U.S. chief of mission in \n     Yugoslavia, William Montgomery, said in a telephone \n     interview. ``We need to get real information from the \n     Yugoslav authorities. We are going to insist they do a full \n     investigation.''\n       Montgomery said he and other U.S. officials had sought \n     information about the Bytyqis from the Yugoslav Foreign \n     Ministry several times since Yugoslav President Slobodan \n     Milosevic was ousted in October, but the ministry \n     acknowledged only that the brothers had been imprisoned after \n     the war ended.\n       Circumstantial evidence unearthed so far raises the \n     possibility of a revenge slaying by policemen, possibly \n     motivated by anger over the leading role that the United \n     States played in pressing for Western intervention in Kosovo \n     to halt human rights abuses committed by Yugoslav security \n     forces against Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority.\n       ``They were killed because they were American citizens,'' \n     said Bajram Krasniqi, a lawyer in Pristina, Kosovo's \n     provincial capital, retained by the Bytyqi family to press \n     for information about the case. ``There were people in that \n     prison who were in [the rebel army] . . . and they were \n     eventually released. This is the only case where someone was \n     arrested, taken to court, tried, released out of the prison \n     and then executed.\n       ``This crime was planned, ordered and conducted without any \n     judicial act and it was done by Serbian officials in \n     cooperation with officials at the prison,'' Krasniqi said. \n     ``Hopefully, the Serb authorities will now arrest these \n     people and they will be brought to justice.''\n       The men's mother, Bahrije Bytyqi, and their father, Ahmet \n     Bytyqi, had moved their family from Illinois to Kosovo in \n     1979 and later separated. Ahmet moved to New York and Ylli, \n     Agron and Mehmet joined him one at a time when each turned \n     age 17.\n       Bahrije was expelled from Kosovo during the war by security \n     forces but later returned to the southern Kosovo city of \n     Prizren. She has been distraught and sedated since learning \n     last week of the discovery of her sons' bodies in Serbia, and \n     could not be interviewed today. When her 22-year old son, \n     Fatos, a resident of Prizren, was interviewed today, he \n     initially lied about his brothers' wartime activities, later \n     explaining he had been ``advised'' not to discuss their \n     membership in the Atlantic Brigade.\n       But members of the brigade interviewed in New York said \n     that the brothers had been enthusiastic--if naive--volunteers \n     in the unit. They had different personalities: Ylli was \n     quiet, Agron an outgoing partier, Mehmet a hard worker. But \n     all three left New York on the brigade's charter flight in \n     the spring of 1999 and tried to join the same rebel unit--\n     only to be told by rebel leaders that they had to fight \n     separately.\n       ``They had that youthfulness that exploded in their \n     faces,'' said fellow rebel Arber Muriqui in New York.\n       In mid-June 1999, when NATO forces deployed inside Kosovo \n     to police a cease-fire, the brothers escorted their mother \n     back into the province. Roughly two weeks later, the brothers \n     told Fatos they were going to Pristina. Their mission, he \n     said, was to visit some ethnic Albanian friends from New York \n     who had fought with the Atlantic Brigade.\n       Amid the postwar chaos--and seething tensions between \n     ethnic Serbs and Albanians--they headed north in a Volkswagen \n     Golf on June 26. An ethnic Roma neighbor of Bahrije's, \n     Miroslav Mitrovic, has told the Belgrade-based Humanitarian \n     Law Center, an independent group, that the three brothers \n     offered him and two other Romas a ride out of Prizren and \n     into southern Serbia, but Fatos says the brothers never \n     mentioned the plan and he cannot confirm the tale.\n\n[[Page S8339]]\n\n       There is a dispute between Fatos and Mitrovic over why the \n     brothers did not have their U.S. passports with them on the \n     journey; in any event, Fatos and the family lawyer say, the \n     brothers carried other identification that clearly indicated \n     they were American residents, including New York state \n     driver's licenses. Around their necks, he said, were \n     medallions bearing the seal of the Kosovo Liberation Army.\n       The brothers were detained at a Serbian checkpoint in the \n     village of Merdare; the Romas were allowed to proceed, \n     Mitrovic told the law center. A magistrate in the nearby town \n     of Kursumlija sentenced them to at least 15 days in jail for \n     illegally crossing the border between Serbia and Kosovo, a \n     Serbian province. The next day--June 27--they were \n     transferred to a prison in Prokuplje, in southern Serbia.\n       There, according to documents and testimony obtained by the \n     law center, the three brothers were interviewed by a police \n     inspector named Zoran Stakovic, whose specialty was cases \n     involving foreign citizens. Four days before the end of their \n     sentence. Stankovic came to the prison and told the warden to \n     release them into his custody, the law center said it had \n     learned.\n       Fatos said he was told by a prison official, whom the \n     family bribed for information four months ago, that the three \n     brothers were taken to the back door of the prison and handed \n     over to two plainclothes police in the company of the \n     uniformed patrolmen. They were driven away in the company of \n     the uniformed patrolmen. They were driven away in a white car \n     and never seen alive again.\n       Their family became so desperate that at one point they \n     persuaded their lawyer, Krasniqui, to write a letter to \n     Miloservic, pleading for information about her sons; their \n     mother also went to the prison in Serbia to demand answers. \n     ``They were very hopeful that the boys would return because \n     once they were in prison, Serb authorities would be aware \n     that they are American citizens,'' and Marin Vulaj, vice \n     chairman of the National Albanian American Council.\n       The law center made inquiries in August, September and \n     October 1999, after Mitrovic contacted the center to express \n     his own concern, but only received a copy of the brothers' \n     prison release order.\n       ``I was hoping they were alive,'' Fatos said. ``We were \n     very shocked. We had no idea how they could have gotten'' to \n     the mass grave site in Petrovo Selo. In a statement issued on \n     Saturday, the law center demanded that the Serbian government \n     ``tell the mother the truth.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/27/senate-section/article/S8339-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8339-S8341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE PACE OF JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I was pleased that the Judiciary \nCommittee was able to hold another confirmation hearing for judicial \nand executive branch nominees this week. Since the Senate was allowed \nto reorganize just before the July 4th recess, returned from that \nrecess to reconvene on July 9 and then assigned members to committees \non July 10, this was the fourth hearings on Presidential nominations \nthat the Judiciary Committee has held in 2 weeks. I cannot remember any \ntime in the last 6 years when the Judiciary Committee held four \nconfirmation hearings in 2 weeks. Two of those hearings involved \njudicial nominees to the Courts of Appeals.\n  I appreciated that when Senators Lott, Baucus, Cochran, and \nHutchinson appeared before the Judiciary Committee to introduce \nnominees, they recognized that we were acting quickly. Likewise, the \nnominees who have appeared before the committee have recognized that we \nhave been moving expeditiously and have thanked us for doing so. I \nappreciate their recognition of our efforts and their kind words.\n  Just last Friday we were able to confirm a number of judicial and \nexecutive nominations. We confirmed Judge Roger Gregory for a lifetime \nappointment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. This \nis a nominee who had waited in vain since June of last year for the \nSenate to act on his nomination. In the year that followed his \nnomination he was unable even to get a hearing from the Republican \nmajority. This month, in less than 2 weeks the Judiciary Committee held \nthat hearing, reported his nomination favorably to the Senate on a 19 \nto 0 vote and the Senate voted to confirm him by a vote of 93 to 1 \nvote. The supposed controversy some contend surrounded this nomination \nwas either nonexistent or quickly dissipated.\n  In spite of the progress we have been making during the few weeks \nsince the Senate was allowed to reorganize, in spite of the \nconfirmation on Friday of three judicial nominations, include one to a \nCourt of Appeals; in spite of the confirmation of two more Assistant \nAttorneys General for the Department of Justice, including the \nAssistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Rights Division; in \nspite of the back-to-back days of hearings for the President's nominees \nto head the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service on Tuesday and Wednesday of last week; despite \nour noticing a hearing for another Court of Appeals nominee and another \nAssistant Attorney General for this Tuesday; despite our having noticed \nexpedited hearings on the nomination to be Director of the Federal \nBureau of Investigation beginning next Monday; despite all these \nefforts and all this action, on Monday our Republican colleagues took \nto the Senate floor to change the tone of Senate debate on nominations \ninto a bitterly partisan one. That was most unfortunate.\n  I regret that we lost the month of June to Republican objections to \nreorganization or we might have been able to make more progress more \nquickly. There was no secret about the impact of that delay at the \ntime. Unfortunately, that month is gone and we have to do the best that \nwe can do with the time remaining to us this year. This month the \nJudiciary Committee is holding hearings on the nominees to head the \nFBI, DEA and INS. In addition, we have held hearings on two more \nAssistant Attorneys General and the Director of the National Institute \nof Justice.\n  Just last Friday we were able to confirm Ralph Boyd, Jr. to serve as \nthe Assistant Attorney General to head the Civil Rights Division. Of \ncourse, the Republican majority never accorded his predecessor in that \npost, Bill Lann Lee, a Senate vote on his nomination in the 3 years \nthat it was pending toward the end of the Clinton administration. Some \nof those now so publicly critical of the manner in which we are \nexpediting consideration of President Bush's nominations to executive \nbranch positions seem to have forgotten the types of unending delays \nthat they so recently employed when they were in the majority and \nPresident Clinton was urging action on his executive branch \nnominations.\n  I noted last Friday that we have already acted to confirm six \nAssistant Attorneys General as well as the Deputy Attorney General, the \nSolicitor General and, of course, the Attorney General himself.\n  We have yet to receive a number of nominations including one for the \nNo. 3 job at the Department of Justice, the Associate Attorney General. \nWe have yet to receive the nomination of someone to head the U.S. \nMarshals Service. Even more disturbing, we have yet to receive a single \nnomination for any of the 94 U.S. Marshals who serve in districts \nwithin our States. We have yet to receive the first nomination for any \nof the 93 U.S. Attorneys who serve in districts within our States.\n  We have much work to do. The President has work to do. The Senate has \nwork to do. That work is aided by our working together, not by the \ninjecting the type of partisanship shown over the last 6 years when the \nRepublican majority delayed action on Presidential nominees or the \npartisan rhetoric that was cast about on Monday. That may make for \nbackslapping at Republican fundraisers, but it is counterproductive to \nthe bipartisan work of the Senate.\n  In this regard, I am also extremely disappointed by the decision of \nthe Republican Leadership to have all Republican Senators refuse to \nchair the Senate. I was one who suggested to Senator Daschle, Senator \nLott and others that we resume the practice of having Senators from all \nparties chair the Senate. That was a longstanding practice in the \nSenate and the practice when I first joined this body. It was our \npractice until fairly recently when a breach in Senate protocol led to \nthe period in which only Senators from the majority party sat in the \nchair of the President of the Senate.\n  I thought that it sharing the chair was one of the better \nimprovements we made earlier this year when we were seeking to find \nways to lower the partisan decibel level and restore collegiality to \nthe Senate. It was a good way to help restore some civility to the \nSenate, to share the authority and responsibility that comes with being \na member of the Senate. I deeply regret that the Republican minority \nhas chosen no longer to participate in this aspect of the Senate. I am \ndisappointed, and fear this is another sign\n\n[[Page S8340]]\n\nthat they are coming to view the Senate through the narrow lens of \npartisanship.\n\n  That partisan perspective, criticizing for criticism's sake or short-\nterm political advantage, seems to be the motivation for the statements \nmade in the wake of our achievements last Friday. If the Senate \nmajority is going to be criticized when we make extraordinary efforts \nof the kind we have been making over the last two weeks, some will be \nforced to wonder whether such action is worth the effort.\n  Moreover, the criticism is ignorant not only of recent facts but \nwholly unappreciative of the historical context in which we are \nworking. Let me mention just a few of the many benchmarks that show how \nfair the Senate majority is being.\n  This year has been disrupted by two shifts in the majority. We were \ndelayed until March in working out the first resolutions organizing the \nSenate and its committees. Senator Daschle deserves great credit for \nhis patience and for working out the unique arrangements that governed \nduring the period the Senate was divided on a 50-50 basis. Likewise, I \ncomplimented Senator Lott for his efforts in late February and early \nMarch to resolve the impasse.\n  In late May and early June the Senate had the opportunity to arrange \na timely transition to a new majority. Republican objections squandered \nthat opportunity and we endured a month-long delay in reorganizing the \nSenate. Ultimately, the reorganization ended up being what could have \nbeen adopted on June 6. Again, I commend Senator Daschle's leadership \nand patience in keeping the Senate on course, productive and working. \nDuring that month the Senate considered and passed the bipartisan \nKennedy-McCain-Edwards Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  But work in the Judiciary Committee was limited to investigative \nhearings. We could not hold business meetings or fairly proceed to \nconsider nominations. That period finally drew to a close beginning on \nJune 29 and culminated on July 10 when Republican objections finally \nsubsided, a resolution reorganizing the Senate was considered and \nCommittee assignments were made.\n  Now consider the progress we have made on judicial nominations in \nthat context. There were no hearings on judicial nominations and no \njudges confirmed in the first half of the year with a Republican \nmajority. The first hearing I chaired on July 11 was one more than all \nthe hearings that had been held involving judges in the first half of \nthe year. The first judicial nomination who the Senate confirmed last \nFriday was more than all the judges confirmed in the first half of the \nyear.\n  In the entire first year of the first Bush administration, 1989, \nwithout all the disruptions, distractions and shifts of Senate majority \nthat we have experienced this year, only five Court of Appeals judges \nwere confirmed. In the first year of the Clinton administration, 1993, \nwithout all the disruptions, distractions and shifts in Senate majority \nthat we have experienced this year, only three Court of Appeals judges \nwere confirmed all year. In less than 1 month this year--in the 2 weeks \nsince the committee assignments were made on July 10, we have held \nhearings on two nominees to the Courts of Appeals and confirmed one. In \n1993, the first Court of Appeals nominee to be confirmed was not until \nSeptember 30. During recent years under a Republican Senate majority, \nthere were no Court of Appeals nominees confirmed at any time during \nthe entire 1996 session, not one. In 1997, the first Court of Appeals \nnominee was not confirmed until September 26. A fair assessment of the \ncircumstances of this year would suggest that the confirmation of a \nCourt of Appeals nominee this early in the year and the confirmation of \neven a few Court of Appeals judges in this shortened time frame of only \na few weeks in session should be commended, not criticized.\n  The Judiciary Committee held two hearings on two Court of Appeals \nnominees this month. In July 1995, the Republican chairman held one \nhearing with one Court of Appeals nominee. In July 1996, the Republican \nchairman held one hearing with one Court of Appeals nominee, who was \nconfirmed in 1996. In July 1997, the Republican chairman held one \nhearing with one Court of Appeals nominee. In 1998, the Republican \nchairman did hold two hearings with two Court of Appeals nominees, but \nneither of whom was confirmed in 1998. In July 2000, the Republican \nchairman did not hold a single hearing with a Court of Appeals nominee. \nDuring the more than 6 years in which the Senate Republican majority \nscheduled confirmation hearings, there were 34 months with no hearing \nat all, 30 months with only one hearing and only 12 times in almost \n6\\1/2\\ years did the Judiciary Committee hold as many as two hearings \ninvolving judicial nominations in a month. So even looking at this \nmonth in isolation, without acknowledging the difficulties we had to \novercome, our productivity compares most favorably with the last 6 \nyears. When William Riley, the nominee included in the hearing this \nweek is confirmed as a Court of Appeals Judge for the Eighth Circuit, \nwe will have exceeded the Committee's record in 5 of the last 6 years. \nGiven these efforts and achievements, the Republican criticism rings \nhollow.\n  I also observe that the criticism that our multiple hearings are \nproceeding with one Court of Appeals nominee ignores that has been a \nstandard practice by the committee for at least decades. Last year the \nRepublican majority held only eight hearings all year and only five \nincluded even one Court of Appeals nominee. Of those five nominees only \nthree were reported to the Senate all year. Nor was last year \nanomalous. With some exceptions, the standard has been to include a \nsingle Court of Appeals nominee at a hearing and, certainly, to average \none Court of Appeals judge per hearing. In 1995, there were 12 hearings \nand 11 Court of Appeals judges were confirmed. In 1996 there were only \nsix hearings all year, involving five Court of Appeals nominees and \nnone were confirmed. In 1997 there were nine hearings involving nine \nCourt of Appeals nominees and seven were confirmed. In 1998 there were \n13 hearings involving 14 Court of Appeals nominees and a total of 13 \nwere confirmed. In 1999, there were seven hearings involving a \nrehearing for one and nine additional Court of Appeals nominees and \nonly seven Court of Appeals judges were confirmed. Thus, over the \ncourse of the last 6 years there have been a total of 55 hearings and \nonly 46 Court of Appeals judges confirmed.\n  I have also respectfully suggested that the White House work with \nSenators to identify and send more District Court nominations to the \nSenate who are broadly supported and can help us fill judicial \nvacancies in our Federal trial courts. According to the Administrative \nOffice of the U.S. Courts, almost two-thirds of the vacancies on the \nfederal bench are in the District Courts, 75 of 108. But fewer than \none-third of President Bush's nominees so far, nine out of 30, have \nbeen for District Court vacancies. The two who were consensus \ncandidates and whose paperwork was complete have had their hearing \nearlier this month and were confirmed last Friday.\n\n  I did try to schedule District Court nominees for our hearing this \nweek, but none of the files of the seven District Court nominees \npending before the Committee was complete. Because of President Bush's \nunfortunate decision to exclude the American Bar Association from his \nselection process, the ABA is only able to begin its evaluation of \ncandidates' qualifications after the nominations are made public. We \nare doing the best we can, and we hope to include District Court \ncandidates at our next nominations hearing.\n  The Senators who spoke earlier this week also sought to make much of \njudicial emergency designations. What they fail to mention is that of \nthe 23 District Court vacancies classified as judicial emergencies by \nthe Administrative Office of the Courts, President Bush has not sent \nthe Senate a single nominee 23 District Court emergency vacancies \nwithout a nominee. Almost one-third of judicial emergency vacancies on \nthe Courts of Appeals, 6 of the 16 are without a nominee, as well. Of \ncourse, Judge Roger Gregory was confirmed for a judicial emergency \nvacancy on the Fourth Circuit, but Republican critics make no mention \nof that either.\n  What I find even more striking, as someone who worked so hard over \nthe last several years to fill these vacancies, is that the Republican \ncriticism fails to acknowledge that many of these emergency vacancies \nbecame\n\n[[Page S8341]]\n\nemergency vacancies and were perpetuated as emergency vacancies by the \nRepublican majority's refusal to act on President Clinton's nomination \nover the last 6 years. Indeed, the Republican Senate over the last \nseveral years refused to take action on no fewer than a dozen nominees \nto what are now emergency vacancies on the Courts of Appeals. I remind \nmy colleagues of their failure to grant a hearing or Committee or \nSenate consideration to the following: Robert Cindrich to the Third \nCircuit; Judge James A. Beaty, Jr. and Judge James A. Wynn, Jr. to the \nFourth Circuit; Jorge Rangel, Enrique Moreno and H. Alston Johnson to \nthe Fifth Circuit; Judge Helene White, Kathleen McCree-Lewis and Kent \nMarcus to the Sixth Circuit; Bonnie Campbell to the Eighth Circuit; \nJames Duffy and Barry Goode to the Ninth Circuit. Those were 12 Court \nof Appeals nominees to 10 vacancies who could have gone a long way \ntoward reducing the level of judicial emergencies around the country.\n  So when others talk about the progress we are finally making in \nSenate consideration of judicial nominations, I hope that in the future \nthey will recognize our accomplishments, understand our circumstances, \nand consider our record in historical context. I have yet to hear our \nRepublican critics acknowledge any shortcomings among the practices \nthey employed over the last 6 years. When they have done that and we \nhave established a common basis of understanding and comparison, we \nwill have taken a significant step forward. As it is, I must sadly \nobserve that partisan carping is not constructive. It seems part of an \nunfortunate pattern of actions this week that are a conscious effort to \nincrease the partisan rhetoric. I would rather we work together to get \nas much accomplished as we possibly can.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/27/senate-section/article/S8341-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         QUESTIONS FOR PARENTS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, according to a study by the Brady Center \nto Prevent Gun Violence, in 1998, there was a gun in more than four out \nof every ten households with children and a loaded gun in one in every \nten households with kids. These numbers are frightening. While most \nparents think to ask where their kids are going, who they are going \nwith and when they will be home, how many think to ask the parents of \ntheir children's friends whether they keep a gun in their home and \nwhether they keep it locked?\n  Unfortunately, the Brady Center's study reports that more than 60 \npercent of parents have never even thought about asking other parents \nabout gun accessibility. If we want to protect our children from gun \nviolence, these are questions we probably need to start asking. After \nall, while in 1 year firearms killed no children in Japan, 19 in Great \nBritain and 153 in Canada, guns killed 5,285 children in the United \nStates. Asking another parent whether they keep a gun in their home is \ntough.

Madam President, I rise today to honor one of the \nextraordinary legacies of my predecessor, Senator Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan, who served in this body for 24 years representing the people \nof New York.\n  With some seeking to insert contentious language regarding Zionism \ninto declarations emerging from the upcoming United Nations World \nConference Against Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia, and Related \nIntolerance in Durban, South Africa, I am reminded of Senator \nMoynihan's courageous statesmanship, when he condemned the 1975 U.N. \nresolution 3379 which infamously declared ``Zionism is a form of racism \nand racial discrimination.''\n  We should never forget the historic battle my predecessor waged to \ndefeat this outrageous effort to de-legitimize the state of Israel and \ndefame the Jewish people. Over 25 years ago, Senator Moynihan boldly \ncalled this hate-filled language ``criminal.'' It was criminal then and \nit's still criminal today.\n  On the day the resolution passed, Senator Moynihan declared, ``the \nUnited States . . . will never acquiesce in this infamous act . . . A \npolitical lie of a variety well known to the twentieth century and \nscarcely exceeded in all the annals of untruth and outrage. The lie is \nthat Zionism is a form of racism. The overwhelming truth is that it is \nnot.''\n  From the moment he entered the Senate in January 1977, Senator \nMoynihan dedicated much of his energy to repealing this despicable \nattack on Israel and the Jewish people, delivering passionate speeches \non the Senate floor. As chair of the Senate Foreign Relations \nSubcommittee on Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, Senator Moynihan \nintroduced Joint Resolution 246, which called on the U.N. to repeal the \n1975 resolution.\n  It took 17 long years to remove this stain from the United Nations' \nreputation. And as we begin this new century, nothing could be more \ndamaging to the promise and integrity of the U.N. than to revive to \nthis ignominious statement. In order to help prevent the U.N. from \nreviving one of the moments of its greatest shame, Senators Schumer, \nSmith, Lugar and I have written the following letter to Kofi Annan, the \nSecretary General of the United Nations, condemning any attempts to \ninclude inflammatory anti-Israel language into declarations associated \nwith the World Conference Against Racism in Durban.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 27, 2001.\n     Hon. Kofi A. Annan,\n     Secretary General of the United Nations, The United Nations, \n         New York, NY.\n       Dear Secretary General Annan: We are writing to express our \n     serious concern regarding recent efforts to insert \n     contentious language into declarations emerging from the \n     upcoming United Nations World Conference Against Racism in \n     Durban, South Africa. Such language, such as ``the racist \n     practices of Zionism,'' undermines the goals of the \n     conference to eradicate hatred and promote understanding. \n     This meeting of the international community should not be a \n     forum to encourage divisiveness, but a time to foster greater \n     understanding between people of all races, creeds, and \n     ethnicities.\n       As you know, on November 10, 1975, the United Nations \n     General Assembly designated Zionism a form of racism. It took \n     sixteen long years for the United Nations to acknowledge that \n     this offensive language had no place at such an important \n     world body. In March of 1998, you appropriately condemned \n     this ugly formulation when you noted that the ``lamentable \n     resolution'' equating Zionism with racism and racial \n     discrimination was ``the low-point'' in Jewish-UN relations. \n     Our former colleague Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan called \n     this designation by the United Nations ``criminal.''\n       Though this ``Zionism equals racism'' language was \n     overwhelmingly rescinded in 1991 by the General Assembly, \n     this issue is far from resolved. With the Palestinians and \n     Israelis in the middle of a delicate cease-fire and after \n     months of violence, we believe that gratuitously anti-Israel, \n     anti-Jewish language at a UN forum will serve only to \n     exacerbate existing tensions in the Middle East.\n       Mr. Secretary, we in Congress applaud your hard work in \n     restoring the reputation of the UN. We urge you to continue \n     your efforts by advocating to all nations of the world the \n     importance of keeping inflammatory language out of this \n     important conference. It is our hope that the Conference on \n     Racism remains only as an opportunity to promote peace and \n     reconciliation among all people, not one to target Israel or \n     Jews. We\n\n[[Page S8342]]\n\n     share a deep common interest in seeing the conference stay \n     focused and embody a sense of unity in the fight against \n     racism. Thank you for your attention to this matter of great \n     importance.\n           Sincerely,\n     Charles E. Schumer,\n     Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     Gordon Smith,\n     Richard G. Lugar,\n       United States Senate.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. In 1975, Senator Moynihan warned his colleagues at the \nU.N. and the rest of the world that: ``As this day will live in infamy, \nit behooves those who sought to avert it to declare their thoughts so \nthat historians will know that we fought here . . . with full knowledge \nof what indeed would be lost.''\n  Senator Moynihan recognized then, as we do today, that this language \nonly serves to fuel hatred and bigotry throughout the world and has no \nplace in international discourse. I am honored to have followed Senator \nMoynihan in the Senate, and I pledge to continue his tradition of \npromoting the principles of decency and human dignity and opposing \nefforts to sow hatred and bigotry, especially when they are cloaked in \nthe guise of diplomacy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the attached statement be printed for \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Speech to the United Nations General Assembly, by U.S. Ambassador to \n          the U.N. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, November 10, 1975\n\n       The United States rises to declare before the General \n     Assembly of the United Nations, and before the world, that it \n     does not acknowledge, it will not abide by, it will never \n     acquiesce in this infamous act.\n       Not three weeks ago, the United States Representative in \n     the Social, Humanitarian, and Cultural Committee pleaded in \n     measured and fully considered terms for the United Nations \n     not to do this thing. It was, he said, ``obscene.'' It is \n     something more today, for the furtiveness with which this \n     obscenity first appeared among us has been replaced by a \n     shameless openness.\n       There will be time enough to contemplate the harm this act \n     will have done the United Nations. Historians will do that \n     for us, and it is sufficient for the moment only to note the \n     foreboding fact. A great evil has been loosed upon the world. \n     The abomination of anti-semitism--as this year's Nobel Peace \n     Laureate Andrei Sakharov observed in Moscow just a few days \n     ago--the Abomination of anti-semitism has been given the \n     appearance of international sanction. The General Assembly \n     today grants symbolic amnesty--and more--to the murderers of \n     the six million European Jews. Evil enough in itself, but \n     more ominous by far is the realization that now presses upon \n     us--the realization that if there were no General Assembly, \n     this could never have happened.\n       As this day will live in infamy, it behooves those who \n     sought to avert it to declare their thoughts so that \n     historians will know that we fought here, that we were not \n     small in number--not this time--and that while we lost, we \n     fought with full knowledge of what indeed would be lost.\n       Nor should any historian of the event, nor yet any who have \n     participated in it, suppose, that we have fought only as \n     governments, as chancelleries, and on an issue well removed \n     from the concerns of our respective peoples. Others will \n     speak for their nations: I will speak for mine.\n       In all our postwar history there had not been another issue \n     which has brought forth such unanimity of American opinion. \n     The President of the United States has from the first been \n     explicit: This must not happen. The Congress of the United \n     States in a measure unanimously adopted in the Senate and \n     sponsored by 436 of 437 Representatives in the House, \n     declared its utter opposition. Following only American Jews \n     themselves, the American trade union movements was first to \n     the fore in denouncing this infamous undertaking. Next, one \n     after another, the great private institutions of American \n     life pronounced anathema in this evil thing--and most \n     particularly, the Christian churches have done so. Reminded \n     that the United Nations was born in struggle against just \n     such abominations as we are committing today--the wartime \n     alliance of the United Nations dates from 1942--the United \n     Nations Association of the United States has for the first \n     time in its history appealed directly to each of the 141 \n     other delegations in New York not to do this unspeakable \n     thing.\n       The proposition to be sanctioned by a resolution of the \n     General Assembly of the United Nations is that ``Zionism is a \n     form of racism and racial discrimination.'' Now this is a \n     lie. But as it is a lie which the United Nations has now \n     declared to be a truth, the actual truth must be restated.\n       The very first point to be made is that the United Nations \n     has declared Zionism to be racism--without ever having \n     defined racism. ``Sentence first--verdict afterwards,'' as \n     the Queen of Hearts said. But this is not wonderland, but a \n     real world, where there are real consequences to folly and to \n     venality. Just on Friday, the President of the General \n     Assembly, speaking on behalf of Luxembourg, warned not only \n     of the trouble which would follow from the adoption of this \n     resolution but of its essential irresponsibility--for, he \n     noted, members have wholly different ideas as to what they \n     are condemning. It seems to me that before a body like this \n     takes a decision they should agree very clearly on what they \n     are approving or condemning, and it takes more time.''\n       Lest I be unclear, the United Nations has in fact on \n     several occasions defined ``racial discrimination.'' The \n     definitions have been loose, but recognizable. It is \n     ``racism,'' incomparably the more serious charge--racial \n     discrimination is a practice; racism is a doctrine--which has \n     never been defined. Indeed, the term has only recently \n     appeared in the United Nations General Assembly documents. \n     The one occasion on which we know the meaning to have been \n     discussed was the 1644th meeting of the Third Committee on \n     December 16, 1968, in connection with the report of the \n     Secretary-General on the status of the international \n     convention on the elimination of all racial discrimination. \n     On that occasion--to give some feeling for the intellectual \n     precision with which the matter was being treated--the \n     question arose, as to what should be the relative positioning \n     of the terms ``racism'' and ``Nazism'' in a number of the \n     ``preambular paragraphs.'' The distinguished delegate from \n     Tunisia argued that ``racism'' should go first because \n     ``Nazism was merely a form of racism.'' Not so, said the no \n     less distinguished delegate from the Union Soviet Socialist \n     Republics. For, he explained, ``Nazism contained the main \n     elements of racism within its ambit and should be \n     mentioned first.'' This is to say that racism was merely a \n     form of Nazism.\n       The discussion wound to its weary and inconclusive end, and \n     we are left with nothing to guide us for even this one \n     discussion of ``racism'' confined itself to world orders in \n     preambular paragraphs, and did not at all touch on the \n     meaning of the words as such. Still, one cannot but ponder \n     the situation we have made for ourselves in the context of \n     the Soviet statement on that not so distant occasion. If, as \n     the distinguished delegate declared, racism is a form of \n     Nazism--and if, as this resolution declares, Zionism is a \n     form of racism--then we have step to step taken ourselves to \n     the point of proclaiming--the United Nations is solemnly \n     proclaiming--that Zionism is a form of Nazism.\n       What we have here is a lie--a political lie of a variety \n     well known to the twentieth century, and scarcely exceeded in \n     all that annal of untruth and outrage. The lie is that \n     Zionism is a form of racism. The overwhelmingly clear truth \n     is that is it not.\n       The word ``racism'' is a creation of the English language, \n     and relatively new to it. It is not, for instance, to be \n     found in the Oxford English Dictionary (appears in 1982 \n     supplement to Oxford Dictionary). The term derives from \n     relatively new doctrines--all of them discredited--concerning \n     the human population of the world, to the effect that there \n     are significant biological differences among clearly \n     identifiable groups, and that these differences establish, in \n     effect, different levels of humanity. Racism, as defined in \n     Webster's Third New International Dictionary, is ``The \n     Assumption that . . . traits and capacities are determined by \n     biological race and that races differ decisively from one \n     another.'' It further involves ``a belief in the inherent \n     superiority of a particular race and its right to dominate \n     over others.''\n       This meaning is clear. It is equally clear that this \n     assumption, this belief, has always been altogether alien to \n     the political and religious movement known as Zionism. As a \n     strictly political movement, Zionism was established only in \n     1897, although there is a clearly legitimate sense in which \n     its origins are indeed ancient. For example, many branches of \n     Christianity have always held that from the standpoint of \n     biblical prophets, Israel would be reborn one day. But the \n     modern Zionism movement arose in Europe in the context of a \n     general upsurge of national consciousness and aspiration that \n     overtook most other people of Central and Eastern Europe \n     after 1848, and that in time spread to all of Africa and \n     Asia. It was, to those persons of the Jewish religion, a \n     Jewish form of what today is called a national liberation \n     movement. Probably a majority of those persons who became \n     active Zionism and sought to emigrate to Palestine were born \n     within the confines of Czarist Russia, and it was only \n     natural for Soviet Prime Minister Andrei Gromyko to deplore, \n     as he did in 1948, in the 299th meeting of the Security \n     Council, the act by Israel's neighbors of ``sending troops \n     into Palestine and carrying out military operations aimed''--\n     in Mr. Gromyko's words--at the suppression of the national \n     liberation movement in Palestine.''\n       Now it was the singular nature--if, I am not mistaken, it \n     was the unique nature--of this national liberation movement \n     that in contrast with the movements that preceded it, those \n     of that time, and those that have come since, it defined \n     its members in terms not of birth, but of belief. That is \n     to say, it was not a movement of the Irish to free \n     Ireland, or of the Polish to free Poland, not a movement \n     of the Algerians to free Algeria, nor of Indians to free \n     India. It was not a movement of persons connected by \n     historic membership to a genetic pool of the kind that \n     enables us to speak loosely but not meaninglessly, say, of \n     the Chinese people, nor yet of diverse groups occupying \n     the same territory which enables us to speak if the \n     American people with no greater indignity to truth. To the \n     contrary, Zionists defined\n\n[[Page S8343]]\n\n     themselves merely as Jews, and declared to be Jewish \n     anyone born of a Jewish mother or--and this is the \n     absolutely crucial fact--anyone who converted to Judaism. \n     Which is to say, in terms of International Convention on \n     the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, \n     adopted by the 20th General Assembly, anyone--regardless \n     of ``race, colour, descent, or nationally or ethnic origin \n     . . .''\n       The state of Israel, which in time was the creation of the \n     Zionist Movement, has been extraordinary in nothing so much \n     as the range of ``racial stocks'' from which it Orient and \n     Jew from the West. Most such persons could be said to have \n     been ``born'' Jewish, just as most Presbyterians and most \n     Hindus are ``born'' to their faith, but there are many Jews \n     who are just converts. With a consistency in the matter which \n     surely attests to the importance of this issue to that \n     religions and political culture, Israeli courts have held \n     that a Jew who converts to another religion is no longer a \n     Jew. Inn the meantime the population of Israel also includes \n     large numbers of non-Jews, among them Arabs of both the \n     Muslim and Christian religions and Christians of other \n     national origins. Many of these persons are citizens of \n     Israel, and those who are not can become citizens by legal \n     procedures very much like those which obtain in a typical \n     nation of Western Europe.\n       Now I should wish to be understood that I am here making \n     one point, and one point only, which is that whatever else \n     Zionism may be, it is not and cannot be ``a form of racism.'' \n     In logic, the State of Israel could be, or could become, many \n     things, theoretically, including many things undesirable, but \n     it could not be and could not become racism unless it ceased \n     to be Zionist.\n       Indeed, the idea that Jews are a ``race'' was invented not \n     by Jews but by those who hated Jews. The idea of Jews as a \n     race was invented by nineteenth century anti-semites such as \n     Houston Steward Chamberlain and Edouard Drumont, who saw that \n     in an increasingly secular age, which is to say an age made \n     for fewer distinctions between people, the old religions \n     grounds for anti-semitism were losing force. New \n     justifications were needed for excluding and persecuting \n     Jews, and so the new idea of Jews as a race--rather than as a \n     religion--was born. It was a contemptible idea at the \n     beginning, and no civilized person would be associated with \n     it. To think that it is an idea now endorsed by the United \n     Nations is to reflect on what civilization has come to.\n       It is precisely a concern for civilization, for civilized \n     values that are or should be precious to all mankind, that \n     arouses us at this moment to such special passion. What we \n     have at stake here is not merely the honor and the legitimacy \n     of the State of Israel--although a challenge to the \n     legitimacy of any member nation ought always to arouse the \n     vigilance of all members of the United Nations. For a yet \n     more important matter is at issue, which is the integrity of \n     the whole body of moral and legal precepts which we know \n     as human rights.\n       The terrible lie that has been told here today will have \n     terrible consequences. Not only will people begin to say, \n     indeed they have already begun to say that the United Nations \n     is a place where lies are told, but far more serious, grave \n     and perhaps irreparable harm will be done to the cause of \n     human rights itself. The harm will arise first because it \n     will strip from racism the precise and abhorrent meaning that \n     it still precariously holds today. How will the people of the \n     world feel about racism and the need to struggle against it, \n     when they are told that it is an idea as broad as to include \n     the Jewish national liberation movement?\n       As the lie spreads, it will do harm in a second way. Many \n     of the members of the United Nations owe their independence \n     in no small part to the notion of human rights, as it has \n     spread from the domestic sphere to the international sphere \n     exercised its influence over the old colonial powers. We are \n     now coming into a time when that independence is likely to be \n     threatened again. There will be new forces, some of them \n     arising now, new prophets and new despots, who will justify \n     their actions with the help of just such distortions of words \n     as we have sanctioned here today. Today we have drained the \n     word ``racism'' of its meaning. Tomorrow, terms like \n     ``national self-determination'' and ``national honor'' will \n     be perverted in the same way to serve the purposes of \n     conquest and exploitation. And when these claims begin to be \n     made--as they already have begun to be made--it is the small \n     nations of the world whose integrity will suffer. And how \n     will the small nations of the world defend themselves, on \n     what grounds will others be moved to defend and protect them, \n     when the language of human rights, the only language by which \n     the small can be defended, is no longer believed and no \n     longer has a power of its own?\n       There is this danger, and then a final danger that is the \n     most serious of all. Which is that the damage we now do to \n     the idea of human rights and the language of human rights \n     could well be irreversible.\n       The idea of human rights as we know it today is not an idea \n     which has always existed in human affairs, it is an idea \n     which appeared at a specific time in the world, and under \n     very special circumstances. It appeared when European \n     philosophers of the seventeenth century began to argue that \n     man was a being whose existence was independent from that of \n     the State, that he need join a political community only if he \n     did not lose by that association more than he gained. From \n     this very specific political philosophy stemmed the idea of \n     political rights, of claims that the individual could justly \n     make against the state; it was because the individual was \n     seen as so separate from the State that he could make \n     legitimate demands upon it.\n       That was the philosophy from which the idea of domestic and \n     international rights sprang. But most of the world does not \n     hold with that philosophy now. Most of the world believes in \n     newer modes of political thought, in philosophies that do not \n     accept the individual as distinct from and prior to the \n     State, in philosophies that therefore do not provide any \n     justification for the idea of human rights and philosophies \n     that have no words by which to explain their value. If we \n     destroy the words that were given to us by past centuries, we \n     will not have words to replace them, for philosophy today has \n     no such words.\n       But there are those of us who have not forsaken these older \n     words, still so new to much of the world. Not forsaken them \n     now, not here, not anywhere, not ever.\n       The United States of America declares that it does not \n     acknowledge, it will not abide by, it will never acquiesce in \n     this infamous act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/27/senate-section/article/S8343-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING BENJAMIN VINCI\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, Senator Clinton and I rise today to \nrecognize and honor the service of Benjamin Vinci of Port Chester, New \nYork--a true American hero.\n  In 1941, at the age of 21, Benjamin Vinci left home to serve in the \nU.S. Army, and by December of that year, was stationed in Hawaii with \nthe 97th Army Coast Artillery Guard. Like so many there on the morning \nof December 7, 1941, Benjamin Vinci was going about his daily business. \nHe had just completed all night guard duty and was eating breakfast \nwhen the whole base erupted in smoke and fire as Japanese war plans \nattacked Pearl Harbor and the surrounding area.\n  As bombers strafed the mess tent, a 50-caliber bullet hit Private \nVinci in the back. But ignoring his wound, Benjamin Vinci reached an \nanti-aircraft emplacement and began to fight back. He stepped down only \nwhen he was ordered to find an ambulance and tend to his wound.\n  Along the way, instead of seeking cover, Benjamin Vinci ran down to \nthe beach and rescued a man who had been shot through the legs. Helping \nthe other soldier into a motorboat, he navigated through a hail of \nbombs and ammunition to the other side of the bay where he finally \nboarded an ambulance. But on the way to the hospital at Hickham field, \nplanes targeted the ambulance and Benjamin Vinci was wounded again--\nthis time a 50-caliber bullet coming to rest near his heart.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. In the aftermath of the attack, doctors believed \nPrivate Vinci's wounds were fatal, but he persevered. He received the \nPurple Heart and eventually was transferred to a hospital in Colorado, \nwhere doctors were able to remove one of the two bullets that had \nalmost taken his life, but not both. He continues to carry with him the \nsecond bullet, which has never been able to be removed.\n  Disabled from his wounds, Benjamin Vinci returned to Port Chester \nafter being discharged from the Army and resumed life as a civilian. \nFor many years, Mr. Vinci worked as a vacuum cleaner salesman in \nWestchester County. He married Rose Civitella in 1945, and together \nthey raised four children: Peter, Burnadette, JoAnn, and Joseph.\n  We honor and thank Benjamin Vinci for his tremendous sacrifice, vital \ncontribution, and gallant service to our Nation. His acts of bravery \nare an exceptional example of the fortitude, determination, and \nstrength of the American spirit. As Mr. Vinci carries the burden of his \nwounds and the bullet he received on that December morning of infamy, \nso too must we carry the memory of his heroic deeds, remembering and \nhonoring all the men and women of that great generation--those veterans \nof World War II who saved our Nation, and the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/27/senate-section/article/S8343-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8343-S8344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I wish to congratulate New \nOrleans on the groundbreaking of the extension of the historic Canal \nStreet Streetcar, which will eventually connect mid-city to downtown.\n  This groundbreaking is truly cause for celebration. It is a product \nof vision and hard work. The streetcar project enriches the city by \ncombining New Orleans tradition with 21st century innovation. The new, \nstate-of-the-art streetcars will be child safe, air-conditioned and in \nfull compliance with disability laws. Not only is the streetcar project \nimportant to businesses and residents of the city, but it is also \nimportant for the expansion of tourism. By providing free, safe, public \ntransportation, the Canal Street Streetcar will alleviate traffic on \nCanal Street. And it will connect all who take advantage of its use to \nseveral points of pride in the city such as the New Orleans Museum of \nArt.\n  Mayor Morial and the city council, Chairman Tucker, and several \nmembers of Louisiana's congressional delegation and I have worked hard \nfor many years to secure funding to make this project a reality. Most \nrecently, we helped secure $23 million for the streetcar in a \ntransportation measure. I congratulate the local leadership for helping \nto make this possible. All who support this project in Congress will \ncontinue to do our part so that one day in the not-too-distant future, \nthe streetcar will be up and running. In fact, in Washington, I will \nhonor this dedication with an entry in the Congressional Record. The \nCanal Street Streetcar is a symbol of our state's rich heritage and New \nOrleans's eclectic character. I am proud to be a part of its \nrestoration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/27/senate-section/article/S8344-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO KEN KASPRISIN\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I publicly thank Colonel Ken \nKasprisin, who will leave his post as District Engineer and Commander \nof the St. Paul District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers today, \nJuly 27. Colonel Kasprisin is one of the finest individuals I have \nworked with as a U.S. Senator representing North Dakota, and we will \nmiss him after he leaves the Corps.\n  North Dakota and the Nation owe Colonel Kasprisin a deep debt of \ngratitude. He has served as Commander of the St. Paul District since \nJuly, 1998, and he has served admirably. During that period, he has \nhelped lead our communities through several flood disasters including \nthe chronic flood at Devils Lake, ND. Throughout it all, he has always \ngone above and beyond the call of duty.\n  Colonel Kasprisin is among the most capable leaders I have ever had \nthe pleasure of working with. He is a true professional, and has a \nunique ability to walk into a difficult condition, assess the \nsituation, and calmly, but decisively, take action. He listens \ncarefully to people and has a leadership style that invites creative \nsolutions to complex problems.\n  Colonel Kasprisin is also a man of tremendous integrity. He cares \ndeeply about the people of this nation, and his commitment to doing the \nright thing is unmatched. He has often been willing to fight for the \nneeds of common citizens, even if it meant leading an uphill fight and \nchallenging others within the Corps.\n  I know that the Colonel leaves the St. Paul Corps a better \norganization due to his leadership. The Colonel set high standards for \nhis team, and they delivered time and time again. Under the Colonel's \nleadership, we have begun the flood protection project for Grand Forks, \nsuccessfully fought several spring floods throughout the Red River \nValley, and have continued to provide protection to residents of Devils \nLake from the rising lake water. I will not forget the incredible \ncontributions Colonel Kasprisin has made to the people of my State and \nthe country.\n  But Colonel Kasprisin's departure from the Corps does not mean he is \ndeparting from public life. FEMA Director Allbaugh has tapped him to be \nthe new FEMA Regional Director for the Pacific Northwest Region head-\nquartered in Seattle. The Colonel's leadership will be a valuable \naddition to the FEMA team, and I believe Director Allbaugh made a great \nchoice for that important position. Colonel Kasprisin will continue to \nmake a difference in people's lives in that position and I am pleased \nthat he has agreed to continue his public service.\n  I want to again express my deep appreciation and respect for Colonel \nKasprisin for his service to my state and to our nation. We in North \nDakota will miss you, Colonel, but wish you all the best in your new \ncareer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/27/senate-section/article/S8344-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RETIREMENT OF MR.

Johnson, the Deputy \nAssistant Secretary of the Army for Installations and Housing, is \nretiring at the end of this month after over 50 years of government \nservice.\n  Paul Johnson began his career with the Federal Government serving on \nactive duty with the Corps of Engineers beginning in 1949, and served \nas an engineer with the Army and the Air Force until he arrived at the \nPentagon in 1962.\n  During his nearly forty years there, Paul Johnson became an \ninstitution in the Army and in the Pentagon. Since 1983, Paul has been \nthe senior career official in the Army responsible for military \nconstruction, family housing, base realignment and closure, real \nproperty management and disposal, and real property maintenance issues \nfor the active duty Army; the Army National Guard; and the Army \nReserve. In this capacity, Paul is responsible for the management of \nover $200 billion in assets.\n  For decades, whenever there has been an Army installation or property \nissue where the Congress needed information or help, we called ``PJ'', \nbecause we knew we could rely on his leadership and sound judgment. And \nPJ did not hesitate to reciprocate and let us know when the Army needed \nhelp from the Congress to solve a problem. When you were talking to PJ, \nthere was never any doubt that he was working to do what was best for \nthe Army.\n  We will miss him, and the Army will miss him even more. I am sure all \nmembers of the Senate who have worked with Paul over the years, \nespecially my colleagues on the Armed Services and Appropriations \nCommittees, will join me in congratulating him on his astonishing \nrecord of over half a century of public service and wish him and his \nfamily all the best as he begins a well-deserved retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/27/senate-section/article/S8344-4", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8344-S8346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-3095.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     the Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to the \n     federal Weatherization Assistance Program for Low-Income \n     Persons and the Low-Income House Energy Assistance program; \n     to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 140\n\n       Whereas, the areas served by electric and gas utilities in \n     Louisiana and throughout the South have poverty levels that \n     are higher than the national average, with many customers \n     being unable to afford utility service without sacrificing \n     other necessities such as medicine and food; and\n       Whereas, disconnection of electric and gas service presents \n     health and safety risks, particularly for the elderly, \n     disabled, and small children residing in the substandard, \n     poorly insulated, energy-inefficient housing that is \n     prevalent in this region; and\n       Whereas, the federally funded WAP and LIHEAP are the \n     nation's largest, most comprehensive effective residential \n     energy efficiency and bill payment assistance programs, \n     serving as a vital safety net during periods of escalating \n     and volatile energy prices; and\n       Whereas, the state agencies and community-based \n     organizations that administer WAP and LIHEAP and distribute \n     the funds on behalf of those eligible and in need have \n     demonstrated their capability to accomplish both energy \n     efficiency services and bill payment assistance when these \n     programs are adequately funded and assured of continued \n     existence for a reasonable number of years; and\n       Whereas, the Fiscal Year 2002 Bush Administration proposed \n     budget call for continuing LIHEAP funding at the same, \n     inadequate levels as was provided during the past year, $1.4 \n     billion nationally, an amount that was recently recognized as \n     vastly insufficient by the United States Senate; and\n       Whereas, it is a matter of utmost importance and urgency to \n     persuade both houses of the Congress of the United States to \n     take swift and bold action to increase and release to the \n     states the funding for WAP and LIHEAP: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to act at once to \n     provide for advanced and increased funding of the \n     Weatherization Assistance program for Low-Income Persons and \n     he Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, so as to enable \n     the programs to engage in planning their work more \n     efficiently and engaging and retaining qualified employees. \n     Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-158. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     the Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to the \n     sale of crawfish and catfish imported from Asia and Spain; to \n     the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 143\n\n       Whereas, Louisiana's crawfish and catfish industries are \n     vital to the well-being of this state and its citizens; and\n       Whereas, these industries are facing a serious economic \n     crisis due to the availability of inexpensive crawfish and \n     catfish imported from Asia and Spain; and\n       Whereas, crawfish from China began appearing in the United \n     States market in the early 1990s; however, they had no \n     significant impact at the time because the amount of \n     available Chinese crawfish was not enough to seriously affect \n     the supply and demand associated with Louisiana's crawfish \n     industry; and\n       Whereas, in 1993 and 1994 there was a substantial increase \n     in the amount of Chinese crawfish, which harmed Louisiana \n     industry, and crawfish are produced in China at a lower cost \n     than is possible in Louisiana which allows their sale at \n     prices with which Louisiana producers cannot compete; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana is also experiencing a similar problem \n     with crawfish arriving from Spain being offered for sale at a \n     low price; and\n       Whereas, since Louisiana crawfish farmers cannot compete \n     with those in China and Spain, the crawfish plants are in \n     danger of closing, which is devastating to Louisiana because \n     it is difficult to re-open the plants because the crawfish \n     peelers have sought other employment, and it is virtually \n     impossible to replace that labor component of the Louisiana \n     crawfish industry; and\n       Whereas, in response to the problem, the Federal Trade \n     Commission recently imposed a duty on Chinese crawfish, which \n     has allowed Louisiana fishermen and suppliers to compete with \n     Chinese fishermen and suppliers; and\n       Whereas, nevertheless, crawfish suppliers are presently \n     circumventing the duty and are still providing crawfish at a \n     much lower price, so the threat to the Louisiana industry \n     continues; and\n       Whereas, the Catfish industry in Louisiana is experiencing \n     similar problems caused by imported Catfish from Vietnam and \n     Spain; and\n       Whereas, between 1993 and 1999, the amount of Catfish \n     exported from Vietnam increased from sixteen thousand five \n     hundred tons to twenty-four thousand tons, and capital \n     investments in Catfish production in the Mekong Delta have \n     continued to grow dramatically: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to assist the Federal \n     Trade Commission in preventing the sale of crawfish and \n     catfish imported from Asia and Spain at prices with which \n     Louisiana producers cannot compete. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-159. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     the Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to the \n     federal-aid highway program; to the Committee on Environment \n     and Public Works.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 152\n\n       Whereas, legislation is pending introduction in congress to \n     allow states to opt out of the federal-aid highway program; \n     and\n       Whereas, those states opting out would be required to \n     replace the federal gasoline tax with a state gasoline tax; \n     and\n       Whereas, five states have laws in effect which would \n     automatically increase the state gasoline tax should the \n     federal gasoline tax be reduced; and\n       Whereas, if Louisiana were authorized to levy the gasoline \n     tax, it could control more of the revenues and would be less \n     subject to certain efforts by the federal government to \n     control state policy: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Louisiana Legislature does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to adopt legislation \n     authorizing states to opt out of the federal-aid highway \n     program. Be it further,\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-160. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     the Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to Section \n     527 of the Internal Revenue Code; to the Committee on \n     Finance.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 188\n\n       Whereas, Congress passed the Full and Fair Political \n     Disclosure Act and the President\n\n[[Page S8347]]\n\n     signed it into law (Public Law 106-230) to require public \n     disclosure of political activities of organizations that \n     usually do not disclose their expenditures or contributions; \n     and\n       Whereas, Rep. David Vitter has introduced H.R. 527 (also \n     known as the Vitter Bill) to correct and clarify P.L. 106-230 \n     by reducing duplicative and burdensome federal reporting and \n     disclosure requirements placed on state and local political \n     candidates, their campaign committees, and state political \n     parties; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 527 relieves individuals and groups from \n     filing pursuant to Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     if their sole intention is to influence the election of state \n     and local public officers or officers in a state or local \n     political organization and if the state and local \n     contribution and expenditure reporting requirements relating \n     to selections, nominations, elections, and appointments to \n     such offices provide that the reports are publicly available; \n     and\n       Whereas, H.R. 527 would not exempt any political committee \n     from the requirements if it spent even one dollar on a \n     federal election, including congressional races, or failed to \n     abide by state and local contribution and expenditure \n     reporting requirements; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 527 exempts state and local political \n     committees because the law is geared toward the federal \n     election cycle which usually does not conform to state and \n     local reporting requirements; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 527 establishes an exemption for state and \n     local political committees similar to the exemption for \n     federal political organizations that report to the Federal \n     Elections Commission; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 527 intends to leave intact the intent of \n     P.L. 160-230 as a response to stealth political action \n     committees that were able to raise and spend unlimited \n     amounts of money for political advocacy without having to \n     disclose the sources and amounts of donations, all while \n     enjoying tax-exempt status: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Louisiana Legislature does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to support House \n     Resolution 527 making changes to Section 527 of the Internal \n     Revenue Code to exempt certain state and local political \n     committees which are required to report contributions and \n     expenditures pursuant to local or state law. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-161. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     the State of Louisiana relative to the Bayou Lafourche \n     restoration and diversion project from the Mississippi River; \n     to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 198\n\n       Whereas, until 1904, Bayou Lafourche carried about fifteen \n     percent of the flow of the Mississippi River and provided \n     vital nourishment for thousands of acres of coastal swamps \n     and marshes throughout the Barataria and Terrebonne Basins; \n     and\n       Whereas, after the bayou was sealed off from the \n     Mississippi River in 1904 to prevent flooding, these marshes \n     began to deteriorate and salt water began to encroach inland; \n     and\n       Whereas, diverting river water into our coastal basins is \n     the best tool we have to create a sustainable coast; and\n       Whereas, Bayou Lafourche provides the sole source of \n     drinking water for about two hundred thousand citizens of \n     Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, during the drought year of 2000, Bayou Lafourche \n     became contaminated by salt water as far north as the \n     Lockport water treatment plant, making the water hazardous to \n     drink; and\n       Whereas, since 1996, the Breaux Act program has been \n     investigating the feasibility of a project that would restore \n     Bayou Lafourche by removing sediment that currently clogs the \n     channel and by introducing about one thousand cubic feet per \n     second of river water into Bayou Lafourche at Donaldsonville \n     on a continuous basis, without flood risk to local residents; \n     and\n       Whereas, the project has been proposed as a means of \n     nourishing eight-six thousand acres of coastal marshes by \n     reintroducing river water into a vast area that has been cut \n     off from the river by levees; and\n       Whereas, the final design of the project should accommodate \n     the reasonable concerns of landowners regarding erosion and \n     property damage; and\n       Whereas, this one thousand cubic feet per second diversion \n     project would also prevent the future saltwater contamination \n     of municipal and industrial freshwater intakes; and\n       Whereas, this project would provide critical benefits to a \n     large area of coastal marshes, it would restore the current \n     sluggish, choked bayou to a flowing, healthy ecosystem, and \n     it would provide a continuous supply of high quality fresh \n     water for municipal and industrial needs into the future: \n     Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Louisiana Legislature does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to support, with \n     funding, the expeditious implementation of the proposed Bayou \n     Lafourche restoration and diversion project from the \n     Mississippi River. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the presiding officers of the Senate and the \n     House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States \n     of America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-162. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to the pending \n     charter boat moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico; to the \n     Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 114\n\n       Whereas, the charter fishing industry in Louisiana is in \n     its infancy but has begun a period of healthy growth which \n     can only be beneficial to the state's overall economic \n     development and the capture of tourist dollars; and\n       Whereas, the Gulf States Fishery Management Council voted \n     this spring to send to the National Marine Fisheries Service \n     a recommendation for a three-year moratorium on the issuance \n     of new charter vessel permits for reef and coastal migratory \n     pelagic fishing; and\n       Whereas, the genesis of the recommended moratorium was \n     concerned about the area of the Gulf of Mexico near Florida \n     where the charter industry is much more mature, much more \n     widespread, and has created a situation where there are too \n     many boats with too many fishermen competing for too few \n     fish; and\n       Whereas, the charter industry in Louisiana exists in a \n     significantly different environment, one where there is not \n     an overabundance of permitted charter boat captains and where \n     there is an abundance of habitat and fish which should result \n     in a productive charter industry; and\n       Whereas, a productive and expanding charter industry would \n     be of great benefit to the economic health of the state, a \n     benefit that would be denied the state of Louisiana if the \n     moratorium were adopted and new charter captains would not be \n     eligible for permitting: Therefore, be it,\n       Resolved, That the Louisiana House of Representatives does \n     hereby memorialize the Louisiana congressional delegation and \n     the United States Congress to express its desire to the \n     National Marine Fisheries Service that the pending charter \n     boat moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico not be implemented. Be \n     it further,\n       Resolved, That if a moratorium is considered by the \n     National Marine Fisheries Service, that the moratorium be \n     limited to the eastern Gulf of Mexico with an authorization \n     for continued expansion of the industry in the western Gulf \n     of Mexico where there are no issues of overcrowding. Be it \n     further,\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be forwarded to \n     each member of the Louisiana congressional delegation and to \n     the presiding officers of the United States House of \n     Representatives and the United States Senate.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-163. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to \n     international child slavery; to the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 128\n\n       Whereas, it is with great moral indignation and deepest \n     concern that the Legislature of Louisiana learns of the \n     continued use internationally of such an unspeakable practice \n     as child slavery; and\n       Whereas, despite current efforts to end the practice of \n     trafficking in child slaves, the trade remains a serious \n     problem, particularly in West and Central Africa where this \n     most disturbing practice has been on the rise; and\n       Whereas, currently thousands of children as young as six \n     years of age are trafficked across borders into slavery to \n     work long hours in harsh conditions as domestic servants, as \n     farm and plantation laborers, and as sellers in markets; and\n       Whereas, while parents living in some of the poorest \n     countries on the planet are on occasion wiling to sell their \n     children for as little as fourteen dollars, often in the \n     belief that their children will receive education and \n     prosperous employment, the vast majority of these children \n     become slaves usually laboring on coffee and cocoa \n     plantations; and\n       Whereas, during long-distance transportation over land and \n     sea, these children face arduous and sometimes fatal journeys \n     riddled with hardships such as ships that lack sufficient \n     supplies of food and fresh drinking water; and\n       Whereas, through a 1998-1999 research and interview project \n     funded by the United Kingdom National Lottery Charities \n     Board, Enfants Solidaires d' Afrique et du Monde, a \n     nongovernmental organization in Benin, found that child \n     slaves transported across the border between Benin and Gabon \n     were subjected to fourteen- to eighteen-hour work days, heavy \n     work, and oftentimes sexual abuse including rape and forced \n     prostitution; and\n       Whereas, interviews by American media reporters in Sudan \n     have revealed a similar pattern of torments, including forced \n     marches, sexual abuse and mutilation, and violent beatings \n     among slaves; and\n       Whereas, many destination countries of child slave \n     trafficking have failed to take the necessary steps to end \n     the exploitation of children in slavery or other abusive \n     labor; and\n       Whereas, diplomatic collaboration between nongovernmental \n     organizations and all national governments is important for \n     developing long-term strategies for eliminating trafficking \n     of child slaves and rehabilitating children who have suffered \n     from this practice; and\n\n[[Page S8348]]\n\n       Whereas, national governments, and particularly the United \n     States government, should ratify and encourage implementation \n     of key measures protecting children, such as the United \n     Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, to ensure that \n     children are protected against slavery, should work to ensure \n     that the United Nations International Convention Against \n     Transnational Organized Crime includes a protocol to prevent, \n     suppress, and punish the practice of trafficking in slaves, \n     and should urge the United Nations to adopt a specific year \n     as the International Year Against Trafficking in Human Beings \n     to focus attention on the issue; and\n       Whereas, governments may curb the practice of child slavery \n     internationally via economic tactics, such as embargoes on \n     products and countries that use child slavery and urging \n     action on the part of industries to purchase directly from \n     plantations where they can ensure that growers implement core \n     international labor standards, particularly those banning \n     forced labor and illegal child labor, and by collaborating \n     with other countries to ensure that international labor \n     standards regarding slavery are enforced throughout such \n     countries; and\n       Whereas, having repealed the terrible and horrific practice \n     of slavery within our own borders with the Emancipation \n     Proclamation and the thirteenth amendment to our \n     constitution, the United States unequivocally opposes slavery \n     in all forms and universally endorses the freedom and dignity \n     of every human being; and\n       Whereas, in the true and compassionate knowledge that every \n     child deserves the opportunity to live the life of a child \n     without subjection to the burdens of injustice, child slavery \n     can only be deemed insufferable and repugnant: Therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Legislature of Louisiana does hereby urge and request the \n     United States Congress and the President of the United States \n     to institute and enforce legislation and diplomatic action \n     toward the eradication of child slavery internationally. Be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of both houses of the United States \n     Congress, to the members of the Louisiana delegation to the \n     United States Congress, and to President George W. Bush.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-164. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to the OCS oil \n     and gas lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico; to the Committee \n     on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 149\n\n       Whereas, it has been almost four years since the \n     environmental impact statement was prepared for the Oil and \n     Gas Lease Sales 169, 172, 175, 178, and 182 in the Gulf of \n     Mexico; and\n       Whereas, as a result of public testimony in response to \n     that EIS, there was recognition of the significant impact \n     which will be felt relative to the infrastructure in offshore \n     activity focal points such as Port Fourchon and LA Highway 1 \n     through Lafourche Parish; and\n       Whereas, at the present time, forty of the forty-five deep \n     water rigs working in the Gulf of Mexico are being serviced \n     through Port Fourchon as are many of the rigs located on the \n     OCS, with the accompanying increase in land traffic and \n     inland waterway traffic, all primarily through Lafourche \n     Parish; and\n       Whereas, efforts have so far failed to develop plans to \n     mitigate these present and well-documented impacts while \n     efforts to increase the number of leases in the gulf continue \n     with no apparent effort to provide mitigation for current or \n     increased impacts: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Louisiana Legislature does hereby memorialize the U.S. \n     Congress to direct the Mineral Management Service to develop \n     a plan for impact mitigation relative to the OCS oil and gas \n     lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be forwarded to \n     the presiding officer of each house of the U.S. Congress, to \n     each member of the Louisiana congressional delegation, and to \n     the director of the Minerals Management Service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/27/senate-section/article/S8348-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. HOLLINGS, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, \n     and Transportation, without amendment:\n       S. 127: A bill to give American companies, American \n     workers, and American ports the opportunity to compete in the \n     United States cruise market (Rept.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a \ntheme study to identify sites and resources to commemorate and \ninterpret the cold war; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the cold war was the longest war in United \nStates history. Lasting 50 years, the cold war cost thousands of lives, \ntrillions of dollars, changed the course of history, and left America \nthe only superpower in the world. Because of the nuclear capabilities \nof our enemy it was the most dangerous conflict our country ever faced. \nThe threat of mass destruction left a permanent mark on American life \nand politics. Those that won this war did so in obscurity. Those that \ngave their lives in the cold war have never been properly honored.\n  Today I introduce a bill that requires the Department of the Interior \nto conduct a study to identify sites and resources to commemorate \nheroes of the cold war and to interpret the cold war for future \ngenerations. My legislation directs the Secretary of the Interior to \nestablish a ``Cold War Advisory Committee'' to oversee the inventory of \ncold war sites and resources for potential inclusion in the National \nPark System; as national historic landmarks; or other appropriate \ndesignations.\n  The Advisory Committee will work closely with State and local \ngovernments and local historical organizations. The committee's \nstarting point will be a cold war study completed by the Secretary of \nDefense under the 1991 Defense Appropriations Act. Obvious cold war \nsites of significance include: Intercontinental ballistic missiles; \nflight training centers; communications and command centers, such as \nCheyenne Mountain, Colorado; nuclear weapons test sites, such as the \nNevada test site, and strategic and tactical resources.\n  Perhaps no other State in the Union has played a more significant \nrole than Nevada in winning the cold war. The Nevada Test Site is a \nhigh-technology engineering marvel where the United States developed, \ntested, and perfected a nuclear deterrent which is the cornerstone of \nAmerica's security and leadership among Nations. The Naval Air Station \nat Fallon is the Navy's premiere tactical air warfare training \nfacility. The Air Warfare Center at Nellis Air Force Base has the \nlargest training range in the United States to ensure that America's \npilots will prevail in any armed conflict.\n\n[[Page S8355]]\n\n  The Advisory Committee established under this legislation will \ndevelop an interpretive handbook on the cold war to tell the story of \nthe cold war and its heroes.\n  I'd like to take a moment to relate a story of one group of cold war \nheroes.\n  On a snowy evening in November 17, 1955, a United States Air Force C-\n54 crashed near the summit of Mount Charleston in central Nevada. The \ndoomed flight was carrying 15 scientific and technical personnel to \nsecret Area 51 where the U-2 reconnaissance plane, of Francis Powers \nfame, was being developed under tight security. The men aboard the ill-\nfated C-54 helped build the plane which critics said could never be \nbuilt. The critics were wrong, the U-2 is a vital part of our \nreconnaissance force to this day. The secrecy of the mission was so \ngreat that the families of the men who perished on Mount Charleston \nonly recently learned about the true circumstances of the crash that \ntook the lives of their loved ones. My legislation will provide \n$300,000 to identify historic landmarks like the crash at Mount \nCharleston. I'd like to thank Mr. Steve Ririe of Las Vegas who brought \nto light the events surrounding the death of the fourteen men who \nperished on Mount Charleston nearly a half century ago, and for the \nefforts of State Senator Rawson who shepherded a resolution through the \nNevada legislature to commemorate these heroes.\n  A grateful nation owes its gratitude to the ``Silent Heroes of the \nCold War.'' I urge my colleagues to support this long overdue tribute \nto the contribution and sacrifice of those cold war heroes for the \ncause of freedom.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Conrad, and Ms. \n        Landrieu):\n  S. 1258. A bill to improve academic and social outcomes for teenage \nyouth; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/27/senate-section/article/S8355-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8355-S8366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        YMCA TEEN ACTION AGENDA\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the YMCA Teen \nAction Agenda Enhancement Act of 2001, along with my colleague Mr. \nDeWine. This bipartisan legislation will enable the YMCA to reach more \nteenagers across the United States who are in need of safe, structured \nafter-school activities.\n  Unfortunately, the evidence is all around us that our young people \ntoday need some extra care and support. Kids today face challenges and \nobstacles that I never dreamed about when I was growing up in Regent. \nChildren are killing other children because they covet their tennis \nshoes or their jackets. Kids are having kids. One-quarter of \nadolescents report that they have used illegal drugs.\n  Part of the problem is the temptation that kids face when they have \ntoo much idle time on their own. Every day, millions of American teens \nare left unsupervised after school. Studies have shown that teens who \nare unsupervised during these hours are more likely to smoke \ncigarettes, drink alcohol, engage in sexual activity, and become \ninvolved in delinquent behavior than those teens who participate in \nstructured, supervised after-school activities. Also, nearly 80 percent \nof teens who are involved in after-school activities are A or B \nstudents, while only half of those who are not involved earn these \ngrades. Two out of every 3 teens said that they would participate in \nafter-school programs to help them improve academically, if such \nprograms were offered.\n  The YMCA is an exemplary organization that is dedicated to serving \nour nation's youth, and it wants to help them even more. Nearly 2.4 \nmillion teenagers, 1 out of every 10, are involved in a program offered \nby their local YMCA. The Y is a safe place for kids during after school \nhours. Teens participate in hundreds of programs that feature tutoring \nand academics, sports, mentoring, community service and life skills. To \nserve more teens who are in need of structured after-school programs, \nthe YMCA has set a goal of doubling the number of teens served to 1 out \nof every 5 teens by 2005. This ambitious campaign is called the Teen \nAction Agenda.\n  The bill that I offer today provides funding to help the YMCA reach \nteens who want and need more after-school activities. This piece of \nlegislation authorizes Federal appropriations of $20 million per year \nfor fiscal years 2002 through 2006 for the YMCA to implement its Teen \nAction Agenda. This funding would in turn be distributed to local YMCAs \nthat are located in all 50 States and the District of Columbia. Similar \nlegislation was passed in the 105th Congress for the Boys and Girls \nClub and in the 106th Congress for the Police Athletic League to aid in \ntheir efforts to reach out to youth. The YMCA is an established and \nproven organization that is in the position to reach and influence \nthousands of teenagers who are in danger of falling through the cracks.\n  This bill will encourage public-private partnerships and leverage \nadditional funding for teen programs. This legislation contains a \nmatching component that will be met by the YMCA through local and \nprivate support. The matching component, along with the support the \nYMCA programs receive from national corporate sponsors, will turn $20 \nmillion in Federal funds into $50 million that will be invested in \nproven programs that serve the teens who are most in need.\n  In my State, there are six YMCAs that serve North Dakota teens. \nThrough programs focusing on education, life skills, safety, \nleadership, and service learning, these YMCAs helped 12,500 teens in my \nState develop character and build confidence within the last year.\n  One example of how the YMCA reaches teens is the Teen Board recently \nestablished in Fargo. This board is comprised of teenage \nrepresentatives who advise the YMCA and other community residents on \nissues and concerns affecting local teens. Similar teen programs have \nbeen created at the other YMCAs in my State. The legislation I \nintroduce today will provide funding for these YMCAs to expand these \nimportant programs.\n  Nationwide, YMCAs partner with 400 juvenile courts, 300 housing \nauthorities and over 2,500 public schools. While the YMCA is national \nin scope, they are local in control and every program is designed and \nevaluated to meet the communities' unique needs. I am confident that \nthis bill will help the YMCA to continue to provide successful \nsolutions for our Nation's teens and their families.\n  Edmund Burke once said, ``All that is necessary for evil to triumph \nis for good people to do nothing.'' This legislation will provide good \nvolunteers in YMCAs across the country with the additional resources \nthey need to reach more teens. This bill represents a small step we can \ntake to reach out to at-risk teens in communities across the Nation. \nFor the sake of our children's future, I urge my Senate colleagues to \njoin me in cosponsoring this piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Graham, and Mr. Helms):\n  S. 1259. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act with \nrespect to the admission of nonimmigrant nurses; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Rural \nand Urban Health Care Act of 2001. I want to thank my cosponsors \nSenator Graham and Senator Helms for their support and leadership on \nthis vital issue.\n  Nothing can traumatize a family more than a medical emergency, \nparticularly one that may have been prevented by timely access to a \nneeded medical professional. In Kansas, I know many communities that \nwould be without a doctor if it was not for an immigrant physician. I \nknow that many communities both in Kansas and around the country would \nbenefit from a greater number of not only doctors, but nurses, nurse \naides, radiologists, medical technicians, and other health-care \nprofessionals.\n  In the area of nurses, it's become apparent that the problem has \ndeveloped into one of national significance.\n  According to the American Organization of Nurse Executives, ``A \nnursing shortage is emerging nationwide that is fueled by age-related \ncareer retirements, small to moderate increases in job creation, and \nreduced nursing school enrollments. Job replacement-related demands due \nto registered nurse age-related retirements are expected to increase \nrapidly over the next 5 to 15 years.''\n\n[[Page S8356]]\n\n  According to data from the Department of Health and Numan Services, \ntoday 18.3 percent of registered nurses are under the age of 35, \ncompared to over 40 percent in 1980. Today, only nine percent of \nregistered nurses are under the age of 30, compared to 25 percent in \n1980.\n  Projections by economists Peter Buerhaus, Douglas Staiger, and David \nAuerbach show that by the year 2020, the number of registered nurses \nworking in America will be ``20 percent below the projected need.''\n  I believe this legislation contains many crucial elements that would \nbenefit many health care providers and the patients they serve.\n  First, the legislation amends the H-1C category established in the \n``Nursing Relief for Disadvantaged Areas of 1999. The problem with that \ncategory is that it allows only a handful of health care facilities \nthroughout the country to hire nurses on temporary visas. That makes \nlittle sense. We should open the category up to facilities in all \nStates, rather than select a handful of hospitals that alone would be \nallowed to hire foreign nurses on temporary visas. In addition, the \nbill streamlines some of the current processes to remove redundancy and \nsituations that impede the arrival of nurses to work and help patients \nin the United States.\n  Second, the legislation retains stringent labor protections \nestablished previously for the H-1C category on wages, layoffs and \nstrikes.\n  Third, the bill authorizes appropriations for the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services to work with states to develop programs aimed at \nincreasing the domestic supply of nurses in the United States.\n  Finally, the legislation expands an already successful program by \nincreasing from 20 to 40 waivers for foreign physicians that may be \nexercised by a particular State, as well allowing a carryover of any \nunused waivers to the next fiscal year. It also eliminates the sunset \ndate of the program.\n  This bill does not attempt to solve all problems related to this \nissue. Other, more expensive solutions, primarily very long-term, may \nemerge from the HELP or Finance committees. However, it is not possible \nin one bill to address all outstanding financial or labor issues \npresent in today's hospitals and nursing homes. Indeed, many of these \nissues will have to be addressed at the State level. But simply because \nwe cannot solve all of today's health-care problems, does not mean that \nwe abdicate our responsibility to find practical solutions to help real \npeople.\n  I think this bill provides real and immediate help for problems that \nare only going to grew worse the longer we wait to address them.\n  I ask that the text of the bill and a section by section summary of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1259\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

If a complaint is filed, the Secretary shall provide \n     within 180 days of filing, a determination as to if a basis \n     exists to make a finding described below (iv). If such a \n     basis exists, the Secretary shall provide notice of such \n     determination to the interested parties, and an \n     opportunity for a hearing on the complaint within 60 days \n     of the date of determination. The Secretary shall \n     promulgate regulations providing for penalties, including \n     civil monetary fines, upon parties who submit complaints \n     that are found to be frivolous.\n       d.

A bill to provide funds for the planning of a special census \nof Americans residing abroad; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, millions of Americans live and work \noverseas. While living abroad, they continue to pay taxes and they can \nvote in our Federal elections. They are American citizens and they want \nto be counted in the next decennial Census in 2010. To achieve this \ngoal, it is essential to plan and prepare.\n  For several years, I have been working closely with Congresswoman \nCarolyn Maloney. She has been a true leader on the important issues of \nthe U.S. Census and I am proud to work with her. The bill I am \nintroducing today is the companion bill to H.R. 680. This legislation \nauthorizes funding to being the work at the Census Bureau to count \nAmericans living overseas. The House Appropriations Committee has \nincluded some funding for this important initiative which is \nencouraging news.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1260\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) an estimated 3,000,000 to 6,000,000 Americans live and \n     work overseas while continuing to vote and pay taxes in the \n     United States;\n       (2) Americans residing abroad help increase exports of \n     American goods because they traditionally buy American, sell \n     American, and create business opportunities for American \n     companies and workers, thereby strengthening the United \n     States economy, creating jobs in the United States, and \n     extending United States influence around the globe;\n       (3) Americans residing abroad play a key role in advancing \n     this Nation's interests by serving as economic, political, \n     and cultural ``ambassadors'' of the United States; and\n       (4) the major business, civic, and community organizations \n     representing Americans and companies of the United States \n     abroad support the counting of all Americans residing abroad \n     by the Bureau of the Census, and are prepared to assist the \n     Bureau of the Census in this task.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Bureau of the Census should carry out a special \n     census of all Americans residing abroad in 2004;\n       (2) the Bureau should, after completing that special \n     census, review the means by which Americans residing abroad \n     may be included in the 2010 decennial census;\n       (3) the Bureau should take appropriate measures to provide \n     for the inclusion of Americans residing abroad in the 2010 \n     decennial census and decennial censuses thereafter; and\n       (4) in order to ensure that the measures specified in the \n     preceding provisions of this subsection can be completed in \n     timely fashion, the Bureau should begin planning as soon as \n     possible for the special census described in paragraph (1).\n\n     SEC. 2. FUNDING TO BEGIN PLANNING FOR A SPECIAL CENSUS OF \n                   AMERICANS RESIDING ABROAD.\n\n       For necessary expenses in connection with the planning of a \n     special census of Americans residing abroad (as described in \n     section 1(b)(1)), there is appropriated, out of any\n\n[[Page S8359]]\n\n     money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, $5,000,000 \n     for fiscal year 2002, to remain available until expended.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 1261. A bill to amend the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee \nVoting Act to increase the ability of absent uniformed services voters \nand overseas voters to participate in elections for Federal office, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, millions of Americans live abroad, \nserving in our military or working in foreign countries. These \nAmericans pay taxes and have the right to vote. They deserve to know \nthat their votes will be counted.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation designed to streamline and \nimprove the process for absentee ballots to help ensure that Americans \nliving overseas can participate in American elections. The bill is \ncalled the Uniformed and Overseas Citizen Absentee Voting Reform Act. \nIt is based on the bipartisan legislation introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney and Congressman Thomas \nReynolds. This bill is developed through recommendations of overseas \nAmericans.\n  Our goal is to help both military and civilian citizens overseas to \nparticipate in elections. The right to vote is important in our \ncountry, and we need to encourage all of our citizens, including those \nmillions living abroad, to participate in elections.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1261\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Uniformed and Overseas \n     Citizen Absentee Voting Reform Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Approximately 3,000,000 to 6,000,000 American citizens, \n     including 576,000 Federal employees and their overseas \n     dependents in the armed services and in other Federal \n     agencies, live permanently or temporarily reside outside the \n     50 States and the District of Columbia.\n       (2) The members of the armed services, their dependents, \n     other employees of the Federal Government and their \n     dependents, and the approximately 3,000,000 to 5,500,000 \n     other American citizens abroad make an inestimable \n     contribution to the security, economic well-being, and \n     cultural vitality of the United States.\n       (3) Although great progress has been made in recent decades \n     in assuring that these citizens have the chance to \n     participate fully in our democratic process, the national \n     elections of November 2000 revealed grave shortcomings in our \n     system, with nearly 40 percent of overseas ballots rejected \n     in one State alone.\n       (4) Moreover, during these elections it became apparent \n     that timely information about the numbers of American \n     citizens seeking to vote and voting from abroad, information \n     which is essential to measure the effectiveness of our \n     overseas voting system, is not currently provided by the \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to make improvements in mathematics and science \neducation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, one of our major national problems \nis the dismal educational achievement of our children in the areas of \nmathematics and science. In 1989 President George H. Bush proposed and \nthe Governors adopted as a national goal that by the year 2000, the \nUnited States would be first in the world in mathematics and science. \nNot only has our country neglected this education goal, the evidence \nshows that our country has not made significant improvements. Several \nstudies have shown that in the intervening years, our performance \nrelative to other industrialized countries is about average and there \nis no indication of any change. Furthermore, the evidence clearly shows \nthat between the 4th and 8th grades our achievement level actually \ndeclines relative to other countries.\n  Not only is this a concern for our future competitiveness in the \nmodern world but it could present a serious national security problem. \nThe U.S. Commission on National Security/21st Century concluded in a \nFebruary 2001 report that the ``Second only to a weapon of mass \ndestruction detonating in an American city, we can think of nothing \nmore dangerous than a failure to manage properly science, technology, \nand education for the common good over the next quarter century.''\n  One major factor in this situation is the lack of sufficient \nqualified mathematics and science teachers. A large number of \nmathematics and science teachers are not certified in their subject \narea. The greatest number of uncertified teachers are located in areas \nwith large minority populations and high concentrations of poverty. \nThis situation is of great concern since many studies have shown that \nfull certification or a major in the field is a strong predictor of \nstudent achievement. Mr. Michael Porter of the Harvard Business School \nhas documented that over 90 percent of urban schools report teacher \nshortages in mathematics and science. Furthermore, recently, the \nNational Council for Accreditation of Teacher Preparation showed that \n50,000 new teachers enter the profession each year lacking appropriate \npreparation. More than 30 percent of secondary mathematics teachers \nhold neither a major or minor in mathematics.\n  I am proud to have Senators Roberts and Kennedy as original \ncosponsors of this legislation since each is a recognized leader on \neducation. We are introducing a bipartisan bill entitled the\n\n[[Page S8361]]\n\nNational Mathematics and Science Partnerships Act. Our bill is very \nsimilar to legislation reported out of the House Committee on Science, \nand I have worked with Chairman Boehlert on this important initiative. \nThe purpose of this bill is to make a major impact on the teaching of \ntechnical subjects in grades K through 12. This bill accomplishes its \ngoal by bringing the wider community including industry into the \neducational process through partnerships, by increasing the number of \nqualified teachers and providing support programs to improve their \nqualifications, and by providing access to master teachers, curriculum \nrelated materials, and research opportunities. The bill also sets up \nCenters of Research on Learning to determine which methodologies are \nmost effective for educating our students in mathematics and science.\n  One of the main provisions authorizes the National Science Foundation \nto establish a program of mathematics and science education \npartnerships involving universities and local educational agencies. \nThese partnerships will focus on a wide array of reform efforts ranging \nfrom professional development to curriculum reform for grades K through \n12. The partnerships may include the State educational agency and 50 \npercent of them must include businesses. These partnerships are \nintended to conceive, develop, and evaluate innovative approaches to \neducation in mathematics, science, engineering, and other technical \nsubjects. A special feature is an emphasis on encouraging the ongoing \ninterest of girls in science, mathematics, engineering, or technology \npreparing them to pursue careers in these fields.\n  A second provision authorizes the expansion of the National Science, \nMathematics, Engineering, and Technology Education Digital Library to \ninclude peer reviewed elementary and secondary education materials. The \nlibrary will serve as an Internet accessible resource for state-of-the-\nart curriculum materials in support of teaching technical subjects.\n  A third provision, that is of particular importance to me, provides \nfor the establishment of a new scholarship program designed to \nencourage mathematics, science, and engineering majors to pursue \ncareers in teaching. The program provides grants to universities who \nwill, in turn, award scholarships to mathematics, science and \nengineering majors who agree to teach following graduation and \ncertification. The institutions must also provide education and support \nprograms for the scholarship recipients. A second element is that \nstipends will be offered to mid-career professionals in mathematics, \nscience, or engineering who need course work to transition to a career \nin teaching. Recipients are required to teach in a K through 12 school \nreceiving assistance under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act of 1965 as payback for the scholarship.\n  The bill also provides for a study of Broadband Network access for \nschools and libraries. This requires the National Science Foundation to \ndetermine how Broadband access can be used and can be effective in the \neducational process. This section is important to the future of the \nhighly successful E-Rate program that is helping close the digital \ndivide between rich and poor schools and urban, rural, and suburban \nschools.\n  Another important provision sets up a grant program to train master \nteachers to work in K through 9 classrooms to improve the teaching of \nmathematics or science. This program will develop an invaluable in-\nhouse resource for teachers of technical subjects.\n  There are a number of other provisions, all of which, address \nshortcomings in our current approach to education in technical \nsubjects.\n  I often visit West Virginia schools, and during the school year I use \nthe Internet to host on-line chats with students across the State. I \nbelieve that students, parents, and teachers recognize the important of \nmath, science and engineering on the workplace, but we need a better \nsupport system for these key subjects in my State, and nationwide.\n  The National Mathematics and Science Partnerships Act is not by \nitself a solution to solving the crisis in technical education. \nHowever, in conjunction with the reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act will begin the process of addressing a major \nnational problem. I urge my colleagues to join us in making our \nchildren the best in the world.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           National Mathematics and Science Partnerships Act\n\n       The overall purpose of this bill is to make a major impact \n     on the teaching of technical subjects in Grades K-12. Many \n     studies have indicated that the US is seriously lacking in \n     our ability to effectively convey scientific knowledge to K-\n     12 students that will enable them to go on to college and \n     major in technical fields. This situation has led to concern \n     that we are losing our competitive edge in the modern world. \n     A key element is the serious shortage of qualified math and \n     science teachers. This bill helps by bringing the wider \n     community including industry into the educational process, by \n     increasing the number of qualified teachers, and by providing \n     for access to support in the form of materials, research \n     opportunities, and Centers of Research on Learning.\n       Most of the provisions of this bill originated in the House \n     Science Committee and some of them reflect the \n     Administration's desires. We, in Senator Rockefeller's \n     office, have been working with the Science Committee for \n     several months. Our major input is the inclusion of a Title \n     that establishes scholarships for students who commit to \n     teach mathematics or science in Grades K-12 in return. We \n     have evaluated the other provisions and agree with them as \n     will be reflected in the bill we are planning to introduce. \n     The provisions of the proposed Senate bill are summarized \n     below.\n\n\nProvisions of the ``National Mathematics and Science Partnerships Act''\n\n       1. Mathematics and Science Education Partnerships: This \n     provides for universities or consortia to receive grants to \n     establish partnership programs to improve the instruction of \n     math and science. The partnerships may include local \n     educational agencies and there is a mandate that 50% will \n     include businesses. There is a strong section on programs \n     aimed at girls. The appropriation is $200M/year for 2002-2006\n       2. Teacher Research Stipend: This provides grants for K-12 \n     math and science teachers to do research in math, science and \n     engineering to improve their performance in the classroom. \n     The appropriation is $15M/year for 2002-2006.\n       3. National Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and \n     Technology Education Library: This Title expands the existing \n     Digital Library to archive and provide for the timely \n     dissemination through the Internet and other digital \n     technologies of educational materials to support the teaching \n     of technical subjects. The appropriation is $20M/year for \n     2002-2006.\n       4. Education Research Centers: This Section will establish \n     4 multi disciplinary Centers for Research on Learning and \n     Education Improvement. This provision is to do research in \n     cognitive science, education, and related fields to develop \n     ways to improve the teaching of math and science. It also \n     provides for an annual conference to disseminate the results \n     of the Center's activities. The appropriation is $12M/year \n     for 2002-2006.\n       5. Education Research Teacher Fellowships: This Section \n     provides grants for institutions of higher education to \n     enable teachers to have research opportunities related to the \n     science of learning. The appropriation is $5M/year for 2002-\n     2004.\n       6. Robert Noyce Scholarship Program: This Title is an \n     updated version of a scholarship program that Senator \n     Rockefeller and Rep. Boehlert sponsored and passed in 1989. \n     It calls for grants to universities or consortia to award \n     scholarships or stipends to students who agree to become K-12 \n     math or science teachers. Scholarships are for $7,500 and are \n     limited to 2 years. In addition, there are provisions for a \n     stipend to enable mid-career math, science and engineering \n     professionals to receive their certificate to teach. The \n     stipend is $7,500 for 1 year. Recipients under this subtitle \n     are obligated to teach math or science. The requirement is 2 \n     years for each year of support within 6 years of graduation. \n     The university or consortium receiving the grant is \n     responsible for monitoring compliance and collecting refunds \n     from those who do not comply. The appropriation is $20M/year \n     for 2002-2005 plus an unspecified amount for the NSF to \n     administer the program for 2006-2011.\n       Political History: While the Noyce scholarship was \n     authorized in 1989, we never secured appropriations to fund \n     the program, in part because NSF had concerns about the \n     scholarships and never lobbied OMB for the appropriations. \n     This time, we worked with NSF staff to get their consent so \n     that we really can promote these scholarships.\n       7. Requirements for Research Centers: Grant recipients \n     establishing research centers must offer programs for K-12 \n     math and science teachers and the quality of their programs \n     is a criteria for awarding grants. There is no appropriation \n     for the Title.\n       The bill to be voted on by the House also contains a number \n     of other provisions added during the Science Committee Mark-\n     up. These are contained in a title called ``Miscellaneous \n     Provisions''.\n\n[[Page S8362]]\n\n       1. Mathematics and Science Proficiency Partnerships: This \n     section sets up a demonstration project for local educational \n     agencies to develop a program to build technology curricula, \n     purchase equipment, and provide professional development for \n     teachers. It is specifically aimed at economically \n     disadvantaged students and requires private sector \n     participation. The private sector will donate equipment, \n     provide funds for internships and scholarships, and other \n     activities helping the objectives of this section. The \n     appropriation is $5M/year for 2002-2004.\n       2. Articulation Partnerships between Community Colleges and \n     Secondary Schools: Amends the ``Scientific and Advanced \n     Technology Act of 1992'' (P.L. 102-476) to direct the NSF to \n     give priority to proposals that involve students that are \n     under represented in technical fields. (The act applies to \n     two year Associate Degree granting colleges.) The \n     appropriation is $5M/year for 2002-2004.\n       3. Assessment of In-Service Teacher Professional \n     Development Programs: This section provides for the Director \n     of the NSF to review all programs sponsored by the NSF that \n     support in-service teacher professional development for \n     science teachers. The purpose is to determine whether \n     information technology is being used effectively and how \n     resources are allocated between summer activities and \n     reinforcement training. A report is due 1 year after \n     enactment of this Act. There is no appropriation.\n       4. Instructional Materials: The NSF may award grants for \n     the development of educational materials on energy \n     production, energy conservation, and renewable energy. There \n     is no appropriation.\n       5. Study of Broadband Network Access for Schools and \n     Libraries: The NSF is to provide an initial report to \n     Congress and provide an update every year for the next 6 \n     years. The reports are to how Broadband access can used and \n     can be effective in the educational process. There is no \n     appropriation. This section relates to the ERATE law to which \n     Senator Rockefeller is very committed.\n       6. Educational Technology Assistance; Learning Community \n     Consortium: This section amends the ``Scientific and Advanced \n     Technology Act of 1992 to enable two year colleges to \n     establish centers to assist K-12 schools in the use of \n     information technology for technical subject instruction. The \n     appropriation is $5M/year for 2002-2004. There is an \n     additional appropriation of $10M to award a grant to a \n     consortium of associate-degree granting colleges to encourage \n     women, minorities, and disabled individuals to enter and \n     complete programs in technical fields.\n       The Senate bill will also include a title that incorporates \n     the provisions of HR 100. This bill was passed out of the \n     House Science Committee at the same time as HR 1858. This \n     bill was also included as Title II of S 478 previously \n     introduced by Senator Roberts, co-sponsored by Senators \n     Kennedy and Bingaman. This approach is agreed to by the House \n     Science Committee. The provisions are:\n       1. Master Teacher Grant Program: This provision establishes \n     a grant program to train master teachers to work in K-9 \n     classrooms to improve the teaching of mathematics or science. \n     The appropriation is $50M/year for 2002-2004.\n       2. Dissemination of Information on Required Course of Study \n     for Careers in Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and \n     Technology Education: The NSF shall compile and disseminate \n     information on prerequisites for entrance into college to \n     pursue a course of study leading to teaching in a K-12 \n     environment and on the licensing requirements for such \n     teachers. The appropriation is $5M/year for 2002-2004.\n       3. Requirement to Conduct Study Evaluation: The NSF shall \n     enter into an agreement with the National Academies of \n     Sciences and Engineering to review existing studies on the \n     effectiveness of technology in the classroom and to report \n     not later than one year after enactment of this Act. The \n     appropriation is $600K.\n       4. Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology \n     Business Education Conference: The NSF shall convene an \n     annual 3-5 day conference for K-12 technology education \n     stakeholders to 1. identify and gather information on \n     existing programs, 2. determine the coordination between \n     providers, and 3. identify the common goals and divergences \n     among the participants. There will be a yearly report to the \n     Senate Commerce Committee and the House Science Committee.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleagues, \nSenator Rockefeller and Senator Kennedy, to introduce a piece of \nlegislation that continues to build on our efforts to improve math and \nscience education.\n  The National Mathematics and Science Partnerships Act creates a \nprogram through the National Science Foundation NSF, that provides a \nvariety of recruitment incentives for college students and individuals \nwho are engineering, science and math professionals in other fields, to \npursue teaching math and science. Additionally, math and science \nteachers are provided a variety of professional development \nopportunities. I am pleased to include in this legislation a portion of \na bill I introduced earlier this year, S. 478, the Engineering, \nScience, Technology and Mathematics Education Enhancement Act.\n  The Math and Science Partnerships Act will provide grants for K-12 \nmath and science teachers to do research in engineering, science and \nmath to do research in these areas to improve their performance in the \nclassroom, a demonstration project for LEAs to develop a program to \nbuild technology curricula, purchase equipment and provide professional \ndevelopment for teachers specifically aimed at economically \ndisadvantaged students. It also provides in-service support and a \nmaster teacher grant program to hire master teachers who are \nresponsible for in-classroom help and oversight. Additionally, the \nlegislation assists high school students in pursuit of their careers as \nmath and science teachers by informing them of courses they should \ncomplete in preparation for college.\n  Bipartisan efforts to increase and enhance math and science education \nhas been encouraging and I am glad to see that math and science \neducation is finally beginning to receive the recognition that is \nneeded and deserved.\n  The need to recruit and retain teachers in the math and science \nfields as well as the need to improve the professional development \nopportunities for teachers currently teaching math and science is \ncrucial. An article that appeared on May 6th in The Hutchinson News, \ndiscusses the teacher recruiting woes that the State of Kansas is \nexperiencing. The article highlights Fort Hays State University in \nHays, KS and tells of a young graduate, Lora Clark, who has a teaching \ndegree in mathematics. With her degree Lora could have found a job \nanywhere in the State of Kansas or with several other States who were \nrecruiting Fort Hays State teaching graduates. Thankfully, she chose to \nstay in her home state and fill a mathematics teaching position in \nHanston, Kansas.\n  However, what stands out most from the article is the number of math \nand science positions available at the career fair at Fort Hays State \nand the number of students that have graduated with teaching degrees in \nmath and science. There were 125 math and science teaching positions \navailable and only 8 students graduating with math and science teaching \ndegrees. We desperately need to fill these positions with teachers who \nhave been properly trained and have professional development \nopportunities in order to encourage students to pursue fields in \nengineering, science, technology and math.\n  The U.S. will need to produce four times as many scientists and \nengineers than we currently produce in order to meet future demand. The \nU.S. has been a leader in technology for decades and the need for \nskilled workers that will require technical expertise continues to \nclimb. Congress has had to increase the number of H-1B visas to fill \ncurrent labor shortages within these fields, we need to focus on long-\nterm solutions through the education of our children.\n  Improving our students knowledge of math and science is not only a \nconcern of American companies but also a concern of U.S. National \nSecurity. According to the latest reports and studies regarding \nNational Security, the lack of math and science education beginning at \nthe K-12 level imposes a serious security threat. The report issued by \nthe U.S. Commission on National Security for the 21st Century reports \nthat ``The base of American national security is the strength of the \nAmerican economy. Therefore, health of the U.S. economy depends not \nonly on an elite that can produce and direct innovation, but also on a \npopulace that can effective assimilate new tools and technologies. This \nis critical not just for the U.S. economy in general but specifically \nfor the defense industry, which must simultaneously develop and defend \nagainst these same technologies.''\n  We are all aware of the need for good teacher recruitment and \nretention programs because of the shortage of teachers many of our \nstates are experiencing or will experience. Math and science education \nis no exception and I am glad to join my colleagues in introducing a \npiece of legislation that will aid in improving and enhancing math and \nscience education and I encourage my colleagues to join in our fight.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1264. A bill to require the conveyance of a petroleum terminal \nserving former Loring Air Force Base and Bangor Air National Guard \nBase, Maine; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n[[Page S8363]]\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the MackPoint \nPetroleum Terminal Conveyance Act. This legislation will authorize the \nconveyance of a petroleum tank farm at MackPoint in Searsport, ME, from \nthe United States Air Force, USAF, to the Maine Port Authority to \npromote economic development in the state of Maine. The bill would \nultimately allow the transfer of a petroleum tank farm to the Maine \nPort Authority in the State Department of Transportation, which will \nprovide critical support for the redevelopment strategy in the region. \nThe Port Authority in Maine has developed a three-port strategic goal \nfor economic development in Northern/Central Maine. This economic \ndevelopment remains high on my list of priorities, and this bill would \nbring us one step closer toward this goal.\n  I am introducing this bill as a companion to legislation, The Loring \nPipeline Reunification Act, which I introduced on the floor earlier \nthis year. This companion legislation would convey a section of a \npipeline connected to the tank farm, from the USAF to the Loring \nDevelopment Authority, LDA, also to contribute to the re-development of \nthe former Loring Air Force Base. Created by the Maine State \nLegislature, Loring Development Authority is responsible for promoting \nand marketing the development of the former base so as to attract more \neconomic development to Northern/Central Maine.\n  The tank farm and pipeline originally were built to supply the former \nLoring Air Base with fuel products critical to its mission as a support \nbase for B-52 bombers and KC-135 tankers. Prior to the base's closure \nin 1994, Defense Fuels would deliver fuel products by tanker to the \nSearsport tank farm, where the line originates, and then pump them \nthrough the line to the base. For a period following the base closure, \nthe Maine Air National Guard continued to use the Searsport Tank Farm \nand the pipeline segment from Searsport to Bangor to supply their \nactivities in Bangor. After a study conducted by the Defense Energy \nSupport Center, a division of the Defense Logistics Agency however, the \nAir National Guard changed their means of transporting fuel from \npipeline to truck.\n  The Air National Guard supports the vision of re-unifying the \npipeline and tank farm, as does the Maine State Department of \nTransportation, and Sprague Industries, the current owner of the land \non which part of the tank farm sits. In consideration of the large \ngeographical expanse of my State, with often treacherous winter \nconditions, and the fuel shortages that have vexed the Northeast over \nthe past two winters, I believe that the conveyance of this tank farm \nand the adjoining pipeline would serve the public well. It would \nprovide a safer means of transporting fuel and, by presenting a more \nefficient means of accessing fuel, manufacturing and processing plants \ncurrently considering new operations in the economically-challenged \narea would be better connected to the resources of the Eastern \nseaboard.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN. (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Reid, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \n        Wellstone, Mr. Corzine, and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 1265. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nrequire the Attorney General to cancel the removal and adjust the \nstatus of certain aliens who were brought to the United States as \nchildren; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this past Spring thousands of students \nacross our Nation donned their caps and gowns and received their high \nschool diplomas as their proud parents and family members looked on. \nThis is an important milestone in the lives of both the graduates and \ntheir parents.\n  However, while many of these graduates will be looking forward to \ncollege, tens of thousands of these students will never get to attend \ncollege and realize their dreams. Why? Because these children are \nundocumented. Most of these children were brought to the United States \nat a very young age by their parents and did not have the ability to \nmake an independent decision about where they would live. They had no \nchoice in matter. Thus, they grew up here. They went to school here. \nAnd like other children, they too had thoughts of realizing the \nAmerican dream. These dreams are quickly dashed when these students \nrealize that, unlike their classmates, college is not on their horizon \nbecause of their immigration status.\n  Although Congress and the United States Supreme Court rightfully \nrequire State and local education agencies to permit undocumented \nchildren to attend elementary and secondary school, there are very few \nmechanisms under current law for these children to legalize their \nimmigration status or go on to college once they have completed their \nhigh school education. They are effectively denied the opportunity to \ngo to college and are constantly under the threat of deportation. Their \nlives are filled with uncertainty and lost opportunity.\n  That is why I, along with Senators Kennedy, Reid, Dodd, Wellstone, \nCorzine, and Feingold, am introducing the Children's Adjustment, \nRelief, and Education Act, CARE Act. Representatives Cannon, Berman, \nand Roybal-Allard introduced a companion bill in the House on May 21, \n2001.\n  The CARE Act would provide immigration relief to undocumented \nchildren who are in the United States, have lived a significant portion \nof their lives in this country, are of good moral character, and are \ninterested in remaining in the country and continuing their education. \nThe CARE Act would help lift these vulnerable children from the shadows \nof society and free them to go to college, regularize their status, and \nfully contribute to our country, now their country.\n  The CARE Act includes three major provisions.\n  As to restoration of the State option to determine residency for \npurposes of higher education benefits, first, the Act would repeal \nSection 505 of the 1996 immigration law, under which any State that \nprovides in-state tuition or other higher education benefits to \nundocumented immigrants must provide the same tuition break or benefit \nto out-of-state residents. In other words, under Section 505, a State \nmust charge the same tuition to out-of-state U.S. citizens as \nit charges to resident undocumented aliens. Repeal of Section 505 would \nrestore to the States the authority to determine their own residency \nrules.\n\n  As to immigration relief for long-term resident students, second, the \nAct would permit students in America's junior high schools and high \nschools who have good moral character, reside in the United States, and \nhave lived in the United States for at least five years to obtain \nspecial immigration relief, known as cancellation of removal, so that \nthey can go to college and eventually become United States citizens. \nThe act also applies to high school graduates who are under 21 years of \nage and are either enrolled in or are seriously pursuing admission to \ncollege.\n  As to higher education benefits for Student Adjustment Act \napplicants, finally, the Act would ensure that students who are \napplying for immigration relief under the Act may obtain federal \nstudent assistance on the same basis as other students while their \napplication is being processed.\n  This legislation would help children like Luis Miguel in my home \nState of Illinois. Luis was born to a single mother in Guadalajara, \nMexico. His mother was having a very difficult time living in Mexico so \nshe decided to take her children and migrate to the United States. Luis \nwas eight years old. He didn't have a say in the matter.\n  Luis was enrolled in a grammar school and after school he worked in a \nsupermarket carrying groceries for people. Because Luis' mother was \nunable to make ends meet, she sent Luis to live in Chicago with his \naunt and uncle when he was nine. He has lived there ever since.\n  Luis is currently 17 years old and just finished up his junior year \nat Kelly High School in Chicago. He is an above average student, and \nhopes to attend the University of Illinois at Chicago someday and \nbecome a computer engineer. He says he loves being involved in all \ntypes of activities because it makes him feel good about himself, and \nmotivates him to do better. He is very active in and out of school. He \nis part of his school band, where he plays percussion, and he plays \nsoccer in the Davis Square Park League. In the past he has participated \nin his church's choir, marimba band and folkloric ballet dance\n\n[[Page S8364]]\n\ngroup. Luis also volunteers as a teacher for catechism classes at Holy \nCross Church.\n  Luis has so much promise. But without this legislation, he is barred \nfrom fulfilling his potential.\n  The same is true for a young musical prodigy who recently completed \nher senior year of high school in the City of Chicago. Because of her \nexceptional musical talent, she was offered a scholarship to Juilliard. \nIt is only in filling out the application that she learned of her \nundocumented status. Her only recourse: go to Korea, where she has \nnever been, and live her life there. I believe our Nation can do better \nthan this.\n  These stories are not unique to Illinois. Tens of thousands of high \nschool students across our Nation, some of them valedictorians, are \nsimilarly situated and face uncertain futures. They cannot continue \ntheir lives or education once they graduate from high school. Instead, \nthey face deportation.\n  Not only do these children suffer but our Nation suffers because we \nare deprived of future contributors and leaders, increased tax \nrevenues, economic growth and social richness. We suffer because \nchildren who might have been scientists, nurses, teachers or engineers \nare forced, instead, to settle for the limited employment options \navailable to those without a college degree.\n  Moreover, the damage to our communities starts long before high \nschool graduation. Guidance counselors report that many promising \nstudents drop out of school at an early age once they realize that they \nwill, as a practical matter, be barred from going to college.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me, Senators Kennedy, Reid, Dodd, \nWellstone, Corzine, and Feingold in supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1265\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Children's Adjustment, \n     Relief, and Education Act'' or the ``CARE Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITION.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``secondary school student'' means a \n     student enrolled in any of the grades 7 through 12.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I strongly support the Children's \nAdjustment, Relief, and Education Act. This needed legislation will \ngive thousands\n\n[[Page S8365]]\n\nof immigrant children who are presently unable to obtain a higher \neducation a fair opportunity to realize the American dream.\n  For too many of these children, the highest level of education they \ncan hope to attain is a high school diploma. It is not their lack of \nability or their lack of desire which holds these children back. It is \nthe fact that they were born abroad to parents who unlawfully entered \nthis country. Under current law, they are often denied State and \nFederal aid for higher education. In an economy in which higher \neducation is a prerequisite for higher wages and benefits, the result \nof current law is to relegate these children to an uncertain future.\n  It is wrong to punish these children for their parents' actions. That \nis why I strongly support the CARE Act. It will help undocumented \nchildren who are in the United States, who have lived a significant \nportion of their lives in this country, who are of good moral \ncharacter, and who want to remain in this country and continue their \neducation. It will give them special immigration relief so that they \ncan go to college and eventually become U.S. citizens. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO (for himself Mr. Lugar Mr. Roberts, and Mr. \n        Hutchinson):\n  S. 1267. A bill to extend and improve conservation programs \nadministered by the Secretary of Agriculture; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Conservation \nExtension and Enhancement, CEE, Act. I am pleased to be joined in \nintroducing this bill by Senator Richard Lugar, the Ranking Member of \nthe Senate Agriculture Committee, Senator Pat Roberts, and Senator Tim \nHutchinson.\n  America's agricultural producers have long been the best stewards of \nthe land. This legislation helps farmers and ranchers continue to meet \nthe public's increasing demands for cleaner air and water, greater soil \nconservation, increased wildlife habitat, and more open space. These \ndemands have resulted in more stringent applications of Federal and \nState environmental regulations, including the Clean Water Act, the \nClean Air Act, and the Endangered Species Act. It is appropriate we \ndirect our funding to help producers in their efforts to provide these \npublic benefits.\n  Conservation is an important component of Federal farm policy. This \nproposal dedicates the resources necessary to ensure farmers and \nranchers are receiving the assistance they need to provide the \nenvironmental benefits the public deserves. It will keep working farms \nworking effectively from an economic and environmental perspective. To \ndo this, CEE re-authorizes necessary conservation programs, makes \nenhancements to these voluntary programs, and provides increased \nfunding to meet increasing needs.\n  The last farm bill built on the past successes of the Conservation \nReserve Program, CRP, and Wetlands Reserve Program, WRP, and enhanced \nthe flexibility of the compliance programs, while creating a number of \nnew conservation programs. There are many success stories associated \nwith these programs, both new and old. However, there have also been \nsuggestions made to improve these programs. This initiative implements \nthose suggestions to make the programs more effective and increases \ntheir funding.\n  CRP has been one of the most successful conservation programs in USDA \nhistory. The program provides a rental payment to producers for \nvoluntarily converting highly-erodible or environmentally-sensitive \ncropland to a cover crop or grasses or trees. The program has led to a \ntremendous reduction in soil erosion, and has been responsible for \ncreation of habitat for a wide variety of species. Unfortunately, CRP \nis currently nearing its acreage cap.\n  I share the concerns of many producers and rural Americans about the \nimpact of idled land on production and main street economies. CEE \nincreases the acreage cap by 3.6 million acres to a total of 40 million \nacres, but it sets aside those 3.6 million acres for continuous \nenrollment CRP and the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program, CREP. \nThese two programs, continuous CRP and CREP, focus on conservation \nbuffers, allowing producers to maintain working lands, while getting \nassistance in protecting their most environmentally-sensitive lands.\n  WRP has played an important role in protecting and restoring \nwetlands. WRP provides payments to producers for enrolling wetlands in \npermanent, thirty-year, or ten-year easements. It also provides \ntechnical and financial assistance to land owners seeking help in \nrestoring wetlands. The environmental benefits of wetlands cannot be \nunderestimated. Unfortunately, WRP is nearing its acreage cap of 1.075 \nmillion acres. CEE allows for an additional 250,000 acres to be \nenrolled in the program annually.\n  The Farmland Protection Program is targeted at easing development \npressure on agriculture lands. It provides a payment to producers who \nagree to enroll land in easements and has been an important program in \nmeeting the public demand for open space. Again, producer demand far \noutpaces available funding. CEE provides $100 million annually to this \nimportant program.\n  Another successful program in need of continued authorization and \nfunding is the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program. This program \nprovides technical and financial assistance to producers who want to \nestablish improved fish and wildlife habitat. My bill provides $100 \nmillion annually to this program, while creating a pilot project that \nassists landowners in focusing their efforts on addressing species \nconcerns before the species is in threat of listing under the \nendangered species act.\n  One of the most important programs available to assist producers is \nthe Environmental Quality Incentives Program. EQIP provides technical \nand financial assistance to producers to adopt conservation practices. \nDemand for the program greatly exceeds existing funding. CEE provides \nfor a tripling of the funding, while increasing flexibility in the \nprogram. EQIP has been the primary vehicle for assisting producers to \ncomply with the Clean Water Act. It has been estimated producers will \nhave to spend billions to comply with new regulations, such as total \nmaximum daily loads and confined animal feeding operations. Increasing \nthe funding and flexibility of the EQIP programs is vital to helping \nproducers meet the challenges of the Clean Water Act and other \nenvironmental regulations.\n  Also included in this comprehensive bill is the creation of the \nGrasslands Reserve Program. Like the other conservation programs \ncreated through past farm bills, it is a bipartisanly-supported, \nvoluntary program. The Grasslands Reserve Program would be a voluntary \ngrassland easement program to provide protections for native \ngrasslands. This will ease development pressure on ranchlands, \nproviding a long-term commitment to wildlife and the environment. I am \nalso pleased to be a co-sponsor of a free-standing Grassland's \nlegislation introduced by my colleague, Senator Larry Craig.\n  CEE also provides funding for the Conservation of Private Grazing \nLands program. This program offers technical assistance to ranchers \nseeking to implement best management practices and other range \nimprovements.\n  The bill codifies existing practices for the Resource Conservation \nand Development, RC, program, while increasing flexibility in the use \nof funds. RC effectively leverage federal funds to assist in \nstabilizing and growing communities while protecting and developing \nnatural resources.\n  CEE also provides for several studies. It authorizes a National \nAcademy of Sciences study to develop a protocol for measuring \naccomplishments. This protocol is necessary to ensure we are getting \nmaximum environmental benefits for the taxpayer.\n  The bill also directs the Secretary of Agriculture to review existing \ndisaster programs and report on how to improve the timeliness and \neffectiveness of the overall disaster program. Natural disasters are a \nconstant threat to farmers and ranchers. Flooding, drought, fire, and \nother natural events impact even the most efficient operations, causing \nlosses beyond producer control. An effective disaster program is vital \nto the survival of many farms and ranches.\n  Conservation programs are vital to continued progress in creating \nefficient, environmentally and farmer-friendly agricultural policies. \nThis bill sets a baseline as we endeavor to create\n\n[[Page S8366]]\n\na farm policy that recognizes the importance of conservation efforts, \nbuilds upon past efforts, is equitable, and has measurable \nachievements. I ask my colleagues to join me in co-sponsoring this \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/27/senate-section/article/S8366-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8366-S8367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 140--DESIGNATING THE WEEK BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 15, \n            2002, AS ``NATIONAL CIVIC PARTICIPATION WEEK''.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS (for himself, and Mrs. Feinstein) submitted the following \nresolution: which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary\n\n                              S. Res. 140\n\n       Whereas the United States embarks on this new millennium as \n     the world's model of democratic ideals, economic enterprise, \n     and technological innovation and discovery;\n       Whereas our Nation's preeminence is a tribute to our great \n     2-century-old experiment in representative government that \n     nurtures those ideals, fosters economic vitality, and \n     encourages innovation and discovery;\n       Whereas representative government is dependent on the \n     exercise of the privileges and responsibilities of its \n     citizens, and that has been in decline in recent years in \n     both civic and political participation;\n       Whereas Alexis de Tocqueville, the 19th century French \n     chronicler of our Nation's political behavior, observed that \n     the people of the United States had successfully resisted \n     democratic apathy and mild despotism by using what he called \n     ``schools of freedom''--local institutions and associations \n     where citizens learn to listen and trust each other;\n       Whereas civic and political participation remains the \n     school in which citizens engage in the free, diverse, and \n     positive political dialogue that guides our Nation toward \n     common interests, consensus, and good governance;\n       Whereas it is in the public interest for our Nation's \n     leaders to foster civic discourse, education, and \n     participation in Federal, State, and local affairs;\n       Whereas the advent of revolutionary Internet technology \n     offers new mechanisms for empowering our citizens and \n     fostering greater civic engagement than at anytime in our \n     peacetime history; and\n       Whereas the use of new technologies can bring people \n     together in civic forums, educate citizens on their roles and \n     responsibilities, and promote citizen participation in the \n     political process through volunteerism, voting, and the \n     elevation of voices in public discourse: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF NATIONAL CIVIC PARTICIPATION WEEK.\n\n       The Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning September 15, 2002, as \n     ``National Civic Participation Week'';\n       (2) proclaims National Civic Participation Week as a week \n     of inauguration of programs and activities that will lead to \n     greater participation in elections and the political process; \n     and\n       (3) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon interested organizations and the people of the \n     United States to promote programs and activities that take \n     full advantage of the technological resources available in \n     fostering civic participation through the dissemination of \n     information.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, we stand in the midst of an amazing \nperiod of history. Not since the industrial revolution has society \nwitnessed such an explosion of technological advancements. The rise of \nthe Internet yields volumes of information to anyone at anytime and is \nonly a mouse click away. It is imperative that we use this medium \nresponsibly.\n  The strength of our country is deeply rooted in informed citizens \nfreely exchanging ideas. Common men and women engaged in the political \nprocess is the lifeblood of the United States. As legislators, we are \nthe stewards of democracy. It is our duty to encourage citizens of all \npersuasions to actively play a role in this democratic saga.\n  With the emergence of the Internet, there is no better way to make \nthis possible than by supporting this resolution. I, along with my \ndistinguished colleague, Dianne Feinstein of California, am submitting \na resolution entitled, ``The National Civic Participation Week.'' It \ndeclares the week of September 15, 2002 as a time devoted to the \neducation of the political process on the Internet. This resolution \nchallenges the technical industry to create Web sites that promote \ncivic involvement. Further, it calls on local communities to establish \nlinks that provide helpful information to its citizens such as polling \nlocations, registration, and, voter information.\n  We submit this resolution today in response to the declining \nparticipation in the American political system, particularly among \nyounger citizens. I offer some sobering statistics: In the last \npresidential election, of the 25.5 million Americans between the ages \nof 18-24, only 19 percent registered to vote and only 16 percent \nactually voted. In the 1996 presidential election, of the 24 million \nAmericans that age, only 47 percent registered, and 32 percent voted. \n22 percent of U.S. teens did not know from whom the United States won \nits independence. 14 percent thought it was France. 10 percent didn't \nknow there were thirteen original colonies. About 23 percent didn't \nknow who fought in the civil war.\n  Our country has come along way from the early days of the thirteen \ncolonies. Those were times, as Alexis de Tocqueville wrote in his \n``Democracy in America,'' of citizens creating ``freedom schools'' to \nteach and learn of freedom and democracy and the role that each of us \ncan play to help it flourish.\n  We believe that the Internet and other new technologies can play a \ncrucial role in acting as ``freedom schools.'' With so many young \npeople drawn to the Internet, it is an ideal medium to cultivate \ndemocratic virtues and encourage participation. The possibilities are \nnumerous. The World Wide Web has the potential to assist citizens on \nfinding information with how the government works, how laws are made, \nand how citizens can effectively communicate with their elected \nofficials.\n  This resolution offers no Federal mandates or governmental \nexpenditures. It does not prescribe what information should be posted \non the web or how it is disseminated. Instead, we as Senators are \nmaking a collective statement that we recognize the power of the \nInternet and its vast potential at promoting civic virtues. It is a \nresolution that encourages those within the technology industry to \nprovide valuable information on the inner-workings of democracy.\n  Let us use the Internet's vast information highway to cultivate \nlearning and greater awareness in civic affairs. It is our sincere hope \nthat we can rekindle the spirit of the ``freedom school'' of the \nAmerican Revolution through the Internet. May these new technologies \nilluminate and continue the lessons and dreams of our forefathers.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today Senator Roberts and I are \nsubmitting a resolution on civic participation. The resolution has \nthree provision: 1. It proclaims the week beginning September 15, 2002 \nas National Civic Participation Week; 2. It proclaims National Civic \nParticipation Week as a week of programs and activities that encourage \ngreater participation in elections and the political process; and 3. It \nrequests the President to issue a proclamation calling on organizations \nand the people of the country to promote the use of technology in \nfostering civic participation through the dissemination of information.\n  The thrust of this resolution is to encourage activities among \nAmericans, especially young people, to use technology to become more \ninvolved in the country's civic life.\n  As our Nation's leaders, it is our job to show Americans, especially \nyoung people, the importance of being involved in local, State, and \nnational affairs.\n  Civic participation is the arena in which citizens can express their \nviews and engage in dialogue and actions that, influence public policy \nand guide public officials to carry out the citizen's views and \nrecommendations.\n  With advances in Internet technology and other computerized forms of \ncommunication, today we can offer citizens new and innovative ways of \nlearning about and interacting with their local, State and Federal \nGovernment in an easily accessible way.\n  With only 65.9 percent of all Americans registered to vote in the \n1996 Presidential election, according to the Federal Election \nCommission, the Civic Participation Week resolution will try to make \nmore people aware of their right and responsibility to take an active \nrole in government.\n\n[[Page S8367]]\n\n  There is no question that we need more Americans involved in their \ngovernment. In fact, our democracy depends on it. In the most recent \nPresidential election last year in the United States, only 50.7 percent \nof the registered voters actually voted, according to the November 9, \n2000 Washington Post. This compares to 49 percent in the 1996 and 50.1 \npercent in the 1988 Federal elections.\n  Among young people, the voter turnout in this country is considerably \nlower. In the 18-21 age group, only 43.6 percent are registered to \nvote, and a dismal 18.5 percent actually voted in 1998, according to \nFederal Election Commission data.\n  In many other countries, the voter turnout is considerably higher \nthan in the United States. According to the Federal Election \nCommission, in Kazakhstan's 1999 Presidential election, there was a \n87.05 percent voter turnout. In Iceland, there was a 85.9 percent voter \nturnout in the 1996 Presidential election. The 1995 Presidential \nelection in Argentina had a 80.9 percent turnout of registered voters.\n  Internet technology may be an especially effective way to reach young \nAmericans because information is highly accessible. Available at the \nclick of a mouse, and young people seem to prefer computers as an \ninformation-gathering tool over more traditional methods.\n  This use of new technology can help bring people together and can \npromote citizen participation in the political process through more \nvolunteerism, easier access to information, and heightened activism in \nour Nation's civic life.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/27/senate-section/article/S8367-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 141--TO AUTHORIZE TESTIMONY AND LEGAL REPRESENTATION \n           IN PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK V.
