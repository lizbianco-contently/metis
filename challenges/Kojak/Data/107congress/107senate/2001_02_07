Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the remarkable \npublic service of the Honorable Arthur M. Levitt, Chairman of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, the longest-\n\n[[Page S1098]]\n\nserving chairman in the history of the SEC. Mr. Levitt will be \ndeparting the Commission soon with a proud legacy of accomplishment--a \nlegacy that has made his tenure as Chairman one of extraordinary \ndistinction as well as one of unusual duration.\n  Correctly seeing his position as a stewardship for the public good, \nChairman Levitt has consistently set aside partisan concerns to \nadvocate tirelessly on behalf of the individual investor. He has also \nimplemented changes that have strengthened the public's trust in U.S. \nsecurities markets.\n  Chairman Levitt was first appointed to a five-year term in 1993, and \nwas reappointed in 1998. No stranger to economic issues and the \nAmerican securities market, he previously had served as Chairman of the \nNew York City Economic Development Corporation, as well as Chairman of \nthe American Stock Exchange. In addition, Mr. Levitt owned a newspaper \nthat is very familiar to those of us who work on Capital Hill: Roll \nCall.\n  During his eight-year tenure, Chairman Levitt has consistently worked \nto deliver the important message that investors must use the increasing \namounts of information available to them to do more research before \ninvesting. He traveled extensively across the country to spread this \nmessage, holding 43 Investors' Town Meetings. At these events, Chairman \nLevitt took pains personally to educate investors about their rights \nand their obligations, while giving them the tools they need to invest \nwisely and to protect themselves from securities scams.\n  On one particularly memorable occasion in 1998, Chairman Levitt was \nscheduled to speak at an Investor's Town Meeting in Bangor, Maine. When \nbad weather thwarted his efforts to reach Bangor and the nearly 600 \nMaine citizens awaiting him, Chairman Levitt improvised, answering all \nof the questions from the audience by phone in what may have been the \nbiggest conference call in the history of the State. In Maine, we truly \nappreciate a person's ability to overcome the elements.\n  Chairman Levitt also brought his expertise to Capitol Hill, \ntestifying in 1997 before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, \nwhich I chair, about problems in the micro-cap markets--including penny \nstock fraud--and providing investors valuable insights on how to avoid \nfalling victims to the predators who lie in wait for the unwary. \nChairman Levitt testified before my Subcommittee again in 1999, this \ntime on the risks associated with day trading. Investor alertness and \ndiligence have been his watchwords, and his advice in this regard has \nbeen consistently sound.\n  A strong proponent of technological advances, Chairman Levitt worked \nto promote the use of technology not only in securities transactions, \nbut also in helping inform and educate investors through the Internet. \nUnder his guidance, the SEC's first Web site went online in 1995. \nToday, it provides valuable information and services--including access \nto the Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval database (also \nknown as ``EDGAR''), which contains a large volume of information about \npublic companies, including corporate annual reports filed with the SEC \nand disclosures of purchases and sales by corporate insiders. The SEC's \nWeb site also has an Investor Education and Assistance service, which \nadvises investors on how to invest wisely and avoid fraud, answers the \npublic's questions, and reviews investors' complaints.\n  Chairman Levitt has truly been a man for his time. With Americans \nflocking to take part in what has been the longest bull market in U.S. \nhistory, he championed the right of the small investor to a level \nplaying field with the big institutions. Last year, for example, the \nSEC approved the adoption of a regulation on Fair Disclosure, which \nrequires companies to disclose material, nonpublic information--such as \nearnings results and projections--simultaneously to Wall Street \nanalysts and the public. This new regulation makes significant strides \ntoward bringing individual investors into the information ``loop'' on a \ntimely basis.\n  In addition, Chairman Levitt oversaw the SEC's adoption in 1998 of \nthe Plain English Rule, which requires that public companies and mutual \nfunds prepare the cover page, summary, and risk factor portions of \ntheir prospectuses in clear, concise, and understandable English. The \nPlain English Rule finally makes prospectuses accessible to those \noutside the small circle of securities lawyers and market professionals \naccustomed to reading them.\n  Chairman Levitt has worked to ensure that the small investor gets the \nbest available price. In 1997, the SEC adopted its Order Handling Rule, \nwhich places individual investors' bids on an equal footing with those \nof professional traders on the NASDAQ. This Rule is designed to prevent \ncollusion among dealer and to promote competition in the market. At the \nsame time, Chairman Levitt has overseen the SEC's vigorous efforts to \nroot out Internet securities fraud and bring the perpetrators to \njustice.\n  Protecting investors' rights and rooting out securities fraud have \nlong been among my primary interests, and I have been both delighted \nand very fortunate to be able to work toward these ends with an SEC \nChairman who shares a powerful commitment to these goals. Mr. \nPresident, while small investors are losing a true friend at the SEC, I \nam confident that the benefits he brought them will endure for many \nyears to come.\n  Mr. President, I wish to thank Chairman Levitt for shepherding the \nsecurities market into the 21st Century, and ensuring that America's \nthriving markets are open to all investors, big and small, and are \nworthy of the public's confidence. I offer him my very best wishes for \nhis future undertakings.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as a lot of people have been doing, I have \nbeen watching and listening with a great deal of interest to the debate \nand the brilliant things that have been said about the proposed tax \ncut.\n  I think there are three significant things that have not come across \nin this debate, and I think we need to talk about that and concentrate \non it.\n  One is the myth that if we cut rates, somehow that is going to have \nthe result of cutting revenues. I do not know what we have to do in \nhistory to show that is not correct.\n  The first time that the whole idea--some call it supply side--came \nout was way back, following the First World War. At that time, it was \nthe Harding administration and the Coolidge administration. They raised \nmoney in order to fight the war. And, of course, that was successful. \nBut after the war, they decided that with the war effort gone, they \ncould reduce the taxes. They reduced the top rate from 73 percent to 25 \npercent. They thought that would have a dramatic reduction in the \nrevenues that were produced around our country. But they were willing \nto do it. To their surprise--this is the first time they had learned \nthis--the economy, as a result of that reduction from the top rate of \n73 percent down to 25 percent, actually grew the economy 59 percent \nbetween 1921 and 1929. And the revenues during that time grew from $719 \nmillion in 1921 to $1.16 billion in 1928.\n  Then along came the Kennedy administration. This is the one where I \ndon't understand how liberal Democrats can stand here and ignore the \nlesson that we learned during the Kennedy administration. Yes. Kennedy \nwanted more money spent on social programs. And he said on this floor \nthat we needed more money to raise more revenues to pay for all the \ndomestic programs we were getting into, and the best way to increase \nrevenue was to reduce taxes. At that time, the top tax rate was 91 \npercent.\n\n  So he reduced the taxes with the help of Congress from 91 percent \ndown to 70 percent, and exactly the same thing with exactly the same \npercentages that took place after World War I took place. Tax revenues \ngrew during that period of time, 1961 through 1968, by 62 percent.\n  I know there are a lot of people who don't want to believe this. I \ndon't want to unfairly attribute a quote to Laura Tyson, but I remember \nin 1993 she made a statement I interpreted to be: There is no \nrelationship between the taxes that a country pays and its economic \nperformance. Theoretically, if that is true, you could tax Americans \n100 percent and they would have the same motivation to stimulate the \neconomy as if they were taxed 50 percent. We knew that is not right.\n\n[[Page S1099]]\n\n  We had gone through that during the 1960s. For some reason, Democrats \ntoday will not acknowledge that. This is a lesson we learned from \nDemocrats. Of course, the 1980s came. In 1980, the total amount of \nrevenue raised to run the United States of America was $517 billion. In \n1990, that was $1 trillion. It almost doubled in that 10-year-period. \nThose are the 10 years we had the most dramatic marginal rate \nreductions in the history of America. If you take just the marginal \nrates, it was $244 billion raised in 1980 and $446 billion raised in \n1990. In that 10-year period it almost doubled, and that was dropping \nthe rate from the 70-percent top bracket we inherited from President \nKennedy when he brought it from 91 percent to 28 percent.\n  History has shown it will happen. Never once in the debate do we talk \nat all about the fact that it will not reduce revenues; it will \nincrease revenues. I have watched this happen over my short lifespan in \npolitics and have been surprised to find this is true. If the money is \nthere, the politicians will spend it.\n  One of the best political speeches I heard in my life was the first \none that Ronald Reagan made, ``A Rendezvous With Destiny.'' I bet some \ndon't remember it at all. In the speech he said, the closest thing to \nimmortality on the face of this Earth is a government program once \nstarted. That means if there is a problem, form a government program to \ntake care of it; the problem goes away but the program remains there. \nThis is a fact of life. It has repeated itself over and over again.\n\n  The second item--a lot of the liberals say this because it sounds \ngood to conservatives--let's go ahead and not have tax cuts until we \npay down the debt.\n  The Wall Street Journal had an article entitled, ``Where Do We Put \nthe Surplus?'' A couple of professors say we have a serious problem \nbecause if we wanted to take the surpluses projected, which is $5.5 \ntrillion in the next 10 years--upgraded by OMB to $6 trillion in that \nsame timeframe we would have to find someplace to put the money. If you \ndon't return it to the taxpayers, it will get spent. There aren't \nenough places you can put money like that because you can't pay down \nthe debt immediately. Some things have not matured. You can't force a \ndebt repayment in the publicly held portion, and the debt is $3 \ntrillion. You have to find a place to put it.\n  You can go into the equity market. If you go into the equity market, \nthat will create a problem. According to Greenspan, by the year 2020, \nif we take this course, the Government will own one-fifth of all \ndomestic equities. If there is anything we don't want to happen, it is \nto have Government owning 50 percent of the private equities in this \ncountry.\n  The last point is how modest this cut is. I would like to have it \nmuch greater than $1.6 trillion because I believe we can afford to do \nthat. During the Reagan administration, it was $1.6 trillion, but in \ntoday's dollars that would equal $6 trillion that we would actually \nhave as tax cuts. If you look at it another way, taking it as a \npercentage of the gross domestic product, what we are suggesting is \nsomewhere between a 0.9 and 1.2 percent cut in the gross domestic \nproduct. In the Kennedy years, it was 2.2 percent; during Reagan it was \n3.3 percent. This is far less than those tax cuts would have been.\n  I conclude by saying we have a decision to make--and it is a very \ndifficult decision--as to what to do with that amount of surplus.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Wall Street Journal article I referred to \nbe printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1)\n  Mr. INHOFE. I don't think there is any question, if we are honest, we \nwould deny that if we leave this money, it will be spent. Parkinson's \nlaw is: Government expands to consume the resources allocated to it, \nplus 10 percent. This has proven to be true over and over again.\n  I can argue as to the fairness of where this cut takes place. I could \ntalk about the fact that the top 5 percent of the income makers in this \ncountry actually pay 54 percent of the taxes; the bottom 50 percent \nonly pay 4.2 percent of the taxes. That begs the question. There is no \nreason to talk about the fairness of this because it is too logical. \nObviously, what we are going through now is an overpayment. We have \ntaxed the American people, and anyone out there right now--and there \nare millions of people who have paid any type of taxes--is entitled to \na refund. To redistribute that wealth would be as unfair as it would be \nif you went down to an auto dealership, bought a new car, paid the \nsticker price, got home and said: Wait, I paid $2,000 too much. And you \nget in the car and drive to the auto dealer and say: You overcharged me \n$2,000, and he says: I just gave it to my mother-in-law.\n  This is an overpayment of taxes we have made and I think people are \nentitled to have the overpayment back. If you do that, it will have the \neffect of increasing revenue, and stimulating the economy, which we \ndesperately need. We are on the brink right now of a recession.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 29, 2001]\n\n                      Where Do We Put the Surplus?\n\n               (By Kevin A. Hassett and R. Glenn Hubbard)\n\n       When historians look back on Alan Greenspan's tenure as \n     chairman of the Federal Reserve and attempt to identify the \n     source of his enormous success, last Thursday's Congressional \n     testimony--in which he advanced the course of tax reform--\n     will likely provide one answer. Mr. Greenspan raised a \n     pressing public-policy question that has been overlooked by \n     most, a question that will likely become the focal point of \n     political and economic debate during President Bush's first \n     four-year term.\n       If the U.S. government starts accumulating big surpluses, \n     where should it put the money?\n       That might not seem so tricky. After all, the government \n     already occasionally places deposits in private banks. But \n     this time we aren't talking nickels and dimes. Current \n     surplus estimates are so large that the government's passbook \n     savings account, if nothing changes, will soon become the \n     Mount Everest of cash hoards.\n       Let's look at the numbers. The latest Office of Management \n     and Budget forecast is for the surplus to reach about $5.5 \n     trillion over the next 10 years. Rumor has it that the soon-\n     to-be-released Congressional Budget Office forecast will peg \n     it at $6 trillion, with almost $1 trillion arriving in 2011 \n     alone. (Note: actual CBO numbers are $5.61 trillion, of which \n     $3.12 trillion will be the non-Social Security surplus)\n       Why not just pay down the debt? Put simply, there's not \n     that much debt to pay. According to the Treasury Department, \n     total government debt held by the public is only about $3 \n     trillion. With no change in tax policy, projected surpluses \n     would pay down the debt by around 2008. Government will \n     subsequently have to decide in what it will invest the \n     massive surpluses.\n       But that is far in the future. Many opponents of tax \n     reduction have suggested that we wait until the uncertain \n     surpluses arrive, and the $3 trillion of existing government \n     debt is retired, before considering tax cuts. Mr. Greenspan \n     had an answer for that as well: ``Private asset accumulation \n     may be forced upon us well short of reaching zero debt.''\n       Indeed, by some estimates, as much as half of existing \n     government debt will be almost impossible to retire, since \n     savings bonds and state and local government series bonds \n     often aren't redeemed until maturity, and because many \n     holders of long-term treasury bills will be unwilling to sell \n     them back to the government. Factor in that surplus estimates \n     keep getting revised upward, and government may well be \n     forced to invest in private assets in just three or four \n     years.\n       How big could the hoard get? Investing that much public \n     money would likely mean the government purchase of stocks, \n     because only equity markets are large enough to absorb such \n     inflows and still remain liquid. Assuming the Treasury begins \n     to invest surpluses in the stock market as soon as it has \n     retired all the debt that it can, and that these investments \n     earn a 10 percent annual return, our government will be \n     sitting on a stock-market portfolio worth $20 trillion by \n     2020. To put that in perspective, the current market value of \n     all equities in the U.S. is about $17 trillion, according to \n     the Federal Reserve. Projecting forward, the U.S. government \n     could own about one-fifth of all domestic equities by 2020.\n       Allowing the government to own that much of the \n     private economy is an invitation to unbounded mischief. \n     Firms will lobby to be put on the list of acceptable \n     investments; those firms or assets left off will suffer \n     hardship. Calls to sell firms that aren't ``green'' or \n     that fail to pass litmus tests will become the latest in \n     political lobbying. Which is why Mr. Greenspan stated \n     flatly: ``The federal government should eschew private \n     asset accumulation because it would be exceptionally \n     difficult to insulate the government's investment \n     decisions from political pressures.'' The risks are just \n     too great.\n       His argument on Thursday caught Democrats flat-footed. Sen. \n     Ernest Hollings of South Carolina told Mr. Greenspan that \n     ``in all candor, you shock me with your statement.'' An \n     apoplectic Sen. Charles Schumer\n\n[[Page S1100]]\n\n     of New York dubbed Mr. Greenspan's analysis a mistake.'' Such \n     venom is reserved for truly decisive arguments. Indeed, word \n     is out that economists at President Clinton's Council of \n     Economic Advisers prepared an analysis of this issue that \n     wasn't allowed to see the light of day.\n       Perhaps the Democratic senators had not previously \n     recognized that their opposition to tax cuts would require \n     the government to buy a massive share of private America. Mr. \n     Hollings later warned Mr. Greenspan that he was ``going to \n     start a stampede.'' It is not a stampede we will observe, but \n     a wholesale retreat by poll-conscious opponents of tax \n     reform, who will have little stomach to defend such a massive \n     government intrusion into private life. A large tax cut is \n     virtually a sure thing.\n       Which doesn't mean we've seen the last of this important \n     question. First, if supply-side arguments are correct, then \n     the marginal-rate reductions proposed by Mr. Bush will \n     eventually increase tax revenues and surpluses, presenting us \n     once again with the quandary of what to buy. Second, Social \n     Security continues to be on very weak footing in the long \n     run, and something must be done to stave off fiscal disaster. \n     This puts Democrats in a tough position. For if they reject \n     the option of allowing the government to hoard private assets \n     in anticipation of retiring baby boomers, there is--as Mr. \n     Greenspan highlighted elsewhere in his remarks--one \n     inevitable alternative: individual accounts.\n       In taking a stand on such important issues in such a public \n     forum, Mr. Greenspan has fundamentally altered the debate on \n     the surplus, taxes and government investment. From now on, \n     opponents of privatization will have to reveal just where it \n     is they intend to put our money, and convince us that those \n     investments will be economically benign.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the tax cuts \nproposed this week by President Bush and to join my colleagues in this \ndiscussion. As I listened to my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator \nInhofe, a number of the points he was making are the ones that I think \nare most germane to this discussion. He spoke eloquently; I have some \ncharts that support what he said.\n  He was talking about the one law that Government spending expands to \nreach the amount of Government resources we have available, plus 10 \npercent. I had not heard of that law, but it sounds as if it is fairly \naccurate.\n  I have a chart that shows that the surpluses lead to higher spending. \nWe can see that is what has taken place as we have had surpluses coming \non line in 1995 through the year 2002. We had an enormous growth in \ndiscretionary spending during the same period of time. This is a time \nperiod when we had a Democrat President and a Republican Congress. \nThere were supposed to be some restraints in spending, but the ironclad \nrule of Government is if there is a dollar left on the table anywhere, \nit will be spent. We now see that is, indeed, what has taken place \nwhere the discretionary spending has increased. If you leave the money \non the table, it will get spent.\n  I want to talk about another thing that my colleague addressed, as \nhave others, and that is tax freedom day, the day we finally start \nworking for ourselves and stop working for the Government. This day, \nunfortunately, has continued to grow longer in the career. We have less \nfreedom from taxation in this country right now than at any time since \nWorld War II.\n  I will first show the size of the overall tax cuts President Bush has \nput forward. They are pretty modest. My colleague from Oklahoma was \ndiscussing the relatively small size of the tax cuts in proportion to \nthe economy. This is the percentage of Gross Domestic Product. The Bush \ntax cut is 1.2 percent of GDP which is quite small, in my estimation. \nWe should be talking about a larger tax cut given the difficulty our \neconomy is starting to show. We are seeing some slowness in the \neconomy. We need to stimulate it both in fiscal and in monetary policy. \nThe Fed is coming forward with monetary policy, and we need to come \nforward with fiscal policy.\n\n  You can see Ronald Reagan had a 3.3-percent cut in percentage of GDP, \nand President Kennedy had a 2-percent cut. I think we ought to be \ngetting up to this 2-percent category and talking more along the lines \nof a $2 trillion tax cut. This will stimulate the economy, keeping it \nfrom going into recession. That is the best thing to do to ensure that \nwe maintain a surplus; with people doing well in this country, we can \navoid an economic recession. That is what we are starting to face.\n  This is a modest tax cut, particularly given the times and situation. \nWe need to do so to help stimulate the overall economy. I think a 2-\npercent cut overall, a $2 trillion tax cut, would be more in keeping \nwith traditional sizes of major tax cuts and would keep our economy \nfrom slipping into an actual recession.\n  You can see what has happened to tax freedom day. This is the day you \nstop working for the Government and start working for yourself. It \nextended until May 3 in the year 2000. People are working for \ngovernment at all levels of the government until May 3.\n  I just bought a used car from an individual. He asked me what I did, \nand I told him I worked in the Senate. He said: If you guys can, do \nanything to cut taxes, I have a paycheck that comes in, and I never \nlook at the gross number because it just depresses me. I just basically \ncut my gross wage in half, and that is how much I get to take home. \nJust cut it in half, was his statement.\n  We ask people why they are having difficulties with the situation at \nhome, with their families. They don't have enough money to take care of \ntheir kids, buy braces, pay for education, and take care of the normal \nexpenses. They need to have at least two jobs in this family, maybe \nmore.\n  Why is that? We look at this chart and see one of the big cost \ndrivers in that situation. It is the tax burden.\n  Look at what happened in the 1990s. In this time period, it has gone \nup precipitously. That shows how much people work for the Government \nrather than working for themselves. Is it any wonder people experience \nstress or have difficulty in their family situation, when they are \nworking for somebody else, who gets close to half the year?\n  How does this break down? I want to break down this tax freedom day \nissue. These are the minutes in an 8-hour day that you are working for \ngovernment, or other taxes that you are paying. Look at how many \nminutes of an 8-hour day you are working for Federal taxes: 112 \nminutes. It is getting close to 2 hours a day that you are working for \nthe Federal Government. I appreciate you working for us that much. I am \nglad people are doing that.\n\n  My point in highlighting this is that it is too much. It is too long. \nYou should not be working for the Government that amount of time.\n  Look at the Federal Government, but also look at State and local \ntaxes. You add another 50 minutes to that. We are getting close to 3 \nhours of your workday to pay for Federal taxes and State and local \ntaxes. That is before you ever pay for housing, health care, food, \nrecreation, transportation, clothing, and put money away in savings. \nWhat happens to savings when you take this big of a bite out of it?\n  This chart puts a graphic on it, and it shows that if you start \nworking at 9 a.m., you are basically working in the morning for the \nGovernment, and then the rest of the day you are working for other \nthings. The morning is basically given to the Government.\n  It is nice that people are willing to do that, but my point is that \nit is too long, it is too much, it is taking too much from them, and it \nis hurting our families and individuals. This is just to point out how \nmuch it is, how it breaks down. This is from the Tax Foundation.\n  How much per dollar of a median family income goes to taxes, \ncomparing 1955 to 1998? In 1955--Federal income tax was 9 cents. \nFederal payroll tax, other Federal tax, State and local taxes, were 3 \ncents. In 1955, we had a pretty good size Government. In 1998, after-\ntax income was 61 cents; we are nearly at 40 percent today.\n  Look at the size of this Federal payroll tax. When I go to high \nschool senior classes, two-thirds of the groups with which I speak are \npaying taxes. The tax that they are paying is Federal payroll tax, \nwhich for most people in this country is larger than any other single \ntax they pay. This is one tax about which we are going to have a lot of \ndiscussion.\n  This chart shows other Federal taxes and State and local taxes, which \nhave increased a great deal as well. This breaks it down on the dollar.\n  Finally, this is tax freedom day by type of tax. Many people don't \nrealize all of the taxes that they pay. Basically, on anything you do, \nyou are paying a tax. If you turn on a water faucet\n\n[[Page S1101]]\n\nin the morning, there is going to be a tax on the water that comes \nthrough. If you use the phone, there is a phone tax. If you die, there \nis going to be a death tax, and if you get married, there is a marriage \npenalty tax--both of which I think we need to address and eliminate.\n  We have a system where we have figured out how to tax virtually \neverything you do or that happens to you. It creates these type of \nburdens.\n  To pay individual income taxes, we are working 50 days a year. You \ncan look at the others. Business taxes, corporate taxes, property \ntaxes, estate and excise taxes, social insurance taxes are also on this \nchart. It is a big overall burden.\n\n  One person has suggested, instead of having payroll taxes, that we \nrequire a person to each month write a check out to the Government for \ntheir level of taxes rather than taking it out of the account. If we \nreally wanted to cut taxes, we should do that so people could see that \neach month when they wrote that check out. It is a heavy burden.\n  I wanted to put that forward to put some context on this. When we \ntalk about a $1.6 trillion tax cut--which I think actually should be at \nthe $2 trillion category--we are overburdening people on taxes now. \nThis is clear. We need help in stimulating the economy. This is clear. \nWe should not be taxing things such as marriage when it is the \nfoundational unit for the family. We need to get rid of the marriage \npenalty tax.\n  I want my colleagues, particularly from Texas and Georgia, who put \nthis tax plan forward, to know I am going to be aggressively pushing to \nget rid of the full marriage penalty tax rather than a portion of it, \nwhich is in this current bill. I think we have to do much better \ntowards our working families, particularly getting rid of the marriage \npenalty tax. I also hope that we can make these tax cuts retroactive to \nstimulate the economy.\n  I point out to my colleagues as well about the surplus--we have been \npaying down the debt, and we will continue to do so. We have paid down \nthe debt by about $360 billion over the last 3 years. We will continue \nto pay the debt down. However, those surpluses have led to increased \ngovernment spending as well. So we need to get some of the tax dollars \nout of the system and back into people's individual pockets.\n  Finally, we have the wherewithal to do this and to protect Social \nSecurity. We can do a $2 trillion tax cut and we can still pay the debt \ndown at the current rate (if not more than what we are currently doing) \nand provide for substantial Federal Government needs that we have \nidentified. That is all doable because the projection on our own \nreceipts is substantial enough that we can get that accommodated--\nroughly in the $5.6 trillion surplus over the next 10 years.\n  We need to do this. American working families need this to take \nplace. It is the right thing to do. It is the right time to do it. I \nhope we do not waste much more time before we actually get these tax \ncuts in place.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Wyoming for hosting this \ndialog and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, this, obviously, is the week and the time \nto be talking about taxes, tax relief, and tax reductions.\n  It is an appropriate time to deal with all of the involved issues. \nCertainly, the President has talked a great deal about his tax plan not \nonly in the campaign but certainly now as he is prepared to reveal and \nunveil this plan of relieving the tax burden on all taxpayers.\n  The plan, of course, is oriented toward stimulating economic growth, \nreducing family tax burdens, and saving family estates from the auction \nblock, and hopefully making this Tax Code simpler and more fair. That \nis an important aspect of it. We talk all the time about the Tax Code \nbeing so detailed and complex, and yet we do not do much about it.\n  I hope we do not start seeking to have directed tax reductions here, \nthere, and other places, aimed more at behavior than at tax reductions. \nThis is designed to make it simpler, and that is important.\n  The case for the President's relief package is strong. First, there \nis a record surplus of taxes coming in. It is really a tax overpayment. \nThat makes possible a policy of paying down the debt and reducing taxes \non working families.\n  Second, the slowing down of the economy has many people concerned and \nproperly so. Absent some kind of fiscal stimulus, our record economic \nexpansion may turn downward and into a recession.\n  The third argument is the one my friends have talked about this \nmorning, but I think it is really the issue for most of us, and that is \nthe burgeoning tax burden on American families.\n  No matter how one looks at it as a proportion of national income, the \nburden persists as compared to other family expenses. Actual time spent \nworking just to fund the Federal Government is taking more of a typical \nfamily's income than at any other time in history. Isn't that \ninteresting? Almost any time in history.\n  Federal revenues for fiscal year 2000 pulled more than $2 trillion \nout of the economy for the first time in American history. Along with \nthat being the highest level ever, the Federal tax burden is also the \nhighest rate of gross domestic product since World War II. In 1944, \nrevenues reached 20.9 percent of GDP. Today, revenues have returned to \nthat extraordinary level. They are at 20.6 percent, well above the \nhistorical norm.\n  Interestingly enough, since 1935, the average tax burden has been \n17.2 percent. Never during the Korean war, the Vietnam war, or the cold \nwar did it ever reach 20 percent. Yet the Federal tax burden continues \nto take more financial power out of the economy without a particular \ncause.\n  In the last few years, the American people have had to pay 20 percent \nof what they earned. The impact on the economy, on families, and the \ntaxpayers has been extraordinary. We have an opportunity to do some \nthings differently, and I hope we do that.\n  The current tax system, I believe, is a mess. Just think how \ndifficult it is for all of us as we prepare our tax returns. We often \nsay if anyone cannot make out their own return, it must be too complex. \nSeldom are people able to make out their own.\n  After 80 years of lawmakers, lobbyists, and special interests working \non it--which will continue--it is unfair; it is complex; it is costly. \nThose are the kinds of things of which I hope, as we move forward, we \ncan take advantage. Someone suggested taxpayers devote almost 5.5 \nbillion hours a year to the preparation of tax returns. The other \nthing--and it depends, I suppose, on your point of view and philosophy \nwith respect to Government; if one believes Government ought to be \ncontained in its growth, that there are limits to in what the \nGovernment ought to be involved--the Federal Government in particular--\nwhy, this has something to do with that.\n\n  When there is a surplus, it is more difficult to maintain limits on \nthe growth of Government than it is when there is not a surplus. \nObviously, we want to fund the essentials such as health care, \neducation, and Social Security. There also ought to be a limit on the \ngrowth of Government, the involvement of Government.\n  We are saying all the time that the Federal Government is involved in \ntoo many things; we ought to give more emphasis to State and local \ngovernments; we ought to evaluate what is the legitimate role of the \nFederal Government. I believe that is true, but that depends on your \nphilosophy of government.\n  We are going to hear arguments during the course of this discussion \nthat there needs to be more Government, more Government spending. If \none believes that is the direction we ought to go, there is no end to \nthe programs. It is very difficult, once a Federal Government program \nis in place and builds a constituency around it, to change it, to \neliminate it, to reduce it.\n  It comes down to a philosophy of government. When you have, as in \nthis case, a surplus of dollars, what do you do with it? You can spend \nit and increase the size of Government. That is a philosophy we hear \nquite often in this Chamber. Another is we ought to limit the role of \nthe Federal Government; we ought to use our best judgment to determine \nwhich of those\n\n[[Page S1102]]\n\nthings are most important, which of those things are essential, which \nof those things can only be done by the Federal Government as opposed \nto local and State governments, which of those things should be done in \nthe private sector as opposed to the Federal Government. All those \nthings have a play in what you do in the future.\n  I happen to believe we ought to be paying down the debt. It is unfair \nfor us to have gone into debt over the last number of years to finance \nprograms young people will have to pay for. We can do that.\n  I am persuaded that under the President's program we can pay down the \ndebt over this period of time. I am persuaded that we will have \nadequate money to spend on essential programs.\n  At the same time, we can substantially reduce the tax burden on \nAmerican families, and that is very much what we want to do.\n  I do believe one of the elements of taxes ought to be fairness. One \nof the issues we have talked about for some time and passed last year, \nonly to be vetoed by the President, was the marriage tax penalty. It \nreally does not make sense from a fairness standpoint that a single man \nand woman earning this amount of money pays x amount of dollars; if \nthey are married, making the same amount of money, they pay more. That \nis a fairness issue and one that needs to be decided.\n  Of course, the estate tax also is one that many argue is a fairness \nissue. People, particularly on farms, ranches, and in small businesses, \nwork their whole lives to create some capital and assets, and if they \nown property, as many ranchers and farmers do, they have to pay this \n55-percent estate tax. They have to dispose of the property to do that \nand that seems unfair. There are some legislative ideas, and I do not \nknow which one will prevail. There can be expansion of exemptions, and \nthere can be elimination, which I favor. There can also be some efforts \nmade to pass these on without taxes and allow then for a tax to be \nplaced on their growth.\n  There are many things we can do. The President has put forth a \npackage that is very useful, one that deals with the issues as we see \nthem, one which will bring fairness, one which will bring a reduction \nin costs, one which will pay down the debt, one which will allow us to \ngo ahead and fund those programs that we deem to be essential and of a \nhigh priority.\n  We have an opportunity to do that now. I am hopeful we will move \nforward and do it quickly, to the benefit of this country, its economy, \nits taxpayers, and all of its families.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be working with \nmy colleague, Senator Thomas, today, and all of this week, to talk \nabout the tax cuts we have tried to provide for hard-working American \nfamilies.\n  We have been trying to give tax relief to working Americans for the \nlast 3 years, but we had a President who did not agree with us. Every \ntime we sent him a tax relief bill, it got vetoed.\n  But today we have a President who agrees with us that hard-working \nAmericans deserve to keep more of the money they earn. Because we \nbelieve it is their money, not ours, we want them to have the choices.\n  So we do have a proposal that Congress and the President are going to \nwork together, hopefully, on a very bipartisan basis, to produce for \nthe American people something they can realize, not something that is \nso complicated and minuscule and fractionated that nobody is ever going \nto know they got a tax cut. What we want is real tax relief for hard-\nworking Americans.\n  It is pretty simple. The basic part of this tax relief plan would \nreplace the current five-rate tax structure--which is 15 percent, 28 \npercent, 31 percent, 36 percent, and 39.6 percent--with four lower tax \nbrackets: 10 percent, not 15 percent, would be the lower bracket; then \n15 percent; then 25 percent; and then 33 percent.\n  That is the bulk of the tax relief plan that we will send to \nPresident Bush if we can get the support of our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle.\n  For a couple with two children, making $35,000 they will have their \ntaxes eliminated. For a couple with two children, making $50,000, their \ntaxes will be cut by 50 percent. For a couple with two children, making \n$75,000 their taxes will be cut by 25 percent.\n  This is tax relief that people will be able to experience. We also \nhope that people will feel so good that they will buy the car they have \nbeen waiting to buy or that they will know then that they will be able \nto make the downpayment on the house they have been saving for--\nsomething that will spur the economy because there is no question our \neconomy is not growing right now. It is stagnant.\n  But we think it can be revived if there is consumer confidence. \nConsumer confidence would come if people feel good about their jobs and \ntheir prospects and if they have more money in their pockets. So this \nis a very important staple of the tax cut plan.\n  The part that I have been working on personally for so many years is \nthe marriage penalty tax cut. Why, in America, would we have to ask \npeople to choose between love and money? The fact is, most couples in \nAmerica, indeed, have to pay an average of $1,400 more in taxes just \nbecause they got married.\n  Who does this hit the hardest? It hits the policeman and the \nschoolteacher who get married and all of a sudden find they have $1,000 \nmore that they owe to Uncle Sam--$1,000 they could certainly use. So we \nwant to help married couples not have to pay any penalty whatsoever.\n  Why should you pay a penalty just because you got married? It does \nnot make sense. So we want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty. In \nfact, I am going to be working with others to make the marriage penalty \ntax cut part of our tax plan significant. We believe we should double \nthe standard deduction, that you should not have to pay more in a \nstandard deduction because you are married than you would if you had \ntwo single income-earning people. So we are going to try to change \nthat.\n\n  We are going to encourage charitable contributions by allowing people \nwho have saved and put money in their IRAs through the years--if they \nfind out they do not need that money because they are doing OK, and \ntheir kids are doing OK--to give some of that money to charity if they \nwant. But there is a big bar to doing that today, and that is the tax \nconsequence. You cannot just take the money out and give it to the \ncharity; You have to pay the taxes.\n  So we want to eliminate that tax, if it is going to go straight to \ncharity. This will encourage people to do things that will enhance our \ncommunities, and that is to give to the charity of their choice.\n  We want to try to help parents by doubling the child tax credit. \nPresident Bush has made this a priority. He wants to make sure that we \nhave a $1,000 per child tax credit rather than the $500 per child tax \ncredit that we are working toward today because we know it costs a lot \nof money to raise a family. Children grow. They grow out of their \nclothes; they eat a lot; they need to be healthy; and they need to be \nwell fed and well dressed.\n  The occupant of the Chair is smiling because he has nine children. He \nknows. He has been there. He has fed and clothed them. He knows this is \nsomething that parents need the help to do.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased to be here and be a part of the \ngroup that is talking about the Bush tax cuts. We are talking about the \nBush tax cuts for hard-working American families. We are talking about \nCongress working with the President on a bipartisan basis for a lot of \nreasons to let people keep more of the money they earn. That is the \nbottom line.\n  We want people to be able to keep the money they earn because we \nbelieve it belongs to them, not to us. We believe families, especially, \nshould get the break they so badly need.\n  We are being taxed at a higher rate today than ever in peacetime. I \nam very pleased that we have this tax relief plan. We know it is going \nto pass. That is what pleases me. Before, when we had been working on \ntax cuts, we had a President who would threaten to veto them every time \nwe sent them to him. Today, we have a tax cut plan with a President who \nsays he is going to sign it.\n  So we feel very good about that. We are going to be talking about it \nand hope the people of this country realize\n\n[[Page S1103]]\n\nwe are going to do something significant for every taxpaying American. \nThose in the lowest brackets will get the most relief; those in the \nupper brackets will get the least relief, but they will get some \nrelief. We think it is fair to target it to middle-income and low-\nincome people. We want them to get the most benefit. They are the ones \nwho pay the most per capita, per income dollar. We want to relieve \nthat, but we want every working American who pays taxes to get relief.\n  Mr. President, I am very proud to be here with my colleague, Senator \nPete Domenici. Senator Domenici is, of course, the person who heads our \nBudget Committee. He knows, in the final analysis, it is his committee \nthat is going to give us a budget that is balanced, that pays down the \ndebt, that takes care of the increases in spending that we know we are \ngoing to need in places such as education, national defense, Medicare \nreform, prescription drug benefits and options, and give back to hard-\nworking Americans some of their tax money.\n\n  I cannot think of anyone that I would trust to be able to do that \nthan my colleague from New Mexico. I will now turn the floor over to \nhim.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank my good friend from Texas.\n  Mr. President, I know that by some strange coincidence the occupant \nof the Chair seems to occupy the Chair quite frequently when the \nSenator from New Mexico speaks. I do not know what that bodes for the \ndistinguished Senator, but I will try to make it interesting today, \nagain, perhaps.\n  First, I am here because I want to share with the American people, \nand my constituents in New Mexico, the fact that this fiscal situation \nof our Nation is about as good as any generation could expect. This is \na good situation. I have been here during times when we were going into \ndebt almost as fast as we were gaining surpluses each year.\n  We had accumulated enormous annual debts that we called the \n``deficit,'' and the first good news is that by the time this year \nends, we will have reduced the debt of our Nation by $600 billion. That \nis for real. That is not a graph. That is not a projection. We have \nalready paid it down substantially. Unless something very dramatic \nhappens in the next few months, that total number will be $600 billion \nin reduction.\n  Interestingly enough, a few weeks ago, probably the most \ndistinguished American on matters economic, and probably the most \ndistinguished American in terms of impact for the positive on the \nAmerican economy, Dr. Alan Greenspan, appeared before the Budget \nCommittee of the Senate. For some people, it was a bombshell when he \nsaid in the course of his discussion, just as deficits can get too big \nand hurt the economy, so can surpluses get too big and, if not handled \nright, can hurt the economy. He came to that conclusion on the basis of \nhis own assessment of where we are going. And without saying it, he \ncertainly lent great credence to a big fact: surpluses are generating \non the inside of the American budget at rates and levels never expected \nor understood in America.\n  He at least implicitly acknowledged that the Congressional Budget \nOffice was on the right track in estimating that the surpluses were \ngrowing and growing, and we were told a few days later by the \nCongressional Budget Office--and when we say that, we mean the whole \nparaphernalia that goes with estimating the American economy groups of \neconomists, economists within the Congressional Budget Office, \ncomparing their results with all kinds of outside estimators whose job \nit is, because of the businesses they work for or the funds they \ncontrol, to be as right as they can--that the Congressional Budget \nOffice which Dr. Greenspan was looking at was giving us their best \nestimate.\n  There are some who say it is only an estimate. They could give us an \nestimate that is not their best estimate that would say the surplus is \ngoing to be $9 trillion. They could give us another estimate which \nwould not be their best estimate that the surplus in the next decade is \ngoing to be $1 trillion. But when they were asked, which one should we \nbuild our policy on, the answer was, the modest growth path, the modest \npath in terms of increases in productivity, nonetheless sustained \nproductivity increases and sustained and very large over the next \ndecade. Use the one we gave you, they said.\n  There are some people down here talking about all the possibilities \nand all the probabilities. When we are told about Social Security 40 \nyears from now, Medicare 30, 40, or 50 years from now, we are using the \nbest we can in giving those notions of costs and liabilities.\n  We have $5.6 trillion. Let's just start right off and say, it is our \nresponsibility to take a good look, with our fellow Senators, at what \nwe ought to do with it. Let me start by saying, we want to pay the debt \ndown as soon as practicable. It is no longer as soon as possible \nbecause we have been told now by both the Congressional Budget Office, \nour experts, and Dr. Alan Greenspan, that there is a limit as to how \nfast we pay it down.\n  First, there is a limit because there is certain of our indebtedness \nthat we cannot buy up; it is just not viable, such as savings bonds and \nthe like; they are going to be there.\n  There is other long-term debt that is too expensive to try to \npersuade the holders of those debts to cash them in now; it costs too \nmuch money. So close to $1 trillion cannot be paid off as soon as we \nhave the surplus.\n  We were told by Dr. Greenspan to use a glidepath for the reduction of \nthe debt, and we will use one in whatever proposals we make to the \ncommittee--I will as chairman--and whatever we make to the Senate and \nto the people. The debt will be coming down rather fast, but not as \nfast as the money is accruing in the surplus because we are being told \nit won't work. We are also being told that is probably not good for the \nfuture of the American economy.\n  Let me talk about the future of the American economy. There is a lot \nbeing discussed today about Social Security 20, 30, 40 years from now, \nand Medicare during the same time interval. Those who work very hard at \ndemographics, telling us how many people are going to be collecting \nfrom these two major beneficiaries programs, how many are going to be \npaying in, and how much money we are going to have sitting around, are \nall suggesting, from what I hear, that the very best thing that can \nhappen is that the American economy has very prolonged intervals of \nsustained growth with high productivity, much like the last 9 or 10 \nyears. If we want the best outcome for the seniors of America, the baby \nboom population, in terms of their health care that we can pay for and \ntheir Social Security being payable, just have, during the next 40 \nyears, three 9-year growth patterns, or four, like the immediate past \nones we have had. That will put us closer to being able to meet our \nobligations than any other policy we can undertake in the Congress.\n  In fact, another thing that has been discussed is a rainy day fund. \nThe best rainy day fund is sustained economic growth over a prolonged \nperiod of time. That is the best rainy day fund.\n  Why do I raise this right in the middle of a discussion about \nsurpluses and what should we do with them? Because we are in a slowdown \nright now. We have different versions of how severe this slowdown is in \nthe economy. Again, he has been correct most of the time. Dr. Greenspan \nsays it is short lived and it is not too deep, and he is correcting it \nin terms of the short term by substantially lowering the interest, \nwhich is within the Federal Reserve Board's power. They have done that \nin a rather dramatic fashion the last couple months, and I surmise they \nwill do some more.\n  The question becomes, what policy could we adopt up here that would \nfit in with these interest reductions and produce long-term growth at \nsustained rates with low rates of inflation and probably high \nproductivity?\n  The best thing we can do is, one, pay down the debt on a glide path \nwhich says we will get it down but not abruptly. We will get it down \nwithin 2 or 3 years of the time that we would get it down if we put all \nof it on there, or tried to. Then we would take all of the Social \nSecurity trust fund money, put it in a lockbox; Medicare. And then we \ncould still provide for very high priority items, both in \nappropriations and elsewhere. And what is left could, indeed, be $1.6 \ntrillion that we ought to\n\n[[Page S1104]]\n\ngive back to the American people rather than keep up here to be spent.\n  If we do not give some of this back to the American people, and start \nsoon giving it back a little bit each year, I think the highest \nprobability is that the pressure that will be responded to will be to \nspend it. There is already some evidence that in the last 6 months we \nhave spent over the baseline, over the amount that would have been \nexpected, $561 billion over the next decade. That is what we have done \nin appropriations. That is what we have done in entitlements. That is \nwhat we have done for veterans and a whole list of them. Surplus was \nhere in abundance. Spending occurred in abundance, and I believe the \nAmerican people would not like to see a much larger Government because \nof these surpluses. I think they would like to see Government at the \nmost efficient level possible.\n  They would clearly like us to give some of this money back to them. I \nwill leave for others on another day whose tax plan is best. I already \nhear Democrats saying they want a tax cut but not as large as the \nPresident does, and they want different shapes and models of it. So, \nfrom my standpoint, I am not going to discuss the details of the plan, \nother than to say one thing: That same Dr. Alan Greenspan who came upon \nthese facts and suggested to us that if we didn't give some of this \nmoney back to the people, there would be an accumulation of money in \nthe hands of the Federal Government--and he saw no alternative other \nthan the Federal Government would start investing it in assets of \nAmerica--contends that would be a negative factor on the growth, \nprosperity, and efficiency of the American economy, which is what we \nneed for the future of Social Security and Medicare and for our people \nto have sustained, increasing paychecks.\n  When you add all this together, you would then say if you are going \nto give part of it back to the American people--and I want everybody to \nunderstand that after you take all the Social Security money and put it \nwhere it belongs, you have $3.1 trillion that is sitting there over the \nnext decade if you believe, or at least have sufficient trust in the \nestimating, as I do, to act upon it. It is $3.1 trillion. That is \nalmost unfathomable to people listening, and probably to most Senators \nand their staffs and my staff and me--$3.1 trillion. I could give you a \nnumber. Our whole budget for everything, including entitlements, \nappropriations, and the like is somewhere around $1.6 trillion to $1.8 \ntrillion per year. So here we have a surplus that is almost twice as \nbig as the total outlays of the Federal Government for a full year. \nThat is at least a comparable.\n  That same Dr. Greenspan has consistently told us, if you have a \nsurplus, the best thing you can do is pay down the debt. He has \nqualified that now and said, yes, pay it down under a glidepath that is \nbest for America. Don't pay it down abruptly because you are apt to \ncreate money in the pockets and drawers of the American Government that \nwill invest it in less efficient Government by acquiring assets, owning \nthings.\n  Having said that, what else has he said repeatedly and reconfirmed? \nIf you are going to have a positive impact on the prosperity level of \nAmericans and have the economy grow, the best tax medicine is marginal \nrate reductions. Cut everybody's marginal taxes some. He says it will \nincrease savings, it will increase investment, and it is the best way \nto use tax dollars. He says the third and worst way to have a positive \nimpact on our future is to spend the surplus.\n  I believe we are moving in the right direction. Debate is good and \nthe President is leading well. I think before we are finished, we will \nhave a significant tax cut of the right kind and still do the marriage \npenalty and death taxes, and we will have a very formidable expenditure \nbudget. Everything can grow substantially, especially priority items. I \nthink if we work together and work with the President, we can give the \nAmerican people something very good by the end of this year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Under the previous order, the time \nfrom 12 noon to 1 p.m. is under the control of the Senator from West \nVirginia, Mr. Byrd.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/07/senate-section/article/S1104-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1104-S1110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PROJECTED SURPLUSES\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have listened to my distinguished friend \nfrom New Mexico with great interest. May I compliment him on the broad \nrange of testimony that his Budget Committee has been acquiring through \nexpert witnesses. I am a new member of the committee. I am very \nimpressed with the well-organized, well-focused hearings that are being \nconducted in that committee.\n  Mr. President, our Nation is facing a fork in the road. The \nCongressional Budget Office is projecting a 10-year surplus of $2.7 \ntrillion, excluding the Social Security and Medicare surpluses. These \nsurpluses provide us with the opportunity to invest in our future and \nto deal with the long-term threats to the budget, such as the \nretirement of the baby boom generation.\n  The administration is proposing large and ballooning tax cuts which, \nif enacted, would have a significant impact on the Federal budget for \ndecades to come. It falls to the Congress to decide how much to \nallocate to tax cuts, how much to spending increases, and how much to \nreserve for debt reduction.\n  Before we make these decisions, we must first decide whether we have \nsufficient confidence in the surplus estimates to use them to make \nlong-term budget decisions. In his recent testimony before the Senate \nBudget Committee, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan--and \nhis name has been referred to already by my dear colleague, Mr. \nDomenici--expressed his hope that we use caution. He said:\n\n       In recognition of the uncertainties in the economic and \n     budget outlook, it is important that any long-term tax plan \n     or spending initiative, for that matter, be phased in. \n     Conceivably, (the long-term tax plan) could include \n     provisions that, in some way, would limit surplus-reducing \n     actions if specified targets for the budget surplus and \n     federal debt were not satisfied.\n\n  Now, while we all rely on the professional estimates provided by the \nCongressional Budget Office, we must recognize that long-term budget \nprojections often have proved to be wrong. In its own report, entitled \n``The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2002-2011,'' released \nlast week, CBO characterizes its estimates as uncertain. On page 95 of \nthat report, CBO States that the estimated surplus could be off in one \ndirection or the other, on average, by about $52 billion in fiscal year \n2001, by $120 billion in fiscal year 2002, and by $412 billion in \nfiscal year 2006. CBO confirmed in testimony before the Senate Budget \nCommittee last week that this uncertainty would grow even larger for \nfiscal year 2007 through fiscal year 2011.\n  Further evidence of the volatility of these estimates can be found on \npage XV of the summary of the CBO report. In summary table 2, entitled \n``Changes in CBO's Projections of the Surplus Since July 2000,'' CBO \nchanges its 10-year revenue estimate by $919 billion. In just 6 months, \ntherefore, from July of 2000 to January of 2001, CBO changed its \nrevenue estimate, I repeat, by $919 billion and its 10-year estimate of \nthe surplus by over $1 trillion for economic and technical reasons \nalone.\n  In its report, CBO concludes that there is ``some significant \nprobability'' that the surpluses will be quite different from the CBO \nbaseline projections.\n  Let me now use this chart, entitled ``Uncertainty in CBO's \nProjections of the Surplus Under Current Policies, in Trillions of \nDollars.'' In fact, CBO indicates that, ``there is some probability, \nalbeit small, that the budget might fall into deficit in the year 2006, \neven without policy changes.'' So on page xviii of the report, CBO \nindicates that the probability that actual surpluses will fall--we can \nsee that in the darkest area on the chart--is only 10 percent.\n  The probability that the surplus will fall in the shaded area is 90 \npercent. Imagine that after some 15 years of crawling and scratching to \nget out of the deficit hole, the ``d'' word just might reappear in our \nnational vocabulary in a scant 5 years even if we stay the course. The \n``d'' word of course, is ``deficit.''\n  Yet we are now being asked by President Bush and the Republican \nleadership to use these extremely tenuous 10-year budget estimates as \nthe baseline for considering a tax cut that could\n\n[[Page S1105]]\n\ncost $2 trillion or more over the next 10 years. We have been down this \nroad before, and sadly I went along for the ride. In 1981, as my good \nfriend, the senior Senator from Maryland, Mr. Sarbanes, well knows, \nPresident Reagan proposed a large tax cut over 5 years. There are not \nmany in this town who remember that his 5-year budget plan projected a \nsurplus for fiscal year 1984 of $1 billion; for fiscal year 1985, a \nsurplus of $6 billion; and for fiscal year 1986, a surplus of $28 \nbillion.\n  Congress passed the tax cut bill that reduced revenues by over $1 \ntrillion from fiscal year 1982 to fiscal year 1987. Did the Reagan \nadministration's projected surpluses come to pass? No. In fact, \nprecisely the opposite occurred. The fiscal year 1984 deficit was not a \nsurplus of $1 billion as projected. The fiscal year 1984 deficit was \n$185 billion--using the ``d'' word, ``deficit.'' The fiscal year 1985 \ndeficit was $212 billion. The fiscal year 1986 deficit was $221 \nbillion.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. These figures are the actual deficit figures the \nSenator is talking about.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, indeed.\n  Mr. SARBANES. They should be contrasted with the projections which \nwere made only a few years before--projections which projected \nsurpluses. Am I correct?\n  Mr. BYRD. Precisely.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I think this is an extraordinarily important point. We \nhave these projections now. We are talking about having a surplus of \ntrillions over 10 years, and yet two-thirds of the surplus being \nprojected now is in the last 5 years of the 10-year period.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Everyone has underscored that you can't really base a \npolicy on these projections, they are so uncertain. As the Senator \npointed out earlier in his statement, in just 6 months the \nCongressional Budget Office changed its projections to raise the \nsurplus estimate by about $1 trillion between last summer and last \nmonth.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. That is remarkable.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I want to bring one other fact to your attention, and \nthen I will certainly yield back to the Senator.\n  Just to show you how fragile these budget surplus estimates are, in \n1995 CBO estimated that in the year 2000 we would have a deficit of \n$342 billion. Five years out they were making that projection. Instead, \nwe had a surplus of $236 billion, because we restrained ourselves on \nspending. We recouped taxes in order to balance the budget. That is a \nswing of $578 billion from the projections to the actuality. That was \nonly projecting 5 years. Now we are talking about projections that go \nfor 10 years.\n  I think the Senator is absolutely right to underscore the fragile \nnature, which would be the best way to put it, of budget projections. \nThese projections have almost an evaporating dimension to them. I think \nwe have to be extremely careful, cautious, and prudent in planning our \npolicy if we are using these kinds of projections.\n\n  Of course, the Senator just underscored it, by outlining the \nprojections that were made in the Reagan years to support the tax cut \nand how far from the mark they were, only a few years later--not quite \nimmediately, but only a few years later.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator. He served with me as we \nsought to have the President postpone the third year of that 3-year tax \ncut until such time as we could see what the impact of the 2 previous \nyears' tax cuts was going to be on the budget and on the economy.\n  I remember going down to the White House. I was the minority leader \nat that time. As I say, there in the Oval Office I said to the \nPresident: Mr. President, you are proposing a tax cut over 3 years--I \nbelieve it was 3 years-- 5 percent, then 10 percent, and then 10 \npercent? It may not be the exact sequence, but those are the correct \nnumbers. Why not wait until we see what the results are and the impact \nis for the first 2 years? Why go ahead now and add a third year of tax \ncuts? Why do it now? Why not wait?\n  President Reagan responded. After he responded, I said: Mr. \nPresident, that doesn't answer my question. So he turned to Mr. Regan, \nwho was the Secretary of the Treasury, and asked Mr. Regan to explain \nto me why we had to have 3 consecutive years all at once. Mr. Regan \nsought to explain it. When he finished, I said: Well, Mr. Regan, you \nstill haven't answered my question.\n  President Reagan then turned to Mr. Meese and asked Mr. Meese to \nexplain it. This was all down in the Oval Office. Mr. Meese explained \nit somewhat like this: Senator, in order to give to the business people \nof this country certainty that there will be 3 years of tax cuts and in \nthese amounts, in order that they might plan ahead with certainty, we \nneed to package the three tax cuts in one bill.\n  That was a reasonable explanation. I didn't buy it. But there were \nsome people who might buy it. And there was something to it.\n  I came back to the Hill, and on the Senate floor I, with Mr. Sarbanes \nand others on this side--we were in the minority then as we are now--\noffered an amendment to postpone that third year until after the first \n2 years of tax cuts had been implemented. We lost, of course. As we \nsee, the projections did not pan out.\n  Lord Byron said, ``History, with all thy volumes vast, hath but one \npage.'' Well, the one page of history that we see today tells us very \nclearly that we cannot depend upon these projections.\n  I know of no one who can better testify to this fact than the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland, Mr. Sarbanes. He has served on the \nJoint Economic Committee for several years.\n  Regarding the administration's 3-year across-the-board tax cut, we \ntried. We lost. In order to help give President Reagan's economic \nprogram a chance, I voted for the final bill because my people in West \nVirginia who send me here said: Give him a chance. Give this new \nPresident a chance.\n  ``Give him a chance.'' So I did, I gave him a chance. I voted for the \nReagan tax cut. It was a mistake on my part.\n  On October 1, 1981, I went out on the floor as minority leader to \ntake a look forward to the new fiscal year. On that day I said: ``Today \nis the beginning of the new fiscal year. Yesterday, there was a kind of \nNew Year's Eve celebration. The trouble with New Year's Eve \ncelebrations, we all have to wake up the next day and face reality.''\n  I quoted Arthur Schlesinger who wrote: ``This supply side fantasy is \nvoodoo economics. The witch doctors have had their day. Reality is \nawaiting.''\n  On that October day, I noted: ``. . . The administration's brave \nwords and rosy predictions began to wilt.''\n  The reality was that deficits as far as the human eye could see were \nout there. Deficits peaked in fiscal year 1992 at $290 billion. Not \nuntil fiscal year 1998, 17 years after the 1981 Reagan tax cuts, were \nwe able to achieve a budget surplus. Having passed the Reagan tax cuts \nin 1981, which in large part created these unprecedented triple-digit, \nbillion-dollar deficits, the Congress had no choice but to pass, and \nPresidents Reagan, Bush, and Clinton signed, numerous bills to correct \nour mistake and increase taxes in hopes of stemming the unprecedented \ntide of red ink.\n  The Budget anachronisms of those tax increase measures are painful to \nrecall: TEFRA, DeFRA, OBRA of 1987, OBRA of 1990, OBRA of 1993, and so \non.\n  Despite all of these efforts to stem the red ink during the 12 years \nof Presidents Reagan and Bush, the national debt rose from $932 \nbillion, the day Mr. Reagan took office on January 20, 1981, to $2.683 \ntrillion the day Mr. Reagan left office; to $4.097 trillion the day \nPresident Bush left office on January 20, 1993. These protracted \ndeficits also resulted in higher interest rates for you and for you and \nfor you, the American taxpayer, to pay. This forced the average \nAmerican to pay more for his mortgage, more for his car, more for his \nchild's education because of our rush to enact a huge tax cut. Because \nof our rush to enact a huge tax cut, the benefits of which went mainly \nto the wealthiest taxpayer, many, many middle-class American taxpayers \nwere left with shrinking paychecks and shriveled dreams.\n  As a result of the tough votes we took on the deficit reduction bills \nof 1990, Senator Sarbanes, and 1993, do you remember 1990, when we went \nover to Andrews Air Force Base? And do you remember 1993 when we passed \nthe bill\n\n[[Page S1106]]\n\nfor which no Republican in the House or in the Senate voted? We are now \nreducing the debt held by the public, but gross debt continues to grow \nto this day.\n  Our current gross debt is $5.6 trillion. Here is the chart: $5.646 \ntrillion. The chart will show that, if these $5 trillion were stacked \nin $1 bills, the national debt would reach into the stratosphere 382 \nmiles.\n  May I ask Senator Sarbanes if he remembers when Mr. Reagan first came \ninto office, Mr. Reagan made a presentation to the American public on \ntelevision, and in that presentation Mr. Reagan talked about the debt \nhe had inherited. It was $932 billion at that time. Mr. Reagan very \ngraphically presented it by saying: If this $932 billion were in $1 \nbills, that stack of $1 bills representing the national debt of $932 \nbillion which I inherited would reach into the stratosphere 63 miles.\n  When Mr. Reagan left office, that same stack of $1 bills would have \nreached into the stratosphere 182 miles, three times what it was when \nMr. Reagan took office.\n\n  Our current gross debt worldwide is $929 for every man, woman, and \nchild. Get that: Our current gross debt comes to $929 for every man, \nwoman, and child around the globe! That is not pocket change. It \nrepresents $20,062 per man, woman, and child in the United States.\n  Some may argue that increased Federal spending is responsible for the \ndeficit. That is not so, not totally so. Looking at the chart entitled \n``Total Federal Spending Lowest Level Since 1966,'' I have heard my \nranking member on the Budget Committee, Mr. Conrad, refer to this chart \nand to this total of Federal spending. He has said it is the lowest \nlevel since 1966.\n  Federal spending this year is only 1.2 percent of GDP, the lowest \nsince 1966, and almost 5 percentage points less than in 1982 during the \nReagan administration, and 4 percentage points less than in 1992 during \nthe Bush Administration.\n  Once again, we face the fork in the road. We have faced it before. We \ntook the wrong path. We voted for that tax cut. But this time, we have \na signpost. It is easy to vote for a tax cut. I love to cast easy \nvotes. The easiest vote I have ever cast in my 55 years in politics has \nbeen a vote to cut taxes. Oh how easy. It doesn't take much courage to \ndo that.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I want to underscore what the Senator is saying. Some \nmake the argument that somehow it takes great political courage to \nadvocate a sweeping tax cut. I have never encountered that in the \ncourse of my public career; a tax cut is always welcome. If it is \npossible, if the fiscal circumstances are such, I think we should \nconsider doing tax cuts. But the real problem is always how to act in a \nresponsible manner and how to think about the future and not rush. The \npaper this morning has an article entitled ``Congressional Republicans \nSeek Bush's Big Tax Cut and Think Bigger.''\n  Another headline says, ``Business Vows to Seek Its Share of Tax \nRelief.''\n  Once you take the lid off the punch bowl, everyone wants to come to \nthe punch bowl and gorge themselves. The real challenge, the difficult \npolitical challenge, is not to do the tax cut. The difficult political \nchallenge is to restrain yourself so whatever you do is done in a \nresponsible manner, in a manner that takes into account the future of \nthe country--by ``the future'' I don't just mean next year, but the \nnext generation and the generation after that--and in a manner that \nwill build the strength of the Nation over time. That is the difficult \nchallenge. I agree completely with the Senator in his observation.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank my friend.\n  Does the Senator from Maryland have grandchildren?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I do, indeed.\n  Mr. BYRD. Does he have great grandchildren?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Not yet.\n  Mr. BYRD. One day we will leave this Chamber for the last time. And, \nif I am able to do so, I will look in a mirror. I will say to myself: \nHow did you serve? Did you think mostly of yourself? Did you think in \nterms of only your generation? Did you think in terms of your \nchildren's future? Did you think about your great grandchildren? What \nabout that little great granddaughter? She is going to be in school one \nday.\n  When I look into that mirror, what will I say as to my stewardship \nduring these years when I have served the people in the Congress? If I \nhaven't served well, I shall have cheated that great granddaughter. I \nshall have cheated my daughters and my grandchildren.\n  I would say as I look in that mirror:\n\n     When you get all you want in your struggle for pelf,\n     And the world makes you King for a day,\n     Then go to the mirror and look at yourself,\n     And see what that guy has to say.\n     For it isn't your Father, or Mother, or Wife,\n     Who judgment upon you must pass.\n     The fellow whose verdict counts most in your life\n     Is the man staring back from the glass.\n     He's the fellow to please, never mind all the rest,\n     For he's with you clear down to the end,\n     And you've passed your most dangerous, most difficult test\n     If the man in the glass is your friend.\n     You may be like Jack Horner and ``chisel'' a plum,\n     And think you're a wonderful guy,\n     But the man in the glass will just say you're a bum\n     If you can't look him straight in the eye.\n     You may fool the whole world down the pathway of years,\n     And get pats on the back as you pass,\n     But your final reward will be heartaches and tears,\n     If you've cheated the man in the glass.\n\n  If I have cheated the people who sent me here, if I have cheated my \ngrandchildren, my children, your children, then I shall have cheated \nmyself most of all.\n  Senator Sarbanes and Senator Conrad, we will have to look in that \nglass one day. And right here coming up, this year is one of the tests \nas to how we are going to react to the challenge before us.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator attended the Budget Committee yesterday in \nwhich we heard from the Comptroller General of the United States, the \nhead of the General Accounting Office. He warned us of precisely what \nyou are talking about. He warned us that this near-term outlook has \nimproved, but the long-term outlook has gotten worse. Does the Senator \nremember that testimony?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I do. I do. And I was very much impressed by that. We \nwere talking about 10 years. What was the testimony, just beyond the 10 \nyears?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Comptroller General of the United States alerted us \nthat just beyond the 10 years lie massive deficits. We are talking \nabout short-term surpluses, but there are massive deficits to come and \nwe ought to take this window of opportunity to strengthen ourselves for \nthe future.\n  We had four demographers today before the Senate Budget Committee \nwith this same message, telling us that if we would set aside some of \nthese acorns, instead of using them all, consuming them all in a tax \ncut or spending--but, instead use some of it to pay down this long-term \ndebt and address this long-term demographic time bomb, the retirement \nof the baby boom generation--that we will have a much stronger economy \nin the future.\n  It is really a message that Senator Sarbanes has delivered so \npowerfully in the past to the members of the committee. If we are \nreally thinking ahead, we will realize we ought to take some of these \nfunds and invest them for the future to reduce our long-term \nindebtedness, to expand the pool of savings, to expand the pool of \ninvestment, to take pressure off of interest rates, and to have a much \nbigger economy when the baby boomers start to retire.\n  That is really the lesson that Senator Sarbanes has provided to us \nday after day in the committee as well.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. Yes. I thank the distinguished ranking member of the \nBudget committee, on which Senator Sarbanes and I serve.\n  Mr. President, once again we face the fork in the road. We have faced \nit before and we took the wrong path--but this time we have a signpost. \nThe lesson of recent history is very clear, and we have only to review \nit to see which way to go.\n  The choices are these: Do we rely on uncertain, 10-year budget \nforecasts to pass a colossal tax cut, or do we exercise a little \ncaution in case the forecasts prove to be only a mirage, as they have \nso often proved to be before?\n\n[[Page S1107]]\n\n If we pass such a tax cut and the surpluses do not materialize, what \nneeds of our citizens may have to be left behind?\n  Let's take Social Security. Currently, 44.8 million older Americans \nreceive Social Security. That is projected to grow to 82.7 million in \nthe year 2030 when the baby boom generation has retired. The ratio of \nworkers to beneficiaries was 42 to 1 in 1945, at the end of World War \nII. Today, that ratio is 3.4 to 1, and it is projected to fall to 2.1 \nto 1 in the year 2040. The Social Security trust fund is projected to \nbe exhausted in the year 2037. If we go along with the Bush \nadministration's tax cut, what about our pledge to protect Social \nSecurity?\n  Let's take Medicare--33.4 million Americans rely on Medicare for \ntheir health care costs. This is projected to grow to 77 million in \n2030. The Medicare--hospital insurance--trust fund is projected to have \nbenefits exceed receipts in 2015 and to run out of money in 2023. If we \ngo along with the Bush administration's tax cuts, shall we just pretend \nthat the Medicare problem will solve itself?\n  How about prescription drugs? Since Medicare was created in 1965, the \npractice of medicine has changed dramatically. Prescription drugs allow \npatients to avoid more expensive and invasive procedures, such as \nsurgery. Since 1990, national spending on prescription drugs has \ntripled. The current Medicare program does not provide a prescription \ndrug benefit. How can we pay for a prescription drug benefit if we have \nemptied the kitty with tax cuts?\n  Just go up to your local drugstore. Get yourself a comfortable place \nsomewhere over in the corner if you can, and watch that line as it \nprogresses along that counter. Listen to some of the people who come \nthere. They get their drugs, and they pay $100, $150. I sometimes \nwonder, how can they do it? Drugs are so terribly expensive, and they \nare becoming more expensive. And yet these people rake and scrape and \nsave to try to have a little money with which to buy drugs. We have \nheard many stories about how some of them have to make a choice between \nfood on the table or drugs to keep down pain, and the problem is \ngetting worse. We are at a crossroads. What are we going to do about \nit?\n  Discretionary spending--let's talk about it for a moment. I am an \nappropriator. The population of this Nation grew by 33 million, or 13.2 \npercent, from 1990 to 2000, and according to the U.S. Census is \nexpected to grow by another 8.9 percent by 2010. Congress should make \nsure that we allow for the future growth of our population.\n  There are those who argue that discretionary spending is too high. \nLet me refer to this chart entitled ``Total Discretionary Outlays, \nFiscal Years 1962 to 2000.'' The distinguished ranking member of our \nBudget Committee has referred to this subject matter as we have \ndiscussed the budget surplus from day to day.\n  In fiscal year 2000, discretionary spending as a share of our economy \nwas just 6.3 percent. There it is. This share of spending has been \nshrinking for decades and is less than half of the share in 1962. When \nI came to this Senate, I say to Senator Conrad--I came to this Senate \n43 years ago--the line on the graph would have been up between 12.7 and \n14 percent. That was for discretionary spending. I was on the \nAppropriations Committee. I went on it the first month I came here.\n  What is it today? At that time, the estimates--the latest estimates \nthat were available were 1962. I came here in 1959. But in that year, \n68 percent of all Federal spending was discretionary. On the pie chart, \none can see how much of that chart was for discretionary spending: $72 \nbillion; 68 percent was for discretionary spending. That was the amount \nof money that went through the hands of the Appropriations Committee.\n  Today, only 34 percent of the Federal budget is discretionary. \nEntitlement spending has grown. We heard a witness before the Budget \nCommittee just the other day talk about entitlement spending. Let's \nlook at this chart entitled ``Entitlement Spending as a Share of the \nEconomy.'' We see that entitlement spending has grown from 5.7 percent \nof GDP, gross domestic product--the source is CBO--in 1966 to 10.5 \npercent today. So America continues to have real needs that are not \nbeing met in the areas of infrastructure, education, health care, \nnational security, and the list goes on and on.\n  For example, the number of vehicle miles traveled on our Nation's \nhighways has grown--from 1983 to 1999--from 1.65 trillion miles per \nyear to over 2.69 trillion miles per year. Of the road miles in rural \nAmerica, 56.5 percent are in fair to poor condition, according to the \nFederal Highway Administration; 56.9 percent are in fair to poor \ncondition. One does not have to go very far to see that. Just travel \nalong the streets in this Capital city and see the potholes, and what \nis happening to traffic congestion. I came to this city 49 years ago.\n\n  Conditions are even worse in urban America, where 64.6 percent of the \nroad miles are considered to be in some state of disrepair.\n  The situation is no better when we turn our attention to the Nation's \nhighway bridges. According to the most recent data from the Federal \nHighway Administration, 28.8 percent of our Nation's bridges are either \nfunctionally obsolete--they can no longer handle the kind of traffic \nfor which they were built--or they are structurally deficient.\n  We all should remember the Silver Bridge disaster that took place a \nfew days before Christmas at Point Pleasant, WV, a few years ago. That \nbridge collapsed, sending many people to their watery graves, on the \nOhio River. Do we just cross our fingers and hope that these bridges do \nnot collapse?\n  The EPA has estimated $200 billion in unmet needs for sewer, \nwastewater, and safe drinking water systems construction and \nmaintenance, just to maintain the current systems and to allow for \nnecessary expansion. Clean and safe drinking water should be a basic \nright of every man, woman, and child in America. We simply must address \nthese needs, and it will take dollars--billions of dollars--to do it.\n  According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, there \nare 5.4 million families, representing 12.3 million individuals, who \nare in need of affordable housing. Do we sacrifice these needs on the \naltar of tax-cut fever?\n  We are all familiar with the myriad problems confronting our military \nforces today: Recruitment and retention problems, crushing deployment \nburdens, aging ships and tanks and aircraft, a scarcity of spare parts, \na scarcity of ammunition--just read it in today's Washington Post, a \nscarcity of ammunition--substandard housing, outdated facilities. All \nof these factors affect readiness.\n  Beyond the current budget, we are bracing for the likelihood of \nrequests of major leaps in defense spending, perhaps as much as $50 \nbillion a year just over the horizon.\n  When we allocate the surplus, it would be totally irresponsible--\ntotally irresponsible--to fail to provide enough discretionary \nresources to allow us to invest in our future. Ask the mayors of the \nbig cities throughout this country. Ask the mayors of the little \ncities, the towns throughout this country.\n  Debt reduction--let's talk about it for a moment. Our debt held by \nthe public peaked in fiscal year 1997 at $3.8 trillion. In recent \nyears, we have paid about $200 billion per year in interest --\ninterest--on that debt. As we approach the retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration, we could do no greater favor for my granddaughter, for my \ngreat granddaughter, for your children, for all of our people, no \ngreater favor than to eliminate that debt and to eliminate those \ninterest payments.\n  I know we have received testimony in the committee that we can only \neliminate it to a certain point as of a year that is not too far away. \nBy the end of fiscal year 2001, we expect to have reduced the publicly \nheld debt to $600 billion from the level in fiscal year 1997.\n  We should make sure that we can stay on that course. If we enact \nlarge tax cuts that siphon away--that suck away, that draw away--the \non-budget surpluses, we could return to the days when we had to use the \nSocial Security surplus to help finance Federal operations rather than \nusing it for reducing debt.\n  In July of 1999, when the Republican leaders were pushing large tax \ncuts, I suggested that Congress take five steps:\n  One, watch our investments carefully and manage them prudently. \nManage the economy and watch out for inflation.\n\n[[Page S1108]]\n\n  Two, pay our debt. Pay down the national debt.\n  Three, cover the necessities. Do not shortchange our Nation's core \nprograms, such as education, health care, and the like.\n  Four, put aside what we need to put aside for a rainy day. Reserve \nthe Social Security and Medicare surpluses exclusively for future costs \nof those programs.\n  Five, take prosperity in measured doses. Ease up on taxes without \npulling the rug out from under projected surpluses.\n  Mr. President, our present conundrum regarding budget surpluses \nreminds me of that old Aesop's fable about the ant and the grasshopper. \nIt seems, as Aesop told it, that a commonwealth of ants, busily \nemployed in preserving their corn, was approached by a grasshopper \nwhich had chanced to outlive the summer. The grasshopper was ready to \nstarve from the cold and hunger and begged the ants for a grain of the \ncorn, much like the 10 virgins in the Scripture; 5 who were wise and \nwho had oil in their lamps, and 5 who were foolish who had no oil in \ntheir lamps.\n  In this case, one of the ant colony asked the grasshopper why he had \nnot anticipated the winter and put aside food, as the ants had so \nwisely done. The grasshopper answered that he had so enjoyed the \nabundance of summer that he had never once thought of the possibility \nof winter.\n  So we are going to have a big tax cut. Ah, we will enjoy that. How \nenjoyable. How sweet. How sweet it would be.\n  If that be the case, the ant replied, then all I can say is, those \nwho spend all day reveling in summer may have to starve in the winter. \nThe moral is, of course, do not fail to provide for the future.\n  So a prudent course would demand, Mr. President, that we anticipate a \ncold and chilly downturn in our economic fortunes and forecasts and put \nback something for the winter. After all, it is only a very few years \nafter the 10-year budget window that even these rosy estimates return \nto deficits as we cope with the retirement of the baby boom generation.\n  Given the pressing needs of our Nation in the coming decades and the \nuncertainty of the budget projections, I believe it is critical we \nestablish a mechanism that would put a cautionary curve on tax cuts and \nnew spending. In response to my question at a recent Senate Budget \nCommittee hearing, Mr. Barry Anderson of the Congressional Budget \nOffice responded that it would be prudent to establish such a \nmechanism.\n  So I intend to work diligently with my colleagues on the committee to \ncraft some way to put a cautionary brake on these huge, foolhardy tax \ncuts that are being proposed, until we can be more sure that the \nsurpluses will materialize. In my heart of hearts, I would prefer that \nany tax cuts this year be limited to no more than half a trillion \ndollars. That is my own viewpoint: $500 billion.\n\n  Americans believe in prudence. They would not blow the mortgage money \nat the race track. Neither should we. Massive tax cuts of the size that \nis being proposed, based merely on projections, merely on pieces of \npaper--here they are. These are the projections. These are the \nprojected surpluses. There they are on paper. Can you spend it? What is \nit worth? It is money not even in our pockets yet. It borders on \nreckless disregard for the needs of our people and the promises we have \nmade to them to proceed in this manner and spend it based on 10-year \nforecasts.\n  Even worse, we risk a return to serious budget deficits. As Mr. \nConrad has said so many times, let's not get back into the ditch which \nour children would have to address. So, as we approach this fork in the \nroad, we owe it to our children and to our children's children to make \nthe right choice. We should invest in our future. We should set aside \nfunds for problems that we know are lurking just over the horizon. Let \nus not make a risky U-turn and return to the rocky road of deficits as \nfar as the eye can see.\n  Mr. President, we will hear this refrain, that: ``It's the people's \nmoney. Let's give it back. It's their money. It's their money.'' And it \nis. But it is also their debt. It is also their deficits. It is also \ntheir highway safety. It is also their water and sewage treatment \nneeds. It is also their children's education. It is theirs. It is also \ntheir safety in the skies. It is all theirs. And we are the stewards. \nHow do we best serve them?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. I will yield to Senator Sarbanes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. As always, I think the very able Senator from West \nVirginia has given us an extremely important message. Moderation in all \nthings is essentially what the Senator is talking about. He is saying: \nBe cautious. Be prudent. These steps that the Senator set out, if one \ngoes over them carefully, are a balanced package which he is \nrecommending. He says: Watch the investments. Manage the economy. Pay \ndown the debt. Cover the necessities. Do those programs that are \nessential to our future strength: Education, health care. Put aside \nwhat we need for a rainy day, preserve Social Security and Medicare. \nAnd then ease up on the taxes.\n  The Senator is not saying: Don't do a tax cut, in light of these \nsurpluses or projected surpluses. But let's be careful about it. And do \nnot pull the rug out from under the projections in the future.\n  Now that is a package that makes sense. That is what all the \ncommentators are telling us. The Baltimore Sun just today had an \neditorial. I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Baltimore Sun, Feb. 7, 2001]\n\n             Calming Down Frenzy for a Big Federal Tax Cut\n\n       President Bush is a glib salesman for his massive tax-cut \n     program. But a closer look at the numbers should prompt \n     Congress to be careful.\n       For a conservative Republican, the president is using very \n     rosy revenue forecasts. The numbers he's using understate the \n     cost of ongoing programs. He's ignoring the extra cash needed \n     for his other proposals and congressional initiatives, such \n     as a prescription-drug plan. he hasn't factored in spending \n     to fix the Social Security and Medicare programs.\n       Mr. Bush is promising more in tax cuts than this country \n     can probably afford. He calls it a $1.6 trillion plan, but \n     other analysts say the true cost is closer to $2.5 trillion. \n     And that amount may not be affordable, even if large \n     surpluses pour in for a decade.\n       Congressional leaders would be wise to listen to David M. \n     Walker, who heads the General Accounting Office on Capitol \n     Hill. He said this week that ``no one should design tax or \n     spending policy pegged to the precise numbers in any 10-year \n     forecast.''\n       Yet this is what President Bush is doing. It's a mistake \n     Congress shouldn't duplicate.\n       Will there be a tax cut this year? Yes, indeed. The \n     momentum is there. But the size of the president's proposal \n     is unrealistic. And, sadly, some Republicans are talking \n     about adding even more to it in this form of capital gains \n     tax cuts and business tax reductions.\n       If there is to be a tax cut, Congress should see that it is \n     more tilted toward those at the lower and middle ranges of \n     the income scale than the president's proposal. Prudence is \n     essential in handling future surpluses that might never \n     occur. And there must be enough left on the table to deal \n     with other pressing needs, such as modernizing the military \n     and making repairs to old-age programs.\n       Mr. Bush has raised expectations, but Congress still must \n     carefully examine every aspect of this major proposal. We all \n     want smaller tax bills, but only if they are reasonable and \n     responsible.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. ``Calming down frenzy for a big federal tax cut. \nCongress should take a close look at Bush's forecast figures and a \ndecidedly cautious approach.''\n  They quote the Comptroller General from his testimony before our \ncommittee where he said that: ``No one should design tax or spending \npolicy pegged to the precise numbers in any 10-year forecast''--exactly \nthe point that the able Senator made at the outset of his statement.\n  And they conclude: ``Mr. Bush has raised expectations, but Congress \nstill must carefully examine every aspect of this major proposal. We \nall want smaller tax bills, but only if they are reasonable and \nresponsible.'' Reasonable and responsible--and, as the Senator has \npointed out, in the context of dealing with these basic needs: \nEducation, infrastructure, defense.\n  This administration has already sent the signal that they are going \nto want a major step up in defense and of course, reserving a \nsignificant amount\n\n[[Page S1109]]\n\nof the surplus to pay down the debt. When are we going to pay off the \ndebt, if we don't do it when we are running large surpluses and are at \na 4.2 percent unemployment rate? We have a strong economy now. We don't \nwant to risk the chance of knocking it off the track.\n  The Washington Post had an editorial entitled ``Fiscal Souffle.'' \nThey conclude it by saying:\n\n       A rush to commit too much of the projected surplus could \n     take the country back to borrow and spend, just as the last \n     big tax cut did 20 years ago.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Right.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I ask unanimous consent that that editorial be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 1, 2001]\n\n                             Fiscal Souffle\n\n       The Congressional Budget Office has raised by another $1 \n     trillion its estimate of the likely budget surplus over the \n     next 10 years, and Republicans, led by President Bush, say \n     the new figures prove there's plenty of room to enact the \n     president' tax cut and still fulfill the government's other \n     obligations. Democrats, including notably the conservative \n     Blue Dogs in the House, say that's not so, that the true \n     surplus is unlikely to be that large and that Congress, while \n     it can safely grant a tax cut, should exercise caution in \n     doing so.\n       The people flashing the caution signs are right. CBO itself \n     warns that ``considerable uncertainty surrounds'' the \n     projections, and that once the baby boomers retire, the \n     outlook shifts from sunny to bleak. About 70 percent of the \n     10-year surplus is projected to occur in the last five years \n     of the period, for which the estimates are least dependable; \n     only 30 percent is projected to occur in the nearer term. The \n     supposed $3 trillion, 10-year surplus consists in part of \n     Medicare funds that both parties in Congress have said should \n     not be counted because Medicare is headed for a deficit. The \n     surplus makes no allowance for the funds that, even with \n     benefit cuts, will be required to avert that deficit, nor the \n     Social Security deficit that likewise lies ahead, nor the \n     increase in defense spending that both parties say is \n     necessary.\n       Make these and similar, smaller allowances, all of them \n     realistic, and the amount available for tax cuts quickly \n     falls. A realistic estimate, assuming everything goes right, \n     is probably well under $2 trillion, and in the past, members \n     of both parties have said they want to use some of that for \n     debt reduction. The true 10-year cost of the Bush tax cut, \n     meanwhile, is well in excess of the $1.3 trillion estimate \n     used in the campaign. In part that's because important \n     provisions would not take effect until toward the end of the \n     10-year estimating period. The 10-year cost of the Bush \n     proposals fully fledged would be more than $2 trillion.\n       ``It doesn't leave room for much of anything else,'' Rep. \n     John Spratt, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget \n     Committee, said the other day. And it may grow; such \n     Republicans as House Majority Leader Dick Armey have begun to \n     say that the Bush proposal may be too small. The Blue Dogs \n     issued a statement yesterday warning that ``budget \n     projections can deteriorate just as rapidly as they have \n     improved in the last few years,'' and that a ``rush to \n     commit'' too much of the projected surplus could take the \n     country back to borrow-and-spend, just as the last big tax \n     cut did 20 years ago. That risk is real.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator. He has set out for us what, \nreally, is a historic decision we will be confronting. We must \nrecognize it as such.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It will affect generations to come. We must make a wise \nand prudent decision. I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his \nextraordinary leadership in this effort.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator may recall when we had the Congressional \nBudget Office personnel before us, they were the ones who made this \nforecast of the surplus, and yet they themselves warned us of the \nuncertainty of their projections.\n  Mr. BYRD. They did.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator may recall that Mr. Anderson put up a chart \nand the chart showed that in the fifth year of this 10-year forecast, \nbased on the previous variances in their projections, we could have a \nbudget that was anywhere from a $50 billion deficit to more than a $1 \ntrillion surplus.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes; here is the chart.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I see the Senator has that chart that shows in the year \n2006, which is 5 years into this 10-year forecast, we could have \nanywhere from a $50 billion deficit to over a $1 trillion surplus. That \nis the uncertainty of their forecast, according to them.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, that is just 5 years out.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is just 5 years out in a 10-year forecast. They are \nwarning, I take it--I would be interested in the Senator's reaction----\n  Mr. BYRD. That is my reaction.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That we should not bet the farm on a specific number with \na 10-year forecast because of the failure of previous forecasts to be \naccurate over such an extended period.\n  Mr. BYRD. Exactly.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Isn't that the upshot of their testimony?\n  Mr. BYRD. That is the point we should take home with us.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In addition to the Post editorial from which I quoted, \nI have a column that appeared in the Post written by Newsweek's Wall \nStreet Editor entitled ``Iffy Long-Term Numbers are Poor Excuse for \nHuge Tax Cuts and Wild Spending.'' The discipline has to be on both \nsides, on the tax cut and on the spending side.\n  No one is saying we should not do some tax cuts. Obviously, we need \nto make some investments on the expenditure side if we are going to \nmeet the needs of our country. But they have to be responsible, they \nhave to be reasonable. And, as this says, iffy long-term numbers are a \npoor excuse for huge tax cuts and wild spending. We need to keep that \nadmonition in mind as we proceed to engage in this debate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 6, 2001.]\n\n   Iffy Long-Term Numbers Are Poor Excuse for Huge Tax Cuts and Wild \n                                Spending\n\n                            (By Allan Sloan)\n\n       There are weeks when you have to wonder whether the \n     American economic attention span is longer than a sand \n     flea's. Consider last week's two big economic stories: The \n     Congressional Budget Office increased the projected 10-year \n     budget surplus by $1 trillion, and the Federal Reserve Board \n     cut short-term interest rates another half-percentage point \n     to try to keep the economy from tanking.\n       To me, the real story isn't either of these events; it's \n     their connection. The Fed is cutting rates like a doctor \n     trying to revive a cardiac patient because as recently as \n     last fall, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan didn't forsee what \n     today's economy would be like. Meanwhile, although it's now \n     clear that even the smart, savvy, data-inhaling Greenspan \n     couldn't see four months ahead, people are treating the 10-\n     year numbers from the Congressional Budget Office as holy \n     writ.\n       Hello? If Greenspan missed a four-month forecast, how can \n     you treat 10-year numbers as anything other than educated \n     guesswork? Especially when the CBO has for years devoted a \n     chapter in its reports to ``The Uncertainly of Budget \n     Projections''?\n       Both the Fed's rate cuts and the CBO's projection are being \n     cited to justify a huge tax cut. Basing economic policy on \n     long-term projections is nuts, and I'd be saying the same \n     thing about Al Gore's campaign spending proposals if he had \n     become president. I sure wouldn't base my personal financial \n     decisions on ultra-iffy long-term numbers. I hope you \n     wouldn't run your life or business that way.\n       A stroll through the numbers would be helpful here, as \n     would a little history. Remember that through the mid-1990s, \n     experts were forecasting huge federal deficits as far as the \n     eye could see. Now they are projecting huge surpluses. When \n     you're dealing with a $10 trillion economy and looking 10 \n     years out, relatively small changes make a huge difference--\n     if they come to pass.\n       The fact that the projected 10-year surplus grew to $5.6 \n     trillion from $4.6 trillion a mere six months ago is an \n     obvious sign that these aren't the most reliable numbers in \n     the world.\n       Here's the math: The surplus grew about $1 trillion because \n     the CBO increased the projected average 10-year national \n     growth rate to about 3 percent (adjusted for inflation) from \n     the previous 2.8 percent or so. Another $600 billion comes \n     from dropping fiscal 2001 (the current year) from the 10-year \n     numbers and adding fiscal 2011. The 2011 number, being the \n     furthest out, is the shakiest one in the projection.\n       Those two changes add up to $1.6 trillion of higher \n     surpluses. But the total increased by only $1 trillion. \n     That's because last year's late-session congressional \n     spending spree knocked $600 billion off the 10-year number. \n     So, even though these numbers are huge, you see how \n     vulnerable they are to moving dramatically as taxes, spending \n     and economic projections change.\n       Now, let's subtract the $2.5 trillion Social Security \n     surplus, which is supposedly going to be ``saved,'' and you \n     have $3.1 trillion to play with. (I treat the Social Security \n     number as reliable because it's based on demographics rather \n     than on economic guesstimates.) Substract another $500 \n     billion for\n\n[[Page S1110]]\n\n     the Medicare surplus, because we're supposedly saving that \n     money, too. That leaves $2.6 trillion--provided the \n     projections are accurate, which they won't be.\n       The CBO hasn't put a cost on President Bush's proposed tax \n     cut package. The package supposedly costs $1.6 trillion, but \n     I'll bet that's way understated, which is typical of such \n     things. And it doesn't include the impact of the feeding \n     frenzy that will undoubtedly result with a big tax cut on the \n     table. Remember what happened when the Reagan tax cuts were \n     enacted in the early 1980s? In addition, Bush's campaign \n     proposals are ``back-loaded''--they cost far more in the \n     later years than in the earlier years.\n       The reason we used to have projected budget deficits as far \n     as the eye could see and now have seemingly endless surpluses \n     lies in the nature of projections--even those as \n     sophisticated and intellectually honest as the CBO's. The CBO \n     takes what's going on now, projects it forward and adjusts \n     for things such as higher or lower interest rates or debt \n     levels, or for programs such as Social Security. It assumes \n     that discretionary spending rises at a fixed rate, which \n     never happens, and that no major new changes in taxes will be \n     enacted. If things are going well in budgetland, as they are \n     now, projections will get better the further out you go. If \n     things are going badly, the projections will get worse.\n       Now we come to Social Security, which contributes hugely to \n     today's happy surplus situation but is projected to start \n     causing trouble, big time, around 2015. That's not all that \n     long after 2011, when the CBO's 10-year projection ends. In \n     2015, Social Security is predicted to start taking in less \n     cash than it pays out, so it will have to start cashing in \n     the Treasury securities in its trust fund. In remarkably \n     short order, Social Security will start running 12-figure \n     cash deficits unless something is done.\n       Until last year, the Social Security problem was projected \n     to start in 2013, but it's been put off because the economy \n     has been doing better than expected. That, combined with now-\n     slipping fiscal discipline, is why the federal budget numbers \n     turned around a few years ago. But if we go on a big tax-cut-\n     and-spend spree, which seems increasingly likely, and the \n     economy performs worse than now projected, we'll be back in \n     the fiscal soup quicker than you can say ``fiscal \n     responsibility.''\n       For now, I'm going to pass on what many people have taken \n     as Greenspan's support for tax cuts. Even if you believe him \n     to be semi-divine, you can parse his public utterances as \n     being cautious about tax cuts. (There is occasionally an \n     advantage to having been an English major in college.)\n       Finally, despite 10 years of projected huge surpluses, the \n     CBO predicts that the total national debt ($6.7 trillion) \n     would be higher on Sept. 30, 2011, than it is now ($5.6 \n     trillion.) That's because, even though publicly held debt \n     shrinks to $800 billion from $3.4 trillion, the debt held in \n     government accounts, primarily Social Security, rises to $5.9 \n     trillion from today's $2.2 trillion.\n       So if we go on a tax-cutting and spending spree, don't be \n     surprised to find us back in the soup a few years down the \n     road. Don't say that you had no way to know. The Fed and the \n     CBO were telling you the risks last week. You just weren't \n     listening.\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to consideration of S. 248 which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 248) to amend the Admiral James W. Nance and Meg \n     Donovan Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years \n     2000 and 2001, to adjust a condition on the payment of \n     arrearages to the United Nations that sets the maximum share \n     of any United Nations peacekeeping operation's budget that \n     may be assessed of any country.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nfor me to deliver my remarks seated at my desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the pending legislation makes a small \nrevision in the United Nations reform legislation approved by Congress \nin 1999 known as the ``Helms-Biden'' law.\n  This legislation justifiably used the leverage of the United States \nto press for reforms, by linking payment of the United States' so-\ncalled ``U.N. arrears'' to specific U.N. reforms. And it was the \nproduct of bipartisan cooperation in the Congress, cooperation between \nthe Executive Branch and the Congress, and cooperation between the \nUnited States and the United Nations. And it worked, thereby producing \nmillions of dollars in savings to the American people.\n  The Helms-Biden law gave the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, \nRichard Holbrooke, the tools he needed to negotiate much-needed \nreforms, ranging from restoring the membership of the United States to \nthe U.N.'s administrative and finance committee, known in the rarified \nlanguage of the U.N. as the ``A-C-A-B-Q'', to the adoption of results-\nbased budgeting.\n  But the most important reforms restore an equitable burden-sharing \nfor the enormous cost of operating the United Nations.\n  This was achieved by reducing the U.S. share of the U.N.'s general \nbudget and its peacekeeping budget. In painstaking negotiations, the \nU.S. faced opposition not merely from increasingly affluent non-Western \nnations, which were clinging to their cut-rate U.N. assessment rates, \nbut from our rich NATO allies as well.\n  Ambassador Holbrooke succeeded in persuading the United Nations \nmember countries to reduce the U.S. share of the general U.N. budget to \n22 percent, which was specified by Helms-Biden. This was the first \nreduction, in more than 28 years, in the American taxpayers' bloated \nshare of the U.N.'s budget.\n  Similarly, Ambassador Holbrooke persuaded U.N. member states to agree \nto a new scale for assessments for U.N. peacekeeping.\n  This was an even more complicated undertaking because it required \nconvincing several nations to give up the big discounts they had \nenjoyed for the better part of thirty years, when they were regarded as \nso-called ``developing'' countries.\n  Our friends Israel, South Korea, Hungary, Estonia, and Slovenia were \namong those who gave up those discounts. We should be grateful to \nthem--I certainly am--for their willingness to do that.\n  On the other hand, some other nations in the Middle East and East \nAsia--which have become rich in recent years--dragged their feet--and \nshame on them.\n  But when all is said and done, the U.N. put in place a six-year plan \nto reduce what the U.N. now says the U.S. owes for peacekeeping.\n  Here's how it will work. The U.S. share of peacekeeping costs will \ndrop: from 31 percent to about 28 percent in the first six months of \n2001; and then, Mr. President, to about 27\\1/2\\ percent in the second \nhalf of 2001; and then, Mr. President, to about 26\\1/2\\ percent in \n2002; and then, Mr. President, down to approximately the 25 percent \nbenchmark specified in the Helms-Biden law.\n\n  Now then, Mr. President, when all this is fully implemented it will \neliminate at least $170 million each year from the amount that the \nUnited Nations had billed the American taxpayers.\n  While this does not quite meet the Helms-Biden specification of a 25 \npercent peacekeeping dues rate, not yet, at least, it comes close.\n\n  That is why Senator Biden, Senator Warner and I have offered this \nlegislation to propose making a relatively small change in the \narithmetic of the original Helms-Biden law.\n  Based on the clear prospect of U.S. peacekeeping dues moving down to \n25 percent in the coming years, we propose to agree to releasing the \nYear 2 dues payment of $582 million to the United Nations immediately--\nin recognition of the savings already achieved for the American \ntaxpayers.\n  This $582 million payment is the largest of the three phases of \narrears attached to reform conditions in the Helms-Biden law--and for \ngood reason: the toughest conditions imposed upon the United Nations by \nthe Helms-Biden law were included. These conditions have already been \nmet largely, and I believe, in response, that the Senate should now \nreward the enormous\n\n[[Page S1111]]\n\nprogress made in New York last December when the U.N. adopted most of \nthe Helms-Biden benchmarks agreed to when I met with Secretary-General \nKofi Annan when we met shortly after he took office at the U.N.\n  I emphasize that the United States does not owe the United Nations \none dime more than 25 percent of the peacekeeping budget.\n  In fact, in 1994, Senator Bob Dole led a bipartisan effort to \ninstitute a cap on how much the U.S. would pay to the U.N. for \npeacekeeping. That year, a Democrat-controlled Congress passed, and \nPresident Clinton signed, a 25 percent cap on the U.S. share of the \nU.N. peacekeeping assessment.\n  I see no reason to abandon that bipartisan policy. Some may argue \nthat, in addition to releasing the Year 2 arrears, we should remove \nthat cap as well. I cannot and will not agree to that, though there may \nbe a way that Senator Biden and I can work out to do something.\n  We are already taking an important step by releasing $582 million in \narrears.\n  But we must not (and will not if I have anything to do with it) \nconcede that the United States expects, in the coming years that the \nU.N. will ultimately reach the 25 percent rate mandated by Congress in \ntwo separate pieces of legislation.\n  In any event, the Helms-Biden reform benchmarks are working, which \nbrings us to the issue of: what next? What are principal remaining \nagenda items for the Congress regarding the U.N.?\n  First, the Congress must continue to take public note of the size of \nthe U.N. budget.\n  There will of course be a major campaign in the U.N., and even by \nsome in the American foreign policy establishment, to allow the U.N. to \nincrease its budget.\n  Congress must make sure that those seeking another explosion of \nbudgetary growth at the U.N. are stopped dead in their tracks. It is \none thing to allow adjustments in the U.N. budget for inflation and \ncurrency fluctuations. But Congress must not allow the floodgates for \nrampant bureaucratic spending to be opened. Fiscal discipline at the \nU.N. will remain a priority for Congress.\n  Specifically, we need to focus on the biggest outrage in the U.N.--\nthe bloated public information bureaucracy. The U.N.'s ``PR \nbureaucracy'' is, quite simply, out of control. I agree completely with \nAmbassador Holbrooke's assessment made to the Foreign Relations \nCommittee this past January 9, when he declared (and I quote):\n\n       The Office of Public Information must be cut. It still has \n     over 800 people. And I believe that is inappropriate. . . . \n     And that should be one of the next major campaigns. . . . We \n     need to attack the Office of Public Information and its over-\n     padded structure.\n\n  I say again, I wholeheartedly agree.\n  Finally, Congress must keep a vigilant eye on plans to remodel and \nexpand the U.N. headquarters in New York. The so-called ``U.N. Capital \nPlan'' estimates that it will cost more than $1 billion. The United \nStates--the American taxpayers--will be asked to pay for at least 25 \npercent of that.\n  I've asked the General Accounting Office to conduct a thorough study \nof the U.N.'s plans for the renovation. GAO's initial judgment is that \nthe project will end up with major cost overruns well beyond the \nbillion dollars estimated in the ``U.N. Capital Plan.''\n  And that U.N. plan calls for interest-free loans from the American \ntaxpayers. New York City will be called upon to transfer even more land \nto the U.N. as a gift.\n  Before building plush new offices for U.N. bureaucrats, let's first \nmake sure that all of the reforms called for in the Helms-Biden law are \ncompleted first.\n  For the moment, Mr. President, we are at an encouraging stage in \nU.S.-U.N. relations. The exchange of visits between the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee and ambassadors on the U.N. Security Council last \nyear in New York and Washington had a positive impact.\n  I believe this exchange gave the U.N. Ambassadors a greater \nappreciation of the role of the U.S. Congress in shaping our nation's \nforeign policy. It certainly gave Senators a better understanding of \nviews held at the U.N.\n  I'm told that the exchange of visits helped bring about the \ndiplomatic achievements of December of 2000 to reform the U.N.'s \nassessment scales. That kind of cooperation is certainly welcome.\n  Mr. President, I must conclude. But before I do, I must note that any \nworthwhile and meaningful cooperation with the U.N. depends upon firm \nleadership by the United States--and particularly the United States \nCongress. Almost every reform that has been enacted by the U.N. in \nrecent years was mandated by the Congress of the United States.\n  Some at the U.N. will always object to so-called Congressional \n``micro management'' of the U.N., and will chafe at the United States \nGovernment seeking to ``dictate'' reforms. But, Ambassador Holbrooke \nput it aptly in his final appearance before the Foreign Relations \nCommittee:\n\n       What I discovered was that since people assume the United \n     States is overbearing and arrogant anyway, it is better to \n     say what the U.S. view is. . . . America should be unafraid \n     to say its views. . . . We were persistent. And sometimes to \n     the point of being regarded as a little bit obnoxious, but \n     not arrogant. And we got the job done. And I think that can \n     be a model.\n\n  Mr. President, the Foreign Relations Committee and I believe, the \nAmerican taxpayers, are grateful to Ambassador Holbrooke for a job well \ndone. Needless to say, Mr. President, I hope the Senate will support \nthe pending legislation.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I have been asked to make this unanimous \nconsent request. I ask unanimous consent that at 3 p.m. today the bill \nbe advanced to third reading and final passage occur at 3 p.m., with no \nintervening action, motion, or debate; the time between now and 3 p.m. \nbe equally divided between the two managers; and paragraph 4 of rule \nXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, before I begin, let me, as we say in the \nSenate, be afforded a personal privilege. I want my colleagues to know \nand the American people to know that this was accomplished not merely \nbecause of the hard, industrious, and imaginative efforts of Ambassador \nHolbrooke, but this was accomplished primarily because of the Senator \nfrom North Carolina. He has been resolute in his commitment to saving \nthe American taxpayers' money. He has been resolute in his commitment \nto preventing waste, and he has been forthright in his assertion that \nwhen U.S. interests are at stake, we should speak up. That is precisely \nwhat he did here with regard to the United Nations.\n  As a consequence of his insistence, although this is called Helms-\nBiden--and I am proud to be a cosponsor of it and am proud to have \nworked all along with the Senator from North Carolina--but it was his \ninsistence that we condition our commitment to pay what we agree were \nthe arrears, not what the U.N. asserted was the amount of the arrears, \nupon some serious and genuine reform at the United Nations. Again, it \nwas his insistence on saving the American taxpayers' money if it didn't \nhave to be spent.\n  The result that no one anticipated from his efforts--maybe he did; \nmost didn't; and I was not certain it would turn out this way--has been \nthat not only are the very folks upon whom conditions were forced not \nangry but they are probably happier with U.S. participation in the \nUnited Nations today than at any time in the last probably 15 years--at \nleast the last decade.\n  Senator Helms demonstrated that there was nothing venal, nor was it \nan attempt at retribution, nor an ideological assault upon the United \nNations when he opened this gambit by introducing the legislation and \nimmediately inviting the members of the United Nations to come to \nWashington, DC, to speak before and meet with the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. I may be mistaken, but I don't think this was ever done \nbefore. I don't think at any time in the existence of the United \nNations was there a wholesale invitation to the Security Council to \ncome to the U.S. Foreign Relations Committee.\n  The amazing thing is, they all came. They came gleefully. They were \nslightly skeptical. This was as a consequence of the Senator from North \nCarolina having first spoken to the Security Council.\n\n[[Page S1112]]\n\n  Again, I don't know how many Senators have addressed the Security \nCouncil in the Senate, and I don't know if he was the first, but I know \nhe preceded me, and I can't think of anyone else in my memory who has \ndone that. He went to the United Nations and in his typical southern \ngentlemanly fashion was bluntly forthright about his objectives.\n  I remember at the time reading in the press some fairly harsh \ncriticism of his assertions, assertions made in his gentlemanly manner \nin New York. Again, almost everyone was wrong because they anticipated \nthe response would be a further freezing, rather than thawing, of the \nrelationship between the United States and the United Nations. A vast \nmajority thought the U.N. would deny us the right to vote because we \nwere not paying our dues.\n  My colleague, although we arrived the same year, arrived with more \nwisdom than I did. My colleague, once again, demonstrated that he knew \nwhat he was doing. A very close friend of his and a man who actually \nwas a former Democratic State senator, I am told, worked with Senator \nHelms in years gone by. This man was a public delegate to the United \nNations and from North Carolina at the time.\n  I will never forget, and I don't think anyone ever anticipated they \nwould see, a dinner in New York, organized by our Ambassador, to honor \nSenator Helms. If I am not mistaken, originally something on the order \nof 100 invitations were sent out, and yet close to 140 Ambassadors of \nthe 180 nations showed up in the large ballroom of a large hotel in New \nYork City to honor the man many in the press and other places wanted to \nvilify.\n  I never thought I would live to see the day when I saw Senator Jesse \nHelms, Henry Kissinger, Ambassador Holbrooke, Mr. Belk, the public \ndelegate from North Carolina, and the U.N. brass have their picture \ntaken in the middle of that ballroom wearing blue U.N. caps. That was a \nbit of an epiphany for me.\n  I was sitting at the table with the German Ambassador. My table had \nat least three members of the Security Council sitting there. I was \namazed to watch what happened. Everyone looked somewhat bemused and \namused, and then I noticed all these very dignified diplomats, among \nthe highest ranking persons in their governments, lining up very \ntactfully, as if they really weren't wanting a picture, to have their \npicture taken with Senator Jesse Helms.\n  Now, I don't know if Senator Helms expected that--I don't think he \ndid, knowing him. I cite it not to be humorous, not to say this was \nsort of interesting simply because it happened, but to point out that \nbecause of Senator Helms, for the first time in the 28 years I have \nbeen here, there is a genuine sense of warmth, there is a degree of \ntrust, there is a greater openness that has occurred between the U.S. \nand the U.N. as a consequence of his insistence in saving the American \ntaxpayers money.\n  I reluctantly went along with the conditions, as my friend from North \nCarolina knows. I had no doubt the reforms were needed. I thought we \nshould pay the back dues and then prospectively insist on conditions in \nthe future. It was a distinction with some difference.\n  However, I expect we will have people come to the floor and say the \nway we finally went was the wrong way to go about it. I point out when \nwe were debating this, and I ask my friend from North Carolina to \ncorrect me if I am wrong, I don't remember anybody else who supported \nthe U.N. that garnered one single penny in back dues.\n  I remember saying to a very significant former Member of the House \nwho was upset with the Helms-Biden approach: I will withhold pushing \nthis. I will give you a week if you can come back to me and tell me you \nare able to raise one single cent in the House of Representatives to \npay the back dues; I'll withdraw.\n  The point was, everyone talked about the pure game, the purity of \ndoing it the ``right way,'' which leads to the second point. I have \nserved with my friend too long not to understand he has a very healthy \nskepticism of international organizations. Not a hostility, skepticism. \nI have served with him too long not to know that he has a skepticism \nfor international agreements made with people who have histories of not \nkeeping international agreements. And I have served with him too long \nto underestimate his ability to know how to get things done. He knew \nbetter than most of us that even if he thought there should be no \nconditions--which he thought there should be--that you weren't going to \nget anything done here. You had to bring along a significant portion of \nthe House and a significant minority in the Senate who didn't even want \nto pay the back dues; didn't want to pay anything, conditions or not.\n  So as the old saw goes over the last 30 years, anyway, just as only \nNixon could go to China, only Helms can fix the U.N. That is true. That \nis absolutely, positively true. I am sure he has taken some heat from \nhis historically loyal and traditional friends on the center right for \ndoing this, I have no doubt he has taken some heat, but, as usual, \nbeing a man who sticks to his principles, he took the heat but in the \nprocess of doing so he put the argument against U.S. participation in \nthe U.N. in a position where it had no credibility. How could anyone \nfrom the center right challenge the Senator from North Carolina? Nobody \ndoubts his convictions and principle. He is too darned conservative for \nme. I love him, but he is too darned conservative for me. But if Joe \nBiden had come along and done this, if Trent Lott had come along and \ndone this, if Dick Lugar and other respected Members did this, and it \nhad been Lott-Biden, anybody on the Republican side, Biden and not \nHelms, this would not have gotten done.\n  I pay tribute not only to the substantive changes he has wrought, but \npay tribute to his tactical genius and how to get it done. It would not \nhave gotten done, without him and we would be standing here today in \nsemicrisis about whether or not we stay in the U.N., whether or not our \nvote had been taken from us, whether or not it was any longer relevant. \nWe would have had some bitter ideological debates on this floor had he \nnot gotten us to this place.\n  I, for one, think the United Nations is an incredibly valuable \ninstitution that, on balance, overwhelmingly benefits the American \npeople. But, I say to my colleagues, don't do what some of us who have \nserved with Senator Helms sometimes do--don't underestimate what this \nfellow did and does, and don't underestimate how knowledgeable he is \nabout getting something done. I am just glad we were not only in the \nsame hymnal on this one, but on the same page on this one.\n  So I want to personally thank him. He did more than save the American \ntaxpayers $170 million and more to come. He did more than set an \natmosphere and tone where now in the United Nations, because of what he \ndid, there is open discussion and debate among the members, not \nincluding us, about the need to reform. He was sort of the fellow who \ncame along and said: Hey, but the emperor has no clothes.\n  Everybody sitting there knew the emperor had no clothes on, but \nSenator Helms said, ``The emperor has no clothes and until he starts \ngetting dressed I am not playing.'' Now I ask a rhetorical question. \nDid my friend ever think he would hear a debate with everyone from the \nChinese Ambassador to the Russian Ambassador to the German Ambassador \nto the French Ambassador talking about the need for further reform? And \ngoing back to their constituents and saying: We need Reform. They want \nto save taxpayers money as well.\n  So that is a big deal. But the bigger deal, in my view, is there is a \nnew sense of legitimacy and vitality in this Chamber, in this \nGovernment, in this country, for the United Nations.\n  I am not Pollyannaish about this. I don't think the United Nations is \na one-world government leading to nirvana. That is the farthest from \nwhat it is. But it is a practical tool in a number of circumstances, \nand an increasingly necessary forum for the one superpower in the world \nto be able to make her views known and garner the support of--or at \nleast prick the conscience of--the rest of the world. We do not want to \nconstantly be put in the position of being that great nation imposing \nher view on all the rest of the world.\n  What most of our foreign colleagues do not understand is we Americans \nare uncomfortable being the sole superpower. I often tell our European\n\n[[Page S1113]]\n\nfriends--my colleague knows, I am, as is he, deeply involved with NATO \nand Europe--I often tell them when they complain about us being the \nonly superpower: You don't understand. Americans were not looking or \nseeking this title. We don't want to be the superpower. If there has to \nbe one it will be us, but that is not our goal. We have no countries to \nconquer. We have no desire to impose our will. Americans would just as \nsoon tend to their business and be home.\n  But that is how we are cast today. That is how we are cast by our \nfriends as well as by our foes. I think in that context the United \nNations takes on a different and dynamic role with the possibility that \nwe can use it to further our interests.\n  So what my friend from North Carolina did is make that possible. \nWhether the U.N. meets those expectations, whether it continues down \nthe road of reform, whether it does what it has the potential to do, \nremains to be seen. But we would not even be in this position today, \nFebruary 7, 2001, talking about this possibility were it not for his \ninsistence.\n  As I said, only Nixon could go to China. Only Helms could make the \nU.N. relevant at the end of this century and the beginning of the next.\n  I know he understands, but knowing how he is, he probably refuses to \nbelieve how big a role that he played. It is literally that big. That \nis the deal. That is why this is so consequential. This legislation \nbefore us is, in a sense, inconsequential. We are changing one number \nin a piece of legislation to accommodate what we believe to be the \ngood-faith serious effort to have embarked upon and stay embarked upon \nmaking an institution of the 20th century relevant in the 21st century.\n  As my friend and I have pointed out, we have both spoken at the \nSecurity Council. We have both had private meetings, and jointly, with \nI think literally almost every single delegate to the United Nations. \nThe luncheon he and I did up there, there were 160-some U.N. \nambassadors. I doubt whether there is a single U.N. representative--\nthere may be one; I will be dumbfounded if there are more than 20--who \nhas not personally met Senator Helms and personally interfaced with \nhim.\n  You know, it is an interesting phenomenon. When they looked him in \nthe eye, when they heard him talk and saw him, and kind of touched him, \nthey realized this is the real deal. This isn't about bashing the \nUnited Nations for hometown political consumption. And it has had a \ndramatic impact on the attitude that institution has about itself, the \nattitude of the American people have about it, the attitude of this \nbody has about it, and the potential utility of that institution to \nwork the way we hoped it would work.\n  As the chairman has explained, this legislation was reported by the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations earlier today by a vote of 18-0.\n  This bill is neither long nor complicated. Let me explain it briefly.\n  In late 1999, Congress passed legislation--the so-called ``Helms-\nBiden'' law--which authorizes payment of $926 million owed to the \nUnited Nations in back dues, conditioned on certain reforms in the \nUnited Nations.\n  The bill provided for payment of the funds in three installments. \nEach installment was linked to a set of reforms in the United Nations.\n  The first installment of $100 million was paid in December 1999.\n  The second installment authorized is $582 million.\n  The key reform linked to this installment is a requirement that the \namount of money the United States pays for U.N. operations be reduced.\n  We believed such reductions were important because the United Nations \nhad become overly dependent on the United States for its funding.\n  Also, the economies of many other nations had grown considerably \nsince the rates were last reviewed seriously in the early 1970s, and we \nbelieved it only fair that a greater share of the budget burden be \nassumed by those countries.\n  I am pleased to report that there has been remarkable progress, not \nonly in the reduction of the U.S. assessment rates, but in U.N. \ninstitutional reform in general. Let me talk about the budget \nreductions.\n  The United Nations has two budgets. The first budget is the so-called \nregular budget, which pays for the day-to-day operations of the U.N. \nSecretariat in New York.\n  The law that Congress enacted in 1999 required that the rate we are \ncharged for this budget be reduced from 25 percent to 22 percent of the \ntotal budget.\n  Our previous Ambassador to the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke, \nachieved this objective. Effective January 1, our assessment for this \nbudget is 22 percent.\n  The second budget is for U.N. peacekeeping operations--for the \nsoldiers in blue helmets around the world. The Helms-Biden law required \nthat our assessment be cut from a rate of just over 30 percent to 25 \npercent.\n  Here, as some in the new administration who come from Texas might \nsay, we did not get the whole enchilada--Ambassador Holbrooke did not \nget our rate down to 25 percent, but Ambassador Holbrooke succeeded in \nreducing our peacekeeping assessment substantially.\n  Effective January 1, our peacekeeping rate has been cut to just over \n28 percent. It will continue to go down gradually to 26.5 percent by \n2003, and possibly lower after that.\n  It is not everything we wanted, but Senator Helms and I believe that \nthe United Nations has met us more than halfway--and that we should \nrespond.\n  Accordingly, the bill before the Senate amends the original Helms-\nBiden legislation to change the one legislative provision that was not \ncompletely satisfied.\n  Taking that step will release the second installment of $582 million \n.\n  The bill was approved unanimously by the Committee on Foreign \nRelations, and I hope the vote in the Senate will also be unanimous.\n  So let me reiterate. Dick Holbrooke took us a long way.\n  Mr. HELMS. You bet.\n  Mr. BIDEN. My grandfather Abrose's name was Abrose Finnigan. He used \nto say: Remember, God protects two groups of people: well-intended \nIrishmen who are drunk, and the United States of America. And then he \nwould joke and say: You know, in our history where there are big and \nlarge issues, it always seems to be the right person comes along at the \nright moment to tackle the big issues. Dick Holbrooke, in another \ngeneration, maybe would not have been as consequential, but what did we \nneed? We needed a man who was--remember when our friend from Texas won \nhis first Senate race? He beat an incumbent, an appointed Democrat who \nwas a good guy. They asked the Democrat about how he felt the night of \nthe election when he lost. He said: There are two things you should \nknow about Phil Gramm: One, he is meaner than a junk yard dog, and, \ntwo, he is smarter than you.\n  There are two things you should know about Dick Holbrooke: One, he is \nmore persistent than Strom Thurmond, which is almost impossible, and he \nis likely to be smarter than you.\n  He kept his commitment to Senator Helms.\n  Mr. HELMS. He did.\n  Mr. BIDEN. He kept his commitment. Senator Helms was wary at the \nfront end of this when he was named, whether or not he really was going \nto do it. He held up his nomination until he came before the committee \nto say: I will commit to Helms-Biden. Once he did that, it was home \nfree and he headed to work. But he did a remarkable job.\n  So I do not, in my praise for Senator Helms, mean to in any way \nsuggest that at the end of the day this could have been done without \nthe ingenuity, intelligence, and dedication of Ambassador Holbrooke and \nhis staff, who, as the chairman has pointed out, many nights toward the \nend stayed up close to around the clock getting this locked down.\n  So I think we are at a good place. I have been with my friend from \nNorth Carolina too long not to think I understand what is behind his \nreluctance to lift a cap that locked into law the amount we would pay \nfor peacekeeping. In 1994, out of frustration with the United Nations \nand its waste and failure to modernize, the U.S. Congress passed a \npiece of legislation that said starting October 1, 1996 we will not pay \nany more than 25 percent of the peacekeeping assessment. Then we were \nbeing charged about 31 percent, as the Senator said.\n  Now this may confuse people. Although the Helms-Biden change we are\n\n[[Page S1114]]\n\nmaking today will allow over half a billion dollars to go to settle our \naccounts, if we do not do something about that 25 percent cap--because \nin spite of everything Ambassador Holbrooke, did our peacekeeping rate \nis not going to go down to 25 percent this year--we will, by the end of \nthe year, accrue another roughly $70 million in debt. We will be behind \nthe 8-ball another $70 million in terms of what we ``owe'' the U.N.\n  If I did not know better, I would say, as the old saying goes, my \nfriend from North Carolina is from Missouri because he is a show-me \nguy. I am hopeful I can convince him or he can become convinced--not \nthat I can convince him--but he will become convinced before the \nlegislative year is over hopefully that these changes are real and \nmaybe we should lift that 25- percent cap. Knowing him, he may toy with \nthe idea of either not doing it at all, doing it temporarily, doing it \nconditionally--I do not know what. I know he will come up with \nsomething.\n  I say to him and my colleagues, I for one feel very strongly--we have \ngone this far--we should not now undo the good will and circumstance we \nhave created, primarily through his leadership.\n  Again, not lifting the 25 percent cap now does not do any damage, any \ninjustice, or any harm to the good that has been done, but if we do not \nby the end of the year deal with this--and he is committed we will deal \nwith it; not how, not what the result will be, what his position will \nbe, but we will deal with it--if we do not deal with it, I fear we will \nhave begun to undo some of the significant good that we did by changing \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, I thank former President Clinton and former Secretary \nAlbright who were also instrumental in lobbying world leaders to have \ntheir countries accommodate this change, which is overdue.\n  I note parenthetically, when we signed on to these commitments, it \nwas a different world. We were the only game in town economically. The \ncombined GDP of Europe eclipses ours. Thank God, through the good works \nof a lot of people, including the generosity of the American people, \nthe rest of the world is doing pretty well in many places, and they can \nafford to pay more. But it still took a lot of cajoling, it took a lot \nof nursing, it took a lot of diplomatic skill to get it done.\n  I say to my friend from North Carolina, I look forward to, before the \nsummer passes, being back on the floor, hopefully with an agreement on \nwhat to do about the 25-percent cap set in 1994, but at least here to \nventilate it, debate it, and let the Senate work its will on what we \nshould do about it.\n  I note parenthetically that Secretary of State Powell supports such \nan amendment to the 1994 law. I received a letter from him 2 days ago \non this subject.\n  I have no doubt the Senator has thought about it a lot and will think \nabout it, and I have no doubt that whatever decision he comes to on the \n25-percent cap, it will be viewed through the prism of making sure the \nAmerican people are not paying more than they should and that the \nAmerican taxpayers catch a break.\n  It has been an honor working with Senator Helms. As I said, he and I \ncame the same year, 1972. We have both been here 28 years, going on 29. \nWe have, as the old saying goes, been together and we have been agin \none another. For me, it is always more comfortable when we are \ntogether. It has never, never been anything other than a pleasure, \nsince I shifted my responsibilities as top Democrat on the Judiciary \nCommittee to Foreign Relations, working with Senator Helms.\n  I am told there are some of our colleagues who wish to speak to this. \nI, quite frankly, would be surprised if there is a controversial aspect \nto this. It passed out of our committee this morning 18-0, unanimously, \nwith very little debate and with some considerable enthusiasm.\n  I hope there will be bipartisan support for these objectives. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the letter from \nSecretary Powell.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       The Secretary of State,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 5, 2001.\n     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n     Committee on Foreign Relations,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Biden: Thank you for your January 23 letter \n     regarding the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's plans, at \n     next week's business meeting, to take up the question of \n     revising Helms-Biden legislation to allow a second tranche of \n     payments of UN arrears to go forward. I appreciate the \n     Committee's willingness to move forward so quickly with this \n     needed step.\n       In your letter, you asked for my views as to whether a 1994 \n     State Authorization Bill provision that places a 25 percent \n     cap on our contribution to UN peacekeeping should also be \n     revised, so that we can pay at the new assessment rate we \n     negotiated in December. My staff have informed me that, \n     unless this cap is revised, we will accrue new arrears of \n     around $77 million in this fiscal year alone. Clearly, this \n     needs to be taken care of to avoid falling into new arrears; \n     my preference would be to move on it now, so that we can put \n     this behind us quickly and focus together on further steps \n     toward UN reform. I hope that the Committee will take the \n     necessary steps to amend the 1994 provision as rapidly as \n     possible.\n       Again, thank you for your letter. I welcome your \n     partnership on this and other matters as we seek to advance \n     America's foreign policy interests in the months ahead.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Colin L. Powell.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. I know we do not have a vote until 3 o'clock. That is when \nit has been set. I am not sure who is going to be here to speak when, \nbut I am not going to trespass on the Senate's time anymore. I am going \nto shortly yield the floor, and I look to my colleague to ask whether I \nshould suggest the absence of a quorum or does he wish to speak?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent for such time that I may require.\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the work \nthat has been done by our distinguished chairman, the senior Senator \nfrom North Carolina, and indeed the ranking member, the senior Senator \nfrom Delaware. I have had the privilege of working with them on this \nissue including traveling to New York City with them while we were \nworking with the distinguished Ambassador, Mr. Holbrooke, on this \nissue. I also traveled a second time to New York City at the invitation \nof then-Ambassador Holbrooke to work on this issue.\n  These three, the great triumvirate, have brought this about. It is a \nremarkable feat for freedom. This institution, the U.N., through the \nyears has collected a good deal of disparaging comment, but it is an \nessential institution. Despite the disparaging references in years \npast, it is a stronger institution today under the current leadership \nof the distinguished Kofi Annan, and it is performing tasks that, \nfrankly, I would not want to see our Government out in front on. Better \nwe take second place and work with other nations through the U.N. to \nachieve certain objectives, rather than the unilateral intervention or, \nindeed, the unilateral participation by the United States.\n  This funding issue has been a cloud that has hung over the \ninstitution of the Congress and the U.N. for many years. Through the \nable leadership of Chairman Helms and the ranking member, Mr. Biden, \nthat cloud is now in a large measure dispelled. It is a job that should \nreceive the commendation and support of all in this Chamber.\n  I see the Presiding Officer is a distinguished Senator from the great \nState of New York which provides a home for the United Nations. The \nUnited Nations is an institution that hopefully will live long and will \nbenefit from the strong support expressed by this vote in the Senate \ntoday.\n  I rise today as an original cosponsor of this very important \nlegislation on the payment of United States arrearages to the United \nNations. We are at this crucial point due to the determined efforts of \nthe distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee\n\n[[Page S1115]]\n\nand our former Ambassador to the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke.\n  The United Nations Reform Act of 1999, known as Helms-Biden, provided \nfor the payment of $926 million in U.S. arrears to the United Nations \nin return for a series of United Nations reforms, including a reduction \nin the U.S. assessment for the regular and peacekeeping budgets. The \nUnited States made its first payment under Helms-Biden, which totaled \n$100 million, in December of 1999. Under Helms-Biden, however, the \nsecond installment, totaling $582 million, could only be paid once the \nSecretary of State certifies that the ceiling for the U.N.'s regular \nbudget scale of assessment for the U.S. is set at 22 percent, and that \nthere is a ceiling set at 25 percent for the U.S. assessment for the \nU.N.'s peacekeeping budget.\n  After a lengthy and substantive debate, in late December 2000 the \nUnited Nation's General Assembly agreed to reduce U.S. dues to the \nUnited Nations. The General Assembly voted to set the ceiling for the \nregular budget scale of assessment for the U.S. at 22 percent--down \nfrom 25 percent--and set the ceiling for the peacekeeping scale of \nassessment for the U.S. at 28.15 percent--previously there was no \nceiling and the U.S. was assessed approximately 31 percent. While the \nnew scale of assessment ceiling for the U.N. regular budget meets the \nrequirements of Helms-Biden, the new scale of assessment ceiling for \nthe U.N. peacekeeping budget falls just short of what is required under \nHelms-Biden.\n  This legislation we are considering today will amend Helms-Biden so \nas to allow the U.S. to make its second payment of arrears to the U.N. \nSpecifically, the requirement that the U.N.'s peacekeeping scale of \nassessment ceiling for the U.S. must be set at 25 percent is amended to \nthe U.N. agreed upon number of 28.15 percent.\n  Although we all wish that the U.N. would have agreed to the 25 \npercent ceiling for the U.S. share of the peacekeeping budget, the \nagreement that was reached is significant and deserves our wholehearted \nsupport. By passing this legislation, we can move forward with the \nimplementation of the goals of Helms-Biden and continue to strengthen \nour relationship with the United Nations.\n  At this point I want to recognize three individuals whose heroic \nefforts made this landmark agreement possible. Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee Chairman Helms and Ranking Member Biden spent years crafting \nthe Helms-Biden legislation. Without their tireless efforts and the \nbipartisanship with which they tackled a task which many felt was \nunachievable, we would not be where we are today. Their commitment and \ntotal devotion to strengthening and reforming the United Nations \ndeserves our highest praise.\n  Likewise, the unflagging efforts of former U.S. Ambassador to the \nUnited Nations Richard Holbrooke must be recognized. Ambassador \nHolbrooke spent his 17 months at the U.N. working incessantly to see \nthat the reforms contained in Helms-Biden were implemented. To achieve \nthis goal, he traveled repeatedly to Washington to consult with Members \nof Congress, invited numerous Members, including myself, to New York \nfor meetings with U.N. ambassadors and spent uncountable hours on the \ntelephone promoting these reforms. In fact, during Ambassador \nHolbrooke's tenure I visited the U.N. twice to meet with numerous U.N. \nambassadors and Secretary-General Kofi Annan in order to discuss U.N. \nreform issues. Without Ambassador Holbrooke's efforts, it is unlikely, \nin my view, that the U.N. General Assembly would have agreed to reform \nthe U.N.'s regular and peacekeeping budgets.\n  The United Nations, under the strong leadership of Secretary-General \nKofi Annan, plays a crucial role in global affairs. It is in our \nnational interests to continue to work with the United Nations to \nensure that it is strong and effective.\n  In light of that, I reiterate my strong support for the rapid passage \nof this legislation which will keep reforms at the U.N. on schedule and \nallow for the continued payment of U.S. arrearages.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG of New Hampshire addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields to the Senator from New Hampshire?\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I yield such time as the Senator may \nneed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair and congratulate the Senator from North \nCarolina for his efforts in bringing a resolution to the U.N. arrearage \nissue. This is an issue in which I have had a fair amount of \ninvolvement, as I chair the appropriations subcommittee which is \nresponsible for actually paying the bills.\n  It was a pleasure to work with the Senator from North Carolina and \nthe Senator from Delaware, the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Grams, and \nSenator Hollings, my ranking member, as we worked with the prior \nadministration, especially the Secretary of State, to try to bring a \nresolution to this very intricate and difficult issue--very touchy \nissue in many ways--which had hung over the U.N. and America's \nrelationship with the U.N. for far too long.\n  There were very significant issues, however, that had to be addressed \nand which, as a result of the efforts of Senator Helms and Senator \nBiden and the working group which I had a pleasure to work with, were \naddressed.\n  Two of the ones that have gotten the most visibility, of course, are \nour contribution levels to the U.N. operation accounts, which were \nexcessive, in my opinion and in the opinion of the Senate and the \nCongress, and also the contributions to the peacekeeping accounts, \nwhich were equally excessive.\n  So the adjustments in the contribution levels, although not \neverything we desire, are a significant step in the right direction. \nBut I think we need to remember as we proceed, especially in the area \nof peacekeeping, that basically the United States is, no matter what \nthe assessment level, giving the U.N. what amounts to essentially a \nblank check.\n  The tremendous expansion in peacekeeping activity which the U.N. has \nundertaken over the last few years--much of it, quite honestly, not \nconsistent with American policy--for example, what is happening today \nin Sierra Leone, where the U.N. has one of its major peacekeeping \ninitiatives--is not consistent with the present American policy on how \nto handle that situation. In fact, the British, who are physically on \nthe ground there, and whose position we do agree with, are taking the \nbrunt of the legitimate effort in that country; whereas the U.N. \npeacekeepers, regrettably, are not contributing to the process of \nresolving the Sierra Leone situation but are actually, well, at best, \non site but not a positive force. Yet we are paying for that. American \ntaxpayers are paying for that.\n  It is inconsistent with the policy as laid out in a letter from the \nthen-Ambassador to the U.N., Mr. Holbrooke, to the Congress relative to \nwhat the American policy was to be in Sierra Leone. That letter, which \nwas very specific and quite appropriate and on point, unfortunately, is \nnot the U.N. policy.\n  So as we move down the road, this whole issue of peacekeeping is \ngoing to be a continuing concern to us, as the payers of the bills, \nbecause I am not much interested, quite honestly, in sending a large \namount of tax dollars, in what amounts to an open check, to the U.N. on \nthe matter of peacekeeping, if the policies of the U.N. are going to \nbe--in those areas where we are actually paying for the peacekeeping--\n180 degrees at odds with American policy.\n\n  I do not understand why we should be paying to underwrite policies \nwhich are inconsistent and, in some instances, actually at odds with \nwhat our policies are as a nation. So this issue of an open check for \nU.N. peacekeeping is one which will require more attention.\n  But as to the question of arrearages, we have at least settled the \nmatter of what the percentage should be in those instances where U.N. \nobligations are due relative to peacekeeping. For that reason, we are \nable to release the $582 million which was held up relative to that \nissue. There remains, however, one more payment, one more tranche \nhere--$244 million--which needs to be made and which we have \nappropriated.\n  By the way, all this money was always appropriated. We, in our \ncommittee, put it on the table, signed the\n\n[[Page S1116]]\n\ncheck, but we did not send the check. It was a letter of credit. We \nsaid: When you meet the conditions of the letter of credit, which were \nbasically the Helms-Biden proposal, then we will release the funds. \nBut, again, the $244 million, which is available to the U.N., and which \nis the third payment, is still conditioned on what I would call \nstructural reforms within the U.N. which are very important, structural \nreforms which go to the operation of the U.N., specifically, stronger \nInspector General activities, stronger evaluation of the effectiveness \nand the relevance of U.N. programs, a termination of programs that are \nno longer needed, establishment of clearer budget priorities and, of \ncourse, an accounting office similar to the General Accounting Office \nwe have here in the U.S. which can actually go in and audit what goes \non in the U.N.\n  One of the big problems we have had in the U.N. was that for many \nyears, regrettably, it was essentially, for lack of a better word, a \npatronage stop for a lot of folks from other countries who found it was \na place where they could basically place friends and relatives, and, as \na result, end up with the United States paying the cost of the salaries \nof those friends and relatives. It had a huge inefficiency. It also had \nprogrammatic activity which simply was inconsistent with what you would \ncall good fiscal policy.\n  I understand it is not something you can change overnight because, to \nsome degree, it is an institutional issue, but the U.N. is moving \ntowards trying to address this. And that is positive. We look forward \nto these management systems being put in place which can show the \nAmerican people that their tax dollars are not being wasted when they \nare sent to the U.N.\n  The U.N. is a very important institution. It is important that the \nAmerican people have confidence in it. This is an institution which can \nplay a huge and positive role as we, as a nation, engage the world. \nSince we are paying a quarter of the costs of the institution, American \ntaxpayers have to know that when they send the tax dollar up there, it \nis going to be used effectively and efficiently. It is not because they \noppose, at least in my State--there is some opposition, but there is \ngeneral support for the U.N. funding. It is not because they oppose \nfunding per se for the U.N; it is because they oppose the concept that \nmoney isn't being used efficiently and effectively. In fact, for a \nnumber of years it was being used inefficiently and ineffectively and \nin some cases just plain in a poor way.\n\n  So putting these systems in place--a strong Inspector General \napproach, general accounting rules along the lines of what we use in \nthe U.S. General Accounting Office, financial data procedures which \nallow us to track the dollars, where they go, who is using them, and \nactual personnel tracking procedures which allow us to make sure the \npersonnel that claims to be doing things is actually doing them, and \nthat we are not ending up paying no-show employees--is very important \nin running a fiscal house effectively.\n  They are the basic elements of good governance. If you are expecting \ntaxpayers to support an undertaking, then you must expect that the \ntaxpayers will demand that there be an accounting as to how their \ndollars are being used. That is all we have asked for here. We have not \nasked for anything outrageous or unreasonable, in my opinion. We have \njust asked for reasonable accounting procedures.\n  The U.N., to their credit, especially the present Secretary General, \nhas made an extra effort to try to address these concerns. I \ncongratulate the Secretary General for doing that. I especially \ncongratulate Ambassador Holbrooke because really he has been a fierce \nforce for bringing responsibilities to the U.N. in the way they have \ndealt with American tax dollars over his tenure there. He has been a \nconscientious protector of the American tax dollar. I think he has done \nit because he understands that support for the U.N. is critical, and \nsupport is tied to American taxpayers having confidence in their \ndollars being used effectively.\n  The agreement which has been reached--I again congratulate the \nSenator from North Carolina for his extraordinary effort, the Senator \nfrom Delaware, and all those who played a role in it--is a very \npositive step forward in putting in place the systems that are \nnecessary to give American taxpayers confidence in the U.N. When we \ngive that confidence to the American taxpayer, we will in turn give the \nU.N. strength. When we give the U.N. strength, in the end it will \nbenefit us as a nation and obviously the world. It is a plus for us. It \nis a plus for the U.N.\n  I am very happy to be here today to support this initiative and look \nforward, as chairman of the appropriating committee, to their \ncompletion of the additional issues that are to be addressed and the \nrelease of the additional $244 million as a result of successful \ncompletion of those initiatives.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I also rise to voice support for S. 248, \na bill to release $582 million in U.S. dues to the United Nations. \nPayment of our dues is long overdue, and I am glad to see this \nbipartisan bill come before the Senate.\n  We know the United Nations is not a perfect organization. No \norganization made up of 189 countries could possibly satisfy everyone. \nIn that sense, it is sort of like a country composed of 50 States. But \njust as the States rely on the Federal Government to address problems \nthat affect each of us collectively, the United States relies on the \ncollective diplomacy and security that only the United Nations can \nprovide.\n  Every day the U.N. is fighting critical battles to resolve conflicts, \ncontain the spread of infectious diseases, stop environmental \npollution, protect human rights, strengthen democracy, and prevent \nstarvation, to mention just some of its roles. U.N. peacekeepers are \ndeployed around the world--from East Timor to Cyprus to the Sinai--to \nhelp prevent violence and restore stability where it is badly needed. \nOf the tens of thousands of U.N. peacekeepers deployed, only a tiny \nfraction are Americans. These missions help to avoid U.S. military \nintervention and far more costly humanitarian relief operations.\n  We are the world's only superpower, and we have a wide range of \ninterests on every continent. We need to send a strong message that the \nUnited States supports the United Nations but that other nations need \nto contribute their share as well. This legislation is a clear step in \nthat direction.\n  Getting here has not been easy, and I want to commend four \nindividuals who deserve special credit. First and foremost, it was the \ndetermination of Ambassador Richard Holbrooke who led us to this \nbreakthrough that few thought was possible. In January, he received a \nstanding ovation from both Republicans and Democrats on the Foreign \nRelations Committee. It was well deserved.\n  We also had the bipartisan vision and leadership of Senator Jesse \nHelms and Senator Joe Biden. They established a framework for this deal \nwith the Helms-Biden legislation, and both deserve a great deal of \ncredit.\n  Finally, we should recognize Ted Turner. It was his gift of $34 \nmillion that was the final piece of the puzzle. We should all be \ngrateful for his generosity and foresight, although it is somewhat \nembarrassing that the government of the wealthiest, most powerful \nnation in history had to rely on the personal donation of a private \ncitizen to help meet its obligations to the international community.\n  While I am very pleased with this legislation, more still needs to be \ndone to address weaknesses in United Nations peacekeeping missions. We \nhave seen poorly conceived missions, serious logistical delays, ill-\nequipped and undertrained troops, and instances of misconduct. While \nthese were exceptions rather than the rule and were largely the fault \nof the U.N.'s member states, I was encouraged by two developments early \nthis fall that began to address some of these problems.\n  First, the U.N. issued a report, produced by an outside panel of \nexperts, that included some common-sense recommendations for improving \nthe effectiveness of U.N. peacekeeping. This was followed by a serious \ndiscussion of\n\n[[Page S1117]]\n\npeacekeeping reform by the heads of state of several key countries at \nthe Millennium Summit.\n  These two events triggered widespread praise from the international \ncommunity and a number of supportive editorials in the U.S. press. The \nBush administration and Congress need to take a close look at these \ndevelopments and determine what the U.S. can do to further efforts to \nimprove U.N. peacekeeping.\n  The administration and Congress should also consider lifting the 25 \npercent cap on U.S. peacekeeping contributions. During the campaign, \nPresident Bush called for the U.S. to act in a more ``humble'' manner \nin the international arena. This may be a good place to start. The \nEuropean Union, whose GDP is roughly equivalent our own, pays over 39 \npercent of U.N. peacekeeping costs, while the U.S. contribution will \nfall to 26.5 percent. Moreover, the agreement that was reached in \nDecember requires 29 nations to accept increases in their assessment \nrates, ranging from 50 percent to 500 percent. Yet, we still maintain \nthe 25 percent cap, and continue to accumulate arrears--hardly a \nstatement of humility. The time may now be right to remove the cap, \nespecially if the administration concludes that U.S. interests are \nbetter served without it.\n  Mr. President, we all want to see reform to continue at the U.N. \nHowever, refusing to pay our dues has irritated our friends and allies, \nwho were legitimately concerned that we wanted a continued veto over \nU.N. decisions, without meeting our treaty obligations. It hurt our \ncredibility, and it weakened our influence.\n  So I am pleased that we are finally acting to remedy this problem by \npassing this legislation today.\n  I see the Senator from Florida, and I yield the floor to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Nelson of Florida are located in today's Record \nunder ``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Cleland pertaining to the introduction of S. 269 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. CLELAND. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nS. 248, a bill to amend the Helms-Biden agreement on United Nations \narrears payments.\n  I have long supported the goals of the United Nations as it works to \npromote peace, to protect human rights, and to improve economic and \nsocial development throughout the world. Participation in the UN acts \nas an incentive to promote peace and provides a forum for negotiations \nand international action which can avert the need for more expensive \nunilateral or bilateral military interventions in the future.\n  I believe repaying United States arrears to the UN is crucial to \nensure that the organization can continue to be a force for peace and \nsecurity in the 21st Century.\n  As you know, significant steps have been undertaken in the last \nseveral years by the UN to reform their administrative structure and to \nreduce costs as called for by the Helms-Biden agreement. Among other \nthings, the UN has reduced its budget and staffing levels, and has \nstrengthened its Office of Internal Oversight.\n  In addition, the UN has agreed to reduce the US assessment for the UN \nregular budget from 25 percent to 22 percent, and the peacekeeping \nassessment from more than 30 percent. I congratulate Senator Helms, \nSenator Biden, Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, and Secretary-General Kofi \nAnnan for their efforts and hard work on these issues.\n  It is my hope that the UN will continue in this direction and enact \nfurther reforms designed to save costs and to make the UN a more \neffective and efficient organization. This bill recognizes that efforts \nhave been made and will continue to be made towards achieving this \ngoal. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I come to the floor to express my strong \nsupport for S. 248, the U.N. dues bill. This is a straightforward bill \nthat continues our efforts to set right U.S. accounts at the United \nNations. Those efforts are not yet complete, but in passing this bill \ntoday we take a big step in the right direction.\n  This bill--and the $582 million in U.S. arrears it will allow us to \npay--will go a long way to improving our relations at the United \nNations. The importance of a solid relationship with a capable UN \nshould not be underestimated. In the last year alone, we have worked \nwith the UN to bolster U.S. interests, including: Containing Saddam \nHussein; combating the debilitating effects of the AIDS pandemic; \nconfronting--and detaining--war criminals in the Balkans; and \ncontrolling the potentially destabilizing conflicts in East Timor and \nEast Africa.\n  Two years ago the outlook was much different. At that time, \nskepticism about the effectiveness of the UN prevailed, and Congress \noutlined an aggressive agenda for reform at the United Nations. Behind \nthe leadership of Senators Biden and Helms, Congress outlined a series \nof conditions before we would pay the nearly $1 billion in debts.\n  Passing that bill was difficult here, including months of debate, \ndeliberation and negotiation. But it turns out that we in Congress had \nthe easy part. The heavy lifting was done by Ambassador Richard \nHolbrooke and his team at the United States Mission to the United \nNations, who took the demands we made here in Congress and came back \nfrom New York with a solid deal.\n  Let's take a quick look at what Ambassador Holbrooke and his team \ndelivered:\n  A reduction in the U.S. assessed costs for the UN regular budget: \nThat reduction--from 25 percent to 22 percent--is the first rate drop \nfor the United States in the regular budget account since 1972.\n  A reduction in the U.S. assessed costs for the UN peacekeeping \nbudget: That reduction--from 31 percent to 27 percent--is the first \nrate drop for the United States in the peacekeeping account since 1973.\n  A combined savings for the U.S. from these reductions is in excess of \n$100 million annually; and, perhaps most importantly, rejuvenated \nCongressional support for the United Nations.\n  Yet the agreement that Ambassador Holbrooke delivered does not spell \nthe end of reform at the United Nations.\n  Last year saw the release of the so-called Brahimi Report, a series \nof common sense improvements to the way the United Nations handles \npeacekeeping operations. The report gives cause for optimism, but \naggressive implementation of the report's recommendations is crucial to \nensure success. Those recommendations will go a long way to burying the \npeacekeeping failures of Srebrenica and Sierra Leone and developing a \nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations that can successfully plan, \ndeploy and manage complex peacekeeping operations.\n\n  We will also watch the implementation of a series of accountability, \noversight and planning measures created in the last year. Secretary \nGeneral Annan is demanding a high level of excellence from his team in \nNew York, and we join him in expecting efficiency and results.\n  Work here in Washington is not done yet. Nor is our work in Congress \ndone yet. Continued reform at the United Nations demands U.S. \nleadership and involvement--and approving this bill today is only the \nfirst step in convincing the international community that we are \nserious about reform.\n  As it stands right now, the United States will continue to accrue \narrears at the United Nations. A law we passed in 1994 that caps U.S. \npayments to the UN peacekeeping budget at 25 percent, but we will \ncontinue to be billed by the UN for between 26 percent and 28 percent \nof that budget, generating arrears and engendering criticism of the \nU.S.--particularly from our European allies whose combined assessments \naccount for well over a third of UN peacekeeping operations.\n  If Congress does not make this fix this year, we risk worsening U.S. \nrelations with the UN and its member\n\n[[Page S1118]]\n\nstates, limiting our ability to use the United Nations to advance vital \nU.S. interests, and setting back the efforts or reform that Ambassador \nHolbrooke did so much to move forward.\n  It is my hope that, before the end of this fiscal year, Congress will \nlift the cap on U.S. assessed contributions to international \npeacekeeping efforts. Doing otherwise will be a lost opportunity.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate will vote today to \nrelease $582 million in U.S. arrearages to the United Nations. In 1999, \nCongress mandated a series of reform benchmarks for the United Nations \nto meet in order for the United States to release funds we were \nwithholding. One requirement related to reform of the scales for \npeacekeeping assessments by member nations, which were created in 1973 \nto fund the Sinai mission and have been in place ever since. As we move \ntoday to release the so-called Tranche II funds for the U.N. under the \nterms of the Helms-Biden law, I commend my colleagues for their work on \nthis issue and note the efforts of Ambassador Richard Holbrooke and the \nAmerican mission to the United Nations that made this progress \npossible.\n  Over the years, the United Nations and its subsidiary bodies have \nsupported U.S. humanitarian interests in a number of ways, performed \npeacekeeping missions important to the security of our nation and our \nallies, and provided a useful forum for developing consensus among \nnations, as demonstrated by former President Bush's extraordinarily \nsuccessful coalition-building to repel Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion \nof Kuwait. But U.N. accomplishments cannot hide the fact that the U.N. \nbureaucracy must be totally reformed from top to bottom.\n  As Ambassador Holbrooke recently told the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, ``I leave my position as confident as ever that the United \nNations remains absolutely indispensable to American foreign policy. . \n. . But at the same time, I am even more convinced that the U.N. is \ndeeply flawed, and that we must fix it to save it.'' Our vote today to \npay $582 million in U.S. arrearages reflects this philosophy. I expect \nclose Congressional scrutiny of United Nations operations and \nadministration to spur additional and much-needed reforms. And I look \nforward to a continuing debate in this body over the level of U.S. \ncontributions for U.N. peacekeeping, which requires additional review \nand may call for further Congressional action.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the passage \nof the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as the tax cut debate begins in earnest \nthis week, I would like to commend to my colleagues' attention two \neditorials that appeared in separate South Dakota newspapers this week, \nthe Pierre Capital Journal and the Madison Daily Leader. Both of these \nopinion pieces give an excellent explication of this year's budget and \ntax cut debate and responsibly advocate a tax cut while paying down the \nnational debt. In so doing, each reminds us that beyond the Beltway and \nacross the country the American public can see through the often \noverheated rhetoric of political debate and focus on the bottom line \npriority of maintaining the fiscal responsibility that forms the \nfoundation of the economic recovery of the 1990's.\n  As these editorials underscore, balance between tax cutting and debt \nreduction should be a central principle of the tax and budget debate. \nWhile Congress should and will pass a significant tax cut this year, it \nmust also make sure that we pay down the national debt and address \nbudget priorities like education, defense and healthcare. And so I \ncommend Dana Hess of the Pierre Capital Journal and Jon Hunter of the \nMadison Daily Leader for their exceptional pieces advocating a tax cut \nwithin the parameters of sound fiscal policy. Their words should give \nus all pause for thought.\n  I ask consent that these editorials be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From the Madison Daily Leader]\n\n           Paying Off National Debt Will Yield Great Results\n\n                            (By Jon Hunter)\n\n       Federal budget surpluses are now reducing the massive \n     federal debt after two decades of rapid growth. The benefits \n     of such debt reduction will be broad and long-lasting.\n       The surpluses are so strong that the United States Treasury \n     announced it will stop issuing one-year Treasury notes at the \n     end of February. Why borrow money for one year when cash \n     receipts outweigh expenses every day?\n       The change will permit the government to eliminate roughly \n     $20 billion in debt issuance in the current fiscal year. \n     Treasury had already eliminated sales of three-year and \n     seven-year notes.\n       The changes mean lower interest payments on the national \n     debt but also pose a challenge for investors because there is \n     a dwindling supply of Treasury securities, considered the \n     world's safest investment.\n       Even this potential challenge will be good for the U.S., in \n     our opinion. Investors who now own maturing one-year bills \n     will have to find other places to invest, and the most \n     logical place is short-term, high-quality corporate notes. \n     The demand will drive down\n\n[[Page S1119]]\n\n     borrowing costs for corporations, which would be similar to \n     an interest-rate cut by the federal reserve.\n       It makes sense to pay down the debt in an orderly fashion. \n     If Treasury tried to pay off the existing longer-term bonds, \n     it would have to buy them back at a high premium. That's why \n     Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said last week that since surplus \n     estimates are growing, he would support both debt reduction \n     and a tax cut.\n       On Tuesday, the Congressional Budget Office (headed by \n     former Madison resident Dan Crippen) projected that the \n     overall budget surplus would be $5.6 trillion over the \n     decade, up from the $5 trillion bounty projected by the \n     Office of Management and Budget near the end of the Clinton \n     administration.\n       In the early 1990s, the combination of a huge budget \n     deficit and higher interest rates were a drain on our \n     economy. Just the interest on the federal debt was consuming \n     about one-seventh the entire federal budget.\n       We will soon experience the opposite effect: lower interest \n     payments will free up money for tax cuts or funding for \n     programs. Provided Congress makes good decisions about the \n     tax cuts or spending, both will provide excellent long-term \n     benefits for America.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Pierre Capital Journal, Feb. 1, 2001]\n\n                Paying Debt Should Have Highest Priority\n\n                             (By Dana Hess)\n\n       Maybe it's his Texas roots that cause President George W. \n     Bush to think big. Or maybe he's just generous. Whatever the \n     reason, the president is pushing for a $1.6 trillion tax cut \n     over 10 years.\n       Bush pushed the tax cut idea throughout his campaign for \n     office, even though polls showed that it was getting a \n     lukewarm reception from the public. Give him marks for \n     consistency because Bush still insists that the tax cut needs \n     to happen.\n       We generally support the idea of the federal government \n     getting less of our money. After making such a mess of the \n     budget for so many years, it stands to reason that the less \n     money our representatives have to work with, the less likely \n     they'll be to get into trouble with it.\n       Bigger and bigger budget surplus projections are giving \n     Bush and everyone else in Washington, D.C., big ideas about \n     what to do with the money. It's a politician's dream come \n     true--enough money to offer tax cuts and promote new \n     spending.\n       We would hope that the years of deficit spending in \n     Washington would have taught lawmakers to be cautious when it \n     comes to spending our money. No one seems to have learned \n     that lesson.\n       As much as we'd like to see taxes cuts, there are a couple \n     of good reasons why Bush and our lawmakers should slow down.\n       The surplus exists, in a large part, because of the booming \n     economy our country has enjoyed. If that economy goes sour--\n     and indications are that it may be ripening a little more \n     every day--then the projections of a big surplus will turn \n     out to have as much truth as the fears about the millennium \n     bug.\n       With all the talk of surpluses and tax cuts, it's easy to \n     forget that there's still a debt to pay. Taking care of that \n     obligation should have a higher priority than trying to win \n     the favor of voters with tax cuts and new programs.\n       We know they're famous for doing things in a big way in \n     Texas. But this nation has a Texas-sized debt. The president \n     should make sure his plan places just as high a priority on \n     paying down the debt as it does on tax cuts and spending \n     plans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/07/senate-section/article/S1119-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1119-S1120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE PRESIDENT'S TAX CUT PROPOSAL AND THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President--that has a nice ring to it--\nit is a privilege for me to take the floor and speak on an unrelated \nsubject but a subject that is of considerable importance to the country \nand to the decisions we will be making very shortly. That is the \nadoption of a budget and the decision in that budget of how large the \ntax cut should be.\n  Just in the last 24 hours, we have seen a consequence of the tax cut \nthat now is proposed by the administration that is soaring upwards of \n$2.5 trillion over the next 10 years, a tax cut that the fiscal effect \nof $2.5 trillion would be so large as not only to wipe out all of the \navailable surplus over the next 10 years, but to cause us to suddenly \nplunge back into deficit spending.\n  We see a consequence of this in the last 24 hours in the fact that \nthe administration is now not proposing to increase the defense budget. \nPersonally, I think we should be looking at a minimum of increasing the \ndefense budget over the next decade to the tune of $100 billion.\n  The administration, now recognizing that its tax cut is going to \nabsorb all of the available surplus, has just, in the last 24 hours, \nlaid out the fact that it will not ask for an increase in the defense \nbudget. When that occurs, I am quite concerned about our existing \ntroops and what their pay is, the fact that there would be no increase \nfor maintenance and operating costs, such as spare parts and rising \nfuel costs, a part of the defense budget that is absolutely essential \nto keeping our existing systems and equipment ready in case they have \nto be deployed, and the sufficient allocation of fuel so that our \ntroops can have the proper training that is essential to their \nreadiness.\n  I can tell you there are a lot of pilots out there right now whose \nmorale is pretty low because they don't feel as if they are getting \nenough flying hours, so that if the call comes and they have to go \nabroad to defend this country--particularly the pilots who are flying \nthese precise pinpoint missions, not even to speak of the ones who have \nto engage in aerial combat--they will have had that training. This is \ngoing to be the consequence of keeping down the defense budget that \nthis administration is reflecting because of its fiscal proposal of a \ntax cut so large that it is going to absorb all of the projected \nsurplus--and, by the way, that may never materialize--over the next \ndecade.\n  If you cut the defense budget too severely, you are suddenly going to \nhave systems that have not been upgraded and we will have unsafe planes \nand ships. That is simply a consequence that I don't think is in the \ninterest of this country. After all, one of the main reasons for a \nnational Federal Government is to provide for the common defense. So we \nare starting to see the ripple effects of this proposed fiscal policy. \nWhy can't this fiscal policy instead be one that is balanced with a \nsubstantial tax cut?\n  The question is not a tax cut or not; the question is how large \nshould the tax cut be? That is where I argue for balance, so that we \nhave a substantial tax cut balanced with the increased spending needs. \nAnd I have just given one example of defense.\n  To give you another example, strengthening the Social Security fund; \nanother example is modernizing Medicare with a prescription drug \nbenefit; to give another example, increased investment in education. I \nhave just listed only four additional areas. In this time of prosperity \nand budget surpluses, if we are fiscally disciplined, and if we are \nfiscally conservative, then we can meet all of the needs in a budget \nthat will be balanced and that will protect the investment and spending \nneeds as well as returning part of the surplus in the form of a tax \ncut.\n  We have seen the charts offered by the Congressional Budget Office as \nto the projected surplus. I likened it, from my old position as the \nState fire marshal in Florida, to a fireman's hose. When that fireman \ntakes that hose into a fire and he starts turning the nozzle, it first \ngoes into fog, a light spray, and then increasingly, as you turn the \nnozzle, it goes into a straight stream of water.\n  The charts we saw by the CBO projecting what the surplus would be \nover the next 10 years look like the spray coming off of a fireman's \nhose. For the chart with a line up to the present showing what the \nsurplus is today, as you project it over 10 years, the range is from a \nhuge surplus 10 years out to no surplus at all 10 years out indeed, \ninto deficit. That is the inaccuracy of forecasting that CBO has \nadmitted is truth.\n  They also stated to us in the Budget Committee that the projected \nsurplus--60 percent of it--will not materialize until the last 5 years \nof the 10-year period--all the more increasing the uncertainty of what \nis going to be available.\n  So my plea to our colleagues, Madam President, is to let us be \nconservative in our planning, let us be fiscally disciplined and not \nfall back into the trap that I personally experienced when I voted for \nthe Reagan tax cuts in 1981 and suddenly realized that I had made a \nmistake--and the country at large understood that it was a mistake--\nbecause the cut was so big, we had to undo it in the decade of the \n1980s not once but three times. It had run us into such deficits in the \nrange of about $20 billion at the end of the decade of the 1970s to \ndeficits that were in excess of $300 billion per year by the end of the \ndecade of the 1980s. In other words, the Government of the United \nStates was spending $300 billion more each year than it had coming in \nin revenue, and that was getting tacked on to the national debt, which \nis what took us from a debt in the 1970s in the range of $700\n\n[[Page S1120]]\n\nbillion to a national debt that is in excess of $3.5 trillion today.\n  My argument to our distinguished colleagues in this august body is to \nuse balance, let's use fiscal discipline, and let's use fiscal \nconservatism as we plan and adopt the next budget for the United States \nof America.\n  Madam President, I am pleased to yield to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Georgia, one of the most able and capable of this body, a former \nAdministrator of the Veterans' Administration in the Carter \nadministration, a former distinguished Secretary of State of the State \nof Georgia, a distinguished junior Senator, now senior Senator, and \neven more so, I am proud that he is my good, personal friend. I yield \nto the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Madam President, it is an honor to share the floor with \nmy distinguished friend from Florida. He and I have known each other \nfor a long, long time.

Mr. President, I wish to express my gratitude to the \nleadership of both parties for making good on their commitment to make \nhigh speed rail a priority early in the 107th Congress. The support of \nboth Senator Lott and Senator Daschle and a majority of our colleagues \nwill send a message that Congress is serious about establishing rail as \na viable alternative to our crowded roads and skies.\n  This innovative finance bill will provide a dedicated source of \ncapital funding for high-speed rail that will not subtract from the \nhighway or aviation trust funds, or general appropriations. This is not \na handout. We will use a modest Federal investment to leverage $12 \nbillion in rail improvements. Amtrak's congressionally mandated \nrequirement to become operationally self sufficient is not affected by \nthis legislation.\n  Air traffic congestion is at an all time high and will only worsen \nover the next ten years. U.S. airports will have to deal with one \nbillion annual passengers in less than ten years. Already, one in every \nfour flights is delayed or canceled. Meanwhile, highway expansion has \nbecome extremely expensive and environmentally sensitive, as our major \narteries grow ever more clogged with traffic.\n  We desperately need a third leg to our national transportation \nstrategy. I believe passenger rail can function in that role.\n  High-speed rail is a reliable, efficient alternative to both driving \nand air travel--particularly over distances of 500 miles or less. \nInvestment in high-speed rail will ease overcrowding and delays at the \nairports that have the worst problems. Of the 20 airports with the most \nflight delays in 1999, 18 were located on high-speed rail corridors. \nAnd most of the airports projected to have the worst flight delay \nproblems over the next ten years are located on high-speed rail \ncorridors.\n  There has never been so much support at the national, state and local \nlevels for such an innovative rail financing measure. Last year, we had \n67 United States Senators, 171 U.S. House Members, the National \nGovernors' Association, U.S. Conference of Mayors, National League of \nCities, National Conference of State Legislatures, the environmental \ncommunity, organized labor and the business community--including such \nnotables as Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley Dean \nWitter--all support the High Speed Rail Investment Act. Today, we enjoy \nsimilar support, with more than half of the Senate joining us in \nsponsoring this landmark legislation.\n  High-speed rail projects are ready to go in more than 20 states \nacross the country. States that have promoted passenger rail for years \nand those which are just now investing in rail alternatives will \nbenefit from this Federal commitment to partnership in passenger rail \nfunding. The 2001 version of the bill provides sufficient financing to \nensure that these new corridors can enjoy the benefits of passenger \nrail.\n  The United States currently invests less than $600 million on its \nrail infrastructure, while spending $80 billion per year on highways \nand $19 billion per year on aviation. We even spend $1 billion every \nyear clearing road kills and $1.4 billion salting icy roads, but only a \nfraction of that amount on rail.\n  Where adding new highway and aviation capacity is now prohibitively \nexpensive, incremental improvements in rail capacity can provide a \nviable alternative for intercity travelers who face rising congestion \non existing highways. In fact, every dollar invested in new rail \ncapacity can deliver 5 to 10 times as much capacity as a dollar \ninvested in new highway capacity, depending on the location. A \ncomparable mile of new high-speed track is estimated to cost about $8 \nmillion per track-mile--the equivalent of about 450 passengers per hour \nfor every $1 million invested.\n  With this Federal investment, we can increase speeds, further reduce \ntrip times and better compete with airlines. In states like Texas, \nthese funds will be used to increase train speeds of existing Amtrak \ntrains, and to establish better, more reliable service along our three \ncorridors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/07/senate-section/article/S1120-2", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1120-S1121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NOMINATIONS\n\n\n                              GALE NORTON\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I supported the nomination of Gale Norton \nto be Secretary of the Interior.\n  As Secretary of the Interior, Ms. Norton will be responsible for the \nmanagement of nearly half a billion acres of Federal land. She will \nassume the responsibility of overseeing our Nation's public land \ntreasures--namely our national parks and wildlife refuges. She will \nalso be responsible for enforcing the laws that protect threatened and \nendangered species. The Secretary is in charge of many agencies that \ndirectly affect North Dakota, including the Bureau of Indian Affairs, \nthe Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Fish and \nWildlife Service, and the Geological Survey.\n  I met with Ms. Norton in my office earlier this month to discuss some \nof the critical issues facing my State and found her receptive to \nworking together to address these challenges. Water development is \ncritical in my State and has been among my highest priorities as \nSenator from North Dakota. Last year Congress passed the Dakota Water \nResources Act, which will redirect the Garrison Diversion Project to \nmeet North Dakota's contemporary water needs. The Bureau of \nReclamation, working under the direction of the Secretary, will be \nresponsible for implementing that act, and Ms. Norton indicated her \ndesire to help ensure the DWRA is implemented responsibly.\n  Ms. Norton will also face significant responsibilities and challenges \nin maintaining government-to-government relations with tribal nations. \nThe Department of the Interior, which includes the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs, is the entity most directly responsible for federal policy in \nIndian country. I know she has worked with Colorado tribes in the past \nand therefore has an understanding of many of the diverse and complex \nissues that tribes face. The tribes in my State anticipate building a \nproductive relationship with Ms. Norton and the new head of the Bureau \nof Indian affairs. I hope she will take time early in her tenure to \nmeet with the United Tribes of North Dakota and listen to their \nconcerns and goals for the future.\n  I was also pleased that during her confirmation hearings she was \ngiven the opportunity to explain her beliefs on public land management \nand to respond to some of the criticisms that had been leveled against \nher. I hope Ms. Norton will continue to follow the moderate stands she \nidentified during her confirmation hearing. Public land management \nissues are often very controversial locally as well as nationally, and \nMs. Norton will have to work very carefully to balance local interests \nwith the Nation's interests when resolving these conflicts.\n  Ms. Norton will face tremendous challenges as Secretary of the \nInterior, and I look forward to working with her on those issues.\n\n[[Page S1121]]\n\n                              ELAINE CHAO\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I supported Elaine Chao's nomination to be \nSecretary of Labor. I am confident that her experience and intellect \nwill serve her well as she considers issues relating to our Nation's \nworkforce and workplaces.\n  Elaine's career exemplifies her dedication to public service and \ncommitment to leadership. Elaine served as deputy transportation \nsecretary under former President Bush and later became director of the \nPeace Corps in 1991. She headed United Way of America between 1992 and \n1996, and she currently serves as a Heritage Foundation fellow. \nAdditionally, many of us in this body also know her as the \ndistinguished wife of our colleague, Senator Mitch McConnell.\n  As a member of the new Administration, I hope that Elaine will be \nable to build coalitions and work effectively with groups holding a \nwide range of political views. These skills will be essential as we \nconsider many of the important labor-related issues during the \nbeginning of the 21st Century.\n\n\n                            GOVERNOR WHITMAN\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I supported the nomination of New Jersey \nGovernor Christie Whitman to serve as Administrator of the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\n  As one of the organizers of the first Earth Day more than 30 years \nago, I understand the importance of protecting and improving our \nNation's environment. The Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking \nWater Act, and other major environmental statutes have helped this \nNation significantly improve our air and water quality. We have made \nsignificant progress over the past three decades, and North Dakota has \ndone well to maintain its clean environment. However, our Nation still \nhas too many areas that have dirty air and unclean water. Too many of \nour citizens develop diseases as a result of pollution in our \nenvironment. We need to continue the progress of the past three decades \nwithout sacrificing the tremendous economic growth of the past eight \nyears.\n  I met with Governor Whitman in my office last week to discuss some of \nthe differences between rural western States and more urban, \nindustrialized eastern States. I emphasized the need to develop \ndifferent solutions to environmental problems in different areas, and \nalso indicated my support for incentive-based approaches to improving \nour environment. I have been pleased to hear some of Governor Whitman's \npreliminary statements on that subject. However, I also believe we \ncannot abandon enforcement efforts to improve compliance with our \nNation's environmental laws. Governor Whitman will have to strike an \nappropriate balance between the two. It will be a difficult task, but \nafter meeting with her and reviewing her record, I believe she is up to \nthe job.\n  President Bush made a good selection when he asked Governor Whitman \nto head the EPA. She assumes a tremendous new responsibility, and I \nlook forward to working with her in her new role as Administrator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/07/senate-section/article/S1121-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 3, 2001, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on February 6, 2001, during the \nadjournment of the Senate, received a message from the House of \nRepresentatives announcing that the House has passed the following \njoint resolution, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.J.

A bill to ensure that immigrant students and their families \nreceive the services the students and families need to successfully \nparticipate in elementary schools, secondary schools, and communities \nin the United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, within the last decade, many States have \nexperienced a wave of immigration that is rivaling the first and second \nwaves of German, Irish, Polish and Scandinavian immigrants who arrived \nin the U.S. in the late 1800s and early 1900s. In fact, the Census \nBureau is estimating that these recently arrived immigrants and \nrefugees will account for 75 percent of the U.S. population growth over \nthe next 50 years. These changing demographics are impacting not just \ncommunities accustomed to large immigrant populations like New York, \nLos Angeles and Miami, but also non-traditional immigrant communities \nlike Gainesville, Georgia and Fremont County, Idaho.\n  One result of our new wave of immigrants is a significant increase in \nthe number of children with diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds \nenrolling in our schools. The Waterloo, Iowa school system, for \nexample, is being challenged to teach 400 Bosnian refugee children, who \ncame here without knowing our language, culture or customs. Schools in \nWausau, Wisconsin are filled with Asian children who want to achieve \nsuccess in the United States. In Dalton, Georgia, over 51 percent of \nthe student population in the public schools are Hispanic children \neager to participate in their new schools and communities. In Turner, \nMaine, the school-aged children of hundreds of recently arrived Latino \nimmigrant families are pouring into this rural town's schools.\n  It is clear that U.S. schools from Florida to Washington State are \nbeing increasingly challenged by these changing demographics. We need \nto make sure that these children are served appropriately--and that \ntheir families are as well. Studies have shown that where quality \neducational programs are joined with community-based services, \nimmigrants have an increased opportunity to become an integral part of \ntheir community and their children are better prepared to achieve \nsuccess in school.\n  The recent influx of immigrants into U.S. communities calls for \ninnovative and comprehensive solutions. Today I am reintroducing the \nImmigrants to New Americans Act. This legislation would establish a \ncompetitive grant program within the Department of Education to assist \nschools and communities which are experiencing an influx of recently \narrived immigrant families. Specifically, this grant program would \nprovide funding to partnerships of local school districts and \ncommunity-based organizations for the purpose of developing model \nprograms with a two-fold purpose: to assist culturally and \nlinguistically diverse children achieve success in America's schools \nand to provide their families with access to comprehensive community \nservices, including health care, child care, job training and \ntransportation.\n  It does take a village to raise a child, Mr. President.\n  I have seen firsthand the benefits of one community's program that \nbrings together teachers, community leaders and businesses in an \ninnovative partnership to aid their linguistically and culturally \ndiverse population. It is the Georgia Project, and its mission is to \nassist immigrant children from Mexico achieve to higher standards in \nDalton, Georgia's public schools.\n  In recent years, the carpet and poultry industries in Dalton and \nsurrounding Whitfield County experienced\n\n[[Page S1123]]\n\nthe need for a larger workforce. The city's visionary leaders \nencouraged immigrants from Mexico to settle in their community to fill \nthat need. The challenge has been in Dalton's public school system \nwhere Hispanic enrollment went from being just four percent ten years \nago to over 51 percent today.\n  To deal with this sizable increase, Dalton and Whitfield County \npublic school administrators and business leaders formed a public-\nprivate consortium. This consortium, known as The Georgia Project, \ninitiated a teacher exchange program in 1996 with the University of \nMonterrey in Mexico. Today, twenty teachers from Mexico are helping to \nbridge the language and culture gap by serving as instructors, \ncounselors and role models and providing Spanish language training to \nEnglish-speaking students. In addition, Dalton public school teachers \nspend a month each year in Monterrey, Mexico learning firsthand the \nculture, language and customs of the Hispanic students they serve.\n  There are other programs across the United States that address \nsimilar challenges experienced by the City of Dalton and Whitfield \nCounty. One such example is the Lao Family Project in St. Paul, \nMinnesota. This is a community-based refugee assistance organization \nthat provides a wide range of parent-student services to Hmong and \nVietnamese refugees in St. Paul in an effort to help parents become \neconomically self-sufficient and their children succeed in school. The \nLao Family Project's staff are bilingual/bicultural para-professionals \nwho provide services that include adult English-language acquisition \nprograms and preschool literacy activities for children.\n  In the rural communities of Healdsburg and Windsor, California, the \nEven Start program provides a variety of instructional and support \nservices to low-income, recently arrived Hispanic immigrant families \nand their preschool and elementary school children. The program focuses \non increasing family involvement in their children's education, helping \nparents and children with their literacy skills, and offering English \nas a second language course. Many of the instructional activities for \nthe parents' classes are coordinated with the classroom teachers to \nensure consistency with what is being taught to both the parent and \nchild. One focus of these classes is to communicate what the children \nare learning in their regular classes so that parents can help their \nchildren at home.\n  The Exemplary Multicultural Practices in Rural Education Program, or \nEMPIRE, operates in the Yakima region of rural Central Washington \nState, an area with a diverse mix of ethnic groups, including \nCaucasians, Hispanics, Native Americans, African Americans, and Asian \nAmericans. The program promotes positive race relations and an \nappreciation for ethnic and cultural differences. It encourages schools \nto develop learning environments where children of all backgrounds can \nbe successful in school and in the community. With support from \nEMPIRE's board of advisors, each school designs and carries out its own \nprojects based on local resources and needs. Schools in which EMPIRE is \nactive plan a wide variety of programs and activities with emphasis on \nstaff development, student awareness, parent involvement and \nimprovement of curriculum and instruction.\n  The Immigrants to New Americans Act is not a one-size-fits-all \napproach. It rewards model programs designed by individual communities \nto address that community's specific needs and challenges. The \nlegislation is endorsed by the National Association for Bilingual \nEducation, the League of United Latin American Citizens, the National \nCouncil of La Raza, the Hispanic Education Coalition, the India Abroad \nCenter for Political Awareness, the Southeast Asia Resource Action \nCenter, and the National Korean American Service and Education \nConsortium.\n  Our Nation's communities are being transformed by the diverse culture \nof their citizens. Successfully addressing this change will require \nleadership, creative thinking and an eagerness to encourage and promote \nthe promise that these new challenges bring. By doing so, we as a \nNation will better serve all our children--the best guarantee we have \nof ensuring America's strength, well into the 21st Century and beyond.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nthe letters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 269\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Immigrants to New Americans \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In 1997, there were an estimated 25,800,000 foreign-\n     born individuals residing in the United States. That number \n     is the largest number of such foreign-born individuals in \n     United States history and represents a 6,000,000, or 30 \n     percent, increase over the 1990 census figure of 19,800,000 \n     of such foreign-born individuals. The Bureau of the Census \n     estimates that the recently arrived immigrant population \n     (including the refugee population) currently residing in the \n     Nation will account for 75 percent of the population growth \n     in the United States over the next 50 years.\n       (2) For millions of immigrants settling into the Nation's \n     hamlets, towns, and cities, the dream of ``life, liberty, and \n     the pursuit of happiness'' has become a reality. The wave of \n     immigrants, of various nationalities, who have chosen the \n     United States as their home, has positively influenced the \n     Nation's image and relationship with other nations. The \n     diverse cultural heritage of the Nation's immigrants has \n     helped define the Nation's culture, customs, economy, and \n     communities. By better understanding the people who have \n     immigrated to the Nation, individuals in the United States \n     better understand what it means to be an American.\n       (3) There is a critical shortage of teachers with the \n     skills needed to educate immigrant students and their \n     families in nonconcentrated, nontraditional, immigrant \n     communities as well as communities with large immigrant \n     populations. The large influx of immigrant families over the \n     last decade presents a national dilemma: The number of such \n     families with school-age children requiring assistance to \n     successfully participate in elementary schools, secondary \n     schools, and communities in the United States, is increasing \n     without a corresponding increase in the number of teachers \n     with skills to accommodate their needs.\n       (4) Immigrants arriving in communities across the Nation \n     generally settle into high-poverty areas, where funding for \n     programs to provide immigrant students and their families \n     with the services the students and families need to \n     successfully participate in elementary schools, secondary \n     schools, and communities in the United States is inadequate.\n       (5) The influx of immigrant families settling into many \n     United States communities is often the result of concerted \n     efforts by local employers who value immigrant labor. Those \n     employers realize that helping immigrants to become \n     productive, prosperous members of a community is beneficial \n     for the local businesses involved, the immigrants, and the \n     community. Further, local businesses benefit from the \n     presence of the immigrant families because the families \n     present businesses with a committed and effective workforce \n     and help open up new market opportunities. However, many of \n     the communities into which the immigrants have settled need \n     assistance in order to give immigrant students and their \n     families the services the students and families need to \n     successfully participate in elementary schools, secondary \n     schools, and communities in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to establish a grant program, \n     within the Department of Education, that provides funding to \n     partnerships of local educational agencies and community-\n     based organizations for the development of model programs to \n     provide immigrant students and their families with the \n     services the students and families need to successfully \n     participate in elementary schools, secondary schools, and \n     communities in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       (1) Immigrant.--In this Act, the term ``immigrant'' has the \n     meaning given the term in section 101 of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101).\n       (2) Other terms.--Other terms used in this Act have the \n     meanings given the terms in section 14101 of the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 8801).\n\n     SEC. 5.

Max Cleland,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Dirksen Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cleland: On behalf of the National Association \n     for Bilingual Education (NABE), I want to thank you for \n     introducing legislation that will help address one of the \n     greatest challenges facing the American educational system--\n     that of addressing the changing needs of emerging immigrant \n     populations.\n       The dramatic demographic changes that are taking place in \n     our nation are forcing school districts and communities to \n     reevaluate their ability to integrate America's newcomers. \n     While it was once the case that immigrants settled primarily \n     in urban areas like New York City or Los Angeles, poultry \n     processing plants, meat packing firms, and other businesses \n     are attracting immigrants to states like Georgia, Iowa, \n     Arkansas, North Carolina and Idaho. Often, these communities \n     have no experience in helping immigrant children and families \n     integrate so that they too will attain the American dream and \n     help make our country stronger.\n       Your bill clearly recognizes the contributions that \n     immigrants have made to the United States over its history, \n     and takes a definitive step forward in the spirit of \n     empowerment through education and community-based \n     collaboration. NABE strongly believes that given the \n     appropriate tools and support immigrant students will rise to \n     the highest of levels of achievement. Our endorsement of this \n     forward-thinking legislation is a reaffirmation of this \n     philosophy, and we hope your colleagues in Congress will \n     grant it prompt approval. Once again, I commend you on the \n     introduction of this important piece of legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Delia Pompa,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  League of United\n\n\n                                      Latin American Citizens,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 26, 2001.\n     Hon. Max Cleland,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cleland: The League of United Latin American \n     Citizens (LULAC) wishes to thank you for your efforts at \n     facilitating and enhancing the ability of immigrant children \n     and their families to achieve success in America's schools \n     and communities. We would like to strongly support your \n     legislation, ``The Immigrants to New Americans Act.''\n       We believe that this act will greatly enhance the ability \n     for schools and community-based services to develop model \n     programs aimed at helping immigrant students\n\n[[Page S1125]]\n\n     and their families to receive the tools that they need to be \n     successful in their new homeland.\n       We find that this closely supports our mission and beliefs \n     that immigrants should be supported in any way possible. \n     LULAC is the oldest and largest Latino civil rights \n     organization in the United States. LULAC advances the \n     economic conditions, educational attainment, political \n     influence, health and civil rights of Hispanic Americans \n     through community-based programs operating at more than 700 \n     LULAC Councils nationwide.\n       Once again, thank you for putting forth this effort to help \n     those who need a little help getting started in this country. \n     Your legislation will help to carry the United States in a \n     positive way well into the 21st century.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Rick Dovalina,\n     LULAC National President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  National Council of La Raza,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 30, 2001.\n     Senator Max Cleland,\n     Senate Dirksen Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cleland: The National Council of La Raza \n     (NCLR) thanks you for your effort to facilitate and enhance \n     the participation of immigrants in American society. In \n     particular, we would like to express our support for your \n     legislation, the ``Immigrants to New Americans Act,'' which \n     would provide education, adult English as a Second Language \n     (ESL), job training, and other important services to \n     immigrants in ``emerging'' communities.\n       Over the past decade, dramatic shifts have occurred in the \n     immigrant population in the United States, particularly among \n     Hispanic immigrants. Many Hispanic immigrants have settled in \n     areas where their presence had previously been virtually \n     invisible. For example, the U.S. Census Bureau determined \n     that the South (Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, \n     Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee) \n     experienced a 93% increase in its Hispanic population from \n     1990 to 1998, far outpacing growth in ``traditional'' \n     Hispanic states like California, New York, and Texas, where \n     increases hovered around 32%. While the U.S. Census Bureau \n     estimated the total Hispanic population in the South in 1998 \n     to be 640,870, unofficial estimates place the Hispanic \n     population of both Georgia and North Carolina at close to \n     500,000 in each state. Midwestern states have also \n     experienced significant increases in their Hispanic \n     populations during this period, such as Iowa (74%), Minnesota \n     (61%), and Nebraska (96%). Many of these Hispanics are \n     immigrants in search of employment.\n       The emergence of new immigrant populations has created a \n     significant need for educational and social services. The \n     search for employment opportunities has historically been the \n     primary impetus for the migration of immigrants. An ever-\n     increasing availability of permanent employment has provided \n     the opportunity for many immigrants to settle with their \n     spouses and children, often in areas where previously there \n     had only been seasonal agricultural work available. However, \n     these opportunities have largely been in unskilled or low-\n     skilled, low-paying jobs, such as the textile, poultry, and \n     construction industries in the South; meat- and vegetable-\n     packing in the Midwest; and light manufacturing and service-\n     sector work in major cities like New York City, Los Angeles, \n     and Houston. As these new immigrant populations form \n     permanent settlements, they often face social isolation and \n     disconnection from mainstream society.\n       Emerging immigrant communities face a multitude of issues \n     in adapting to their new environment. Among the needs \n     identified in these communities are access to rigorous \n     standards-based curriculum in the public schools, effective \n     parental involvement in their children's education, adult \n     English-language acquisition programs, quality child care, \n     and employment and training. Your legislation would help \n     local communities to provide services in each of these \n     critical areas.\n       NCLR believes that the ``Immigrants to New Americans Act'' \n     can have a significant, positive impact on the lives of many \n     immigrant children and families, and on the communities in \n     which they are settling. That is why we strongly support your \n     legislation and encourage the entire Congress to do the same.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Raul Yzaguirre,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Hispanic Education Coalition,\n\n                                                 January 29, 2001.\n     Hon. Max Cleland,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Dirksen Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cleland: On behalf of the Hispanic Education \n     Coalition (HEC)--an ad hoc coalition of national \n     organizations dedicated to improving educational \n     opportunities for over 30 million Hispanics living in the \n     United States--we are writing to commend you for introducing \n     The Immigrants to New Americans Act. We support this \n     legislation because it will help improve educational \n     opportunities for Hispanic Americans by supporting education \n     and community-based collaboration.\n       Recent demographic data show that Hispanic children are the \n     fastest growing segment of the school-aged population. While \n     the majority of Hispanic children live in large urban areas \n     in states like California, Texas and Florida, more and more \n     Hispanic families are migrating to states like Arkansas, \n     Iowa, North Carolina and Georgia. Emerging immigrant \n     communities face a multitude of issues in adapting to their \n     new environment such as academic and language support and \n     effective parental involvement in their children's public \n     schools, adult English-language acquisition programs, and \n     employment and training. Communities like Rogers, Arkansas \n     are in dire need of assistance to ensure new Hispanic and \n     immigrant families are integrated in their communities and \n     schools.\n       The Immigrants to Americans Act recognizes that while local \n     communities may need support, they are ultimately in the best \n     position to address the needs of the newly arrived Hispanic \n     immigrant families. We are particularly supportive of the \n     inclusion of community-based organizations as partners in \n     developing model programs that help immigrant children \n     succeed in schools and provide families with access to \n     community services.\n       HEC believes that The Immigrants to New Americans Act can \n     have a significant, positive impact on the lives of many \n     immigrant children and families, their local communities and \n     our nation. That is why we strongly support your legislation \n     and encourage the entire Congress to do the same.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Patricia Loera,\n\n                                    Co-Chair, National Association\n                                          For Bilingual Education.\n\n       On behalf of: Association for the Advancement of Mexican \n     Americans (AAMA); HEP-CAMP Association; Hispanic Association \n     of Colleges and Universities (HACU); League of United Latin \n     American Citizens (LULAC); Migrant Legal Action Program; \n     National Association for Migrant Education (NAME); National \n     Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials \n     (NALEO); National Council of La Raza (NLCR); National Puerto \n     Rican Coalition (NPRC).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Levin, Mr. \n        Brownback, and Mr. Helms):\n  S. 270. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide a transitional adjustment for certain sole community hospitals \nin order to limit any decline in payment under the prospective payment \nsystem for hospital outpatient department services; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with my \ncolleagues Senators Jeffords, Levin, Brownback, and Helms the ``Rural \nHospital and Health Network Preservation Act of 2001.''\n  As you are aware, rural health care providers have operating margins \nthat are often much lower and more dependent upon Medicare and Medicaid \nreimbursement then suburban or urban providers. The Balanced Budget \nRefinement Act of 1999 (BBRA 99) allowed rural hospitals of less than \n100 beds to be held harmless in the conversion to the new outpatient \nProspective Payment System by allowing them to choose to stay \nessentially under the old fee-for-service program which provided them \nwith increased revenue. However, that 100-bed limit seems arbitrary and \nwill actually result in many slightly larger rural hospitals, that have \neven higher per patient costs and lower per patient margins, being \nsqueezed even harder under BBA 97 rules.\n  With passage of the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits \nImprovement and Protection Act of 2000, several additional fixes were \nput in place for rural providers. While these were steps in the right \ndirection, rural hospitals with between 100 and 400 beds are still not \nbeing held harmless in the conversion to the new outpatient Prospective \nPayment System. This group of hospitals is still suffering under \nprovisions of the BBA of 1997.\n  Rural hospitals, and all hospitals for that matter, operate on very \nslim margins yet manage to bring cutting-edge medical care to the \ncommunities they serve. But changes in Medicare payments to hospitals \nhave put many institutions in a bind.\n  The bill I am introducing today will extend the BBRA of 99 hold-\nharmless provisions to rural hospitals of up to 400 beds that are both \nRural Referral Centers and Sole Community Hospitals. This will bring \noutpatient reimbursement rates for these critical health care providers \ncloser in line to the actual health care costs incurred in rural \nAmerica by these valued providers.\n  Rural communities across New Mexico have felt the negative impact of \nthe BBA of 97. The Carlsbad Regional Medical Center, Eastern New Mexico \nMedical Center, San Juan Regional Medical Center, and Lea Regional \nHospital have\n\n[[Page S1126]]\n\nall been suffering because of the BBA of 97. They tell me that they are \nbearing substantially higher expenses per patient due to diseconomies \nof scale for the technically intensive speciality care that is required \nat these types of facilities. In addition, they face difficulties in \nrecruiting qualified health professionals, as well as qualified coders \nand compliance experts that are required under the new outpatient \nProspective Payment System given Medicare's complexity. This is not a \nNew Mexico only problem. There are at least sixty-one other rural \nhospitals that fall in this same category across the United States that \nare also suffering.\n  While the positive restorative effects of BBRA of 99 and the recently \nenacted ``Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and \nProtection Act of 2000'' were very helpful, they are not enough to \nprotect rural providers. We must prevent rural hospitals from reducing \nservices or closing completely. When a rural hospital reduces services, \nor worse yet closes, local residents lose access to preventive, \nroutine, and even emergency services. Doctors and other highly trained \nprofessionals move away. Then people must drive a hundred miles or more \nin some cases to get the care city dwellers take for granted. Local \neconomies suffer when jobs are lost. Existing businesses may have to \nmove, and new businesses won't locate in places where health care is \nunavailable. Hospital closure can be a death-knell for struggling \ntowns. We must move forward to preserve and strengthen the ability of \nour Nation's rural hospitals and other Medicare providers to provide \nadequate health care to their patients.\n  I urge my colleagues to support and pass the Rural Hospital and \nHealth Network Preservation Act of 2001.\n  I ask consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 270\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to rescind fiscal year 2001 procurement funds for the \nV-22 Osprey aircraft program other than as necessary to maintain the \nproduction base and to require certain reports to Congress concerning \nthat program; to the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on \nthe Budget, concurrently, pursuant to the order of January 30, 1975, as \nmodified by the order of April 11, 1986, with instructions that the \nBudget Committee be authorized to report its views to the \nAppropriations Committee, and that the latter alone be authorized to \nreport the bill.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Osprey \nSafety, Performance, and Reliability Evaluation Act of 2001. This \nlegislation would delay the procurement of the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor \naircraft for one year, and would require reports from the Secretary of \nthe Navy and the Department of Defense's Inspector General regarding \nthe program.\n  The Osprey is an experimental tilt-rotor aircraft that takes off and \nlands like a helicopter, but flies like an airplane by tilting its \nwing-mounted rotors forward to serve as propellers. The premise for the \naircraft is to combine the operational flexibility of a helicopter with \nthe speed, range, and efficiency of a fixed-wing aircraft.\n  The Marines, Air Force, and Navy all want to purchase versions of \nthis aircraft. The MV-22 would be used by the Marines for missions such \nas troop and cargo transport and amphibious assault; the CV-22 would be \nused by the Air Force for special operations; and the HV-22 would be \nused by the Navy for search and rescue missions.\n  I want to be very clear. This bill does not terminate the V-22 \nprogram. It does not affect the Marine Corps' ability to continue the \nresearch, development, testing, and evaluation of this aircraft.\n  This bill delays the start of full-rate procurement of the MV-22 \nOsprey, the Marines' version of this aircraft, for one year. It also \ndelays the procurement of four CV-22s, the Air Force's version of this \naircraft, for one year.\n  There are serious allegations and serious questions surrounding the \nV-22 program. Thirty Marines have died in Osprey crashes since 1991. \nMany questions regarding the validity of maintenance records and the \nsafety and viability of this aircraft remain unanswered.\n  We cannot, in good conscience, move forward with the full-scale \nprocurement of the MV-22 until these allegations have been investigated \nfully and until these questions have been answered.\n  We should not move forward with the procurement of this aircraft \nuntil further testing has been done to address potentially serious \ndesign flaws that could continue to endanger the lives of our military \npersonnel.\n  We owe it to our men and women in uniform to put their safety first. \nThey are willing to go into harm's way while serving their country. \nThat service should not include being put into harm's way by a \npotentially unsafe aircraft. We should not move forward with the \nprocurement of an aircraft that crashed as recently as December. We \nshould not procure this aircraft until the Department of Defense is \nabsolutely certain that all major design flaws have been corrected.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today will delay full-rate \nproduction of the MV-22 for one year. This delay is prudent given the \nongoing controversy that has loomed over this program during the last \nweeks and months.\n  I want to reiterate that this legislation does not require the \nDepartment of Defense to terminate the Osprey program. I appreciate the \nimportance of this program to the Marine Corps. I agree that they need \nto replace the aging CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters that they currently \nhave. However, I am not sure that the Osprey is the safest and most \ncost-effective alternative to the Sea Knight.\n  I know that the leaders of the Marines and the Air Force have the \ngreatest concern for the safety of their personnel who are and who will \nbe assigned to the Osprey program. I share that concern. My bill would \nrequire the Marine Corps to wait one year to move to full-rate \nproduction of the MV-22. Because the airframes for the MV-22 and the \nCV-22 are 90 percent similar, it follows that the four CV-22s the Air \nForce plans to buy this year may be subject to many of the same design \nflaws that have been found in the MV-22. For that reason, my bill would \nalso require the Air Force to wait one year to procure the four CV-22s, \nwhich would be used to train their pilots.\n  I realize that an effort is being made to address the design flaws \nfound during testing of this aircraft resulting in some changes in the \nnew planes that are scheduled to go into production in fiscal year \n2001. However, I remain concerned about the many unanswered questions, \nand the potentially costly retrofits that these aircraft would require \nas more information about the safety and reliability of the Osprey \ncontinues to come to light. In my view, it would be more prudent and \nmore cost effective to wait to move to full-rate production until these \nquestions have been answered.\n  For those reasons, my bill rescinds most of the fiscal year 2001 \nprocurement funds for the MV-22 and the CV-22, but leaves enough \nfunding in place to maintain the integrity of the production line. \nThese rescissions would return to the taxpayers more than $1.2 billion \ndollars. This kind of investment should not go forward until we are \nsure that the Osprey is safe.\n  The bill does not affect the $148 million in research and development \nfunding for this program. During the next year, vigorous research and \ntesting on the problems that remain should continue once the decision \nhas been made to resume test flights.\n\n[[Page S1127]]\n\n  This program has a troubled history. Thirty Marines have been killed \nin Osprey crashes since 1991, twenty-three of them in the past eleven \nmonths alone. The Osprey program has been grounded since the December \ncrash that killed four Marines. Following that crash, former Secretary \nof Defense William Cohen appointed a blue ribbon panel to study the \nOsprey program. That panel's report is due to be presented to Secretary \nof Defense Rumsfeld in March or April of this year. In addition, two \ninvestigations on the December crash are ongoing.\n  The safety of our men and women in uniform should be the top priority \nevery time the Department of Defense develops and procures new \ntechnology, whether it be weapons, ships, or aircraft.\n  During his tenure as Secretary of Defense, Vice President Cheney \ntried to cancel the V-22 program in each of his budget requests from \nfiscal year 1990 through 1993 because he believed the program was too \ncostly. Congress disagreed, and the program continued to receive funds.\n  When asked about the Osprey program last month, the Vice President \nsaid, ``Given the track record and the loss of life so far, it would \nappear to me that there are very serious questions that can and should \nbe--and I hope will be--raised about the Osprey.''\n  I agree with Vice President Cheney's statement, and I hope that this \nlegislation will help to get answers to these serious concerns.\n  One additional concern about this program is its cost. The Marines, \nthe Air Force, and the Navy each want to buy a version of this \naircraft, for a total of 458 aircraft at a cost of $38.1 billion, or \nabout $83 million per Osprey. Some defense observers have argued that \nthe mission of the Osprey could be performed by less costly \nhelicopters.\n  Another concern is the safety of the aircraft. One of the newspapers \nin my home state of Wisconsin, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, has \ncalled the Osprey a ``lemon with wings.'' Is that a fair description? \nThere is reason to pause and take a good look at the program and find \nout. In addition to the four crashes that have occurred since 1991, \nthere are also a number of unanswered questions regarding the design \nand performance of the aircraft.\n  The MV-22 underwent operational evaluation, OPEVAL, between October \n1999 and August 2000. During OPEVAL, in June 2000, a draft DoD \nInspector General's report cited 23 major operational effectiveness and \nsuitability requirements that would not be met prior to the scheduled \nDecember 2000 Milestone III decision on whether to enter into full-rate \nproduction of the MV-22 in June 2001. The Marine Corps conceded that \nthese problems exist, and said they had been aware of these \ndeficiencies prior to the beginning of the OPEVAL.\n  In October 2000, the Navy announced that the MV-22 had been judged \noperationally effective and suitable for land-based operations. In \nNovember 2000, the MV-22 was also judged operationally effective and \nsuitable for sea-based operations.\n  Following the completion of OPEVAL, the Department of Defense's \nDirector of Operational Testing and Evaluation, Philip Coyle, released \nhis report on the MV-22. This report, which was issued on November 17, \n2000, makes a number of recommendations regarding further testing that \nshould be conducted on this aircraft, including testing on a number of \nrequirements for the aircraft that were waived during OPEVAL.\n  Particularly troubling are the MV-22's Mission Capable, MC, and Full \nMission Capable, FMC, rates at the end of OPEVAL. These ratings \ndemonstrate the availability of the aircraft--the amount of time that \neach MV-22 is able to fly versus the amount of time that each MV-22 is \nunavailable due to maintenance needs.\n  The Mission Capable rating represents the percentage of time that the \ntest aircraft were able to perform at least one of their assigned \nmissions. The Marine Corps' objective for the MC rate is between 82 and \n87 percent. At the end of OPEVAL, the MC rate for the MV-22 was 49 \npercent. That means, Mr. President, that the MV-22 test fleet was \ncapable of performing at least one of its missions only 49 percent of \nthe time during OPEVAL. From 1995-1999, the entire CH-46 fleet Sea \nKnight fleet, which the Osprey is supposed to replace, was rated \nMission Capable 79 percent of the time.\n  The Full Mission Capable rate, FMC, is defined as the percentage of \ntime that the aircraft could perform all of its assigned missions. The \nMarine Corps' objective for FMC is 75 percent. At the end of OPEVAL, \nthe MV-22 had a FMC rate of only 20 percent. From 1995-1999, the CH-46 \nfleet had a FMC rate of 74 percent.\n  I want to say this again--at the end of OPEVAL, the MV-22 test fleet \nwas capable of performing all of its assigned missions only 20 percent \nof the time. The Coyle report says that part of this low rating can be \nattributed to problems with the blade fold wing stow, BFWS, system, and \nthat measures to address this problem will be incorporated into all new \nMV-22s.\n\n  While both the MC and the FMC both improved over the course of \nOPEVAL, both rates are still well below the Marines' own requirements. \nBy delaying the full rate production of the MV-22 for one year, the \nMarines will have the opportunity to further improve these crucial \nrates, including testing the modifications to the BFWS system, and \npotentially save countless maintenance hours and costs over the life of \nthis program.\n  In addition to the problems outlined in the Coyle report, a General \nAccounting Office report released last month titled ``Major Management \nChallenges and Program Risks: Department of Defense'' also expresses \nconcern about the Osprey program. The report states that ``the DoD . . \n. begins production on many major and nonmajor weapons without first \nensuring that the systems will meet critical performance \nrequirements.'' The report cites a number of examples, including the \nOsprey. GAO reports that ``the Navy was moving toward a full-rate \nproduction decision on the MV-22 Osprey aircraft without having an \nappropriate level of confidence that the program would meet design \nparameters as well as cost and schedule objectives.''\n  This finding is just another of the many reasons why the full-rate \nprocurement of the MV-22 and the procurement of four CV-22s should be \ndelayed. I share GAO's concern about the frequency with which DoD moves \ninto full-rate production of systems that may not have been adequately \ntested. This rush to production often raises safety concerns and costs \nthe taxpayers large sums for costly retrofits to address problems that \nwere often evident--but not fixed--before full-rate production began. \nAnd even if the Osprey is proven to be safe, questions still remain \nabout its cost.\n  I am also deeply troubled by the allegations that the Commander of \nthe Marine Tilt-Rotor Training Squadron 204 may have ordered his team \nto falsify maintenance records for the MV-22. An anonymous DoD whistle \nblower released a letter and documentation, including an audio tape on \nwhich it is reported that the Commander is heard telling his squadron \nto ``lie'' about maintenance reports on the MV-22 until the Milestone \nIII decision to move into full-rate production of the aircraft had been \nmade. This decision was scheduled to be made in December 2000, but has \nbeen postponed indefinitely. The Commander has been relieved of his \ncommand pending a full investigation by the DoD Inspector General's \noffice.\n  There have been reports that high-ranking Marine Corps officers may \nhave known about the low MC and FMC rates for the MV-22 in November \n2000, and that one of them may have released inaccurate information to \nthe press regarding the Mission Capable rates of the MV-22.\n  An electronic mail message from one of these officers to a superior \nofficer dated November 11, 2000, states that the information regarding \nthe MV-22 MC and FMC rates for November contained in the message should \nbe ``close held'' and that the MC and FMC rates for Squadron 204 were \n26.7 percent and 7.9 percent, respectively. The message also said that \nthe sender ``had hoped to be able to use some recent numbers next month \nwhen [his superior] meet[s] with Dr. Buchanan for his Milestone III/FRP \ndecision in December . . . this isn't going to help.''\n  Later that month, on November 30, 2000, the officer who reportedly \nsent that electronic mail message participated in a DoD press briefing \nat which\n\n[[Page S1128]]\n\nthe Osprey was discussed in some detail. During this press briefing, \nthe officer said the following regarding the Mission Capable rates of \nthe MV-22s being tested by Squadron 204: ``. . . as I was walking down \nhere [to the briefing], I pulled the first 13 days of November, \nmission-capable rate on those airplanes, and the average is 73.2 \npercent for the first 13 days in November of those nine airplanes. So \nwhen we start talking about the airplane, even since OPEVAL, improving \nand getting better, the answer is it is absolutely a resounding yes.''\n  This information is contrary to the electronic mail message that the \nofficer in question reportedly sent to a superior officer only nine \ndays before, which stated that the MC rate for the MV-22s being tested \nby Squadron 204 for November 2000 was only 26.7 percent. That is a \ndifference of 46.5 percent. News reports last week said that the \nofficer admitted sending the message and attributes the discrepancy in \nthe MC rate figures to a new software system.\n  I understand that these very serious allegations are still being \ninvestigated, and I agree that all of those involved deserve a fair and \nimpartial investigation. We should not rush to judgement about the \nalleged conduct of any of these personnel, all of whom who have \ndedicated their lives to serving and protecting this country. However, \nwe must remain cognizant of the fact that the outcome of this \ninvestigation could have an enormous impact on the Osprey program.\n  This still unfolding situation is another reason why the full rate \nprocurement of the MV-22 should be delayed. Until these disturbing \nallegations have been fully investigated to determine whether records \nwere falsified in order to make the Osprey appear safe and reliable, \nthe Department of Defense should not move ahead with this program.\n  Because of the safety concerns outlined above, Mr. President, my bill \nrequires the Secretary of the Navy to submit a report to the Congress \non the V-22 program that includes: a description of the planned uses \nfor the fiscal year 2001 research and development funding for the \nOsprey program; a description of the actions taken as a result of the \nCoyle report; and a description of the manner in which the Navy and the \nMarine Corps have responded to the allegations of the falsification of \nmaintenance records at Squadron 204. The bill also requires the DoD \nInspector General to report to the Congress on the results of its \ninvestigation into the alleged falsification of maintenance records at \nSquadron 204. It would require that these reports be submitted three \nmonths after the enactment of this legislation or on the date of the \nMilestone III decision regarding full-rate production of the MV-22 \nOsprey, whichever is earlier.\n  The safety of our men and women in uniform should be the principle \nthat guides this important decision. We should not begin to procure the \nMV-22 in mass quantities until we know for certain that this aircraft \nis safe, that its maintenance records are accurate, and that the design \nflaws described in the Coyle report have been adequately addressed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 272\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, on behalf \nof myself and my distinguished colleague, Senator Corzine, a bill that \nwill help bring more criminals to justice and create a better federal \njudicial system in New Jersey. This legislation will divide the federal \nDistrict of New Jersey into the Southern and Northern Districts of New \nJersey thus enabling federal courts and federal law enforcement to \nbetter serve the State's approximately eight million residents.\n  Currently, the District of New Jersey has 17 judges. This bill does \nnot increase the number of judges, but divides them between the \nSouthern and Northern Districts giving the South 7 judges and the North \n10. The bill will also result in the creation of several new federal \npositions for the Southern District including a Clerk of the Court, \nU.S. Attorney, U.S. Marshal, and a Federal Public Defender.\n  The creation of two districts in New Jersey is called for by the \nadditional crime-fighting resources a split will bring to the State and \nby the sheer size of the State. The current District of New Jersey is \nthe third most populous federal judicial district in the nation. Of the \n25 states that have a single federal judicial district, New Jersey has \nthe largest population. More than a dozen states with smaller \npopulations have multiple judicial districts. In fact, with more than 2 \nmillion residents in the southern counties, the population of the \nproposed Southern District of New Jersey would exceed that of almost \nhalf of the current judicial districts. The proposed Northern District \nwould rank even higher.\n  And while the bill would not create any new judgeships, it would mean \nthat, for the first time, the judges of the Southern District would \nnecessarily come from and be part of the unique community they serve. \nThis can only lead to enhanced sensitivity to the community's needs.\n  The bill will also take a significant step towards addressing the \ndisparity in crime-fighting resources allocated to northern and \nsouthern New Jersey. In 1998, southern New Jersey accounted for 25 \npercent of the state's urban murders, 32 percent of the state's murder \narrests and 33 percent of the state's arrests for violent crimes. \nDespite these statistics, only 10 percent of the FBI agents, 15 percent \nof U.S. Marshals and 18 percent of DEA agents in New Jersey are \nassigned to the southern counties.\n  The bill will also ensure that crime-fighting decisions are made \nlocally instead of by officials who are based elsewhere in the state. \nThis too would result in a government more sensitive and responsive to \nthe people it serves.\n  Given these facts, it is not surprising that the bill has received a \nringing endorsement from many in New Jersey's\n\n[[Page S1129]]\n\nlegal and law enforcement community. In the last Congress, the House \nversion of this bill was cosponsored by the entire southern New Jersey \nCongressional delegation. I hope to have their support again. It is \nalso supported by the New Jersey State Bar Association, all of the \nsouthern county bar associations, the South Jersey Police Chief's \nAssociation, the Chamber of Commerce of Southern New Jersey, and \nvarious former county prosecutors and former federal law enforcement \nofficials.\n  While the process of reviewing and deliberating the merits of this \nlegislation will be lengthy and time consuming, this is a change that \nis long overdue. The citizens of New Jersey deserve a better federal \njudicial system and their fair share of federal crime-fighting \nresources. I look forward to working with my colleagues to secure \npassage of this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 273\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In 1978, the Judicial Conference of the United States \n     established a procedure for creating new Federal judicial \n     districts, which is still in force. According to the \n     ``Proceedings of the Judicial Conference, September 21-22, \n     1978'', this procedure requires that 4 principal criteria be \n     taken into consideration in evaluating the establishment of a \n     new Federal judicial district: caseload, judicial \n     administration, geography, and community convenience.\n       (2) The criterion of ``caseload'' is found to include the \n     total number of Federal court cases and the number of cases \n     per Federal judge, for both criminal and civil Federal cases.\n       (3)(A) The 13 southern counties of New Jersey, consisting \n     of Atlantic, Burlington, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, \n     Gloucester, Hunterdon, Mercer, Monmouth, Ocean, Salem, \n     Somerset, and Warren Counties, have a substantial criminal \n     caseload which requires the creation of a separate judicial \n     district.\n       (B) 463 Federal criminal cases originated in the 13 \n     southern New Jersey counties in fiscal year 1999 and were \n     handled principally by the 5 judges of the Camden vicinage \n     and the 3 judges of the Trenton vicinage.\n       (C) In fiscal year 1999, the criminal cases originating in \n     the 13 southern New Jersey counties exceeded that of 57 of \n     the current 93 Federal judicial districts other than the \n     District of New Jersey. Only 36 of the other current Federal \n     judicial districts had more criminal cases than the southern \n     region of New Jersey.\n       (D) For example, in the District of Massachusetts (19 \n     judges), 434 criminal cases were filed in fiscal year 1999. \n     In the District of Connecticut (14 judges), only 250 criminal \n     cases were filed in fiscal year 1999.\n       (4)(A) The substantial civil caseload concentrated in the \n     southern counties of New Jersey requires the creation of a \n     separate judicial district.\n       (B) Approximately 2,983 Federal civil cases originated in \n     the 13 southern New Jersey counties in fiscal year 1999 and \n     were handled principally by the 5 judges of the Camden \n     vicinage and the 3 judges of the Trenton vicinage.\n       (C) In the fiscal year 1999, the civil cases originating in \n     the 13 southern New Jersey counties exceeded that of 68 of \n     the current Federal judicial districts other than the \n     District of New Jersey. Only 25 of the other Federal judicial \n     districts had more civil cases than the southern region of \n     New Jersey.\n       (D) For example, in the Southern District of West Virginia, \n     a separate judicial district with 8 judges, only 1,203 civil \n     cases were commenced in fiscal year 1999. The Western \n     District of Tennessee, with 6 judges, had only 1,512 civil \n     cases commenced in fiscal year 1999.\n       (5) The criterion of ``judicial administration'' is found \n     to include the backlog of pending cases in a Federal judicial \n     district, which hinders the effective resolution of pending \n     business before the court.\n       (6)(A) The size of the backlog of pending cases \n     concentrated in the 13 southern counties of New Jersey \n     requires the creation of a separate judicial district.\n       (B) In fiscal year 1999, the pending criminal cases \n     attributed to the 13 southern New Jersey counties exceeded \n     that of 62 of the current 93 Federal judicial districts other \n     than the District of New Jersey. Only 31 of the other current \n     Federal judicial districts had more pending criminal cases \n     than the southern region of New Jersey.\n       (C) In fiscal year 1999, the pending civil cases attributed \n     to the 13 southern New Jersey counties exceeded that of 66 of \n     the current 93 Federal judicial districts other than the \n     District of New Jersey. Only 27 of the other current Federal \n     judicial districts had more pending civil cases than the \n     southern region of New Jersey.\n       (D) The number of pending cases in the Camden vicinage of \n     New Jersey exceeds the number of cases pending before entire \n     judicial districts with similar numbers of judges, clearly \n     indicating that southern New Jersey merits a separate Federal \n     judicial district. For example, as of October 1, 1999, there \n     were 1,431 civil cases pending before the Camden vicinage, \n     and only 113 of those were commenced in fiscal year 1999. The \n     Western District of Tennessee, with 6 judges, had only 1,079 \n     civil cases pending in fiscal year 1999. The Western District \n     of Oklahoma had only 1,356 civil cases pending in fiscal year \n     1999 before 9 judges. Finally, there are 161 criminal cases \n     pending before the Camden vicinage, while the entire Southern \n     District of Indiana, with 7 judges, had only 117 criminal \n     cases pending in fiscal year 1999.\n       (7) The criterion of ``geography'' is found to mean the \n     accessibility of the central administration of the Federal \n     judicial district to officers of the court, parties with \n     business before the court, and other citizens living within \n     the Federal judicial district.\n       (8)(A) The distance between the northern and southern \n     regions of New Jersey and the density of New Jersey's \n     population create a substantial barrier to the efficient \n     administration of justice.\n       (B) The distance from Newark, New Jersey to Camden, New \n     Jersey is more than 85 miles.\n       (C) When a new Federal court district was created in \n     Louisiana in 1971, the distance between New Orleans and Baton \n     Rouge (nearly 80 miles) was cited as a major factor in \n     creating a new district court, as travel difficulties were \n     impeding the timely administration of justice.\n       (9) The criterion of ``community convenience'' is found to \n     mean the extent to which creating a new Federal judicial \n     district will allow the court to better serve the population \n     and diverse communities of the area.\n       (10)(A) New Jersey's culturally and regionally diverse \n     population of over 8,000,000 citizens, widely distributed \n     across a densely populated State, is inconvenienced by having \n     only 1 judicial district.\n       (B) The District of New Jersey is the third most populous \n     Federal judicial district in the United States.\n       (C) The population of the 13 southern New Jersey counties \n     exceeds the population of 67 of the current 93 Federal \n     judicial districts other than the District of New Jersey. The \n     population of the 8 northern New Jersey counties (consisting \n     of Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Sussex, \n     and Union) exceeds the population of 73 of the current 93 \n     Federal judicial districts other than the District of New \n     Jersey.\n       (D) Of the 25 States that have only a single Federal \n     judicial district (including Puerto Rico, the United States \n     territories, and the District of Columbia), New Jersey has \n     the highest population.\n       (E) More than a dozen States have smaller populations than \n     New Jersey, yet they have multiple Federal judicial \n     districts, including Washington, Oklahoma, Iowa, Georgia, \n     West Virginia, and Missouri.\n       (11) In evaluating the creation of a new Southern District \n     of New Jersey, the Judicial Conference should seek the views \n     of the chief judge of the affected district, the judicial \n     council for the affected circuit court, and the affected \n     United States Attorney as representative of the views of the \n     Department of Justice, as required in the procedure \n     established by the ``Proceedings of the Judicial Conference, \n     September 21-22, 1978''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to establish a Congressional Trade Office; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today to create a \nCongressional Trade Office. It is similar to the bill I offered in the \nlast session of Congress. This legislation is designed to assist the \nCongress in fulfilling our Constitutional responsibility for trade \npolicy by creating an entity that can provide us with the expertise we \nneed to get independent, non-partisan, and neutral analysis and \ninformation about trade.\n  Over the past three decades, the role of trade in our economy has \ngrown enormously. In 1970, trade was equal to only eleven percent of \nour Gross Domestic Product. In contrast, today exports and imports are \nequivalent to 27 percent of our economy.\n  I have been in Congress for 26 years. During that time, I have \nwatched a continuing transfer of authority and responsibility for trade \npolicy from the Congress to the Executive Branch. The trend has been \nsubtle, but it has been clear and constant. We need to reverse this \ntrend.\n  Article I, Section 8, of the U.S. Constitution says: ``The Congress \nshall have power . . . To regulate commerce with foreign nations.'' It \nis our responsibility to set the direction for the Executive Branch in \nits Formulation of trade policy. It is our responsibility to ensure \nthat agreements with our trading partners are followed and that there \nis full compliance. It is our responsibility to provide more effective \nand active oversight of our nation's trade policy. I believe strongly \nthat we must re-assert Congress' constitutionally defined \nresponsibility for international commerce.\n  The Congressional Trade Office I am proposing will provide the entire \nCongress, through the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and \nMeans Committee, with the additional trade expertise that will allow us \nto meet these responsibilities.\n  The trade issues that the Congress may face this session are many and \ncomplex: Fast track; incorporating legitimate labor and environmental \nissues into trade policy; the U.S./Jordan Free Trade Agreement; the \nU.S./Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement; Free Trade Area for the \nAmericas; possible free trade agreements with Singapore, Chile, and \nothers; Chinese accession to WTO and then compliance with its WTO \ncommitments; and a new comprehensive multilateral trade round.\n  Congress needs to be much better prepared to deal with these issues \nresponsibly and authoritatively. That means we need access to more and \nbetter information, independently arrived at, from people whose \ncommitment is to the Congress, and only to the Congress.\n  The Congressional Trade Office would help us meet these \nresponsibilities through its four core functions.\n  First, it will monitor compliance with major bilateral, regional, and \nmultilateral trade agreements. Congress needs the independent ability \nto look more closely at agreements with other countries. The \nCongressional Trade Office will analyze the performance under key \nagreements and evaluate success based on commercial results. It will do \nthis in close consultation with the affected industries. The \nCongressional Trade Office will recommend to the Congress actions \nnecessary to ensure that commitments made to the United States are \nfully implemented. It will also provide annual assessments of the \nextent to which agreements comply with labor and environmental goals.\n  The General Accounting Office has reported on the deficiencies in the \nExecutive Branch in following trade agreements and monitoring \ncompliance. Often more energy goes into negotiating new agreements than \ninto ensuring that existing agreements work. The Administration has \nincreased the resources it devotes to compliance, and I supported that. \nBut an independent and neutral assessment in the Congress of compliance \nis necessary. It is unrealistic to expect an agency that negotiated an \nagreement to provide a totally objective and dispassionate assessment \nof that agreement's success or failure. Human nature, and institutional \nnature, does not lead to such an outcome.\n  Second, observing trade negotiations first hand is critical to the \nability of Congress to provide meaningful oversight of trade policy. \nCongressional Trade Office staff will participate in selected \nnegotiations as observers and report back to the Committees.\n  Third, the Congressional Trade Office will be active in dispute \nsettlement deliberations. It will evaluate each WTO decision where the \nU.S. is a participant. In the case of a U.S. loss, it will explain why \nit lost. In the case of a U.S. win, it will measure the commercial \nresults from that decision. Congressional Trade Office staff should \nparticipate as observers on the U.S. delegation at appropriate dispute \nsettlement panel meetings at the WTO.\n  I don't think we even know whether the WTO dispute settlement process \nhas been successful or not from the perspective of U.S. commercial \ninterests. A count of wins versus losses tells us nothing. The \nCongressional Trade Office will give us the facts we need to evaluate \nthis process properly.\n  Fourth, the Congressional Trade Office will have an analytic \nfunction. For example, after the Administration delivers its annual \nNational Trade Estimates report, the NTE, to Congress, it will analyze \nthe major outstanding trade barriers based on the cost to the\n\n[[Page S1131]]\n\nU.S. economy. It will also provide an analysis of the Administration's \nTrade Policy Agenda.\n  The Congressional Trade Office will analyze proposed trade \nagreements. It will examine the impact of Administration trade policy \nactions. And it will analyze the trade accounts every quarter, \nincluding the global current account, the global trade account, and key \nbilateral trade accounts.\n  The Congressional Trade Office is designed to service the Congress. \nIts Director will report to the Senate Finance Committee and the House \nWays and Means Committee. It will also advise other committees on both \nthe impact of trade negotiations and the impact of the Administration's \ntrade policy on those committees' areas of jurisdiction. Trade rules \nincreasingly affect domestic regulations. Expertise on the implications \nof trade policy on domestic regulatory issues will be vitally \nnecessary. The Congressional Trade Office can provide that assistance.\n  The staff of the Congressional Trade Office will consist of \nprofessionals who have a mix of expertise in economics and trade law, \nplus in various industries and geographic regions. My expectation is \nthat staff members will see this as a career position, thus, providing \nthe Congress with long-term institutional memory.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this innovative proposal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Gramm, Mrs. Lincoln, and \n        Mr. Bayh):\n  S. 275. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe Federal estate and gift taxes and the tax on generation-skipping \ntransfers, to preserve a step up in basis of certain property acquired \nfrom a decedent, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today, Senators Breaux, Gramm, Lincoln, and \nBayh and I are introducing the Estate Tax Elimination Act, a bill to \nreplace the federal estate tax with a tax on capital gains earned from \ninherited assets due when those assets are sold.\n  This is the approach that won the support of bipartisan majorities in \nboth houses of Congress last year. Instead of levying an estate tax at \ndeath, Congress agreed that a tax should be imposed when income is \nactually realized from inherited property--that is, when it is sold. \nThe bipartisan consensus that already exists in support of this plan \nmeans that Congress and President Bush--who, unlike his predecessor, \nsupports repeal of the death tax--can come together and quickly dispose \nof the issue this year.\n  Mr. President, the beauty of this approach is that it removes death \nas the trigger for any tax. Whether an asset is sold by the decedent \nduring his or her lifetime, or by someone who later inherits the \nproperty, the gain is taxed the same. Death neither confers a benefit, \nnor results in a punitive, confiscatory tax. Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle accepted this arrangement last year, and should support it \nagain this year.\n  Mr. President, we know that many Americans are troubled by the estate \ntax's complexity and high rates, and by the mere fact that it is \ntriggered by a person's death rather than the realization of income. \nFor a long time, I have advocated repeal, because I believe death \nshould not be a taxable event.\n  Others agree that the tax is problematic, but are concerned that the \nunrealized appreciation in certain assets might escape taxation forever \nif the death tax were repealed while the step-up in basis allowed by \nunder current law remained in effect. That is a legitimate concern.\n  We address this by recommending the elimination of both the death tax \nand the step-up in basis, and attributing a carryover basis to \ninherited property so that all gains are taxed at the time the property \nis sold and income is realized.\n  The concept of a carryover basis is not new. It exists in current law \nwith respect to gifts, property transferred in cases of divorce, and in \nconnection with involuntary conversions of property relating to theft, \ndestruction, seizure, requisition, or condemnation.\n  In the latter case, when an owner receives compensation for \ninvoluntarily converted property, a taxable gain normally results to \nthe extent that the value of the compensation exceeds the basis of the \nconverted property. However, Section 1033 of the Internal Revenue Code \nallows the taxpayer to defer the recognition of the gain until the \nproperty is sold. The concept recommended in this amendment would treat \nthe transfer of property at death--perhaps the most involuntary \nconversion of all--the same way, deferring recognition of any gain \nuntil the inherited property is sold.\n  Small estates, which currently pay no estate tax by virtue of the \nunified credit, and no capital-gains tax by virtue of the step up, \nwould be unaffected by the basis changes being proposed here. The \nestate tax would be eliminated for them, and a limited step-up in basis \nwould be preserved. Each person could still step up the basis in his or \nher assets by up to $2.8 million. Beyond that, a carryover basis would \napply.\n  I want to stress to colleagues, particularly colleagues on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle, that this measure would not allow \nunrealized appreciation in inherited assets--beyond the limited step-up \namount--to go untaxed, as other death-tax repeal proposals would do. We \nare merely saying that if a tax is imposed, it should be imposed when \nincome is realized.\n  Mr. President, some people may ask whether the American people want \nthis kind of tax relief. I will answer that question. Although most \nAmericans will probably never pay a death tax, most still sense that \nthere is something terribly wrong with a system that allows Washington \nto seize more than half of whatever is left after someone dies--a \nsystem that prevents hard-working Americans from passing the bulk of \ntheir nest eggs to their children or grandchildren.\n  Fairness, Mr. President. That is what the effort to repeal the death \ntax is all about. A June 22-25, 2000 Gallup poll found that 60 percent \nof the people support repeal, even though about three-quarters of those \nsupporters do not think they will ever have to pay a death tax \nthemselves.\n  A poll conducted by Zogby International on July 6, 2000, found that, \ngiven a choice between a candidate who believes that a large estate \nleft to heirs should be taxed at a rate of 50 percent for anything over \n$2 million, and a candidate who believes that the estate tax is unfair \nto heirs and should be eliminated, 75 percent of the people prefer the \nperson supporting death-tax repeal.\n  Other polls similarly put support for repeal at between 70 and 80 \npercent.\n  Voters in two states approved referenda last November to repeal their \nstate death tax: South Dakota by a vote of 79 to 21 percent, and \nMontana by a vote of 68 to 32 percent. Many other states have already \ndone the same.\n  Mr. President, the significant majorities in the House and Senate \nthat voted for repeal last year means that we have finally found a \nformula for taxing inherited assets in a fair and commonsense way. \nAppreciated value will be taxed, but only when income is actually \nrealized--that is, when the assets are sold. And then, the gains would \nbe treated by the Tax Code no better, and no worse, than the gains from \nthe sale of any other kind of asset.\n  I invite our Senate colleagues to join in support of this bipartisan \ninitiative again this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SHELBY (for himself, Mr. Bond, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Hagel, Mr. \n        Sessions, Mr. Helms, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Burns, Mr. Kyl, Mr. \n        Cochran, Ms. Snowe, and Mr. Allard):\n  S. 276. A bill to amend chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, to \nprovide for congressional review of any rule promulgated by the \nInternal Revenue Service that increases Federal revenue, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nBond, to introduce the Stealth Tax Prevention Act. Perhaps the most \nimportant power given to Congress by the Constitution of the United \nStates, is the responsibility of taxation. The Founding Fathers \nrationale behind bestowing this power on Congress is that as elected \nrepresentatives, Congress remains accountable to the people when they \nlevy and collect taxes. Members of Congress, unlike Federal agency \nbureaucrats, are rightly held responsible to the public for producing \nfair and prudent tax legislation.\n\n[[Page S1132]]\n\n  In 1996, Mr. President, Congress passed the Congressional Review Act, \nwhich provides that when a major agency rule takes effect, Congress has \n60 days to review it. During this time period, Congress has the option \nto pass a disapproval resolution. If no such resolution is passed, the \nrule then goes into effect.\n  As you know, Mr. President, the Internal Revenue Service maintains an \nenormous amount of power over the lives and the livelihoods of the \nAmerican taxpayers through their authority to implement and enforce the \nTax Code. Even though Congress, and only Congress, has the authority to \ntax, the Internal Revenue Service has found a ``backdoor'' way to \nincrease our federal tax burden through their interpretive authority. \nThe Stealth Tax Prevention Act, that Senator Bond and I are introducing \nalong with Mr. Thomas, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Burns, Mr. Helms, Mr. \nInhofe, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Snowe, and Mr. Allard, will \nreturn the authority of taxation to the United States Congress by \nexpanding the definition of a major rule to include any IRS regulation \nwhich increases Federal revenue.\n  For example, if the Office of Management and Budget finds that the \nimplementation and enforcement of a rule would result in an increase of \nFederal revenues over current practices or revenues anticipated from \nthe rule on the date of the enactment of the statute, the Stealth Tax \nPrevention Act would allow Congress to review the regulations and take \nappropriate measures to avoid raising taxes on hard working Americans \nand small businesses.\n  The discretionary authority of the Internal Revenue Service exposes \nsmall businesses, farmers, and individual taxpayers to the sometimes \narbitrary actions of bureaucrats, creating an uncertain and, in many \ninstances, a hostile environment in which to conduct day-to-day \nactivities. The Stealth Tax Prevention Act will be particularly helpful \nin lowering the tax burden on small business which suffers \ndisproportionately, Mr. President, from IRS regulations. This tax \nburden discourages the startup of new firms and ultimately the creation \nof new jobs in the economy, which has really made America great.\n  Average American families and small businesses are saddled with the \nhighest tax burden in our country's history. Americans pay federal \nincome taxes, they pay state income taxes and they pay property taxes. \nOn the way to work in the morning they pay a gasoline tax when they \nfill up their car and a sales tax when they buy a cup of coffee. \nAllowing federal bureaucrats to increase taxes even further at their \nown discretion through interpretation of the tax code is intolerable. \nThe Stealth Tax Prevention Act will leave tax policy where it belongs--\nto elected members of Congress--not an unelected and unaccountable IRS.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Alabama \nto introduce the Stealth Tax Prevention Act. I sponsored this bill in \nthe 105th and again in the 106th Congress. I felt strongly enough about \nthis bill to sponsor it again this year.\n  One of the most common concerns I hear from my constituents is \nregarding the Federal Government's authority to levy and collect taxes. \nThis is an important role that we in Congress do not take lightly as we \nare accountable to the voters who pay those taxes.\n  Three years ago, Congress passed the Congressional Review Act, which \nprovides that when a major agency rule takes effect, Congress has 60 \ndays to review it. During this time period, Congress has the option to \npass a disapproval resolution. If no such resolution is passed, the \nrule then goes into effect.\n  The Stealth Tax Prevention Act will expand the definition of a major \nrule to include any IRS regulation which increases taxes. It is not the \nrole of the IRS to make decisions that will result in increased taxes.\n  For example, if the Office of Management and Budget finds that the \nimplementation and enforcement of a rule would result in an increase of \nFederal revenues over current practices or revenues anticipated from \nthe rule on the date of the enactment of the statute, the Stealth Tax \nPrevention Act would allow Congress to review the regulations and take \nappropriate measures to avoid raising taxes on hard working Americans, \nin most cases, small businesses.\n  Bureaucrats are not directly accountable to taxpayers--I am.\n  Under the bill introduced today, an IRS implemented stealth tax could \nnot go into effect for at least 60 days following its publication in \nthe Federal. Register. This window would allow Congress the opportunity \nto review the rule and vote on a resolution to disapprove the tax \nincrease before it is applied to a single taxpayer.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this important \nlegislation to ensure that the IRS neither usurps the proper role of \nCongress--nor skirts its obligations to identify the impact of its \nproposed and final rules. When the Department of the Treasury issues a \nfinal IRS rule that increases taxes, Congress should have the ability \nto exercise its discretion to enact a resolution of disapproval before \nthe rule is applicable to a single taxpayer.\n  The Stealth Tax Prevention Act will leave tax policy where it \nbelongs, to elected Members of the Congress, not unelected and \nunaccountable IRS bureaucrats.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Boxer, \n        Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Durbin, \n        Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. harkin, Mr. Kerry, Ms. \n        Landrieu, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Ms. Mikulski, \n        Mrs. Murray, Mr. Reed, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. \n        Schumer, Mr. Wellstone, and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 277. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nprovide for an increase in the Federal minimum wage; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this afternoon I and others will be \nintroducing legislation to increase the minimum wage. We will increase \nthe minimum wage by 60 cents this year, 50 cents next year, and 40 \ncents the year after.\n  The reason we are doing this is to recognize that over the last 8 \nyears, we have had the most extraordinary economic expansion, but there \nare a number of Americans, about 11 million to 13 million Americans, \nwho have not benefitted from our economic expansion.\n  They are the individuals who are on the lowest rung of the economic \nladder. This is an attempt to make an adjustment in their income, and \nthis increase in the minimum wage will provide an extremely modest \nincrease in that income.\n  This issue is a women's issue because the great majority of those who \nreceive the minimum wage are women.\n  This is a children's issue because the great majority of the women \nwho are receiving the minimum wage have children and their lives are \ndirectly affected by the amount of income their mother or their parents \nmake, and if they are making the minimum wage, often it is not just one \njob, but two jobs, and their lives are dramatically affected.\n  It is a civil rights issue because so many of those who are earning \nthe minimum wage are men and women of color.\n  Most of all, it is a fairness issue. Men and women in this country \nwho work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year should not have to live in \npoverty.\n  This is about rewarding work. It is a recognition that people in our \ncountry who are playing by the rules attempting to provide for their \nfamily, if they are making a minimum wage today with a family of three, \nthey are still falling $3,400 below the poverty line in the United \nStates of America. This minimum wage will reduce that, but they will \nstill fall within the definition of poverty.\n  With this extraordinary expansion we have seen, with the \nextraordinary benefits that have gone to so many millions of Americans, \nit is time that we ought to give some attention to those who have been \nleft out and left behind.\n  Who are these minimum wage workers? First of all, they are men and \nwomen of dignity; men and women who take pride in the work they do; men \nand women who are proud to go to work and understand the value of work, \nfrustrated as others might be, but nonetheless are willing to put their\n\n[[Page S1133]]\n\nshoulder to the wheel because they want to take care of their families \nand because they have a sense of pride.\n  What do they do? By and large, minimum wage workers work in child \ncare centers. They are helping to look after the children of others who \nare working hard in American industry. Many of them are assistants to \nteachers in our schools and, again, are working with children all \nacross this country. Many others are working in nursing homes looking \nafter those who have retired, those who need nursing home attention. \nThese are men and women who are doing very important work, in many \ninstances helping to make sure that the major buildings that house our \nindustries and corporations are attended to during the nighttime. These \nare hard-working people, and they are people who take great pride in \nwhat they do, as they should.\n  Let's look at what their situation has come to. This chart says: \nWorking hard, but losing ground. The real value of the minimum wage. If \nwe look at constant dollars, the purchasing power of the minimum wage \nwas $7.66 in 1968. Over the years, we have seen how that has fallen, \nwith just a few interruptions when there was an increase in the minimum \nwage in 1988 and another increase in 1994. We can see what has happened \nwith the purchasing power of the minimum wage. Without an increase in \nthe minimum wage, in the year 2002, it would be down to $4.75, just \nabout the lowest that it has been since the mid-1960s. This is in real \npurchasing power.\n  If we raise the minimum wage 60 cents, 50 cents, and 40 cents, and \nadd that $1.50 on top of the $5.15 an hour now, the purchasing power \nwould only be $6.14, which is identical to what it would be if we \nactually increased the minimum wage in the last 2 years by 50 cents and \n50 cents, which was our proposal. Since we lost a year, there has been \nfurther deterioration in the purchasing power of the minimum wage. Even \nwith the step-up of 60 cents, 50 cents, and 40 cents, its purchasing \npower will still only be $6.14.\n  This is an extremely modest increase. Historically, the percentage \nincrease in the minimum wage we are asking for is extremely modest. \nMost other times, the percentage has been a good deal higher than it is \nin this proposal. This is a modest increase, but a very important \nincrease.\n  What has been happening to our minimum wage workers? This chart \nindicates what has happened to average hourly earnings from 1969 to the \nyear 2000.\n\n  You can see from the chart that the average hourly earnings have been \nconstantly going up. Going back to 1969, the minimum wage was 53 \npercent of average hourly earnings. In the year 2000, do you think it \nhas even held at 53 percent? No. It has dropped to 37 percent of \naverage hourly earnings--a dramatic reduction, even in comparison to \nwhat has been happening to the average American workers across the \ncountry. They are falling further and further behind.\n  This chart is very interesting in that it shows what is happening out \nthere in the workplace among those who have families with children who \nare in the bottom 40 percent of U.S. family incomes from 1979 to 1999.\n  All workers are averaging 416 hours more a year. Do we understand \nthat? In 1999, they are working more than 400 hours a year more than \nthey were working in 1979, even when their amount of income \nproportionately was a good deal better. Now we find American workers \nare working longer and harder than any other workers in any other \nindustrial country in the world. And this is true about minimum wage \nworkers, who, in most instances, have not just one job but have two \njobs.\n  So for all those from whom we are going to hear in this Chamber about \nthe importance of rewarding people who work, here we have some of the \nhardest workers in the world who are making pitiful little and find it \nenormously difficult to be able to provide for their families.\n  Four hundred sixteen hours, what does that translate into? What it \ntranslates into is this: The average minimum wage worker today gets to \nspend 25 hours a week less with his or her children than they did 15 \nyears ago. When we are talking about family values--and we will hear a \ngreat deal about family values--one of the most important and basic and \nfundamental family values is having an adequate income to provide for \none's children. The minimum wage does not provide it.\n  We see from this chart that working families are increasingly living \nin poverty. The red line indicates what the poverty line represents \nhere in the United States. What we have seen for many years--in the \n1960s, 1970s, right up to about 1980--is that the minimum wage was \neffectively the poverty wage. That was the bare minimum to be able to \nlive with some degree of dignity in terms of providing the housing, the \nfood, the shelter, the clothing, the essentials for families. What we \nhave seen is this spread has been growing and increasing. Minimum wage \nworkers are falling further and further behind.\n  Now, this is against a very important chart here which reflects the \nchanges in family incomes from 1979 to 1999. The top fifth of families' \nincomes have increased by 42 percent in the last 20 years; middle-\nincome families by about 11 percent over the last 20 years; the bottom \nfifth has actually declined in terms of their quality of life and in \nterms of what their income is. It shows they are going down, working \nlonger, working harder, providing important kinds of services at a time \nof extraordinary economic prosperity. They are falling further and \nfurther and further behind. We have an opportunity to do something \nabout that.\n  We provided an increase in the earned-income tax credit in the recent \ntimes, which is helpful for those with larger families who have a \nnumber of children; but still, for the single mom, or the mother and \nfather with a single child, the minimum wage is the way to go when you \nare talking about benefitting and increasing the income for families.\n  We often hear on the Senate floor we cannot do that because if we do \ndo it, we are going to have an adverse impact in terms of our \nemployment situation. That is a lot of hogwash.\n\n  Let's look at what has happened since the last time we increased the \nminimum wage. Since 1996, when we increased the minimum wage in two \nsteps, we heard: We do not want to do that because it is going to have \nan adverse impact on teens. That is wrong. The unemployment rate for \nteens has actually gone down with our two-step increase in the minimum \nwage.\n  For those who are lacking high school diplomas--they said: They will \nnot be able to get employment at the McDonald's in order to gain work \nhabits--wrong again. We found that the unemployment rate has gone down \neven for those lacking a high school diploma.\n  How about, we often heard: This isn't fair to African Americans. \nWrong again. We found out the unemployment rate has still declined. It \nis certainly more than double what it is for the national average, but \nthe employment level has dropped over what it was previously. The same \nis true with regard to Hispanics. And the same is true with regard to \nwomen.\n  So we believe this is an issue of fairness. We believe it is a matter \nof urgency. We have tried, over the period of recent years, to get this \nmeasure up before the Senate. We were denied that opportunity to have \nan up-or-down vote. We were told by the Republican leadership at the \nend of the last Congress: You can have this if you provide $73 billion \nin tax breaks for American companies and corporations. Effectively, \nthey were saying: We are going to hold this hostage. They were going to \nhold this hostage until they got the $73 billion. They did not hold \ntheir own pay increase hostage. They did not hold hostage increasing \nMembers' pay $3,800 a year in order to benefit businesses and \ncorporations. But they are holding hostage those who are at the lowest \nlevel, the most vulnerable people, working hard, trying to make ends \nmeet for their families. They are holding them hostage until they get \nadditional tax breaks for companies and corporations at an unparalleled \nlevel.\n  The last time we had the increase we had a modest tax break for small \nbusiness. Small business may need help and assistance, I am for that. \nBut at that time, it was $20 billion. Now that they have that up at $73 \nbillion, and they refuse to let us give consideration to an increase in \nthe minimum wage, they are saying to all of those women, all of those \nchildren, all of those workers who are minimum wage workers: No,\n\n[[Page S1134]]\n\nyou can just wait there. You can stay at $5.15 an hour. You can \ncontinue to work at $5.15 until we get around to developing our package \nin order for the $73 billion in tax breaks. And then at that time, when \nwe are ready to get that $73 billion, the Senate of the United States \nbetter take all $73 billion or we are not going to increase your \nminimum wage.\n  I think that is an outrageous position to take in terms of a \ncontemptible attitude toward our fellow Americans.\n  I want to indicate, we welcome the support we have. This issue is not \ngoing to go away. We are going to have to face this issue. We want to \nhave a fair opportunity. It is not one of those issues that needs a \ngreat deal of study. All of us remember the situation where people tap \nus on the shoulder and say: Will you support H.R. 222 or S. 444? and we \nare unfamiliar with the details of a particular program. This one is \nvery simple. Increase in the minimum wage: Three steps, 60, 50, 40 \ncents. You don't need to have a lot of hearings.\n  To reiterate, Mr. President, the minimum wage is one of the Nation's \nfundamental workplace protections. It is a bedrock right of every \nworking man and woman. For over 60 years, this country has been \ncommitted to the principle that employees are entitled to a fair \nminimum wage that guarantees a fair day's pay for a fair day's work and \nprotects the dignity of their employment.\n  In recent years, the country as a whole and most Americans have \nbenefitted from unprecedented prosperity--the longest period of \neconomic growth in the Nation's history and the lowest unemployment \nrate in three decades. But minimum wage workers have been left out and \nleft behind. A fair increase in the minimum wage is long overdue.\n  The real value of the minimum wage is now nearly $3 below what it was \nin 1968. To have the purchasing power it had in that year, the minimum \nwage would have to be $8.05 an hour today, not $5.15 an hour.\n  At the same time, poverty has almost doubled among full-time, year-\nround workers. Since the late 1970s, it has climbed from about 1.5 \nmillion to almost 2.5 million in 1999. An unacceptably low minimum wage \nis part of the problem. Minimum wage employees working 40 hours a week, \n52 weeks a year, earn only $10,700 a year--$3,400 below the poverty \nline for a family of three. Minimum wage workers today fail to earn \nenough to afford adequate housing in any area of this country. No one \nwho works for a living should have to live in poverty.\n  In too many cases, minimum wage workers are forced to work longer and \nlonger hours to make ends meet, with less and less time to spend with \ntheir families--still without sharing fairly in the Nation's \nprosperity. In fact, the lowest paid American families worked 416 more \nhours in 1999 then they did in 1979. Since 1969, the ratio of the \nminimum wage to average hourly earnings has dropped from 53 percent to \n37 percent.\n  It is shameful that Congress acted to raise its own pay by $3,800 \nlast year--the third pay increase in 4 years--yet we did not find time \nto provide any pay increase at all to the lowest paid workers.\n  The increase in the legislation we are introducing today--the Fair \nMinimum Wage Act of 2001--will directly benefit over 11 million \nworkers. It will raise the minimum wage by $1.50 in three installments: \n60 cents on the 30th day after the bill's enactment; another 50 cents \non January 1, 2002; and 40 more cents on January 1, 2003. The bill will \nalso apply the federal minimum wage to the Mariana Islands, which now \nhas an unacceptably low level of $3.05 an hour.\n  The $1.50 increase is necessary to make up for lost time. In real \nvalue, the $1.50 increase will bring the minimum wage up to the same \nlevel it would have been if our proposed one dollar increase had gone \ninto effect last year.\n\n  Raising the minimum wage is a labor issue, because it guarantees that \nAmerican workers will be paid fairly for their contribution to building \na strong Nation and a strong economy. It is a women's issue, since 60 \npercent of minimum wage earners are women. It is a children's issue, \nbecause 33 percent of minimum wage earners are parents with children--\nand 4.3 million children live in poverty, despite being in a family \nwhere a bread-winner works full-time, year-round. And it is a civil \nrights issue, because 16 percent of those who will benefit from a \nminimum wage increase are African Americans, and 20 percent are \nHispanic.\n  The record of past increases clearly shows that raising the minimum \nwage has not had a negative impact on jobs, employment, or inflation. \nAfter the last increases in the minimum wage in 1996 and 1997, the \neconomy continued to grow with impressive strength. The unemployment \nrate has fallen from 5.2 percent to 4.2 percent. Twelve million new \njobs have been created, at a pace of 230,000 per month, with more than \n6 million new service industry jobs, including one and a half million \nnew retail jobs, and over a half a million new restaurant jobs. \nSimilarly, the minimum wage increase during the recession in 1991 \nprovided needed support for low-income workers and caused no loss of \njobs.\n  President Bush supports raising the minimum wage, but suggests that \nstates should be able to opt out of the increase. But allowing states \nto opt out of the minimum wage would violate the basic principle, which \nwe have stood by for over 60 years, that working men and women are \nentitled to a fair minimum wage. Millions of workers across the country \ndeserve a pay raise, and they deserve it now.\n  The Federal minimum wage guarantees a floor, but it also allows \nStates to set wage rates higher than the Federal minimum. Massachusetts \nrecently raised its minimum wage to $6.75 an hour, one of the highest \nlevels in the country. Other states, such as California, Connecticut, \nVermont and Rhode Island, have also set their State rates higher than \nthe Federal minimum.\n  In other States, however, the State minimum wage is far below the \nFederal level. In these States, the Federal level applies to the vast \nmajority of workers. But for those not covered by the Federal law, the \nState level is often extremely low. It is $1.60 in Wyoming, $2.65 in \nKansas, and $3.35 in Texas. Clearly, Congress should not leave the \nminimum wage to the tender mercy of the States.\n  A fair increase in the federal minimum wage is long overdue. I urge \nCongress to act as quickly as possible to pass this long overdue \nincrease.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 277\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to restore health care coverage to retired members of \nthe uniformed services; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n[[Page S1135]]\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, our country must honor its commitments to \nmilitary retirees and veterans, not only because it's the right thing \nto do, but also because it's the smart thing to do. We all know the \nhistory: for decades, men and women who joined the military were \npromised lifetime health care coverage for themselves and their \nfamilies. They were told, in effect, if you disrupt your family, if you \nwork for low pay, if you endanger your life and limb, we will in turn \nguarantee lifetime health benefits.\n  In my own family, my oldest son is in the Army and has served tours \nof duty in Bosnia and Kosovo. I fully appreciate what inadequate health \ncare and broken promises can do to the morale of military families.\n  Military retirees and veterans are our nation's most effective \nrecruiters. Unfortunately, poor health care options make it difficult \nfor these men and women to encourage the younger generation to make a \ncareer of the military. In fact, in South Dakota, I was talking to \nmilitary personnel and talking to retirees who are loyal and patriotic, \nwho have paid a price second to none for our nation's liberty, and they \ntold me: ``Tim, I can't in good faith tell my nephews, my children, \nyoung people whom I encounter, that they ought to serve in the U.S. \nmilitary, that they ought to make a career of that service because I \nsee what the Congress has done to its commitment to me, to my family, \nto my neighbors.''\n  I am pleased that last year we made historic improvements in health \ncare coverage for the approximately 12,600 military retirees living in \nSouth Dakota. In the 106th Congress, I introduced the Keep Our Promise \nto America's Military Retirees Act to restore the broken promise of \nlifetime health care for military retirees and dependents. My \nbipartisan legislation received the endorsement from most military \nretiree and veterans organizations and called for military retirees to \nhave the option of staying in their TRICARE military health care \nprogram or electing to participate in the Federal Employees Health \nBenefit Program, FEHBP.\n  I offered my legislation as an amendment to last year's defense bill \nand received 52 votes. Although the amendment failed on a procedural \nmotion, I was able to convince my colleagues to include one part of my \nbill--the expansion of TRICARE to Medicare-eligible military retirees--\nin both the Senate defense bill and the final version signed into law.\n  While I am pleased that last year's defense bill begins to address \nproblems with military retiree health care, there is more work that \nneeds to be done. That is why I am once again working with fellow \nDemocrats and Republicans in the Senate to continue the progress we've \nmade at living up to our country's commitment to those who serve in the \nmilitary.\n  Today, I am reintroducing the Keep Our Promise to America's Military \nRetirees Act to finish the job we started last year. I am pleased to be \njoined by Senator Jeff Bingaman and Senator Olympia Snowe. Similar \nlegislation introduced in the House of Representatives by \nRepresentative Ronnie Shows and Representative Charlie Norwood already \nhas overwhelming bipartisan support, and I expect a number of Democrats \nand Republicans here in the Senate to once again support my bill.\n  My legislation addresses the pressing health care needs of military \nretirees under age 65. Thanks to our efforts last year, retirees over \n65 soon will be able to choose their own doctor and be covered by \nMedicare and TRICARE as a secondary payer. However, retirees under age \n65 must continue coverage under a TRICARE program that offers care at \nmilitary treatment facilities on a space available basis. Nationwide, \nbase closures and downsizing have made access to these military bases \ndifficult. For many military retirees in South Dakota and other rural \nstates, it is next to impossible to find a doctor participating in \nTRICARE, and these men and women are forced to drive hundreds of miles \njust for basic health care.\n  In addition, retirees who entered the service prior to June 7, 1956, \nwhen space-available care for military retirees was enacted, actually \nhave seen much of their promised benefits taken away. Under the Keep \nOur Promise to America's Military Retirees Act, the United States \ngovernment would pay the full cost of FEHBP enrollment to this most \nelderly group of retirees.\n  Congress has the unique opportunity to use a portion of the budget \nsurplus to improve the quality of life for our military retirees, \nveterans, and active duty personnel. I have always believed that our \nnation's defense is only as good as the men and women who serve in our \narmed forces. Broken promises of health care, retirement benefits, \neducation incentives, and pay have eroded the morale of the most \nvaluable assets to our national security. I am hopeful that members of \nboth parties will join me once again making these issues a priority--\ninstead of an afterthought--during this session of Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON (for himself, Mr. Graham, Mr. Campbell, Mr. enzi, \n        Mr. Baucus, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. Hollings):\n  S. 280. A bill to amend the Agriculture Marketing Act of 1946 to \nrequire retailers of beef, lamb, pork, and perishable agricultural \ncommodities to inform consumers, at the final point of sale to \nconsumers, of the country of origin of the commodities; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senator \nJohnson, Senator Campbell, Senator Craig, and Senator Cleland to \nintroduce the Consumer Right to Know Act of 2001.\n  This bill would require country of origin labeling of perishable \nagricultural commodities and meat products sold in retail \nestablishments. I offer this legislation to ensure that Americans know \nthe origin of every orange, banana, tomato, cucumber, and green pepper \non display in the grocery store.\n  For two decades, Floridians shopping at their local grocery stores \nhave been able to make educated choices about the food products they \npurchase for their families. In 1979, during my first year as governor, \nI proudly signed legislation to make country-of-origin labels mandatory \nfor produce sold in Florida. This labeling requirement has proven to be \nneither complicated nor burdensome for Florida's farmers or retailers.\n  Country of origin labeling is not new to the American marketplace. \nFor decades, ``Made In'' labels have been as visible as price tags on \nclothes, toys, television sets, watches, and many other products. It \nmakes little sense that such labels are nowhere to be found in the \nproduce or meat sections of grocery stores in the vast majority of \nstates. The current lack of identifying information on produce means \nthat Americans who wish to heed government health warnings about \nforeign products don't have the information they need to protect \nthemselves. Nor can Americans show justifiable concerns about other \nnations' labor, environmental, and agricultural standards by choosing \nother perishables.\n  According to nationwide surveys, between 74 and 83 percent of \nconsumers favor mandatory country of origin labeling for fresh produce. \nThis is a low-cost, common sense method of informing consumers, as \nretailers will simply be asked to provide this information by means of \na label, stamp, or placard. It is estimated that implementing produce \nlabeling would take about two hours per grocery store per week. At the \ncurrent minimum wage, this equates to about $10.30 per store per week. \nThis is a remarkable small price to pay to provide American consumers \nwith the information they need to make informed produce purchases.\n  In addition, a study by the General Accounting Office found that all \nof the 28 countries that account for must of the U.S. produce imports \nand exports have requirements for fruit and vegetable labeling. By \nadopting this legislation, our law will become more consistent with the \nlaws of our trading partners.\n  Consumers have the right to know basic information about the fruits \nand vegetables that they bring home to their families. Congress can \ntake a major step toward achieving this simple goal by adopting this \namendment, thereby restoring American shoppers' ability to make an \ninformed decision.\n  Both Senator Johnson and I have worked on this legislation for \nseveral Congresses. I am very pleased to be introducing one legislative \npackage this year which contains both fruit and vegetable and meat \nlabeling requirements.\n\n[[Page S1136]]\n\nBoth have passed the Senate in the 105th and 106th Congress.\n  I urge my colleagues who have supported this concept in the past to \nco-sponsor our legislation. I urge those of you who are new to this \nissue to review this legislation and ask yourselves if American \nconsumers deserve this basic level of information about their food \nsupply--the country of origin.\n  I ask for your support, and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on the Senate Agriculture Committee to move this legislation \nexpeditiously through the Committee process.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 282. A bill to establish in the Antitrust Division of the \nDepartment of Justice a position with responsibility for agriculture \nantitrust matters; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today, along \nwith Senator Lugar, legislation that would ensure that there is in the \nAntitrust Division of the Department of Justice a position with the \nprimary responsibility of providing advice and assistance to further \neffective enforcement of the antitrust laws in the food and \nagricultural sectors of our economy.\n  As so many of my colleagues understand, we are in a period of very \nrapid change in the economic structure of agriculture and of our food \nsystem from the farm on through retail distribution. Those changes \ninclude sweeping consolidation and greatly increased economic \nconcentration in many segments of our nation's food and agriculture \nsystem that have profoundly affected agricultural producers and rural \ncommunities and raised serious questions about impacts on consumers.\n  The purpose of this bill is to ensure that our nation's antitrust \nlaws are fully enforced during this time of rapid change in our food \nand agriculture system. This is the same legislation as Senator Lugar \nand I introduced late in 1999. Following that introduction, the Clinton \nAdministration did appoint a person to fill the position required by \nthis legislation. While that action obviated the necessity of enacting \nthe legislation at that time, we do not know for certain what the \npresent or future administrations may do in assigning personnel at the \nDepartment of Justice to antitrust enforcement in agriculture. This \nbill is an important safeguard to ensure that we have a person who is \ndevoted full-time at Justice to the critical task of enforcing our \nantitrust laws in the food and agriculture sector.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 282\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--There shall be established within the \n     Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice a position \n     the primary responsibility of which shall be to provide \n     assistance and advice to the Assistant Attorney General of \n     the Antitrust Division to further the effective enforcement \n     of the antitrust laws with respect to the food and \n     agricultural sectors.\n       (b) Appointment.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall appoint a \n     person to the position described in subsection (a).\n       (c) Functions.--The responsibilities of the position \n     established under subsection (a) shall include all actions \n     appropriate to furthering effective enforcement of the \n     antitrust laws with respect to the food and agricultural \n     sectors, including--\n       (1) assisting and advising with respect to the \n     investigation of possible restraints of trade;\n       (2) assisting and advising with respect to the \n     investigation of mergers and acquisitions; and\n       (3) ensuring that any investigation described in paragraphs \n     (1) or (2) takes into account the effects of the conduct or \n     transaction under investigation on consumers, agricultural \n     producers and rural communities.\n\n     SEC. 2. ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall affect or limit the authority of \n     the Attorney General or the Assistant Attorney General of the \n     Antitrust Division to delegate or assign functions relating \n     to the enforcement of any provision of law.\n\n     SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE PERIOD.\n\n       This Act shall be effective until the date that is 5 years \n     after the date of enactment of this Act.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to join my esteemed colleague \nand Ranking Democratic Member of the Agriculture Committee from Iowa, \nSenator Harkin, in once again introducing legislation to help ensure \nthat antitrust laws impacting agriculture are properly enforced.\n  Mr. President, the face of rural America is rapidly changing. Ever-\nchanging technologies, developments in biotechnology and concentration \nin production agriculture and agribusiness are developing a new profile \nin rural areas. Farmers in my home state of Indiana have many questions \nand concerns related to these rapid changes. Many remain to be \nconvinced that appropriate oversight of merger and acquisition activity \nin ag business is a reality.\n  The intent of this legislation is to establish the Office of Special \nCounsel for Agriculture in the Antitrust Division of the Justice \nDepartment. While this office will focus on reviewing ag business \nmergers and acquisition activity, it will also serve as an information \nresource for American agriculture producers wanting to provide input on \nantitrust-related issues.\n  It is important to note, Mr. President, that shortly after \nintroduction of this legislation in 1999, Attorney General Reno, on her \nown initiative, established the Office of Special Counsel for \nAgriculture and appointed Mr. Doug Ross to that position. While the \nperspective of Attorney General Ashcroft is not yet known on this \nmatter, this legislation is a signal, a strong statement, that the \nChairman and the Ranking Democratic Member of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee are in favor of greater transparency and consideration to \nthose issues surrounding ag business mergers in the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. l. \n        Chafee, Mr. Graham, Mr. Specter, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \n        Baucus, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Nelson of Florida, and \n        Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 283.

PROCEDURES FOR INITIAL CLAIMS FOR BENEFITS AND \n                   PRIOR AUTHORIZATION DETERMINATIONS.\n\n       (a) Procedures of Initial Claims for Benefits.--\n       (1) In general.--A group health plan, or health insurance \n     issuer offering health insurance coverage, shall--\n       (A) make a determination on an initial claim for benefits \n     by a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized \n     representative) regarding payment or coverage for items or \n     services under the terms and conditions of the plan or \n     coverage involved, including any cost-sharing amount that the \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee is required to pay with \n     respect to such claim for benefits; and\n       (B) notify a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or \n     authorized representative) and the treating health care \n     professional involved regarding a determination on an initial \n     claim for benefits made under the terms and conditions of the \n     plan or coverage, including any cost-sharing amounts that the \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee may be required to make \n     with respect to such claim for benefits, and of the right of \n     the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee to an internal \n     appeal under section 103.\n       (2) Access to information.--\n       (A) Timely provision of necessary information.--With \n     respect to an initial claim for benefits, the participant, \n     beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized representative) and \n     the treating health care professional (if any) shall provide \n     the plan or issuer with access to information requested by \n     the plan or issuer that is necessary to make a determination \n     relating to the claim. Such access shall be provided not \n     later than 5 days after the date on which the request for \n     information is received, or, in a case described in \n     subparagraph (B) or (C) of subsection (b)(1), by such earlier \n     time as may be necessary to comply with the applicable \n     timeline under such subparagraph.\n       (B) Limited effect of failure on plan or issuer's \n     obligations.--Failure of the participant, beneficiary, or \n     enrollee to comply with the requirements of subparagraph (A) \n     shall not remove the obligation of the plan or issuer to make \n     a decision in accordance with the medical exigencies of the \n     case and as soon as possible, based on the available \n     information, and failure to comply with the time limit \n     established by this paragraph shall not remove the obligation \n     of the plan or issuer to comply with the requirements of this \n     section.\n       (3) Oral requests.--In the case of a claim for benefits \n     involving an expedited or concurrent determination, a \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized \n     representative) may make an initial claim for benefits \n     orally, but a group health plan, or health insurance issuer \n     offering health insurance coverage, may require that the \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized \n     representative) provide written confirmation of such request \n     in a timely manner on a form provided by the plan or issuer. \n     In the case of such an oral request for benefits, the making \n     of the request (and the timing of such request) shall be \n     treated as the making at that time of a claims for such \n     benefits without regard to whether and when a written \n     confirmation of such request is made.\n       (b) Timeline for Making Determinations.--\n       (1) Prior authorization determination.--\n       (A) In general.--A group health plan, or health insurance \n     issuer offering health insurance coverage, shall make a prior \n     authorization determination on a claim for benefits (whether \n     oral or written) in accordance with the medical exigencies of \n     the case and as soon as possible, but in no case later than \n     14\n\n[[Page S1138]]\n\n     days from the date on which the plan or issuer receives \n     information that is reasonably necessary to enable the plan \n     or issuer to make a determination on the request for prior \n     authorization and in no case later than 28 days after the \n     date of the claim for benefits is received.\n       (B) Expedited determination.--Notwithstanding subparagraph \n     (A), a group health plan, or health insurance issuer offering \n     health insurance coverage, shall expedite a prior \n     authorization determination on a claim for benefits described \n     in such subparagraph when a request for such an expedited \n     determination is made by a participant, beneficiary, or \n     enrollee (or authorized representative) at any time during \n     the process for making a determination and a health care \n     professional certifies, with the request, that a \n     determination under the procedures described in subparagraph \n     (A) would seriously jeopardize the life or health of the \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee or the ability of the \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee to maintain or regain \n     maximum function. Such determination shall be made in \n     accordance with the medical exigencies of the case and as \n     soon as possible, but in no case later than 72 hours after \n     the time the request is received by the plan or issuer under \n     this subparagraph.\n       (C) Ongoing care.--\n       (i) Concurrent review.--\n\n       (I) In general.--Subject to clause (ii), in the case of a \n     concurrent review of ongoing care (including \n     hospitalization), which results in a termination or reduction \n     of such care, the plan or issuer must provide by telephone \n     and in printed form notice of the concurrent review \n     determination to the individual or the individual's designee \n     and the individual's health care provider in accordance with \n     the medical exigencies of the case and as soon as possible, \n     with sufficient time prior to the termination or reduction to \n     allow for an appeal under section 103(b)(3) to be completed \n     before the termination or reduction takes effect.\n       (II) Contents of notice.--Such notice shall include, with \n     respect to ongoing health care items and services, the number \n     of ongoing services approved, the new total of approved \n     services, the date of onset of services, and the next review \n     date, if any, as well as a statement of the individual's \n     rights to further appeal.\n\n       (ii) Rule of construction.--Clause (i) shall not be \n     construed as requiring plans or issuers to provide coverage \n     of care that would exceed the coverage limitations for such \n     care.\n       (2) Retrospective determination.--A group health plan, or \n     health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage, \n     shall make a retrospective determination on a claim for \n     benefits in accordance with the medical exigencies of the \n     case and as soon as possible, but not later than 30 days \n     after the date on which the plan or issuer receives \n     information that is reasonably necessary to enable the plan \n     or issuer to make a determination on the claim, or, if \n     earlier, 60 days after the date of receipt of the claim for \n     benefits.\n       (c) Notice of a Denial of a Claim for Benefits.--Written \n     notice of a denial made under an initial claim for benefits \n     shall be issued to the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee \n     (or authorized representative) and the treating health care \n     professional in accordance with the medical exigencies of the \n     case and as soon as possible, but in no case later than 2 \n     days after the date of the determination (or, in the case \n     described in subparagraph (B) or (C) of subsection (b)(1), \n     within the 72-hour or applicable period referred to in such \n     subparagraph).\n       (d) Requirements of Notice of Determinations.--The written \n     notice of a denial of a claim for benefits determination \n     under subsection (c) shall be provided in printed form and \n     written in a manner calculated to be understood by the \n     average participant, beneficiary, or enrollee and shall \n     include--\n       (1) the specific reasons for the determination (including a \n     summary of the clinical or scientific evidence used in making \n     the determination);\n       (2) the procedures for obtaining additional information \n     concerning the determination;

INTERNAL APPEALS OF CLAIMS DENIALS.\n\n       (a) Right to Internal Appeal.--\n       (1) In general.--A participant, beneficiary, or enrollee \n     (or authorized representative) may appeal any denial of a \n     claim for benefits under section 102 under the procedures \n     described in this section.\n       (2) Time for appeal.--\n       (A) In general.--A group health plan, or health insurance \n     issuer offering health insurance coverage, shall ensure that \n     a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized \n     representative) has a period of not less than 180 days \n     beginning on the date of a denial of a claim for benefits \n     under section 102 in which to appeal such denial under this \n     section.\n       (B) Date of denial.--For purposes of subparagraph (A), the \n     date of the denial shall be deemed to be the date as of which \n     the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee knew of the denial \n     of the claim for benefits.\n       (3) Failure to act.--The failure of a plan or issuer to \n     issue a determination on a claim for benefits under section \n     102 within the applicable timeline established for such a \n     determination under such section is a denial of a claim for \n     benefits for purposes this subtitle as of the date of the \n     applicable deadline.\n       (4) Plan waiver of internal review.--A group health plan, \n     or health insurance issuer offering health insurance \n     coverage, may waive the internal review process under this \n     section. In such case the plan or issuer shall provide notice \n     to the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized \n     representative) involved, the participant, beneficiary, or \n     enrollee (or authorized representative) involved shall be \n     relieved of any obligation to complete the internal review \n     involved, and may, at the option of such participant, \n     beneficiary, enrollee, or representative proceed directly to \n     seek further appeal through external review under section 104 \n     or otherwise.\n       (b) Timelines for Making Determinations.--\n       (1) Oral requests.--In the case of an appeal of a denial of \n     a claim for benefits under this section that involves an \n     expedited or concurrent determination, a participant, \n     beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized representative) may \n     request such appeal orally. A group health plan, or health \n     insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage, may \n     require that the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or \n     authorized representative) provide written confirmation of \n     such request in a timely manner on a form provided by the \n     plan or issuer. In the case of such an oral request for an \n     appeal of a denial, the making of the request (and the timing \n     of such request) shall be treated as the making at that time \n     of a request for an appeal without regard to whether and when \n     a written confirmation of such request is made.\n       (2) Access to information.--\n       (A) Timely provision of necessary information.--With \n     respect to an appeal of a denial of a claim for benefits, the \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized \n     representative) and the treating health care professional (if \n     any) shall provide the plan or issuer with access to \n     information requested by the plan or issuer that is necessary \n     to make a determination relating to the appeal. Such access \n     shall be provided not later than 5 days after the date on \n     which the request for information is received, or, in a case \n     described in subparagraph (B) or (C) of paragraph (3), by \n     such earlier time as may be necessary to comply with the \n     applicable timeline under such subparagraph.\n       (B) Limited effect of failure on plan or issuer's \n     obligations.--Failure of the participant, beneficiary, or \n     enrollee to comply with the requirements of subparagraph (A) \n     shall not remove the obligation of the plan or issuer to make \n     a decision in accordance with the medical exigencies of the \n     case and as soon as possible, based on the available \n     information, and failure to comply with the time limit \n     established by this paragraph shall not remove the obligation \n     of the plan or issuer to comply with the requirements of this \n     section.\n       (3) Prior authorization determinations.--\n       (A) In general.--A group health plan, or health insurance \n     issuer offering health insurance coverage, shall make a \n     determination on an appeal of a denial of a claim for \n     benefits under this subsection in accordance with the medical \n     exigencies of the case and as soon as possible, but in no \n     case later than 14 days from the date on which the plan or \n     issuer receives information that is reasonably necessary to \n     enable the plan or issuer to make a determination on the \n     appeal and in no case later than 28 days after the date the \n     request for the appeal is received.\n       (B) Expedited determination.--Notwithstanding subparagraph \n     (A), a group health plan, or health insurance issuer offering \n     health insurance coverage, shall expedite a prior \n     authorization determination on an appeal of a denial of a \n     claim for benefits described in subparagraph (A), when a \n     request for such an expedited determination is made by a \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized \n     representative) at any time during the process for making a \n     determination and a health care professional certifies, with \n     the request, that a determination under the procedures \n     described in subparagraph (A)\n\n[[Page S1139]]\n\n     would seriously jeopardize the life or health of the \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee or the ability of the \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee to maintain or regain \n     maximum function. Such determination shall be made in \n     accordance with the medical exigencies of the case and as \n     soon as possible, but in no case later than 72 hours after \n     the time the request for such appeal is received by the plan \n     or issuer under this subparagraph.\n       (C) Ongoing care determinations.--\n       (i) In general.--Subject to clause (ii), in the case of a \n     concurrent review determination described in section \n     102(b)(1)(C)(i)(I), which results in a termination or \n     reduction of such care, the plan or issuer must provide \n     notice of the determination on the appeal under this section \n     by telephone and in printed form to the individual or the \n     individual's designee and the individual's health care \n     provider in accordance with the medical exigencies of the \n     case and as soon as possible, with sufficient time prior to \n     the termination or reduction to allow for an external appeal \n     under section 104 to be completed before the termination or \n     reduction takes effect.\n       (ii) Rule of construction.--Clause (i) shall not be \n     construed as requiring plans or issuers to provide coverage \n     of care that would exceed the coverage limitations for such \n     care.\n       (4) Retrospective determination.--A group health plan, or \n     health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage, \n     shall make a retrospective determination on an appeal of a \n     claim for benefits in no case later than 30 days after the \n     date on which the plan or issuer receives necessary \n     information that is reasonably necessary to enable the plan \n     or issuer to make a determination on the appeal and in no \n     case later than 60 days after the date the request for the \n     appeal is received.\n       (c) Conduct of Review.--\n       (1) In general.--A review of a denial of a claim for \n     benefits under this section shall be conducted by an \n     individual with appropriate expertise who was not involved in \n     the initial determination.\n       (2) Review of medical decisions by physicians.--A review of \n     an appeal of a denial of a claim for benefits that is based \n     on a lack of medical necessity and appropriateness, or based \n     on an experimental or investigational treatment, or requires \n     an evaluation of medical facts, shall be made by a physician \n     (allopathic or osteopathic) with appropriate expertise \n     (including, in the case of a child, appropriate pediatric \n     expertise) who was not involved in the initial determination.\n       (d) Notice of Determination.--\n       (1) In general.--Written notice of a determination made \n     under an internal appeal of a denial of a claim for benefits \n     shall be issued to the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee \n     (or authorized representative) and the treating health care \n     professional in accordance with the medical exigencies of the \n     case and as soon as possible, but in no case later than 2 \n     days after the date of completion of the review (or, in the \n     case described in subparagraph (B) or (C) of subsection \n     (b)(3), within the 72-hour or applicable period referred to \n     in such subparagraph).\n       (2) Final determination.--The decision by a plan or issuer \n     under this section shall be treated as the final \n     determination of the plan or issuer on a denial of a claim \n     for benefits. The failure of a plan or issuer to issue a \n     determination on an appeal of a denial of a claim for \n     benefits under this section within the applicable timeline \n     established for such a determination shall be treated as a \n     final determination on an appeal of a denial of a claim for \n     benefits for purposes of proceeding to external review under \n     section 104.\n       (3) Requirements of notice.--With respect to a \n     determination made under this section, the notice described \n     in paragraph (1) shall be provided in printed form and \n     written in a manner calculated to be understood by the \n     average participant, beneficiary, or enrollee and shall \n     include--\n       (A) the specific reasons for the determination (including a \n     summary of the clinical or scientific evidence used in making \n     the determination);\n       (B) the procedures for obtaining additional information \n     concerning the determination; and\n       (C) notification of the right to an independent external \n     review under section 104 and instructions on how to initiate \n     such a review.\n\n     SEC. 104. INDEPENDENT EXTERNAL APPEALS PROCEDURES.\n\n       (a) Right to External Appeal.--A group health plan, and a \n     health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage, \n     shall provide in accordance with this section participants, \n     beneficiaries, and enrollees (or authorized representatives) \n     with access to an independent external review for any denial \n     of a claim for benefits.\n       (b) Initiation of the Independent External Review \n     Process.--\n       (1) Time to file.--A request for an independent external \n     review under this section shall be filed with the plan or \n     issuer not later than 180 days after the date on which the \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee receives notice of the \n     denial under section 103(d) or notice of waiver of internal \n     review under section 103(a)(4) or the date on which the plan \n     or issuer has failed to make a timely decision under section \n     103(d)(2) and notifies the participant or beneficiary that it \n     has failed to make a timely decision and that the beneficiary \n     must file an appeal with an external review entity within 180 \n     days if the participant or beneficiary desires to file such \n     an appeal.\n       (2) Filing of request.--\n       (A) In general.--Subject to the succeeding provisions of \n     this subsection, a group health plan, and a health insurance \n     issuer offering health insurance coverage, may--\n       (i) except as provided in subparagraph (B)(i), require that \n     a request for review be in writing;\n       (ii) limit the filing of such a request to the participant, \n     beneficiary, or enrollee involved (or an authorized \n     representative);\n       (iii) except if waived by the plan or issuer under section \n     103(a)(4), condition access to an independent external review \n     under this section upon a final determination of a denial of \n     a claim for benefits under the internal review procedure \n     under section 103;\n       (iv) except as provided in subparagraph (B)(ii), require \n     payment of a filing fee to the plan or issuer of a sum that \n     does not exceed $25; and\n       (v) require that a request for review include the consent \n     of the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized \n     representative) for the release of necessary medical \n     information or records of the participant, beneficiary, or \n     enrollee to the qualified external review entity only for \n     purposes of conducting external review activities.\n       (B) Requirements and exception relating to general rule.--\n       (i) Oral requests permitted in expedited or concurrent \n     cases.--In the case of an expedited or concurrent external \n     review as provided for under subsection (e), the request may \n     be made orally. A group health plan, or health insurance \n     issuer offering health insurance coverage, may require that \n     the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized \n     representative) provide written confirmation of such request \n     in a timely manner on a form provided by the plan or issuer. \n     Such written confirmation shall be treated as a consent for \n     purposes of subparagraph (A)(v). In the case of such an oral \n     request for such a review, the making of the request (and the \n     timing of such request) shall be treated as the making at \n     that time of a request for such an external review without \n     regard to whether and when a written confirmation of such \n     request is made.\n       (ii) Exception to filing fee requirement.--\n\n       (I) Indigency.--Payment of a filing fee shall not be \n     required under subparagraph (A)(iv) where there is a \n     certification (in a form and manner specified in guidelines \n     established by the appropriate Secretary) that the \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee is indigent (as defined \n     in such guidelines).\n       (II) Fee not required.--Payment of a filing fee shall not \n     be required under subparagraph (A)(iv) if the plan or issuer \n     waives the internal appeals process under section 103(a)(4).\n       (III) Refunding of fee.--The filing fee paid under \n     subparagraph (A)(iv) shall be refunded if the determination \n     under the independent external review is to reverse or modify \n     the denial which is the subject of the review.\n       (IV) Collection of filing fee.--The failure to pay such a \n     filing fee shall not prevent the consideration of a request \n     for review but, subject to the preceding provisions of this \n     clause, shall constitute a legal liability to pay.\n\n       (c) Referral to Qualified External Review Entity Upon \n     Request.--\n       (1) In general.--Upon the filing of a request for \n     independent external review with the group health plan, or \n     health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage, \n     the plan or issuer shall immediately refer such request, and \n     forward the plan or issuer's initial decision (including the \n     information described in section 103(d)(3)(A)), to a \n     qualified external review entity selected in accordance with \n     this section.\n       (2) Access to plan or issuer and health professional \n     information.--With respect to an independent external review \n     conducted under this section, the participant, beneficiary, \n     or enrollee (or authorized representative), the plan or \n     issuer, and the treating health care professional (if any) \n     shall provide the external review entity with information \n     that is necessary to conduct a review under this section, as \n     determined and requested by the entity. Such information \n     shall be provided not later than 5 days after the date on \n     which the request for information is received, or, in a case \n     described in clause (ii) or (iii) of subsection (e)(1)(A), by \n     such earlier time as may be necessary to comply with the \n     applicable timeline under such clause.\n       (3) Screening of requests by qualified external review \n     entities.--\n       (A) In general.--With respect to a request referred to a \n     qualified external review entity under paragraph (1) relating \n     to a denial of a claim for benefits, the entity shall refer \n     such request for the conduct of an independent medical review \n     unless the entity determines that--\n       (i) any of the conditions described in clauses (ii) or \n     (iii) of subsection (b)(2)(A) have not been met;\n       (ii) the denial of the claim for benefits does not involve \n     a medically reviewable decision under subsection (d)(2);\n       (iii) the denial of the claim for benefits relates to a \n     decision regarding whether an individual is a participant, \n     beneficiary, or enrollee who is enrolled under the terms and \n     conditions of the plan or coverage (including the \n     applicability of any waiting period under the plan or \n     coverage); or\n       (iv) the denial of the claim for benefits is a decision as \n     to the application of cost-sharing requirements or the \n     application of a specific exclusion or express limitation on \n     the\n\n[[Page S1140]]\n\n     amount, duration, or scope of coverage of items or services \n     under the terms and conditions of the plan or coverage unless \n     the decision is a denial described in subsection (d)(2).\n\n     Upon making a determination that any of clauses (i) through \n     (iv) applies with respect to the request, the entity shall \n     determine that the denial of a claim for benefits involved is \n     not eligible for independent medical review under subsection \n     (d), and shall provide notice in accordance with subparagraph \n     (C).\n       (B) Process for making determinations.--\n       (i) No deference to prior determinations.--In making \n     determinations under subparagraph (A), there shall be no \n     deference given to determinations made by the plan or issuer \n     or the recommendation of a treating health care professional \n     (if any).\n       (ii) Use of appropriate personnel.--A qualified external \n     review entity shall use appropriately qualified personnel to \n     make determinations under this section.\n       (C) Notices and general timelines for determination.--\n       (i) Notice in case of denial of referral.--If the entity \n     under this paragraph does not make a referral to an \n     independent medical reviewer, the entity shall provide notice \n     to the plan or issuer, the participant, beneficiary, or \n     enrollee (or authorized representative) filing the request, \n     and the treating health care professional (if any) that the \n     denial is not subject to independent medical review. Such \n     notice--\n\n       (I) shall be written (and, in addition, may be provided \n     orally) in a manner calculated to be understood by an average \n     participant or enrollee;\n       (II) shall include the reasons for the determination;\n       (III) include any relevant terms and conditions of the plan \n     or coverage; and\n       (IV) include a description of any further recourse \n     available to the individual.\n\n       (ii) General timeline for determinations.--Upon receipt of \n     information under paragraph (2), the qualified external \n     review entity, and if required the independent medical \n     reviewer, shall make a determination within the overall \n     timeline that is applicable to the case under review as \n     described in subsection (e), except that if the entity \n     determines that a referral to an independent medical reviewer \n     is not required, the entity shall provide notice of such \n     determination to the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee \n     (or authorized representative) within such timeline and \n     within 2 days of the date of such determination.\n       (d) Independent Medical Review.--\n       (1) In general.--If a qualified external review entity \n     determines under subsection (c) that a denial of a claim for \n     benefits is eligible for independent medical review, the \n     entity shall refer the denial involved to an independent \n     medical reviewer for the conduct of an independent medical \n     review under this subsection.\n       (2) Medically reviewable decisions.--A denial of a claim \n     for benefits is eligible for independent medical review if \n     the benefit for the item or service for which the claim is \n     made would be a covered benefit under the terms and \n     conditions of the plan or coverage but for one (or more) of \n     the following determinations:\n       (A) Denials based on medical necessity and \n     appropriateness.--A determination that the item or service is \n     not covered because it is not medically necessary and \n     appropriate or based on the application of substantially \n     equivalent terms.\n       (B) Denials based on experimental or investigational \n     treatment.--A determination that the item or service is not \n     covered because it is experimental or investigational or \n     based on the application of substantially equivalent terms.\n       (C) Denials otherwise based on an evaluation of medical \n     facts.--A determination that the item or service or condition \n     is not covered based on grounds that require an evaluation of \n     the medical facts by a health care professional in the \n     specific case involved to determine the coverage and extent \n     of coverage of the item or service or condition.\n       (3) Independent medical review determination.--\n       (A) In general.--An independent medical reviewer under this \n     section shall make a new independent determination with \n     respect to whether or not the denial of a claim for a benefit \n     that is the subject of the review should be upheld, reversed, \n     or modified.\n       (B) Standard for determination.--The independent medical \n     reviewer's determination relating to the medical necessity \n     and appropriateness, or the experimental or investigation \n     nature, or the evaluation of the medical facts of the item, \n     service, or condition shall be based on the medical condition \n     of the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (including the \n     medical records of the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee) \n     and valid, relevant scientific evidence and clinical \n     evidence, including peer-reviewed medical literature or \n     findings and including expert opinion.\n       (C) No coverage for excluded benefits.--Nothing in this \n     subsection shall be construed to permit an independent \n     medical reviewer to require that a group health plan, or \n     health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage, \n     provide coverage for items or services for which benefits are \n     specifically excluded or expressly limited under the plan or \n     coverage in the plain language of the plan document (and \n     which are disclosed under section 121(b)(1)(C)) except to the \n     extent that the application or interpretation of the \n     exclusion or limitation involves a determination described in \n     paragraph (2).\n       (D) Evidence and information to be used in medical \n     reviews.--In making a determination under this subsection, \n     the independent medical reviewer shall also consider \n     appropriate and available evidence and information, including \n     the following:\n       (i) The determination made by the plan or issuer with \n     respect to the claim upon internal review and the evidence, \n     guidelines, or rationale used by the plan or issuer in \n     reaching such determination.\n       (ii) The recommendation of the treating health care \n     professional and the evidence, guidelines, and rationale used \n     by the treating health care professional in reaching such \n     recommendation.\n       (iii) Additional relevant evidence or information obtained \n     by the reviewer or submitted by the plan, issuer, \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or an authorized \n     representative), or treating health care professional.\n       (iv) The plan or coverage document.\n       (E) Independent determination.--In making determinations \n     under this subtitle, a qualified external review entity and \n     an independent medical reviewer shall--\n       (i) consider the claim under review without deference to \n     the determinations made by the plan or issuer or the \n     recommendation of the treating health care professional (if \n     any); and\n       (ii) consider, but not be bound by the definition used by \n     the plan or issuer of ``medically necessary and \n     appropriate'', or ``experimental or investigational'', or \n     other substantially equivalent terms that are used by the \n     plan or issuer to describe medical necessity and \n     appropriateness or experimental or investigational nature of \n     the treatment.\n       (F) Determination of independent medical reviewer.--An \n     independent medical reviewer shall, in accordance with the \n     deadlines described in subsection (e), prepare a written \n     determination to uphold, reverse, or modify the denial under \n     review. Such written determination shall include--\n       (i) the determination of the reviewer;\n       (ii) the specific reasons of the reviewer for such \n     determination, including a summary of the clinical or \n     scientific evidence used in making the determination; and\n       (iii) with respect to a determination to reverse or modify \n     the denial under review, a timeframe within which the plan or \n     issuer must comply with such determination.\n       (G) Nonbinding nature of additional recommendations.--In \n     addition to the determination under subparagraph (F), the \n     reviewer may provide the plan or issuer and the treating \n     health care professional with additional recommendations in \n     connection with such a determination, but any such \n     recommendations shall not affect (or be treated as part of) \n     the determination and shall not be binding on the plan or \n     issuer.\n       (e) Timelines and Notifications.--\n       (1) Timelines for independent medical review.--\n       (A) Prior authorization determination.--\n       (i) In general.--The independent medical reviewer (or \n     reviewers) shall make a determination on a denial of a claim \n     for benefits that is referred to the reviewer under \n     subsection (c)(3) in accordance with the medical exigencies \n     of the case and as soon as possible, but in no case later \n     than 14 days after the date of receipt of information under \n     subsection (c)(2) if the review involves a prior \n     authorization of items or services and in no case later than \n     21 days after the date the request for external review is \n     received.\n       (ii) Expedited determination.--Notwithstanding clause (i) \n     and subject to clause (iii), the independent medical reviewer \n     (or reviewers) shall make an expedited determination on a \n     denial of a claim for benefits described in clause (i), when \n     a request for such an expedited determination is made by a \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized \n     representative) at any time during the process for making a \n     determination, and a health care professional certifies, with \n     the request, that a determination under the timeline \n     described in clause (i) would seriously jeopardize the life \n     or health of the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee or the \n     ability of the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee to \n     maintain or regain maximum function. Such determination shall \n     be made as soon in accordance with the medical exigencies of \n     the case and as soon as possible, but in no case later than \n     72 hours after the time the request for external review is \n     received by the qualified external review entity.\n       (iii) Ongoing care determination.--Notwithstanding clause \n     (i), in the case of a review described in such subclause that \n     involves a termination or reduction of care, the notice of \n     the determination shall be completed not later than 24 hours \n     after the time the request for external review is received by \n     the qualified external review entity and before the end of \n     the approved period of care.\n       (B) Retrospective determination.--The independent medical \n     reviewer (or reviewers) shall complete a review in the case \n     of a retrospective determination on an appeal of a denial of \n     a claim for benefits that is referred to the reviewer under \n     subsection (c)(3) in no case later than 30 days after the \n     date of receipt of information under subsection (c)(2) and in \n     no case later than 60 days after the date the request for \n     external review is received by the qualified external review \n     entity.\n\n[[Page S1141]]\n\n       (2) Notification of determination.--The external review \n     entity shall ensure that the plan or issuer, the participant, \n     beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized representative) and \n     the treating health care professional (if any) receives a \n     copy of the written determination of the independent medical \n     reviewer prepared under subsection (d)(3)(F). Nothing in this \n     paragraph shall be construed as preventing an entity or \n     reviewer from providing an initial oral notice of the \n     reviewer's determination.\n       (3) Form of notices.--Determinations and notices under this \n     subsection shall be written in a manner calculated to be \n     understood by an average participant.\n       (f) Compliance.--\n       (1) Application of determinations.--\n       (A) External review determinations binding on plan.--The \n     determinations of an external review entity and an \n     independent medical reviewer under this section shall be \n     binding upon the plan or issuer involved.\n       (B) Compliance with determination.--If the determination of \n     an independent medical reviewer is to reverse or modify the \n     denial, the plan or issuer, upon the receipt of such \n     determination, shall authorize coverage to comply with the \n     medical reviewer's determination in accordance with the \n     timeframe established by the medical reviewer.\n       (2) Failure to comply.--\n       (A) In general.--If a plan or issuer fails to comply with \n     the timeframe established under paragraph (1)(B) with respect \n     to a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee, where such \n     failure to comply is caused by the plan or issuer, the \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee may obtain the items or \n     services involved (in a manner consistent with the \n     determination of the independent external reviewer) from any \n     provider regardless of whether such provider is a \n     participating provider under the plan or coverage.\n       (B) Reimbursement.--\n       (i) In general.--Where a participant, beneficiary, or \n     enrollee obtains items or

remedies available \n     under law) to recover only the amount of any such \n     reimbursement that is owed by the plan or issuer and any \n     necessary legal costs or expenses (including attorney's fees) \n     incurred in recovering such reimbursement.\n       (D) Available remedies.--The remedies provided under this \n     paragraph are in addition to any other available remedies.\n

Mr. President, I'm honored to join my colleagues in \nintroducing the Bipartisan Patient Protection Act. This bill is a true \nbipartisan compromise, and I am confident it will receive the support \nof the majority of the Senate.\n  We believe that our proposal is just what the doctor ordered to end \nabuses by HMOs and managed care health plans. Doctors and patients \nshould be making medical decisions, not insurance company accountants. \nIt is long past time for Congress to start protecting patients, instead \nof HMO profits.\n  Prompt passage of this legislation is vital for the 161 million \nAmericans with private health insurance coverage. This is the fifth \nyear that Congress has considered patient protection--and too many \npatients have been subject to unacceptable abuses as the result of our \ninaction. Every day that Congress fails to act, more patients suffer.\n  A survey by the School of Public Health at the University of \nCalifornia found that every day--each and every day--50,000 patients \nexperience added pain and suffering because of actions by their health \nplan. Thirty-five thousand patients have needed care delayed--or denied \nall together. Thirty-five thousand other patients have a referral to a \nspecialist delayed or denied. Thirty-one thousand patients are forced \nto change their doctors. Eighteen thousand patients are forced to \nchange their medications.\n  A survey of physicians by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the \nHarvard School of Public Health found similar results. Every day, tens \nof thousands of patients across the country suffer serious declines in \ntheir health as the result of the action--or inaction--of their health \nplan.\n  Whether the issue is diagnostic tests, specialty care, emergency \ncare, access to clinical trials, availability of needed drugs, \nprotection of doctors who give patients their best possible advice, or \nwomen's ability to obtain gynecological services--too often, in all of \nthese cases. HMOs and managed care plans treat the company's bottom \nline as more important than the patient's vital signs. These abuses \nhave no place in American medicine. Every doctor knows it. Every \npatient knows it. And in their hearts, every member of Congress knows \nit.\n  Every American also knows that it is wrong for the current legal \nsystem to give immunity to health insurance companies and HMOs that \nkill or injure patients. No other industry in America has immunity from \nliability when it acts irresponsibly, and HMOs and health insurance \ncompanies shouldn't have it either.\n  The legislation we are offering today is bipartisan. Whether the \nissue is liability, the appeals process, or state flexibility, we have \nmade significant modifications to respond to legitimate concerns. but \nwe have preserved the basic principle that when serious illness \nstrikes, every American deserves the protection they were promised.\n  President Bush campaigned on a pledge to pass an effective patients' \nbill of rights. We are ready to work with him to bring the American \npeople the protection they deserve. Ending the current abuses should be \na priority for the new Congress and the new Administration, and I am \nhopeful that we can work together to past this legislation as soon as \npossible this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/07/senate-section/article/S1156-1", "month": "02",

Con. Res. 8\n\n       Whereas the Canadian provinces use government timber to \n     subsidize lumber production and employment by providing \n     timber to Canadian lumber companies through noncompetitive, \n     administered pricing arrangements for a fraction of the \n     timber's market value;\n       Whereas unfair subsidy practices have resulted in shipments \n     of lumber to the United States to the point that subsidized \n     Canadian lumber is being imported into the United States at \n     record levels and now accounts for over one-third of the \n     United States softwood lumber market;\n       Whereas highly subsidized Canadian lumber imported into the \n     United States has resulted in lost sales for United States \n     lumber companies, depressed United States lumber values, \n     jeopardized thousands of United States jobs, and contributed \n     to a collapse in lumber prices;\n       Whereas Canadian lumber subsidy practices have been \n     identified by a variety of independent analyses;\n       Whereas United States Government officials in the Reagan, \n     Bush, and Clinton Administrations, United States industry, \n     timberland owners, and labor unions have called for an end to \n     the subsidies and for fair trade; and\n       Whereas an agreement between the United States and Canada \n     on lumber trade is scheduled to expire on March 31, 2001: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the President, the United States Trade \n     Representative, and the Secretary of Commerce should--\n       (1) make the problem of subsidized Canadian lumber imports \n     a top trade priority to be addressed immediately;\n       (2) take every possible action to end Canadian lumber \n     subsidy practices through open and competitive sales of \n     timber and logs in Canada for fair market value, or if Canada \n     will not agree to end the subsidies immediately, provide that \n     the subsidies be offset in the United States; and\n       (3) if Canada does not agree to end subsidies for lumber--\n       (A) enforce vigorously, promptly, and fully the trade laws \n     with respect to subsidized and dumped imports;\n       (B) explore all options to stop unfairly traded imports; \n     and\n       (C) limit injury to the United States industry.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a Senate \nconcurrent resolution that urges the administration to realize that an \nimmediate trade priority should be to address the problem of subsidized \nCanadian softwood lumber imports. I am pleased to be joined in this \neffort by Senators Lott, Lincoln, Cochran, Hutchinson, Thurmond, Crapo, \nand Craig.\n  The U.S.-Canada Softwood Lumber Agreement of 1996 will expire on \nMarch 31, 2001--just 53 short days from now--and there are no \ngovernment-to-government negotiations taking place. We do not know just \nwhat will happen if the Agreement is allowed to expire with no \nalternative solution in place, but without restrictions, the subsidized \nlumber from Canada will flood over the border further impacting our \nU.S. sawmills. This to me is unacceptable.\n  It is safe to say that we who represent our respective states here in \nthe Senate share the same goals for our constituents--economic growth \nand prosperity through secure businesses and jobs, a healthy \nenvironment, including the ability to purchase reasonably priced homes \nand lumber with which to remodel. I cannot stand by,\n\n[[Page S1158]]\n\nhowever, and watch someone's dream become another's nightmare.\n  The United States has over four million forest landowners, with \napproximately 20,000 logging facilities, sawmills and planing mills, \nwhich employ over 700,000 employees. In the past year, lumber prices in \nthe United States have plummeted by 33 percent while Canadian imports \nhave grown to record levels. Approximately 3,500 mills have already \nclosed, and I have heard from those with sawmills in Maine that are \nstill open that they are close to laying off their hard-working \nemployees and using their lumber to board up their businesses. Their \nmessage, as is mine, is for free trade that is also fair trade.\n  I would like to note that, the problem of the subsidized lumber is \nnot coming from Maine's good neighbors to the North--those small \nsawmills of the Canadian Maritimes--as they do not have vast amounts of \ncrown, or government-owned, forest, but also get their wood from \nprivate forests, and they do not fall under the current quotas of the \nAgreement. There are only four provinces that actually fall under the \nquota system, Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia, and the \nlarge integrated sawmills--those that have both pulp and sawmill \noperations, are doing very well. On the other hand, the small sawmills \nin the Maritimes are hurting just as much as our sawmills in the United \nStates. This is a trade problem that we must negotiate with Canada in \nthe interests of the United States while they also work to solve their \nown inequities.\n  The U.S. timber prices for lumber are set by the market for both \npublic and private forests, while the Canadian Government sets the \nprice of timber from Quebec to British Columbia at a level that is one \nhalf to one-quarter the actual market value of timber. Some of the \nCanadian provinces with vast crown forests use government timber to \nsubsidize lumber production and employment by providing timber to \nCanadian lumber companies through noncompetitive, administered pricing \narrangements for a fraction of the timber's market value.\n  These unfair subsidy practices have fueled shipments to the United \nStates to the point that subsidized Canadian imports are at record \nlevels and now control over one-third of the U.S. softwood lumber \nmarket. The highly subsidized Canadian lumber imports have gained sales \nvolume from U.S. lumber companies, depressed U.S. timber values, and \njeopardized thousands of U.S. jobs, and contributed to a collapse in \nlumber prices.\n  Canadian lumber subsidy practices have been identified by a variety \nof independent analyses. U.S. Government officials in the Reagan, Bush \nand Clinton administrations, the U.S. industry and timberland owners, \nand labor unions all have called for an end to the subsidies and for \nfair trade.\n  We are calling upon the President, the Office of the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, and the Secretary of Commerce to take every possible \naction to end Canadian lumber subsidy practices through open and \ncompetitive sales of timber and logs in Canada for fair market value, \nor if Canada will not agree to end the subsidies immediately, the \nsubsidies must be offset pending some sort of reform.\n  In addition, if Canada will not reach an agreement to vigorously, \npromptly, and fully enforce the trade laws against subsidized and \ndumped imports and explore all options to stop unfairly traded imports, \nand to limit injury to the U.S. industry pending further action, the \nadministration should be prepared to vigorously and fully enforce the \ntrade laws against subsidized and dumped imports from Canada.\n  I hope that these efforts today will jump start the administration as \nsoon as tomorrow to start working towards negotiations with Canada. \nThere are no surprises here, as the issue has been around since the \n1930s. There have been years of investigations, assessments, petitions, \nrulings, imposed duties, and a 1986 Memorandum of Understanding to \naddress the inequities.\n  As a matter of fact, a major reason for bringing Canada to the \nnegotiating table for the 1996 Agreement, along with a lawsuit by the \nCoalition for Fair Lumber Imports, was the implementing legislation for \nthe GATT Uruguay Round Agreements. Congress approved the President's \n``statement of administrative action'' that stated that lumber imports \nfrom Canada could be subject to countervailing duties under the Uruguay \nRound.\n  Every possible action must be taken immediately, to end Canadian \nlumber subsidy practices through open and competitive sales of timber \nand logs in Canada at fair market value. This trade must be both free \nand fair. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/07/senate-section/article/S1158-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n            committee on banking, housing, and urban affairs\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, the powerful earthquake which recently \ndevastated India's densely populated western state of Gujarat has \nfocused our attention, once again, on India. Gujarat officials estimate \nthat 28,000 to 30,000 people have died. Thousands more have been \ninjured, and hundreds of thousands have been displaced.\n  In response to India's dire need for help, USAID has sent blankets, \ngenerators, water containers, plastic sheeting, food, and other relief \nsupplies--all part of our official commitment to provide some $10 \nmillion in emergency humanitarian aid. But in my view this is not \nenough. We can and should do more. In the initial phase of this \ndisaster when India particularly needed search and rescue teams and \nmedical assistance, the United States was conspicuous in its absence. \nThe Russians, the Brits, the Swiss and others were engaged in pulling \npeople out of the rubble. We were not. At least half a dozen countries, \nincluding Denmark, Israel, and Sweden, sent field hospitals, doctors \nand medical personnel. We did not. Given our slow start, it is \nespecially important for the United States to be particularly generous \nwhen it comes to reconstruction.\n  Indian-Americans, on the other hand, have moved quickly to mobilize \ntheir own relief effort--collecting sizeable donations and medical \nsupplies as well as assembling teams of doctors. Reflecting the depth \nof concern among Americans for the tragedy that has struck India, \nPresident Bush, last week, made a condolence call to Indian Prime \nMinister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. I commend the President for making this \ncall, not only because it was the right thing to do under the \ncircumstances, but also because it was an important gesture by the new \nAdministration toward a country in a region that the United States \ntends to ignore, except in times of crisis.\n  Regrettably the Clinton Administration paid little attention to \ndevelopments in South Asia until May 1998, when India broke its 25 year \nmoratorium on nuclear testing with five underground tests. Taken by \nsurprise, the Administration tried--to no avail--to persuade Pakistan \nnot to test in response. Confronted with escalating tensions not only \nin the nuclear realm but on the ground over Kashmir, the Administration \nwas forced to focus on growing instability in the subcontinent.\n\n  Belatedly the Administration picked up the pace of its diplomacy in \nthe region, opening a high level dialogue\n\n[[Page S1163]]\n\nwith India and Pakistan on nuclear issues, interceding to reduce \ntensions over Kashmir, and arranging a Presidential visit last March to \nIndia, with a brief stop in Pakistan. President Clinton's trip to \nIndia--the first by a US president in 22 years--was an effort, in his \nwords, to ``rekindle the relationship'' between the United States and \nIndia. It was a welcome initiative.\n  I was in India in December 1999, a few months before President \nClinton's visit, to participate in the World Economic Forum's India \nEconomic Summit. While there, I had an opportunity to meet with a \nnumber of Indian officials including the Prime Minister, his National \nSecurity Adviser and the Defense Minister. During the course of these \nmeetings, it became very clear to me that India wanted a better \nrelationship with the United States. In many respects, this was \npredictable because from India's perspective, the neighborhood in which \nit lives has become less friendly and more threatening, and its \nhistorical ally, the Soviet Union, no longer exists.\n  Pakistan is under the control of a military regime rather than a \ndemocratically elected government--a regime which New Delhi views as \nillegitimate and threatening. In the months before the Clinton visit, \ntensions with Pakistan had intensified not only over Kashmir but also \nover Pakistani support for terrorists. Although tensions have subsided \nsince then, Kashmir continues to be a volatile issue that could provoke \nanother war between India and Pakistan both armed with nuclear weapons. \nPakistan, like India, has declared its intention to be in the nuclear \ngame. Pakistan clearly poses a security problem for India but not of \nthe magnitude of China. As one Indian told me during my visit, \n``Pakistan is a nuisance but not a threat--China is a threat.''\n  The biggest and from the Indian viewpoint most menacing power in the \nneighborhood is China--a country with which India has had longstanding \ntensions over border and territorial issues. China's past assistance to \nPakistan's nuclear program and its ongoing efforts to build influence \nwith other smaller countries in the region, particularly those on \nIndia's border such as Burma, are proof at least in the minds of \nIndians that China is trying to encircle India. Whereas most of the \ncountries in Southeast Asia see Chinese aspirations as limited to that \nof a regional power that wants recognition and respect, India is wary \nof China's aspirations both in the region and globally.\n  The Indian fear of China seems to me to be larger than reality but it \nis real nonetheless, and it is a major reason why India has been \nseeking improved relations with the United States. The Clinton \nAdministration, recognizing that improved relations would be in \nAmerica's interests as well as India's, wisely took advantage of this \nopportunity. India is the largest democracy in Asia and a potentially \nimportant partner in our efforts to promote regional stability, \neconomic growth and more open political systems in surrounding \ncountries. It is a fledgling nuclear power with the potential to affect \nthe nuclear balance in South Asia as well as our nonproliferation goals \non a global level. It is involved in a longstanding conflict with \nPakistan which could erupt into another war possibly at the nuclear \nlevel. It is a player in a region dominated by China, with whom the US \nhas mutual interests but also major differences.\n\n  While the United States and India have differences over serious \nissues related to the development of India's nuclear program, labor and \nthe environment, Cold War politics and alliances no longer stand in the \nway of improved relations. In fact, as many of my Indian hosts \nsuggested, the United States and India are ``natural allies''. Both are \nvibrant democracies; Indian-American family ties are strong and \nextensive. As India has begun to open and liberalize its economy over \nthe past decade, American business and investment in India has grown, \nparticularly in the high tech region of Bangalore, and America has \nbecome India's largest trading partner and source of foreign \ninvestment. And on the flip side, Indians are playing a major role in \nthe growth of our high tech industry in California, Massachusetts, New \nYork, and elsewhere. Together with the Taiwanese, Indians own more than \n25 percent of the firms and supply more than 25 percent of the labor in \nthis country in those technology fields. All of India's political \nparties have accepted the need to continue India's economic \nmodernization. Undoubtedly there will be disagreements over how to do \nit but continuation of the process holds out the prospects of increased \neconomic interaction with the United States.\n  The potential exists for the U.S. and India to have a strong, \ncooperative relationship across a broad range of issues. President \nClinton's visit to India was an important step in laying the foundation \nfor this new relationship. Working groups were set up on trade, clean \nenergy and environment, and science and technology. A broad range of \nenvironmental, social and health agreements were signed. To strengthen \neconomic ties, $2 billion in Eximbank support for U.S. exports to India \nwas announced;.U.S. firms signed some $4 billion in agreements with \nIndian firms. The effort to institutionalize dialogue was capped by an \nagreement between President Clinton and Prime Minister Vajpayee for \nregular bilateral summits between the leaders of both countries. An \ninvitation was extended to the Prime Minister to visit Washington, \nwhich he did last September. During that visit, the two leaders agreed \nto expand cooperation to the areas of arms control, terrorism and AIDS.\n  The seeds have been sown for a new Indo-American relationship. It is \nup to the Bush Administration to nurture them. The Administration must \ndevote time and attention to the relationship--and to developments in \nthe region--on a consistent basis, not on a crisis only basis. \nPresident Clinton and Prime Minister Vajpayee set out to regularize \nbilateral contacts not only at the working level but also at the \nhighest levels. President Bush should continue this process. Personal \ndiplomacy at the highest levels, particularly when dealing with Asian \ncountries, is an essential element of relationship-building. I also \nbelieve that the time is long overdue for the United States to \ndistinguish, once and for all, between India and Pakistan and to treat \neach differently and according to the demands of those bilateral \nrelationships.\n\n  A constant source of irritation for Indians has been the inability or \nunwillingness of the United States to differentiate between India and \nPakistan. From their perspective, India's commitment to democracy and \neconomic reform dictate that the United States have a different \nrelationship with India than with Pakistan, which has a military regime \nthat supports terrorism. I agree that a distinction must be drawn. That \nthe United States lumps them together or even worse is soft on Pakistan \nis clearly unacceptable from the Indian point of view. To a certain \nextent, they have a point. To a certain extent, they have made their \npoint accurately.\n  Just as the passing of the Cold War has improved the atmosphere for \nan improvement in Indo-American relations, it has also removed the need \nfor the United States to ignore Pakistan's transgressions both within \nand outside of its borders. The United States no longer needs to tilt \ntoward Pakistan in pursuit of larger strategic objectives. We should \nlook at our relationships with India and Pakistan separately, analyzing \neach in terms of mutual interests and differences and being more candid \nin defining areas of agreement and disagreement. President Clinton \nattempted to find a new balance during his trip last year, by spending \nseveral days in India and only a few hours in Islamabad. But more needs \nto be done. In my view, we can advance our interests and strengthen our \nrelationship with India by immediately terminating the sanction on \nloans to India from international financial institutions (IFIs).\n  Although President Clinton waived most of the sanctions imposed on \nIndia after it tested in 1998, he chose not to exercise the waiver for \nIFI loans to India, amounting to some $1.7 billion, or for FMF (foreign \nmilitary financing) for India. I believe that we should lift the IFI \nsanction at this time. The release of these funds would send an \nimportant signal to India of our ongoing commitment to improved \nrelations while also encouraging the government of India to continue \nits economic modernization.\n\n[[Page S1164]]\n\n  The sanction on FMF needs discussion in hopes of finding further \nprogress regarding India's position on nuclear issues. At the moment, \nIndian officials have made it clear that there would be no rollback of \nIndia's nuclear program and that India intends to have a credible \nminimum nuclear deterrent which means nuclear weapons and delivery \nsystems. They believe that the United States is under-emphasizing \nIndia's security needs and overemphasizing nonproliferation objectives. \nI believe there is a happy medium between these two. Although there has \nbeen ongoing dialogue between Indian and American officials on the \nClinton Administration's four nonproliferation benchmarks set after the \n1998 tests--signing and ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty \n(CTBT), halting fissile material production, refraining from deploying \nor testing missiles or nuclear weapons, and instituting export controls \non sensitive goods and technology.\n  Despite the fact that we set up these benchmarks, the truth is there \nhas been little progress made with respect to them.\n  We must be frank and acknowledge at the same time, as we see and \nmeasure the progress, that we have to be honest about our own status, \nif you will. That requires us to acknowledge that our failure in the \nSenate to approve the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty has undermined our \nability to influence India and many other countries. And Pakistan, \nobviously, is in the same equation.\n  Nevertheless, it is imperative that the dialog continue because too \nmuch is at stake in terms of regional stability and nonproliferation to \nallow it to wither. We need to understand the fears that are driving \nIndia's sense of security and insecurity. We need to ask ourselves what \nis realistic to expect from India in light of those fears.\n  For their part, the Indians must understand that much can be gained \nin the relationship with the United States and with progress on these \nissues. Arms control and regional stability are inextricably linked, \nand global security is inextricably linked to our resolution of these \nissues.\n  I am very hopeful we can quickly reach a mutual understanding to \npermit the FMF sanction to also be lifted. I believe we can make \nprogress on these difficult issues if both parties are prepared to \ntackle them and to be sensitive to understanding the other's security \nconcerns.\n  India and the United States have begun to build a new cooperative \nrelationship that reflects our common ties and our common interests. A \nprocess has begun, and the administration needs to continue that \nprogress with commitment and with zeal.\n  India and the United States have an enormous amount to offer each \nother. We both can benefit, in my judgment, from a more cooperative and \nfriendly working relationship. I think the groundwork has been laid. I \nhope this administration can move rapidly to lift the current \nsanctions, to enter into the talks, and to move forward in this most \ncritical relationship.

Mr. President, let me turn to an event occurring to our \nneighbor to the south, Haiti, this very day. It is an event that has \nimpact not just for the people of that impoverished country, but also \nfor the United States.\n  Today, Jean-Bertrand Aristide will be inaugurated. This is the second \ntime that Aristide is being inaugurated as Haiti's President. Aristide, \nwith great popularity and great expectations, will today be succeeding \nhis hand-picked successor of Rene Preval.\n  For Aristide, and more importantly for the Haitian people, this is a \nmoment of great historic import and significant opportunity. Aristide's \nsecond inauguration represents a monumental opportunity because this \nman has the power to save his tiny nation from its own self-\ndestruction--destruction due in large part to the collective ideas, \nhopes, and dreams that both President Preval and President Aristide \nhimself have squandered over the precious years since 1994.\n  When last many Americans tuned into Haiti, it was 1994. In 1994, our \ncountry sent 20,000 troops to Haiti as part of an internationally \nendorsed effort to restore Aristide to power. That did occur in 1994. \nTragically, though, during these past 6 years, both President Aristide, \nand then President Preval, have failed to enact the necessary reforms \nto bring democracy, stability, and, yes, hope to Haiti. As a result, \nHaiti, today, still has a declining gross national product. Nobody \nknows what the unemployment is. Official estimates are between 60 and \n70 percent unemployment. There is little to no foreign investment. In \nfact, there is less today than a number of years ago. They have the \nhemisphere's lowest per capita income and highest infant mortality \nrate. The Haitian National Police, HNP, a civilian police force, which \nthe United States and the international community helped to establish 6 \nyears ago, and that we worked very hard on and saw great success made, \nnow, today, unfortunately, is declining in its expertise.\n  Six years ago, there was great promise for the Haitian National \nPolice. Today, though, the HNP has become more corrupt, more engaged in \npolitics, and is in a state of steady decline.\n  In 1994, when Aristide was returned to power, everyone was realistic. \nNo one expected miracles. Haiti was, after all, a country that has been \nmiserably governed by Haitians and non-Haitians alike for not just \ndecades but for centuries. What could have been expected and should \nhave been expected was the establishment of a foundation for change and \nthe establishment of a foundation for progress that would help move \nthat country away from its failed past and toward a hopeful and \nproductive future.\n  Tragically, under both President Aristide, and then President Preval, \nthere has been no movement in that direction. Moreover, the few \nHaitians who comprised the economic elite have shown no interest in \nbecoming stakeholders in their country's overall social, political, and \neconomic progress. For them, it seems, they think it is in their best \ninterest to stand back from the turmoil that surrounds them so as to \nnot risk their own wealth and security. That has been true of the \neconomic elite, and it has been true of the political elite as well.\n  Despite this, in politics, as in theater and in life itself, there \nare second acts, second opportunities for redemption. President \nAristide now has such an opportunity. His immense popularity and his \npolitical hold on the country give him the capability to reverse \nHaiti's destructive course. It is within his means to do the things \nthat are necessary. Quite frankly, anyone who has spent any time \nlooking at Haiti knows that there are four, five, six basic things that \nHaitians need to do to get their country moving in the right direction. \nIt is within Aristide's grasp today to help Haiti begin to eliminate \ncorruption, create free markets and new industries, to do basic things \nsuch as privatize Port-au-Prince port, which today, unbelievably, is \nthe most expensive port in the entire hemisphere to ship anything into \nor out of. He has it within his power to improve the country's judicial \nsystem, to stabilize its political system, to respect human rights, and \nto learn to establish and sustain an agricultural system that can begin \nto feed its own people.\n  It is within Aristide's means to help Haiti break out of its vicious \ncycle of despair, a cycle in which political stalemate stops government \nand judicial reforms which, in turn, discourage investment and \nprivatization. Caught in a cycle such as this, the economy stands to \nshrink further and further until there is no economic investment to \nspeak of at all.\n  That will occur unless some action is taken. Aristide already has \ngiven some indication--at least on paper--that he is willing to make \nsome of these changes. In a December letter to President Clinton, he \nsaid he was committed to a broad range of governmental and political \nreforms, including: Rapid review and rectification of 10 contested \nSenate seats; creation of a credible new provisional electoral council \nin consultation with opposition party members; substantial enhancement \nof cooperation with the United States to combat drug trafficking; \nnomination of capable and respected officials for senior security \npositions, including the Haitian National Police; strengthening of \ndemocratic institutions and protection of human rights; installation of \na broad-based government, including members of the opposition; \ninitiation of new dialogue with international financial institutions to \nenhance free markets and private investment; and negotiation of an \nagreement for the repatriation of illegal migrants.\n  All of these things were spelled out in that letter from President \nAristide to then-President Clinton. All of these things are readily \nachievable.\n  Aristide's pledge is encouraging. But, unless he has the political \nwill to actually carry out these reforms and create a stable and \ndemocratic government, Haiti has no hope of making real and lasting \neconomic, political, and judicial progress. Quite candidly, there's \nnothing the United States can do to fix Haiti if its government isn't \nwilling to fix itself. Since the mid-1990s, we've spent more than $2 \nbillion--and the international community has poured in at least another \n$1.5 billion--to try to bring democracy and stability to Haiti.\n  Yet if we look at where Haiti is today versus where it was 6 years \nago, a casual observer going through that country would come to the \nconclusion that virtually nothing has changed, that nothing has \nhappened.\n  Candidly, Mr. President, the fact is that extraordinary amounts of \nfinancial assistance and the good intentions behind them are no \nsubstitute for the political will and leadership necessary to rescue an \nunstable country in an economic freefall. Unless Aristide and his \nFamily Lavalas Party take responsibility for the situation and commit \nto turning things around, history will repeat itself.\n  Unless President Aristide, his political party, and the leadership of \nHaiti\n\n[[Page S1166]]\n\ntake responsibility for the situation and commit to turning things \naround, history will once again tragically repeat itself.\n  Unless Aristide makes concrete changes, we will once again be seeing \nmakeshift boats and rafts overflowing with Haitians who want a better \nlife trying to get to Florida. We will begin to see that again--people \nrisking their lives as they float towards Miami for a chance of freedom \nand democracy and food for their children.\n  But should Aristide begin to demonstrate a legitimate commitment to \nchange, the United States and the international community stand ready \nto resume our efforts to help the Government of Haiti. But it will take \naction, and it will take action from the President, President Aristide, \nand from the Haitians. Until then, until we see that kind of \ncommitment, U.S. commitment will remain limited to directly helping the \nchildren of Haiti, the people of Haiti, and not the Government.\n  The United States, irrespective of what Aristide does, must remain \ninvolved in humanitarian efforts--efforts such as Public Law 480, the \nFood Assistance Program, a food assistance program that is helping tens \nof thousands of Haitian children every day, giving them the one meal a \nday they have, and for many of them giving them an incentive to go to \nschool and become educated. We must continue to do that.\n  One of the bright spots of what has been going on in Haiti, and one \nof the things of which I think this country should be very proud, is \nhow many Americans are in Haiti every single day working to make a \ndifference. Many of them are religious. Many of them belong to church \ngroups. Many of them belong to other nonprofit organizations or groups. \nSome go for a week, some go for 2 weeks, and some have gone to live and \nstay. But there are thousands and thousands of Americans every day who \nare making a difference in Haiti.\n  We must continue as a U.S. Government to assist them as they try to \nassist the children of Haiti because it is the children who are the \ntrue casualties in Haiti. It is the children who have suffered the most \nfrom the lack of progress over the last 6 years. It is the children who \nhave suffered the most from the inability and the unwillingness of \nthe Haitian Government to move to make real changes in Haiti.\n\n  So the real victims have been the children. They are the victims of \nthe turmoil. They are the victims of the instability. They are the \nvictims of a lack of political will. We as a country and as a people \nsimply cannot and will not turn our back on them.\n  This is a country where the infant mortality rate is approximately 15 \ntimes that of the United States. It has the highest infant mortality \nrate in our hemisphere. Of those Haitian children under 5 years of age, \n129 of every 1,000 never make it to the age of 6.\n  Because Haiti lacks the means to produce enough food to feed its \npopulation, the vast majority of Haitian children who survive are \nmalnourished and rely heavily on our humanitarian food aid.\n  Additionally, because of the lack of clean water and sanitation, only \n39 percent of the population has access to clean water and 26 percent \nhas access to decent sanitation. Because of that, diseases such as \nmeasles and tuberculosis are epidemic, and children die from the \nsimplest thing as diarrhea. That happens every single day in Haiti.\n  The future of Haiti's children ultimately is in Aristide's hands. It \nis time for President Aristide to match his words with his deeds and \nuphold his recent pledge to place his country and its people on a path \nof significant democratic societal reform. Lip service and piecemeal \nefforts, actions temporarily to appease the United States and the \ninternational community, frankly, will get Haiti nowhere.\n  This is Aristide's second act. The curtain comes up on that act \ntoday. He and the political rulers have a simple choice: To break with \nrecent history and create a stable political system and a free and \ndemocratic, market-driven economy, or to perpetuate the status quo and \nthe needless bloody tragedy that confines future generations of \nHaitians to lives of distress, disillusionment, and despair.\n  It is, quite candidly and quite bluntly, up to President Aristide to \nmake that determination. This is the second act. This is the second \nopportunity. History will judge whether or not he takes that \nopportunity for the people of Haiti or whether that opportunity is \nsquandered.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/07/senate-section/article/S1166-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
