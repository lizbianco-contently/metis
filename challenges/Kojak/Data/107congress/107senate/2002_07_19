Mr. President, since I still have time remaining under \nmorning business, I will comment on another issue that I am sure will \nbe commented on throughout the day and later next week. Later this \nmorning I will be at a conference meeting on the accounting reform \nbill. I have had a considerable role in that process and will be doing \nthat when we get to the actual debate on this bill. I see that as a top \npriority as well.\n  Today I rise in support of the tripartisan 21st Century Medicare Act, \nwhich was introduced on July 15 by Senators Grassley, Snowe, Jeffords, \nBreaux, and Hatch. This bill is a giant step forward for seniors in \nthis country and it demonstrates a sincere commitment to future \nbeneficiaries, by taking steps to preserve, improve, and modernize the \nMedicare Program. No other proposal before the Senate can deliver on \nsuch a promise.\n  Some of them have not been introduced yet. In fact, we have been a \nlittle disappointed that bills have not been introduced so that a more \ndirect discussion can be done on that.\n  I should say, not only no other proposal is before the Senate, no \nother proposal that is being talked about out there can deliver on the \npromise that this bill does.\n  This bill very likely has the support of the majority of the Senate. \nOf course, we would need a supermajority, or support of 60 Members, to \nadopt the bill. It raises a very important and interesting question. It \nis a budget question, because the score of the tripartisan bill exceeds \nby $70 billion the $300 billion Congress reserved last year for \nMedicare; there is a budget point of order that can be raised against \nthe bill.\n  Essentially, if a Senator votes against removing or bypassing the \nbudget point of order, they will be saying this bill costs taxpayers \ntoo much,\n\n[[Page S7094]]\n\nso I will not support it. But what is really interesting is that many \nof those who oppose this bill are actually supporting a proposal that \nis significantly more costly to the taxpayers. So I suggest people take \na look to see who votes against this bill on the basis it exceeds the \namount of money we have set aside by $70 billion and then perhaps votes \nfor a bill that is $700 billion, $800 billion, $900 billion--or a \ntrillion dollars--perhaps twice or three times the cost of this bill.\n  My point is a number of my colleagues could find themselves in the \nposition of voting against one bill because it costs too much only to \nturn around and support a competing bill that is two or three times \nmore costly.\n  Beyond cost to taxpayers, there are other important policy \ndifferences between the two Medicare drug benefit proposals. I believe \nthe most important is that the tripartisan bill stretches Federal \ndollars further than any other proposal and provides a permanent, \ncomprehensive drug benefit that's affordable for seniors and taxpayers. \nThis is a critical achievement.\n  And, the bill does even more. It provides seniors with the option of \nan expanded fee-for-service plan, including drug coverage, that will \nserve as the first modernization of the scope of benefits under \nMedicare since the program was created almost 40 years ago.\n  Lastly, while Medicare managed care plans--known as Medicare Plus \nChoice plans--are not serving Wyoming, millions of seniors across the \ncountry made the ``choice'' to enroll in those plans, and this bill \nmakes long overdue improvements to how those plans compete for seniors' \nbusiness. My colleagues from more populous and urban states undoubtedly \nknow that seniors who have Medicare Plus Choice plans as an option now \nwant to keep that option and want to see it expanded and improved.\n  All of this sounds like a lot. And it is. But I won't stand here and \ntell my constituents in Wyoming that this is everything they might \ndream of in a prescription drug benefit. It is a giant step forward and \nit will absolutely reduce the drug costs seniors bear today. It won't \nmake those costs disappear, but it will dramatically reduce them. And, \nit's a benefit we can afford to enact for seniors today and keep our \npromise to implement it in 2005. The proponents of the Daschle bill are \nalso making seniors promises about a great new drug benefit. Except we \ncan't afford it, so it's a hollow promise.\n  The opponents of the tripartisan bill will say that our bill doesn't \nprovide a real benefit to seniors. Well, here's the skinny on our bill \nand what it will save seniors in out-of-pocket costs. The Congressional \nBudget Office (CBO) determined that Medicare beneficiaries will spend \nan average of $3,059 per year on drugs in 2005. If enacted, this bill \nwould cut those costs by 53%--a savings of over $1600. That is real \nmoney. CBO also determined that the bill would cut costs for lower-\nincome beneficiaries at or below 135% of poverty by 98%, a savings of \n$2,988! The estimated out-of-pocket cost per prescription among the 50 \nmost-prescribed medications would be $21. And, every beneficiary would \nhave at least 2 drug plans to choose from when selecting the plan that \nbest fits their health care needs.\n  The Democrat bill, on the other hand, has a statutorily prescribed \ncost sharing for all drugs that the government decides to include in \nthe plan, and every senior must participate in that one-size-fits-all \nplan. That's a concerning and very significant difference from the \ntripartisan bill. All of us in this body have numerous choices of \nhealth plans both at and above the standard benefit package under the \nFederal Employees Health Benefit Program. I do not believe seniors \nshould be--by law--without a choice in their own health coverage. \nUnlike the tripartisan bill, the Daschle bill completely misses the \nopportunity to improve Medicare through expanded choices for seniors \nwhen selecting the right drug coverage.\n  To restate another distinction I raised earlier, the tripartisan bill \nhas been officially scored by the CBO to cost $370 billion over 10 \nyears. The sponsors of the Daschle bill have not provided us with an \nofficial score, but the unofficial scores are as high as $1 trillion \nover 10 years. More importantly, the drug benefit is not permanent \nunder the Daschle bill. It would sunset in the year 2010. That is to \nhold costs down as much as possible. There are rumors of a 4th \niteration of the bill that would not sunset the benefit, but that bill \nhas not been introduced and will be much more costly.\n  Since I'm talking about the cost of the Daschle bill to taxpayers, I \nwould be remiss if I did not talk about the cost of the bill to seniors \nthemselves. Because the bill would cement in Federal law fixed co-\npayment amounts for all drugs, seniors will actually pay more for \ncertain drugs than they would if the bill allowed drug plans to offer \nlower co-payments. The CBO analysis and score of the tripartisan bill \nproves that it employs this logic and essentially proved that drugs \nwill be provided in a more cost-effective way under the tripartisan \nmodel.\n  I have mentioned it before, but I just want to say again that, in \naddition to the very high profile issue of needing to provide a drug \nbenefit, Medicare has many other shortcomings. It is crying out for \nupdating and improvements. No one in this chamber can possibly be \nsatisfied with the program's status quo. Every day--literally--I either \nmeet with or hear from my constituents who interact with the Medicare \nprogram or beneficiaries. They are all complaining, and rightly so. The \nprogram was created with the best of intentions. But since that day \nsome 40 years ago, the rest of the health care world has evolved and \nimproved, from standards of care to technology to disease management. \nNot to mention how providers are reimbursed and empowered in the \ndelivery of health care services. I question whether any of this \nprogress has penetrated the morass of the Medicare program. In fact, \nall I seem to hear from my constituents is that things are pretty bad \nwith Medicare right now. That is before the new program is started.\n  I am astonished that only one of the two major bills--the tripartisan \nbill--tries to address the other problems with Medicare. The foundation \nof the program desperately needs reinforcement; simply building on its \nweak foundation the way the Daschle bill does is dangerous and falls \nshort of our obligation to do our best for seniors where all of their \nhealth care is concerned. Where the tripartisan bill has an enhanced \nfee-for-service option and improvements to the existing Medicare Plus \nChoice option, the Daschle bill is eerily silent. Such an absence of \nreform will only cost seniors more money in patch jobs down the road.\n  I guess I have come full circle. This debate is all about giving \nseniors additional coverage options and saving them money. Many seniors \ncurrently lack drug coverage. All of the bills will give them coverage \nand cost them less out-of-pocket than what they pay right now. But only \nthe tripartisan bill will give them flexibility in their coverage \nchoices and buy them and taxpayers the most that a dollar will buy. \nThat takes competition and modernization. The tripartisan bill has \nboth. The Daschle bill prohibits competition in its statutory language \nand does not entertain even modest improvements to the rest of the \nMedicare program.\n  The choice is clear to me and, I imagine, will be crystal clear to \nthe American people. For that reason, Mr. President, I would ask \nunanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor of the 21st Century \nMedicare Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine).

Mr. President, I think it is vitally important that the \nSenate pass a Medicare prescription drug benefit plan now. Our seniors \nneed it, our seniors have been waiting for years for it, and our \nseniors deserve it now.\n  Medicare is a health care entitlement program for the elderly. Since \nMedicare was established in 1965, Congress has considered adding a \nprescription drug benefit to the program. In the 106th Congress, the \nSenate got serious about enacting a benefit but was unsuccessful in \ntheir efforts.\n  I hope the Senate is successful now. I am concerned, however, that \nthe legislative process has been derailed. The majority leader decided \nto bring to the floor S. 812, the Greater Access to Affordable \nPharmaceuticals Act. This legislation did not proceed through the \nCommittee on Finance. In order for a revenue measure to not face a \nBudget Act point-of-order, legislation must proceed through the \nCommittee on Finance. S. 812 did not. As a result, the Senate is left \nwith assuming budget points-of-order against any and all revenue \nlegislation as we continue debate this week.\n  This is unacceptable. Seniors need drug coverage now. But the Senate \nmajority has stalled the process. I hope seniors across the United \nStates realize what has happened. This faulty procedure is robbing \nseniors of their drug benefit, which Congress and the President support \nbut which the Senate is denying. Politics is superseding policy and \nthat is simply unacceptable.\n  Because S. 812 did not proceed through the Committee on Finance, next \nweek the Senate will take up the Graham-Miller, tripartisan, Hagel-\nEnsign, and Smith-Allard amendments in an attempt to provide a \nprescription drug benefit. We can only hope that the Senate will waive \nthe budget point-of-order raised against these measures.\n\n  I have serious concerns about the legislation introduced by Senators \nGraham and Miller. Graham-Miller would be a temporary drug benefit, \nwithout secure financing. Graham-Miller would raise drug prices \nsignificantly, and Graham-Miller would not be able to be implemented as \nproposed. Graham-Miller would have an immeasurable and possibly \nunlimited cost.\n  Senator Graham's bill does not even have a CBO score. That is another \nconcern I have. Preliminary estimates are that it would cost at least \n$400 billion to $800 billion over only 6 years. With two-thirds of \nseniors already obtaining their prescription drugs independent of \nGovernment, the Graham plan, frankly, is too generous at a time when \nSocial Security solvency is at risk. According to CBO, Medicare \nbeneficiaries will utilize $1.8 trillion worth of drugs over the next \n10 years. But $1.1 trillion of this $1.8 trillion will be paid by third \nparties, such as employers, States, and Medicare+Choice plans. Drug \nbenefit proposals should focus on reducing the $700 billion that will \nbe paid by beneficiaries, not shifting the remaining $1.1 trillion to \nthe Federal budget. Seniors and taxpayers need a plan that provides a \nbenefit that does not blanket seniors with costs completely covered and \nthat does not break the Nation's bank. Graham-Miller's cost alone is \nreason to oppose it.\n  Other Senate drug proposals are less expensive. The tripartisan 21st \nCentury Medicare Act of 2002, introduced by Senators Grassley, Snowe, \nBreaux, Jeffords, and Hatch, is estimated to cost about $350 billion \nfrom the years 2005 to 2012. For days, weeks, and months, the Senate \nFinance Committee members and staff have worked tirelessly to write a \nbill that expands drug plan options for seniors and refines and \nenhances Medicare+Choice, Medigap, and other programs. This tripartisan \nbill will establish a universal, voluntary prescription drug benefit \nwith affordable premiums and special protections for low-income \nseniors. The tripartisan bill would add a new voluntary fee-for-service \noption to fit modern health benefit packages, and it will strengthen \nanother drug option under Medicare+Choice.\n  I am pleased that this tripartisan group of Republican, Democrat, and \nIndependent Senators have joined together to provide a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit. The tripartisan plan expands drug options \nfor seniors so they can choose a plan that fits their needs.\n  I also laud the work of Senators Hagel, Ensign, Gramm, and Lugar who \nintroduced the Medicare Prescription Drug Discount and Security Act. \nThe Hagel-Ensign plan would offer beneficiaries a voluntary drug \ndiscount card that they could use to purchase prescription drugs. The \nbill would cover catastrophic drug costs for beneficiaries under 600 \npercent of the Federal poverty level, so that seniors making less than \nabout $53,000 will pay no more than $1,500 to $5,500 in out-of-pocket \nexpenses. The bill also does not require monthly premiums, deductibles, \nor benefit caps. This bill is fiscally responsible, costing about $150 \nbillion over 10 years. I commend Senators Hagel and Ensign for their \nwork in offering this voluntary plan for seniors who need it most.\n  Senator Smith and I also have introduced an amendment to S. 812 that \nwould provide a Medicare prescription drug benefit. Under our plan, the \nvoluntary Medicare prescription drug plan, a Medicare beneficiary \nalready enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B will have the option of \nchoosing a new, voluntary prescription drug plan called Rx Option. This \nwould cover 50 percent of their prescription drug costs toward the \nfirst $5,000 worth of prescriptions that the senior purchases.\n  Currently, Medicare Part A has a $812 deductible and Part B has a \n$100 deductible. The Smith-Allard plan would create one deductible for \nPart A and Part B of $675 that would apply to all hospital costs, \ndoctor visits, and prescription drug costs. Once this $675 deductible \nis met by the Medicare recipient, Medicare will pay 50 percent of the \ncost toward the first $5,000 worth of prescription drugs that the \nsenior purchases.\n  In addition, there is no benefit premium that would be required. Our \nplan is revenue-neutral. It is voluntary and will lower Medigap \npremiums by $550 per year.\n  According to the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of \nMedicare, the Federal Government pays about $1,400 more per senior if \nthe senior has a Medigap plan that covers his Part A and Part B \ndeductibles. This generally is attributed to the fact there is \noverutilization of hospital and doctor visits by the senior because no \ndeductible is required under Medigap, and seniors are more inclined to \nvisit the hospital or doctor without having to pay a deductible.\n  The Smith-Allard plan would require seniors pay a deductible. As a \nresult, Medigap utilization will decrease and savings are achieved. In \nother words, there is an incentive created for the senior to go to the \ndoctor when he needs to and not simply because it cost him nothing.\n  The Smith-Allard plan would work as a stand-alone drug benefit or as \na complementing, additional drug benefit in conjunction with the other \ndrug options about which I talked earlier. Our plan has a number of \nfeatures that both the Graham-Miller plan and the House-passed Medicare \nModernization and Prescription Drug Act do not have.\n  I would like to take a minute to go over a chart I put together on \nSmith-Allard. This is the Smith-Allard proposal as compared to current \nlaw, as compared to the Democrat plan referred to as Graham-Kennedy, \nand as compared to the House GOP plan for prescription drugs.\n  This is assuming the senior has Medigap supplemental insurance. Under \ncurrent law, there is no deductible with the doctor or the hospital \nwhen they have Medigap insurance coverage.\n  With the Smith-Allard plan, there would be a $675 deductible that \nwould combine for both Part A and Part B of Medicare. Under the \nDemocrat plan, there is no deductible, and in the House plan there is \nno deductible.\n\n[[Page S7096]]\n\n  The prescription drug deductible is not covered in current law. It is \ncombined in the Smith-Allard plan. There is no deductible in the \nDemocrat plan and the House plan.\n  The average supplemental insurance premium under current law is \n$1,611. Under the Smith-Allard plan, this comes to $1,061. This remains \nthe same under both the Graham-Kennedy and House GOP plan.\n  Prescription drug premium: Under current law, there is no coverage. \nUnder the Smith-Allard plan, the prescription drug premium would be \nzero. Under the Democrat plan, the monthly charge that is talked about \nas $25 a month, this amounts to a $300-a-year premium, and the House \nGOP plan, which is $30 a month, amounts to an annual premium of $420.\n  Total annual premiums and deductible: Under current law, we stay at \nthe $1,611 level. Under the Smith-Allard plan, it is $1,736. Under the \nDemocrat plan, the Graham-Kennedy proposal, it is $1,911. And the House \nGOP plan is $2,281.\n  Let's look at the 10-year cost to the Medicare Program. Obviously, we \ndo not have anything under current law. The Smith-Allard plan would \nremain at zero. The 10-year cost of the Medicare Program to the \ntaxpayer is zero.\n  The Graham-Kennedy plan gets up to $600 billion, and some estimates \nare running between $400 billion and $800 billion; $600 billion is the \nnumber we use on this chart.\n  The House GOP plan comes in at $350 billion. Some are estimating $370 \nbillion currently.\n  Who provides the drug benefit? Under current law, it is not covered. \nUnder the Smith-Allard plan, Medicare provides that drug benefit. In \nthe Graham-Kennedy bill, Medicare provides it. And under the House GOP, \nit is provided by the private insurance industry.\n\n  What is the comparison of drug coverage? Currently, there is no \ncoverage. In the Smith-Allard plan, there is 50 percent coverage of all \ndrugs up to $5,000. In the Graham-Kennedy plan, the senior pays $10 for \ngeneric drugs and $40 for brand name drugs. Then in the House GOP, \nthere is 20 to 30 percent coverage up to $1,000 the senior pays, and \nthen 50 percent between $1,000 and $2,250, and 100 percent over the \n$2,250, up to $5,000.\n  Let's look at the catastrophic coverage under these various plans. \nUnder the Smith-Allard proposal, it is optional. Seniors can decide \nwhether they want to take it or not. Coverage could be provided with \nsavings if they decide to take that optional provision. In the Graham-\nKennedy plan, it is over $4,000, and in the House GOP plan, it is over \n$5,000.\n  The nice thing about the Smith-Allard plan and one reason I am \npresenting it to the Senate today and have introduced the legislation \nwith Senator Smith is because it provides another option, and it is \ncompatible with these other drug plans, particularly the first one we \ntalked about, the tripartisan plan, with an Independent, Democrats, and \nRepublicans supporting the plan. Our bill is very compatible with that \nkind of a plan.\n  The amendment I will be offering with Senator Smith is simply to \nprovide seniors with an option so that as we move forward with this, it \nmay be they do not want to pay the $25-a-month premium or the $30-a-\nmonth premium. They can say: I will offset that by increasing my \ndeductibles in Part A and Part B on Medicare. I think it is the kind of \nchoice we ought to offer seniors. It will balance any of the plans that \nhappen to pass the Senate, and we ought to pass it in the Senate in \norder to give seniors some choice.\n  I am pleased the Senate is working to pass a prescription drug \nbenefit for Medicare's 40 million enrollees. The Senate should be \npleased that many Members have worked hard in recent years to add a \ndrug benefit. We should be pleased that we are debating various \nproposals now. But our efforts are in vain if we do not pass a drug \nbenefit this year. Our efforts are in vain, I repeat, if we do not pass \na drug benefit this year. I urge my colleagues to set aside politics \nand pass a Medicare prescription drug benefit now.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak until the \nhour of 11:20 a.m. in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/19/senate-section/article/S7096-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7096-S7099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           AMERICA'S SENIORS NEED PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to talk about the delivery of \nprescription drugs to America's seniors. It is a subject that Senators \nhave been talking about pretty much all week long, but people tuning in \nmight wonder whether we are really making any progress toward getting a \nbill passed. That is what I would like to address this morning.\n  For quite a long time now, we have appreciated the fact that when \nMedicare was created, treating people with medications was not the \npreferred or first or primary method of treatment. So much of what \nMedicare covers today is the cost of invasive surgery, and the cost of \njust about every other kind of treatment except treatment through the \nuse of medication or prescription drugs. Over the last 25 years, it has \nbecome increasingly common for physicians first to treat with \nmedications, if possible. It seems second nature to us now. When \nMedicare was first established, that was not the case. As a result, \nmost prescription drugs were not covered as part of Medicare.\n  Over the years, people learned how to receive supplemental drug \ncoverage through Medigap insurance and other ways to pay for \nprescription drugs, but the combination of the fact that Medicare \nitself did not set out to cover those drugs and, second, that the cost \nof drugs has obviously increased over the years has made it more \ndifficult for some seniors to be able to pay for their prescription \ndrugs, especially since, again, this is what their physicians are \nprescribing as the best way to treat them in many cases.\n  Add to that the fact that people are, fortunately, living longer \ntoday, but that the longer one lives, the more likely they are going to \nneed to take various kinds of drugs, and we have a situation in which \nclearly it is time for Congress to respond with an inclusion of a \nMedicare drug benefit for all of America's seniors. We have been \nworking on that now for quite a long time.\n\n  I find it interesting that on the Republican side there are three or \nfour very good, somewhat different, ways of approaching this because \nMembers on our side have been working hard to try to fashion a set of \nbenefits we can afford and which will also provide the kind of care we \nwant for our senior citizens, and now we have a number of options.\n  I sit on the Finance Committee. Last year, when Senator Grassley \nchaired the Finance Committee, we began working legislation through the \nFinance Committee to try to bring to the Senate floor so we could \nprovide a prescription drug benefit to Medicare. Then the control of \nthe Senate changed.\n  Toward the end of last year, Republican members continued to meet \nand, in fact, began reaching across the aisle to meet with the \nDemocratic members of the Finance Committee and also with the \nIndependent Member of the Senate, Senator Jeffords, who had left the \nRepublican Party and caucused with the Democrats but is identified as \nan Independent, and over the months, representatives of the Republican \nParty, the Democratic Party, and Senator Jeffords have come together on \nan approach that has now acquired the name, the tripartisan approach--\nbecause it is not just the two parties but, it is actually three \nparties--an approach that actually will deliver a very good \nprescription drug benefit to our seniors and a plan that actually is \nunique among all of the different ideas that have been brought to the \nfloor because it can actually pass the Senate.\n  It has more than 51 votes in the full Senate, we believe, and it \ncould pass the Finance Committee. Senator Breaux is one of the leaders \nin this coalition, and he has been a leader in the Finance Committee in \nsupport of this. So a great deal of work has been done to try to \ndevelop the kind of reform that is necessary to provide prescription \ndrugs to our seniors.\n\n[[Page S7097]]\n\n  Then why the discussion on the Senate floor and what is going to \nhappen next week? Well, at the early part of next week, we are finally \ngoing to have a chance to vote on some alternatives. There will be at \nleast two. One will be this tripartisan plan I mentioned that has been \noffered by Senators Grassley, Hatch, Snowe, Jeffords, Breaux, and \nothers, and the other will be a competing plan brought by some members \nof the Democratic Party, led by Bob Graham from the State of Florida. \nThe two proposals approach the prescription drug issue in fairly \ndifferent ways. I am hoping we will have a good debate about the \ndifference between those two approaches.\n  There are also approaches from other Republican colleagues who are \neven more different and in some ways provide a very direct benefit to \nseniors at a much lower cost than either of the two bills I just \ndescribed. The problem is that at the end of next week, it is doubtful \nthe Senate will have passed any of these bills.\n  How can that be if, as I said, there is majority support at least for \none of the bills? I fear the problem is a political one, that there are \nsome people who would rather have an issue than a bill, a problem \nrather than a solution, because of course the problem can continue to \nbe talked about in a campaign context. I would rather have a bill that \nprovides the benefit we can all take credit for, but if politics is the \nprimary motivation, then clearly doing something is a good way to \nappeal to voters. But of course the whole point is it is the right \nthing to do.\n  It is past time that we provided a drug benefit to our seniors. Why \nis it that my prediction is what it is? Ordinarily, if the Finance \nCommittee brought a bill to the floor, we would vote on it and the \nmajority would prevail. It either wins or it loses. But in this case, \neven though the Finance Committee has been working very hard under the \nchairmanship of Senator Baucus's and Senator Grassley's leadership on \nthe Republican side, we are close to being able to mark up the bill in \nthe Finance Committee and bring it to the floor. It is clear that the \nSenate majority leader has, according to Senator Baucus, indicated the \nbill would have to be acceptable to him in order for it to come out of \nthe Finance Committee and brought to the floor. That was not the case \nwith the so-called tripartisan bill. The legislation that has been \nbrought to the floor by the majority leader is not legislation that \nwould have come out of the Finance Committee.\n\n  Why is that important? Because a point of order lies against \nlegislation that does not come out of committee. In practical terms, \nthat means you have to have 60 votes on the Senate floor to pass it.\n  What has been set up is a process that is set up to fail. By not \nallowing the Finance Committee to bring its bill to the floor and be \nvoted on by a majority of 51, we are setting up a requirement that any \nbill has to pass with 60 votes because it did not come out of \ncommittee; 60 votes will be very difficult to achieve because the \nSenate is divided roughly \\50/50\\ among the two parties.\n  We have different approaches to this solution, this problem. The only \nbill that likely would pass is the so-called tripartisan compromise. \nBut if it has to have 60 votes, that is a stretch, as well. I am not \nsure we can get 60 votes.\n  At the end of the day, by virtue of the process that has been \ncreated, we are not likely to end up with any legislation at the end of \nnext week. Then what will we do? Point fingers: It is your fault. No, \nit is your fault.\n  The bottom line will be that the American people end up the losers. \nOur seniors will not have a prescription drug benefit because the \nSenate decided to operate in a way that guaranteed that conclusion.\n  The House of Representatives has passed a bill that is a good bill. \nIt is not exactly what I would do, but it is a good start. The Senate \nshould act in the same way.\n  Let me describe a little bit about what this tripartisan bill does. \nEven though it is not a bill I would have written, I am willing to \nsupport it, primarily because it does have a number of good ideas, and \nit can be passed and we can move on, get a bill to conference and to \nthe President for signature to begin providing Medicare drug benefits \nfor our seniors.\n  The tripartisan plan is a comprehensive plan. It is a permanent plan \nwith respect to providing drugs to all Medicare beneficiaries. It also \nhas another feature that the other plans, by and large, do not, in that \nit provides reforms of Medicare that will ensure that as the program \ncontinues on out into the future, it will actually work. The problem \nwith both Social Security and Medicare today is without serious \nmodernizations neither one can provide the benefits that have been \npromised. Those are commitments that we should be ensuring we can keep.\n  Under this plan, Medicare beneficiaries will have a new drug benefit \noption. They can keep their current Medicare plan and do nothing, or \nthey can buy into the new drug plan provided for them. If they sign up \nfor the new plan, it is completely voluntary on their part. If they \nsign up for the new plan, they will have choices so that they can pick \nwhat best suits them. They would pay a premium that is estimated to be \nabout $24 a month, very similar to the monthly premium seniors now pay \nfor Medicare Part B. They would be able to choose between competing \nplans. The plans would compete for their business and therefore would \noffer the best possible arrangements for each individual senior. The \nplans generally would have an annual deductible of $250. This is \nsimilar to the Part B deductible seniors now pay which is currently \n$100.\n\n  A key difference is after $3,700 in out-of-pocket drug spending by \nthe beneficiary, the Government would pay 90 percent of the costs, and \nthe beneficiary would only pay 10 percent. As Medicare beneficiaries \nknow, traditional fee-for-service Medicare does not have this type of \nimportant stop-loss coverage for the benefits it provides; stop-loss \nmeaning after you pay a certain amount you do not have to pay anymore, \nthe Government would begin paying the bulk at that point. It is \nimportant to protect the beneficiaries from high drug costs, \nparticularly those who have a significant illness, or a longstanding \nillness that will require them to pay for drugs over a long period of \ntime.\n  Another important aspect of the proposal is it is affordable. The CBO \nhas estimated the cost, what we call scoring, will be $370 billion over \n10 years. Given it is estimated the alternative offered by the House \nDemocrats cost in the neighborhood of $800 billion to $900 billion over \n10 years, and the Graham-Miller proposal will cost almost $600 billion \nover 10 years, we clearly have an inability to fund that kind of a \nprogram. I believe the tripartisan plan is a much more affordable and \npractical plan.\n  In an artificial attempt to keep down their costs, the Graham-Miller \nplan sunsets after just 6 years. The proponents of this plan claim the \nreason they sunset their legislation after 6 years, in the year 2010, \nis they want the ability to look to see whether changes are necessary. \nThe fact is, it is a very expensive plan, about $600 billion over 10 \nyears, if enacted on a permanent basis, making it undesirable from a \npolitical point of view. That is one of the reasons that plan should \nnot be supported.\n  Let me also say we can examine legislation at any time, whether or \nnot it sunsets, and we can review legislation every year and propose \namendments to it. We do not need to sunset this legislation.\n  I mentioned the fact that traditional fee-for-service Medicare does \nnot have the stop-loss provision so people can continue to pay for \nhigh-cost drugs on and on. Under the tripartisan plan, beneficiaries \nwill have a chance to join this new fee-for-service option instead of \njoining Medicare Part A and Part B, as they do now. It would have a \ncombined deductible, instead of two separate deductibles that \nbeneficiaries have to deal with today.\n  Additionally, it would eliminate the beneficiary cost sharing for \npreventive benefits, such as breast cancer screening, prostate cancer \nscreening, and screening for glaucoma. This allows Medicare \nbeneficiaries to receive these benefits without having to pay a so-\ncalled copay.\n  One of the important aspects of the new option is the ultimate $6,000 \nstop-loss coverage, especially important if a Medicare beneficiary has \na long hospital stay. As I said, there are those\n\n[[Page S7098]]\n\nwho have serious illnesses that simply cannot afford to pay more than \nthat. This new option is a complete benefits package as opposed to just \na prescription drug package. Instead of just trying to address the \nissue of providing drugs, the tripartisan bill puts it into a new \noption in the traditional Medicare Program that currently exists so \npeople will know what they have a comprehensive plan. They can make an \nintelligent choice and know that it is all there for them together.\n  I will comment on another important part of the plan, and that is \nthat it uses the current market system that seniors are familiar with \nto deliver the benefits. The alternative is a strictly Government plan \nthat has to be run by Government bureaucrats. They will make the rules. \nThey would establish exactly what the benefits are over time and what \nthe costs of those are. By using the market that is currently used, \nthere is competition to provide the product that is the best for \nseniors at the lowest cost, so that seniors' needs will actually keep \nthe costs down and keep the benefit structure positive, as opposed to \nthe Government bureaucrats making those decisions.\n\n  The tripartisan plan includes coverage for drugs within all \ntherapeutic categories and classes, and provides timely appeals if \nthere is any denial of drug coverage in a particular case. This allows \nthe beneficiary to continue to have access to the needed drug and to \ncall on outside experts to review any decision that would deny them \nthose drugs.\n  The plans that participate in the program will have to meet access \nand quality standards that are decided by the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, including pharmacy access standards. We want to make \nsure in the rural areas Medicare beneficiaries have access to \npharmacies they can go to and get good advice. In rare cases, where \nbeneficiaries may not have a choice of at least two of these plans, the \nlegislation guarantees they would have an option of a fallback plan.\n  Providing affordable drug coverage is the goal of the tripartisan \nplan. That is why it subsidizes private plans to provide this drug \nbenefit. Using this delivery method, as I said before, will both \nprovide competition to hold down the costs and maintain the kind of \nprogram benefit that seniors are used to at the present time.\n  The CBO has told the authors of the tripartisan plan that using this \ndelivery method not only ensures Medicare beneficiaries access to the \nnew drug plans but also the most effective use of taxpayer dollars. We \nknow the plan will become more expensive over time. Seniors care just \nas much about taxes as anyone else and they want to know it is \naffordable. The more affordable it is, the more likely they can expand \nthe benefit to seniors. So that is in their interests, as well.\n  In contrast, the Graham-Miller plan uses government contractors to \nadminister their drug benefit. These contractors would have little \ninterest in holding down the cost of prescription drugs for Medicare \nbeneficiaries. We all know what the ultimate result of this would be: \nthe federal government would establish price controls on prescription \ndrugs to hold down the costs. This would have a devastating impact on \nprescription drugs. Let me offer a real life example of what will \nhappen here.\n  In some major cities today you have price controls, or rent controls \non housing. We all know what happens when you have these rent controls. \nThe bottom line is the prices either go up or the conditions of the \ntenements go down because the people who own them are no longer in a \nposition to continue to upgrade them because they cannot make a profit \non them.\n  What happens is that a severe shortage of housing is created and most \npeople who do not have access to rent controlled housing have to pay \nvery large amounts just to live in a small apartment. We are familiar \nwith this in the area of housing.\n  The same thing would happen with respect to drugs. If you use the \nalternative plan, which will ultimately lead to an attempt by the \nGovernment to control the prices--whenever you try to control the price \nof something, you get less of it. That is exactly what would happen \nhere. People who do not have access will pay extremely high costs. Just \nas there is no incentive to build new rental housing units in areas \nwith price controls, there will be no incentive to create new \nprescription drugs. After all, if you cannot make a profit with a new \ndrug that you create, why would you go to the effort and expend the \nmoney to try to develop that new drug and put it on the market? It is \njust not worthwhile to spend the amount of money necessary to create a \nproduct when you cannot even cover the costs when you sell it.\n  If we just think about price controls, if they had existed on \nprescription drugs over the last 20 years, you are probably not likely \nto have seen the creation of the fantastic new drugs we all have the \nbenefit of today--to control cholesterol levels, like Lipitor; to help \npeople with allergies; to help people with diabetes; and the list goes \non. This could be the result of the Democratic alternative which would \ntry to impose price controls without providing an incentive to create \nthese new drugs. Over time, that will result in inferior medical care \nbecause fewer and fewer drugs are being brought to market that will \nhelp seniors as well as everyone else.\n  This is another reason we should support the tripartisan plan that \nessentially builds on the system we have today, that gives seniors at \nleast two types of choices. Medicare beneficiaries can either continue \nin the existing Medicare system or get to choose the new options. If \nyou get into the new options, you are going to have at least two plans \nto choose from. So there is a lot of choice at the same time that it is \nalso very similar to the current system private employees and federal \nworkers have to receive their health care.\n  Let me finally talk about how much the Government is paying Medicare \nproviders to serve Medicare beneficiaries. It is a very serious \nconcern. At some point we are going to have to deal with it. In the \nHouse of Representatives there was, I think, $30 billion added to their \nprescription drug benefit legislation to ensure that physicians and \nhospitals and other providers would receive the money they need \nliterally to stay in business.\n  We have emergency rooms around the country that are closing because \nthey are not being paid. It is going to be necessary for us to provide \nsome supplemental funding to the hospitals and other health care \nproviders literally to continue to provide the benefits we are \npromising through programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. If there are \nnot doctors and hospitals to serve people, we can pass all the laws we \nwant, but it is not going to do people any good. So we are going to \nhave to address this issue, whether it is on this legislation or \nlegislation down the road.\n\n  My colleagues may appreciate that by Federal law, under the Medicare \nProgram, physicians will receive a 17-percent cut over the next 4 years \nin what Medicare pays them to see a Medicare patient. Since private \nplans frequently base their reimbursements on what the Government \nMedicare plan reimburses, the effect is, for virtually all physicians, \nthat they are seeing this kind of drastic cut in what they are \nreimbursed, either by the Government--which provides about 50 percent \nof the health care--or by the private plans, which provide the \nremainder.\n  According to a March 12, 2002, New York Times story, 17 percent of \nfamily doctors are not taking new Medicare patients because of this \nproblem. They are simply not getting paid enough to cover their \noverhead costs.\n  Last year, Senators Jeffords and Breaux and I introduced legislation \nthat would have partially fixed this problem. This legislation now has \n80 cosponsors in the Senate. That means virtually everybody in the \nSenate has said we need to adopt this legislation. It would help to fix \nthis problem of declining reimbursements for providers.\n  Additionally, Home health care agencies will be taking a 15-percent \nreduction in payments starting October 1, skilled nursing facilities \nwill experience a 17-percent cut in some of their Medicare rates, and \nthese are just a few of the examples of payment reductions. So we are \nnot going to be able to provide quality care under Medicare if we are \nnot able to sustain the experts who are providing that care today.\n  I am looking forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that \nthrough the reimbursements we will add, whether in this legislation or\n\n[[Page S7099]]\n\nsome other legislation this year, we will be able to provide that \nsupplemental help to them until we are able to straighten out the \npayment formulas under which Congress reimburses the hospitals and \nother providers that are providing care called for by Medicare.\n  Let me summarize the point about the difference between the two \nprescription drug proposals and how we are likely to pass a drug bill \nthat will actually be signed into law. If we had been able to pass a \nbill out of the Finance Committee, we would only have to have a bare \nmajority--51 votes. The tripartisan bill has support on both sides of \nthe aisle, Democrat and Republican as well as Senator Jeffords, another \ncosponsor, to be able to pass. We could actually get together with the \nHouse of Representatives, make the changes, the compromises between the \nHouse bill that has already been passed and this bill, and get it to \nthe President for his signature, and by the beginning of the fiscal \nyear we could actually be implementing a new drug for our seniors that \nthey do not currently have.\n  But because that does not fit in with the plans of the majority \nleader, we are now in a situation where any bill that is brought here \nis going to have to have 60 votes to pass. Because of the realities of \nthe political environment in which we operate, it is unfortunately the \ncase that it is going to be very difficult to get 60 votes for any \nplan.\n  The one that has the best chance is the tripartisan plan that I \nalluded to earlier. It is not the bill I would have written, but I am \nwilling to support it because it is a good proposal that has the best \nchance we have to actually get something passed and deliver a real \nbenefit to our seniors. We will have time to work the issues in the \nconference committee. We will have time to continue to modify the \nlegislation after it is passed and signed into law. But we have to act, \nand every year we do not act is a year in which more and more seniors \nare denied the benefit that they need, that their physicians are \nprescribing for them and, unfortunately, many of them cannot afford.\n  It seems to me we should put ideologies and politics aside and try to \ndo something good for the seniors of our country and lay those \ndifferences aside to the extent that we can actually pass a bill. It is \na good bill. It is a very good bill in terms of providing the benefits. \nIt is costly, but with the reforms in Medicare that are included within \nit, I think over time we will be able to afford these costs. After all, \nit is a commitment that we should be satisfying for our seniors.\n  I urge my colleagues, when the time comes early next week, to lay \naside partisan differences, to support the tripartisan bill, the only \nbill that has a chance of succeeding here, and move on with the \npolitical process so we can work with the House of Representatives, \npass it on to the President, who I am quite sure will sign it, and \nbegin providing a prescription drug benefit to our seniors.\n  Going all the way back to when Medicare was created, we treated \npeople differently. Today we know medications are the primary method of \ntreatment. We have to recognize that here in the Senate, something that \nall seniors understand very well. Let's recognize the reality, let's \nprovide this drug benefit and really keep faith with the seniors we \nrepresent.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/19/senate-section/article/S7099-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7099-S7100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, in all the rhetoric and grandstanding \nabout who has the best prescription drug plan, I truly do not want us \nto forget who we are trying to help.\n  I cannot possibly forget the 436,000 Medicare beneficiaries in \nArkansas who struggle every single day to pay for the prescription \ndrugs to control blood pressure, their heart, and help them cope with \nchronic diseases.\n  Yes, some seniors are eligible for Medicaid. Some have Medigap. But \nmost of them fall through the cracks. In Arkansas, we don't have the \ntools that other States might have to help our seniors pay for their \nprescription drugs. Medicare+Choice has left our State. Medigap plans \ncost a lot more than the national average--almost 20 percent higher, to \nbe exact, a year.\n  Employer-sponsored retiree health plans are extremely rare. On top of \nthat, 60 percent of our seniors live in rural areas. So how do our \nseniors afford their prescription drugs, which rise in cost absolutely \nevery year? The sad fact is, they don't.\n  The best way to combat this problem is add a prescription drug \nbenefit to the Medicare Program. That is why I am so disappointed that \nneither of the Medicare prescription drug plans we will consider this \nnext week seem to have the 60 votes they need to pass.\n  I am disappointed we are at a standstill in the Senate, and I am \ndisappointed we have been unable to forge a compromise in the Senate \nFinance Committee. As a member of that committee, I would prefer to be \ndebating these plans in that committee. However, I understand that the \nurgency of the issue and the timing of the Senate schedule has brought \nus here today.\n  In years past, I have been a cosponsor of Senator Bob Graham's \nMedicare prescription drug bill. My colleague from Florida has invested \na tremendous amount of time and effort in designing a benefit that \nsenior citizens desire. And he has done well. My constituents have told \nme how much they like the benefit package and the extra assistance for \nlow-income beneficiaries. They like that the premium will be guaranteed \nat $25 a month and will not vary State by State or region by region. \nThis is good because in States such as Arkansas, we usually--almost \nalways--get the short end of the stick when that happens. They like \nthat the benefit is stable and universal and that it does not have a \ngap in coverage and is straightforward and simple.\n\n  Although I favor this plan, I did not cosponsor the bill this year in \nthe hopes that I could help my colleagues on the Finance Committee \nforge a compromise that would work for seniors and that would have \nenough votes to pass the Senate. Unfortunately, that effort seems to \nhave failed. I commend my chairman, Senator Baucus, for his efforts to \ntry to shape a compromise between these two competing plans that we \nhave before us today.\n  I also thank my friend from Louisiana, Senator John Breaux. Senator \nBreaux, through serving on the National Bipartisan Commission on the \nFuture of Medicare in 1997 and shaping the debate in Congress, has \nplayed a leading role in the national effort to improve the Medicare \nProgram.\n  I appreciate the many meetings we have had on this issue and hope we \nhave the ability to continue to work in that bipartisan fashion, \nworking to forge compromises as we move forward on the Senate floor, as \nwell as in conference.\n  I also want to recognize the tremendous amount of staff work that has \nbeen done, particularly and especially by my staff, Elizabeth \nMacDonald, all of the staff on the Finance Committee, as well as the \nMembers who have had plans.\n  However, despite the changes Senator Breaux, Senator Grassley, and \nothers have made to the tripartisan bill, I believe the bill still \nfails to offer an acceptable model to deliver prescription drugs to \nseniors in rural States such as Arkansas.\n  I cannot in good conscience vote for a plan that relies on the \nuntried, untested delivery system laid out in the tripartisan plan. The \nprivate insurer model will require significant taxpayer subsidies to \nattract insurers into a drug-only insurance market, something we have \nnever tried before. The insurance companies have told me they are \nhesitant to assume the risk for this type of plan unless they are \nheavily subsidized, and I do not think this is a proper use of our \ntaxpayers' dollars. Nor can I support a plan that does not entitle \nseniors to any particular drug benefit but, rather, only a suggested \nbenefit.\n  Consider for a moment the story of Mrs. Mildred Owens of Havana, AR. \nMildred is 70 years old, and she worked for 35 years before retiring 5 \nyears ago. Now widowed, Mildred receives about $830 a month in Social \nSecurity and about $125 a month in retirement.\n\n[[Page S7100]]\n\n  Mildred takes prescription drugs which cost about $200 a month. After \npaying her Medicare premium and drug expenses, she has spent well over \n27 percent of her income. She said that she and her two sisters, Evalee \nand Betty, who each make about $600 a month, do not even go to the \ndoctor anymore because they cannot even afford the prescription drugs \nthe doctor would prescribe. Sometimes Mildred and her sisters must rely \non their children to help pay for some of their medications.\n  If the tripartisan plan were law and if Mildred and her sisters asked \nme what their monthly premium was going to be and what their benefits \nwould be for prescription drug coverage under Medicare, I would have to \nsay to them, actually, I do not know; I cannot give you a specific; we \nwill have to wait and see what actually happens in our area. Mildred \nmay, in fact, end up paying a different premium for prescription drugs \nthan her friends pay in California or Florida or New York or \nother States. Yet they both paid taxes into Medicare all of their lives \nand therefore should be entitled to the same Medicare benefit.\n\n  The point is, we do not know yet what private plans might offer in \ndifferent regions of the country. We do not know what their benefits \nwould be. We do not know if private plans would want to participate. We \ndo not know how much they would charge for it. And there is absolutely \nno guarantee that seniors would be able to depend on the same plan or \nbenefit structure from year to year. These are just too many unknowns, \nand for seniors, nothing is more frightening than the unknown.\n  Why do we want to force our parents and grandparents into an untested \ndelivery system that is unlike any other system in American health care \nas we know it?\n  Why should seniors in rural Arkansas, who are older and sicker and \nmore likely to use prescription drugs, be in the dark about what their \npremiums will be until the Federal Government entices the private \ninsurers to compete in their area of the country?\n  Why should we risk forcing them to pay higher premiums than those in \nurban areas?\n  Show me where it has worked. I ask my colleagues: Show me a study, \nshow me a demonstration project. If the sponsors of the tripartisan \nplan are so confident that their delivery model will work, then I \npropose a compromise that could garner the 60 votes needed to pass a \nMedicare prescription drug plan.\n  Let's put a demonstration project in the home State of the bill's \nchief architects and use the Graham delivery model in Arkansas and the \nrest of the country so that we can be assured of what we are going to \nget until we know what works. Let's see if this untested delivery model \nworks in a few States before we take it nationwide and put everyone at \nrisk.\n  Why subject our seniors to a vast social experiment? Why should we \nsubsidize private insurance companies when we should instead empower \nour seniors with the ability to afford the prescription drugs they \nneed?\n  I am also concerned that the tripartisan bill has a gap in coverage, \nalbeit a much smaller one than originally proposed. How can I tell \nseniors in my State that they will not receive any coverage for their \ndrug costs between $3,451 and $5,300?\n  Although the tripartisan plan says it only contains a gap of $250, in \nreality it is actually a gap of $1,850 because the first threshold \nincludes the combined expenditures of seniors and the Government, while \nthe second only refers to the senior's out-of-pocket expenses.\n  How can I explain to Mildred Owens that no other American but \nMedicare beneficiaries will have this gap in coverage? Members of \nCongress and Federal employees do not face a gap in prescription drug \ncoverage, nor do non-Federal retirees or employees. This gap in \ncoverage for seniors who use more prescription drugs than any other \npopulation group in our country is not only unfair, it is simply \nunreasonable.\n  Further, this gap in coverage is opposed by the AARP, which counts \nabout 350,000 Arkansans in their nationwide membership. AARP has \nsurveyed their membership on the value of a prescription drug benefit \nand has identified five characteristics that any prescription drug \nbenefit must include in order to attract the enrollees it needs. One of \nthose characteristics is a benefit that does not expose beneficiaries \nto a gap in insurance coverage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print a letter from the \nArkansas AARP State chapter in the Record that shows how the \ntripartisan bill fails to meet the kitchen-table test that their \nMembers will likely use when determining if the drug benefit is a good \nbuy.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                         AARP,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 12, 2002.\n     Hon. Blanche L. Lincoln,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lincoln: Medicare beneficiaries cannot wait \n     any longer for protection against the increasing cost of \n     prescription drugs. The 439,000 Medicare beneficiaries in \n     Arkansas need an affordable prescription drug benefit enacted \n     into law this year.\n       Currently, about 13 million Medicare beneficiaries \n     nationwide lack prescription drug coverage for the entire \n     year and about 16 million lack coverage for some point during \n     the year. State pharmacy assistance programs often provide \n     some prescription drug benefits to low to moderate-income \n     beneficiaries. However, as you know, Arkansas does not even \n     have such a program to help meet the needs of low-income \n     beneficiaries in the state.\n       The prescription drug legislation recently passed by the \n     House of Representatives begins to move the Medicare program \n     one step closer to providing millions of older Americans and \n     people with disabilities with some help against the rising \n     costs of prescription drugs. But more needs to be done.\n       We know from our membership that they will assess the value \n     of a prescription drug benefit by adding up the premium, \n     coinsurance and deductible to determine if it is a good buy. \n     We believe that in order for a voluntary Medicare \n     prescription drug benefit to pass this ``kitchen table test'' \n     and attract enough enrollee it should:\n       Provide an affordable benefit as a permanent part of \n     Medicare's benefit package;\n       Keep the monthly premium to no more than $35;\n       Ensure reasonable and stable cost-sharing for \n     beneficiaries;\n       Ensure that there are no gaps in coverage that leave \n     beneficiaries vulnerable;\n       Be voluntary and available to all beneficiaries no matter \n     where they live;\n       Help to bring down the soaring costs of prescription drugs; \n     and\n       Protect low-income beneficiaries.\n       It is critical that the Senate pass a Medicare prescription \n     drug bill this month that meets these goals. The 205,000 AARP \n     households in Arkansas are counting on your support for a \n     prescription drug benefit at least as good as the Graham-\n     Miller proposal.\n       If you have any questions please call one of us or have \n     your staff call David Certner, Director of our Federal \n     Affairs Department, at (202) 434-3750.\n           Sincerely,\n     William D. Novelli,\n       Executive Director and CEO.\n     Cecil Malone,\n       AARP Arkansas State President.\n     Maria Reynolds-Diaz,\n       AARP Arkansas State Director.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am also hopeful that a compromise on \nthe Medicare prescription drug benefit is imminent. I am ever \noptimistic that we can all agree on a good basic solution at the end of \nthe day. We must not fall into the trap of all talk and no action once \nagain. For the almost 4 years I have served in the Senate, I have \ncontinually gone home to my State of Arkansas, talked to seniors across \nour great State, and assured them that the Senate would act on a \nprescription drug package.\n  I can no longer in good faith continue to simply talk about the \nbenefit that is so needed. Our parents and our grandparents are \ndepending on us. It would be a national tragedy to let them all down.\n  We have talked and talked about it for years. Let us act this year \nand in this session. Let us not adjourn until we pass a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit that is meaningful and affordable for all \nseniors across this great country, no matter where they live.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/19/senate-section/article/S7100-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7100-S7101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ESTONIAN AMERICAN NATIONAL COUNCIL\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the 50th \nanniversary of the Estonian American National Council. On July 19, \n1952, Estonian Americans founded this Council to preserve\n\n[[Page S7101]]\n\nthe Estonian cultural heritage. For 50 years, it has provided an \nindependent voice for the Estonian people in their successful campaign \nfor human rights and democracy in their homeland.\n  The Estonian American National Council combined the strong spirits of \nAmerica and Estonia in its fight for Estonian independence. Forcibly \nannexed and occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940, Estonians could not \nspeak freely for themselves in their own homeland. But as the leader of \nthe free world, the United States never recognized the Soviet Union's \noppressive regimes in Estonia or its Baltic neighbors, Latvia, and \nLithuania. So with the start of the cold war, Americans of Estonian \ndescent established their own organization.\n  Half a century later, I visited Estonia. I was so happy to see the \ntremendous strides the country was making toward developing its \ndemocratic and market-based systems. Estonia is proving its abilities \nthrough high-tech initiatives in everything from cellular phones to \npaperless government. I also appreciate the Baltic States' renewed \nsenses of culture while respecting the rights of Russian-speaking \nminorities.\n  As a founding member of the Senate Baltic Freedom Caucus, I applaud \nthe work of the Estonian American National Council, a critical member \nof the Joint Baltic American National Committee. Together, America, \nEstonia and the other Baltic States are doing all they can in the war \nagainst terrorism. With America's support, Estonia, Lithuania, and \nLatvia are already contributing to our mutual security by developing \nmodern armed forces, air surveillance systems, and participating in \npeacekeeping activities. I believe Estonia and its Baltic partners will \nmake a wonderful contribution to NATO.\n  Since Estonia achieved independence in 1991, the Estonian American \nNational Council has been instrumental in bringing America and Estonia \ntogether to make both countries more secure. The council has funded \nscholarships, schools, cultural activities, youth programs and exchange \nmissions that have enhanced the ties that it began to build between \nAmerica and Estonia many years ago. I am proud of the partnerships \nMaryland had built with Estonia through our National Guard and their \nArmed Forces, and the trade between our great cities and ports.\n  Everywhere I look, America's interest in strengthening its ties with \nEstonia and the other Baltic States is growing. I congratulate the \ncouncil on its 50th anniversary, and I send my best wishes to the \nEstonia American community in Maryland and nationwide. You can count on \nme to continue to help promote a closer and more comprehensive \nrelationship between the United States and Estonia. I ask my colleagues \nto join me in congratulating the Estonian American National Council on \nits contributions to America and Estonia for the last 50 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/19/senate-section/article/S7101-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak \nabout hate crimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in \nMarch of last year. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred September 17, \n1997, in Chicago, IL. Two minors pushed a gay man down a flight of \nstairs because of his sexual orientation. The assailants used anti-gay \nobscenities during the attack.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/19/senate-section/article/S7101-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MEASURES REFERRED\n\n  The following bill was read the first and the second times by \nunanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n       H.R. 5118.

A bill to direct the Securities and Exchange Commission to \nconduct a study and make recommendations regarding the accounting \ntreatment of stock options for purposes of the Federal securities laws; \nto the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Enzi-\nLieberman-Allen-Boxer amendment on stock options. Our bipartisan \namendment helps solve many of the perceived problems with the issuance \nof stock options by giving the SEC a broad mandate to look into and \nanalyze numerous issues concerning stock options, including disclosure, \ncorporate governance, and the benefits and detriments of expensing \nstock options.\n  After its analysis, the SEC will be required to furnish \nrecommendations, if any, for changes in corporate America's uses of \nstock options, and we envision that being done through FASB. We are not \ntrying to tell FASB, the Federal Accounting Standards Board, how to do \ntheir work; we are trying to provide them with more information so they \ncan make a consideration of that issue again.\n  I and the other original cosponsors of this bill have sent a letter \nto Chairman Harvey Pitt and the other Commissioners on the SEC asking \nthem to initiate on their own the action items outlined in our bill and \nto make recommendations on these issues in the next 60 days. I hope \nthey take such initiative.\n  Mr. President, I ask unaimous consent the letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 19, 2002.\n     Hon. Harvey L. Pitt, Chairman,\n     Hon. Isaac C. Hunt, Jr., Commissioner,\n     Hon. Cynthia A. Glassman, Commissioner,\n     Mr. Robert K. Herdman, Chief Accountant,\n     Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Pitt, Commissioners Hunt and Glassman, and \n     Mr. Herdman: We are writing to request that the Securities \n     and Exchange Commission (SEC) analyze and propose \n     recommendations, if needed, on issues regarding stock \n     options. We have introduced legislation mandating such action \n     by the Commission, but ask that you proceed before this \n     legislation is enacted.\n       The legislation is the Stock Option Fairness and \n     Accountability Act. This legislation focuses on key issues \n     regarding stock options, which include stock option pricing \n     models; disclosure to investors and shareholders; shareholder \n     approval of stock option plans; and restrictions on senior \n     management sale of stock. The bill also mandates a review of \n     the benefits and detriments of any new options expensing \n     rules on the productivity and performance of companies and \n     start-up enterprises, the recruitment retention of skilled \n     workers, and employees at various income levels, with \n     particular focus\n\n[[Page S7105]]\n\n     on the effect on rank-and-file employees and the income of \n     women.\n       It is our view the debate on stock options has focused \n     narrowly on the accounting of stock options, and failed to \n     focus on other critical stock option policy issues. We seek \n     to broaden the debate to ensure that Congress, the \n     Commission, and other relevant agencies take action to \n     eliminate any problems which might exist with stock options, \n     while ensuring their benefits are retained.\n       We believe options should be preserved and protected \n     because, when they are properly structured, they are \n     incentives for productivity and growth. In most instances, \n     they reflect America's best business values--the willingness \n     to take business risks, the vision to develop new \n     entrepreneurial companies and technologies, a way to broaden \n     ownership and participation among employees, and a strong \n     performance incentive for both management and employees. We \n     should focus on strengthening stock option incentives and \n     enabling them to yield even greater economic growth dividends \n     for our economy.\n       In general, we believe the Senate should not be legislating \n     detailed accounting or regulatory standards regarding stock \n     options or other accounting issues. These are issues best \n     left to the SEC and its expert staff. The Financial \n     Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has independent authority \n     to set accounting standards, and should continue to do so. \n     That is why our legislation and this letter request that the \n     Commission address all of these issues and make \n     recommendations.\n       Regarding shareholder approval of stock option plans, a \n     Special Committee of New York Stock Exchange recommended \n     shareholder approval of all stock option plans, while the \n     NASDAQ has recommended shareholder approval of any plan that \n     includes officers and directors. We want the SEC to examine \n     whether these measures are adequate, and whether any \n     additional accountability to shareholders is needed.\n       Current disclosure requirements for stock options exist \n     which focus on the potential cost of stock options when they \n     are exercised, the potential dilution of earnings per share, \n     and other issues. We believe the SEC should look at whether \n     these disclosure rules should be strengthened in order to \n     provide investors and shareholders more accurate and complete \n     information.\n       We understand that restricting the sale of stock acquired \n     through stock option plans is a complex and controversial \n     issue. We ask you to review whether a need exists for \n     imposition of a holding period for senior executives and \n     whether the benefits of such a rule would outweigh the costs. \n     Should you recommend such a rule, we suggest you also review \n     whether any exemptions are necessary, given individuals may \n     have a legitimate need to sell stock to raise cash to pay \n     taxes on their options or for personal emergencies. We urge \n     you to also consider whether a holding period might impose a \n     special burden on small companies and start-up enterprises, \n     where stock options form a greater proportion of employee \n     compensation.\n       We appreciate the assistance of the Commission addressing \n     these vital issues and promptly making recommendations. We \n     believe we have presented you with a comprehensive agenda of \n     stock option policy issues, which will ensure positive action \n     is taken to restore investor and shareholder confidence, calm \n     and markets, and prevent perceived problems associated with \n     stock options. We look forward to receiving a response with \n     your recommendations and plan for action within 60 days.\n           Sincerely,\n         Senator Mike Enzi, Senator Joseph Lieberman, Senator \n           Barbara Boxer, Senator Conrad Burns, Senator John \n           Ensign, Senator George Allen, Senator Bill Frist.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. How did we get here, to this point of perhaps possibly \nlegislating on stock options? The debate on stock options became heated \nover the last few months, following the accounting debacles of Enron, \nWorldCom, and Global Crossing. I think we can all agree that the use of \nstock options did not cause the demise of these companies, but \nnevertheless their use by these and other companies has become \nincreasingly scrutinized during the current accounting debate and \nevidence of top exeuctive abuse.\n  What initially raised everyone's attention to stock options was \nEnron. As we all know, Enron's executives and employees were issued \nnumerous stock options. It is now clear that months before Enron filed \nfor bankruptcy, executives who were aware of the true condition of the \ncompany, exercised millions of dollars of their options. Now, Enron \nemployees--kept in the dark on company finances--are left with \nworthless Enron stock and retirement savings. While these Enron \nexecutives absconded with money from the sell of stock options, we all \nknow the financial collapse of Enron had little to do with its \naccounting procedures on stock options. Enron went bankrupt. \nNevertheless, concerns about stock option use by corporations have \nbecome magnified.\n  We all know that when properly used, stock options can be a marvelous \nopportunity for all employees. In addition, small businesses and \nstartup companies use stock options as an incentive and sometimes the \nonly means to attract qualified employees.\n  There have been many suggestions on what will stop future Enrons, and \nincluded in that debate has been a discussion on improving the \naccounting practices and other issues concerning stock options. Some \nmembers have come up with some creative and not so creative ideas on \nhow to improve their use.\n  Some have not considered how their ideas will affect rank-and-file \nemployees, while others have kept that as their primary consideration. \nSome members have proposed setting a new expensing standard or \ndirecting the Federal Accounting Standards Board to take some specific \naction in setting new expensing rules. But, these amendments have pre-\nordained what the solution to stock options will be.\n  Members promoting these amendments are furnishing their own \nconclusions. They mandate either codification of new expensing rules, \nor direct the Federal Accounting Standards Board, known as FASB, to \nrequire stock option expensing at the time of grant or exercise. This \nis a conclusion some of us do not believe should be made by non-experts \nin Congress, without careful analysis.\n  Our bipartisan amendment is different. It doesn't preordain what the \nsolution to stock options will be. Instead, it directs the SEC to \nanalyze the treatment of stock options in several categories, not just \nstock option expensing, and lend its superior expertise in furnishing a \nreport and making useful recommendations.\n  This is a smart amendment because 99 non-accountant Senators, and one \naccountant Senator, all without expertise in securities accounting and \nlaw, have no business making a definitive decision on what the answer \nto stock option problems should be. Instead, the SEC should analyze the \nproblem and make recommendations on what is needed.\n\n  Let me get to the specifics of our amendment. First, it requires an \nanalysis of the accounting treatment of employee stock options, \nincluding the accuracy of available stock option pricing models. What \nare these models?\n  Currently, companies estimate the value of granted stock options \nusing something called the Black-Scholes model. This is because they do \nnot know what the future value of their stock will be when the options \nare actually exercised and sold. So they make an educated guess with \nthe Black-Scholes model.\n  However, many believe the current practice of using the Black-Scholes \nmethod to value stock options, as currently used on footnotes, is \nfatally flawed. This method will be just as flawed if it must be used \nfor expensing stock options at the time of grant. This amendment \ndirects the SEC to look at the accuracy of this and other pricing \nmodels.\n  Second, our amendment directs the SEC to analyze the adequacy of \ncurrent disclosure requirements to investors and shareholders on stock \noptions. The SEC needs to determine whether better disclosure \nprovisions would solve the current, perceived problem with stock option \nreporting. The SEC can study what further disclosure and transparency \nprovisions, if any, would be useful.\n  We do not know what the SEC's recommendations might be. They might \ninclude a recommendation for user-friendly disclosure in clear, plain \nEnglish with graphs and charts, which are comparable with other company \ndisclosures. They might recommend increased quarterly reporting on \ncertain information.\n  Even high profile financial celebrities have differing view on \nexpensing and disclosure. Like me, Secretary O'Neill has advocated \nfuller disclosure as a means to cure the present perceived problems \nwith the information provided to investors and shareholders in \nfootnotes on company financial statements, rather than expensing. \nOthers, like Warren Buffet, have said fuller disclosure and \ntransparency will not cure these problems, and Congress should do \nsomething about expensing. Alan Greenspan believes expensing of stock \noptions at the time of grant is needed, but that Congress should not be \nthe one deciding this or setting accounting standards.\n\n[[Page S7106]]\n\n  Given these differing views by financial heavy weights like Secretary \nO'Neill, Greenspan and Buffett, it makes sense to let the SEC analyze \nthis issue and make the determination of what, if any, disclosure \nimprovements are necessary, taking into account the effect on all \naffected parties--companies, shareholders, investors, and rank-and-file \nemployees.\n  Next, our amendment would direct the SEC to analyze the adequacy of \ncorporate governance requirements on stock options, including the \nusefulness of having shareholders approve stock option plans.\n  Previously, I advocated shareholder approval of stock option issuance \nto top corporate executives to prevent them from abusing stock options. \nNow, I and others of us are leaving it to the SEC to determine whether \nthis will prevent stock option abuse.\n  Our bipartisan amendment also requires an analysis of the need, if \nany, for stock holding period requirements for senior executives. Some \nSenators have advocated a holding period during which top executives \ncannot sell their stock options. One suggestion was that a 90-day \ncooling off period occur before a top executive can sell his stock. \nAnother suggestion was that these executives could not sell their stock \nuntil they left the company and a two-year period expired.\n\n  These suggestions pose a dramatic solution which needs more study by \nthe SEC. These are not provisions to be taken lightly, nor drafted \nhurriedly by Senators. This type of amendment could possibly help \nprevent abuses, or have the opposite effect of chilling the future use \nof stock options entirely. Because I do not know what the effect of \nthis will be and whether it will prevent executive fraud and abuse, I \nam at least willing to let the SEC study it to see if there is any \nmerit to it.\n  And finally, our amendment directs the SEC to look at the benefit and \ndetriment of any new options expensing rules. So, instead of Senators, \nwho have little knowledge of securities accounting, making an \naccounting decision on stock option expensing, we are leaving it in the \nhands of the SEC to see how expensing will affect all segments related \nto stock options.\n  Our bipartisan amendment directs the SEC to look at the benefit and \ndetriment of stock option expensing on companies and start-up \nenterprises. Specifically, it requires the SEC to look at what stock \noptions expensing would do to the productivity and performance of all \nsizes of companies, and start-up enterprises.\n  I am particularly concerned about the effect of expensing stock \noptions on small companies and start-up enterprises. Many small \nbusinesses and start-up companies cannot afford to offer the salaries \nlarger companies give, so they offer stock options as an incentive to \nattract highly-skilled employees. In addition, our amendment would \nrequire the SEC to look at the benefits and detriments of stock option \nexpensing on the recruitment and retention of skilled workers.\n  Currently, employees who risk working for start-up companies have the \nability to make much more money than through traditional methods of \npayment by salaries or wages. Those who stay with the company tend to \nhave a vested interest in the company through the issuance of stock \noptions. Stock options may be the very reason that some employees start \nwith a company and stay with it. We are asking the SEC to look at the \nissue of what effect stock option expensing will have on future \nrecruitment and retention of employees.\n  Finally, and most importantly, our amendment asks the SEC to look at \nthe benefits and detriments of stock options on employees at all income \nlevels, with particular emphasis on rank-and-file employees.\n  These are some of the questions the SEC needs to look at and make a \nrecommendation on.\n  Whatever we do, we need to make sure the cure is not worse than the \ndisease. We should not rush to pass something just for the sake of \nlegislating on stock options. Let us step back and see what \nrecommendations the SEC makes. Then, with cooler heads, perhaps we can \nprevail in getting rules and regulations on stock options which are \ntruly needed, and not merely an overreaction to the current atmosphere \nof Enron.\n  I would hate to see any hastly decision chill the ability of \ncompanies to issue stock options to millions of rank-and-file \nemployees. Or chill new start-up companies' use of stock options to \nattract employees. At the same time, we have to stop future abuses by \ncorporate executives who thumb their noses while plundering companies \nresources.\n  For these reasons, I ask you to vote in favor of the Enzi-Lieberman-\nAllen-Boxer Amendment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 2761. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat reimbursements for costs of using passenger automobiles for \ncharitable and other organizations are excluded from gross income, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer legislation today \nthat will increase the mileage reimbursement rate for volunteers.\n  Under current law, when volunteers use their cars for charitable \npurposes, the volunteers may be reimbursed up to 14 cents per mile for \ntheir donated services without triggering a tax consequence for either \nthe organizations or the volunteers. If the charitable organization \nreimburses any more than that, they are required to file an information \nreturn indicating the amount, and the volunteers must include the \namount over 14 cents per mile in their taxable income. By contrast, the \nmileage reimbursement level currently permitted for businesses is 36.5 \ncents per mile.\n  At a time when government is asking volunteers and volunteer \norganizations to bear a greater burden of delivering essential \nservices, the 14 cents per mile limit is posing a very real hardship.\n  I have heard from a number of groups in Wisconsin in recent weeks on \nthe need to increase this reimbursement limit. One organization, the \nPortage County Department on Aging, explained just how important \nvolunteer drivers are to their ability to provide services to seniors \nin that county. The Department on Aging reported that last year 54 \nvolunteer drivers delivered meals to homes and transported people to \nmedical appointments, meal sites, and other essential services. The \nDepartment noted that their volunteer drivers provided 4,676 rides, and \ndrove nearly 126,000 miles. They also delivered 9,385 home-delivered \nmeals, and nearly two-thirds of the drivers logged more than 100 miles \nper month in providing these needed services. Altogether, volunteers \ndonated over 5,200 hours last year, and as the Department notes, at the \nrate of minimum wage, that amounts to over $27,000, not including other \nbenefits.\n  The senior meals program is one of the most vital services provided \nunder the Older Americans Act, and ensuring that meals can be delivered \nto seniors or that seniors can be taken to meal sites is an essential \npart of that program. Unfortunately, Federal support for the senior \nnutrition programs has stagnated in recent years. This has increased \npressure on local programs to leverage more volunteer services to make \nup for lagging federal support. The 14 cent per mile reimbursement \nlimit, though, increasingly poses a barrier to obtaining those \ncontributions. Portage County reports that the many of their volunteers \ncannot afford to offer their services under such a restriction. And if \nvolunteers cannot be found, their services will have to be replaced by \ncontracting with a provider, greatly increasing costs to the \nDepartment, costs that come directly out of the pot of funds available \nto pay for meals and other services.\n  By contrast, businesses do not face this restrictive mileage \nreimbursement limit. The comparable mileage rate for someone who works \nfor a business is currently 36.5 cents per mile. This disparity means \nthat a business hired to deliver the same meals delivered by volunteers \nfor Portage County may reimburse their employees over double the amount \npermitted the volunteer without a tax consequence.\n  This doesn't make sense.\n  Morever, the 14 cent per mile volunteer reimbursement limit is \noutdated. According to the Congressional Research Service, Congress \nfirst set a reimbursement rate of 12 cents per mile as part of the \nDeficit Reduction Act of 1984, and did not increase it until 1997, when \nthe level was raised slightly, to\n\n[[Page S7107]]\n\n14 cents per mile, as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.\n  The bill I am introducing today raises the limit on volunteer mileage \nreimbursement to the level permitted to businesses. It is essentially \nthe same provision passed by the Senate as part of a tax bill passed in \n1999 that was vetoed by President Clinton. At the time of the 1999 \nmeasure, the Joint Committee on Taxation, JCT, estimated that the \nmileage reimbursement provision would result in the loss of $1 million \nover the five year fiscal period from 1999 to 2004. The revenue loss \nwas so small that the JCT did not make the estimate on a year by year \nbasis.\n  Though the revenue loss is small, I have also included an offset to \nmake the measure deficit neutral by including a provision that would \nimpose a civil penalty of up to $5,000 on failure to report interest in \nforeign financial transactions. That provision was recently included in \nthe CARE Act legislation by the Senate Finance Committee.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

A bill to respond to the illegal production distribution, \nand use of methamphetamines in the United States, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``CLEAN-\nUP Meth Act,'' a bill to address illegal and environmentally disastrous \nmethamphetamine production.\n  I am pleased to submit this bill on behalf of myself, Senator \nHutchinson of Arkansas, and Senator Kohl.\n  Essentially, this bill would help our Federal, State and local \ngovernments combat methamphetamine on a number of levels, from \nproduction to clean-up, prosecution to prevention.\n  The legislation would accomplish this with two key components: First, \nthe bill would allocate $125 million for important training and cleanup \nefforts, including training local law enforcement to effectively clean \nup meth lab and dump sites. And second, we would make it much harder \nfor meth dealers to get the precursor pseudoephedrine products \nnecessary to make this illegal drug.\n  Once predominantly found in the American Southwest, methamphetamine's \npresence now stretches from coast to coast. Once predominantly found in \nrural areas, its harmful effects now extend from our smallest towns to \nour biggest cities.\n  For instance, the number of clandestine meth labs discovered in North \nCarolina has doubled every year for the past four years.\n  In New Orleans, police in the Jefferson district seized a total of \n828 grams of methamphetamine in all of the year 2000. Last year, they \nseized more than ten times that amount, 9,003 grams, with a street \nvalue of more than $1 million.\n  I'm sorry to say that my home State of California has been referred \nto as the ``Colombia of meth production.'' In fact, our State is known \nas the ``source country'' for the drug, producing roughly 80 percent of \nthe Nation's methamphetamine supply. According to the DEA, 1,847 \nclandestine meth labs were found last year in California alone.\n  Each of these 1,847 labs in California, and each of the labs \nscattered around this Nation near schools, on farms, in trailer parks \nand in quiet suburban neighborhoods, creates a whole host of dangers \nand toxic waste.\n  The actual production of methamphetamine is harmful in a number of \nways. First, the hazardous chemicals used in meth production are toxic, \nand long-term exposure is damaging. Furthermore, the materials can also \nbe explosive and dangerous. Production using these volatile materials \nhas resulted in countless accidents, houses and even apartment \nbuildings burned to the ground, explosions that scatter chemicals and \nflames, and chemical reactions that cause untold damage to the \nindividuals involved in meth production or simply living in the same \nhousehold, individuals that, too often, include children.\n  Meth production also poses risks to the health of the surrounding \npublic and environment. According to the National Drug Intelligence \nCenter, NDIC, for every pound of meth produced, five to seven pounds of \nhazardous waste results from the production as well. Meth producers \ndump this waste anywhere and everywhere, from nearby ditches to public \nlands, from pits dug in the middle of a farm to rivers and lakes.\n  One private contractor hired to clean up meth-related hazardous dump \nsites in California responded to more than 500 calls in 2000 alone. And \none of those dump sites was located along the banks of the California \nAqueduct, which is a direct source of water for Los Angeles.\n  NDIC investigators have found also found toxic chemicals discarded \ninto\n\n[[Page S7108]]\n\nhousehold drains and storm drains. And the precursors used to make \nmeth, and the toxic byproducts, may last for years in the soil. \nDecontaminating these sites is what makes clean-up so expensive, with \ncosts ranging from $5,000 to $150,000 per site. State police in \nBaltimore, MD claim that its costs taxpayers nearly $75,000 each time a \nmeth lab must be cleaned up. According to the DEA, that agency spent \nmore than $22 million cleaning up 6,609 labs nationwide.\n  These extraordinary costs simply cannot be maintained on the local \nlevel without Federal support. These costs are proof of why Federal \nfunding for such valuable efforts is necessary.\n  So the first thing this legislation would do is help law enforcement \nas well as the public pay these important costs, by providing millions \nto help clean-up labs and train law enforcement authorities to properly \nand safety do this important work.\n  Specifically, the CLEAN-UP Meth bill would provide: $15 million for \nclean-up and remediation of meth contaminated lands managed by the \nDepartments of Agriculture or Interior; $15 million for Department of \nAgriculture grants to State and local governments and to private \npersons to clean up meth contaminated lands; $20 million for OSHA \ngrants to local law enforcement agencies for training and equipment for \nthe safe identification, handling, clean-up and disposal of meth labs; \nand $10 million for Department of Labor grants to local law enforcement \nagencies to help them comply with Federal laws regarding cleanup and \ndisposal of meth labs.\n  Second, this legislation includes resources to help State and local \nofficials prosecute meth offenses, educate the public, and study the \neffects of meth use.\n  Methamphetamine is so prevalent partly because it is simple to make \nand is profitable. Producers of meth range from people with advanced \nchemistry degrees to those who are self-taught. Recipes are easily \navailable in books as well as over the Internet.\n  The drug does not have to be smuggled in across secured international \nborders. Fifty percent of the Nation's consumed methamphetamine is \nproduced right here in our country. In fact, the basic ingredients can \nbe found in your local pharmacy. These relatively inexpensive materials \ncan be used to create a drug that fetches much higher prices. For \nexample, ounce quantities are worth between $1,500 and $2,000 and can \nbe sold to individual users for about $100 a gram in crystallized \npowder form that can be smoked, snorted, swallowed or turned into \nliquid and injected. According to the Office of National drug Control \nPolicy, ONDCP, methamphetamine users spent nearly $6 billion on the \ndrug in 1999.\n  Methamphetamine is also highly addictive. Known on the street as \ncrank, speed, ice and zip, methamphetamine is cheaper than cocaine, \nmore addictive than crack and causes more brain damage than heroin or \nalcohol. A single dose of this ``poor man's cocaine'' can keep a person \nawake for three to four days at a time and has been associated with \nparanoia and often violence. In California's Central Valley, \nmethamphetamine has become the drug of choice and a principal cause of \ncrime.\n  I firmly believe that law enforcement officials cannot effectively \nfight this drug and its harmful effects unless we provide them with the \nproper resources. Already this year, police in Oklahoma City have \nseized 115 meth labs. Law enforcement officials there have attributed \nthese seizures to the support from Federal grants.\n  Keith Cain, a sheriff in Daviess County, KY also claims that Federal \nfunding has proved to be crucial to the war against meth. According to \nCain, ``Without that money, we would not have been able to be as \nproactive as we've been.''\n  Last year, the federally funded Central Valley High-Intensity Drug \nTrafficking project to restrict the supply of the chemical agents used \nin making the deadly drug was showing impressive results. A team of \nspecialists from local drug units, the California Highway Patrol, DEA \nand FBI averaged one bust a week of the clandestine ``super labs'' that \nhad made the Central Valley the national center for the production of \nmethamphetamine. These triumphs were the direct result of federal \nfunding and proof that allocating Federal resources is imperative to \nprogress.\n  However, since September 11, agents have been removed from the \nproject and transferred to anti-terrorism work. The lack of drug \nenforcement resources has created a strain on the project and threatens \nthe progress it has had combating methamphetamine.\n  It would be a tragedy to California and the country if we lost all of \nthe progress this program and others like it have made in the war on \nmeth simply due to a lack of resources. Programs like this one have \nproven to be effective and need our continued support.\n  Our bill would provide: $20 million for training of State and local \nprosecutors and law enforcement agents for prosecution of meth \noffenses, $5 million of which will be dedicated for rural communities \nand $2 million to reimburse the DEA for existing training programs; $10 \nmillion additional for training at the DEA's Clandestine Laboratory \nTraining Facility in Quantico, VA; $2 million for the Department of \nJustice for the collection, aggregation and dissemination of meth lab \nseizure stats by the El Paso Intelligence Center, EPIC.\n  Third, we address the problems of our children. Raids and seizures of \nclandestine meth labs have been instrumental to the war on meth and \nhave uncovered a number of alarming issues, but none more troubling \nthan the effect meth production has on the children of meth dealers and \ntheir friends.\n  Drug rings and meth trafficking organizations found throughout the \nAmerican West have been linked to Mexican drug traffickers as well as \nwhite supremacist groups. Last year, for instance, law enforcement \nauthorities in Los Angeles County uncovered a sophisticated meth \ntrafficking ring that includes suspects with tattoos of Nazi swastikas \nand belong to a local gang called the ``Untouchables.'' During police \nraids of their meth labs and headquarters, agents seized nearly \n$500,000 in cash and more than 100 high-powered weapons, including \nassault rifles and a grenade launcher.\n  Earlier this year, Central Valley investigators raided a \nmethamphetamine super-lab in a farmhouse on the outskirts on Merced, \nCA. Inside, investigators found vats of toxic chemicals, large supplies \nof pseudoephedrine used in producing meth and three illegal firearms.\n  Yet, the most disturbing part of this story is that while the \nmanufacturers were engaged in the potentially explosive process of \nextracting pure methamphetamine, four small children watched television \nin the next room. The children were taken to a local hospital and \ntested positive for methamphetamine contamination.\n  I would like to say that this is a rare case. However, this story is \nno exception. In 2001, 1,989 children were found in clandestine meth \nlabs, materials storage sites and dump sites across the country.\n  The CLEAN-UP Meth Act would provide $2.5 million for grants to states \nfor treatment of children suffering adverse health impacts from meth-\nrelated exposure.\n  The bill also includes $20 million for the development of anti-\nmethamphetamine education programs in our nation's schools. Informing \nand educating our children on the dangers of this drug is the first \nstep in reducing the number of new users of methamphetamine.\n  In addition to the funding provisions of the bill, which were \nintroduced by Representative Ose in the House, this legislation also \ncontains language to close the ``Blister Pack Loophole'' in current \nlaw, which currently allows meth dealers to purchase unlimited \nquantities of pseudoephedrine products, generally cold and sinus \nmedication, as long as it is packaged in blister packs, those tin foil \nand plastic packages most of us buy these days, which require that each \npill be separate rather than simply poured into a bottle.\n  Our current law limits retail sales of bottled pseudoephedrine to \njust 9 grams, because we found several years ago that meth dealers \nwould go into a pharmacy, a Costco or other large store, sweep the \nshelves clean of cold medicine, bring the bottles back to the lab, cut \noff the tops of the bottles without even bothering to unscrew the caps \ninstead, and pour the pills out as the first step to making meth.\n  When we passed the 9 gram threshold, and before that the 24-gram\n\n[[Page S7109]]\n\nthreshold, for bottled pills, I made the case that if limits were \nplaced on bottles only, meth dealers would simply start buying blister-\npacked pills instead. At the time, some argued that blister packs were \nsimply too unwieldy for meth manufacturers to bother with, the process \nof popping individual pills out of each blister would be too time \nconsuming. But we had evidence from California that dealers were \nalready using these blister packs, so as a compromise we asked the DEA \nto conduct a nationwide study of whether blister packs posed a problem. \nWell, guess what, they do.\n  According to the report we requested from the DEA, which was \nfinalized late last year, blister packaged pseudoephedrine products \nseized at clandestine methamphetamine laboratories and other locations, \nsuch as dumpsites, have involved seizures of over a million tablets. \nThe seizure of so many blister packaged pseudoephedrine products shows \nconvincingly that blister packaging is not a deterrent to ordinary, \nover-the-counter pseudoephedrine use in clandestine methamphetamine \nlaboratories.\n  Indeed, the report even includes information about automated machines \nwhose sole purpose is to remove pills from blister packs on a massive \nscale. These machines have been found in meth labs, along with \nhundreds, even thousands, of empty blister packs.\n  So clearly, what we argued in 1999, and in 1996, is true. Meth \nmanufacturers are using blister packs, and something must be done to \nstop them as best we can.\n  In order to address this problem, DEA recommended in the report it \nreleased late last year that the blister pack loophole be closed, and \nthat the current retail sales limit of 9 grams for bottled \npseudoephedrine be extended to blister packed products as well. And \nthat is what this bill would do.\n  The meth problem is not just a California problem, or a New York \nproblem, or even an Iowa problem. The meth problem is a national \nproblem, with tragic consequences across this great country. Without a \ncontinuing, nationwide, relentless effort on the part of the Federal \nGovernment, this problem will continue to grow and to infect our \nchildren and our communities with the scourge of methamphetamine \nproduction and use.\n  I believe DEA Director Hutchinson put it best this spring when he \nargued in support of Federal efforts to crack down on meth. ``It \nclearly impacts every one of our districts, every segment of our \nsociety and every age group.''\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and join the latest \nstep towards progress in our war against methamphetamine.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the CLEAN-UP Meth Act \nof 2002. I am pleased to join my fellow cosponsors, Senators Feinstein \nand Hutchinson in introducing this legislation.\n  Methamphetamine is a plague in Wisconsin that affects not only the \npeople who purchase and use it, their families and friends, but also \nthe law enforcement officials who are involved in cleaning up the \nabandoned meth laboratories. These home grown meth labs inflict \nsignificant damage to the environment unlike other illicit drugs. The \nlabs contaminate the environment and threaten those who discover and \nbreak down the labs, are exposed to t4he precursor chemicals and clean \nup the polluted environment.\n  The meth scourge is growing every day. In 1998, Wisconsin State \nauthorities seized only two methamphetamine labs. By 2001, that number \nhad increased to 52 and shows no signs of abating. Its appearance in \nthe last few years in the western part of Wisconsin, trafficked from \nMinnesota and Iowa, has created a dramatic new problem for law \nenforcement. And, production in the State has grown dramatically in the \nlast four years.\n  The amount of methamphetamine produced in Wisconsin is also growing \nby leaps and bounds. In 1999, State drug task forces seized 1.6 \nkilograms of methamphetamine. In 2000, the number increased to 2.5 \nkilograms. Finally, in 2001, the amount of methamphetamine seized in \nWisconsin skyrocketed to 20.9 kilograms, an increase of 13 fold in only \ntwo years.\n  The existence of a significant and growing meth problem comes as no \nsurprise to us. In fact, with the assistance of Wisconsin's Department \nof Narcotics Enforcement, we have attempted to fight the spread of meth \nfor the past several years. We have augmented DEA's representation in \nWisconsin, specifically adding new agents in the western part of the \nstate to work in conjunction with state drug officials. We have secured \nDEA mobile drug teams to traverse the northwestern part of the State \nwhere much of the meth can be found. We have also secured millions of \ndollars in the appropriations process to aid in prevention and clean up \nefforts in western Wisconsin.\n  Unfortunately, this has not stemmed the spread of meth. We fear to \nconsider how much worse the problem would be if it were not for the \nefforts of our state and local law enforcement officials.\n  We must do more. The legislation we introduced today is another \nweapon in the battle against the spread of meth. The bill authorizes \nmore funding for the education, prevention and clean up of \nmethamphetamine.\n  Educating more people about the dangers of meth and assisting in safe \nenvironmental cleanup are important, long-term approaches to the meth \nproblem. There is, however, something that can be done immediately to \nmake it more difficult for meth producers to manufacture the drugs.\n  We need to make it more difficult for meth producers to get access to \nthe precursor chemicals they use to produce methamphetamine. That means \nclosing a loophole in the law that currently makes it too easy for meth \nproducers to get pseudophedrine. Pseudophedrine is the central \ningredient in both methamphetamine and most major cold medicines sold \nover the counter.\n  To combat the sale of pseudophedrine to meth producers, Congress \npassed the Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996. This \nlimited the amount of pseudophedrine or ephedrine that any one person \ncould purchase at one time. Yet, Congress did not proscribe the \npurchase of pseudophedrine in so-called ``blister packs.'' The \npharmaceutical industry argued that it is sufficiently difficult to \nremove each pill from a blister pack, that the sale of pseudophedrine \nin that form need not be limited. Only the sale of pseodphedrine in \nbottles where it would be easy for meth producers to access large \nquantities needed to be restricted.\n  As it turns out, the meth producers adapted their behavior to take \nadvantage of the loophole in the law by finding a way to make the \nblister packaged pseudophedrine economical to purchase. They did so \nwith the advent of presses that simply punctured all of the blister \npacks--therefore removing the type of packaging as an impediment to \ntheir access to the pseudophedrine.\n  The DEA conducted a study on the use of blister packs and found that \namong the refuse left at meth labs are more and more blister packs. \nThis demonstrates, in the DEA's view, that the blister pack loophole \nneeds to be closed. We agree with their recommendation and therefore \nrecommend limiting the amount of pseudophedrine that can be purchased \nby any one person at any one time.\n  Closing this loophole in the law governing the manufacture of meth is \none more weapon in the battle against the drug. Combined with \neducation, prevention and greater resources for law enforcement \nthroughout Wisconsin, we can stem the tide of this scourge before it \ndoes even more damage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MILLER:\n  S. 2764.
