Madam President, I thank the Judiciary Committee for \nrecognizing the needs of Florida and favorably reporting the nomination \nof Mr. Jose Martinez.\n  Jose Martinez's long and impressive legal career makes him an \noutstanding candidate. Beginning as counsel and now partner at Martinez \n& Gutierrez, Mr. Martinez has been associated with the firm since 1991. \nJose Martinez has served as Assistant United States Attorney in the \nSouthern District of Florida, and Legal Officer for the United States \nNavy, Judge Advocate General Corps. He took a two-year leave from his \nfirm to become the Regional Director for the Office for Drug Abuse Law \nEnforcement of the United States Department of Justice.\n  Mr. Martinez received his undergraduate and law degrees from the \nUniversity of Miami. He was the President of the highest honorary on \ncampus, the Iron Arrow. His involvement with Student Government ranged \nfrom working in the Student Activities Office to becoming the treasurer \nof the School of Business.\n  Currently, Mr. Martinez is the vice chairman of the Federal Court \nPractice Committee of the Florida Bar. He is also a member of the \nAmerican Bar Association, the Federal Bar Association, the Cuban \nAmerican Bar Association, and the Hispanic National Bar Association.\n  In summary, Mr. Martinez is a highly regarded and qualified candidate \nfor the federal bench.\n  I appreciate the Senate's consideration of Judge Martinez's \nnomination and appreciate the Senate's recent confirmation of Kenneth \nMarra and Timothy Corrigan, who will serve in Florida's Southern and \nMiddle Districts, two of the largest and busiest judicial districts in \nthe country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/13/senate-section/article/S8583-6", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\nThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, first of all, let me say, I know under the \nexisting order of the unanimous consent request agreed to yesterday \nbetween the leaders--let me make a parliamentary inquiry. As I \nunderstand it, there is a vote to occur at 10:15; is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DODD. On or in relation to the Dodd amendment?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, let me say, first of all, for the benefit \nof my colleagues, I know our staffs, right now, are working to see if \nit is possible to come to some compromise on the amendment that I \nproposed along with my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman. \nMy hope is that we might be able to do that.\n  I thank Senator Inouye and Senator Campbell and their staffs and my \nstaff. They began to work last evening, talking about this matter. \nThere was some discussion about possibly delaying this vote, but the \nleadership wanted to go forward with a vote this morning, and so we are \ngoing to try to work this out, if we can. That would be my fervent goal \nand desire.\n  Let me state, again, why they are talking and working here. It was \nnot my hope or desire to have to get involved in all of this, but each \nof us represents our respective State. And my State has been undergoing \nsome additional pressures. There are some nine applications pending for \ndesignation for recognition.\n  I have been--and still am--a strong supporter of the Native American \ncommunity. I have a strong relationship with the two tribes in my State \nthat have added tremendously to the economic well-being of my home \nState of Connecticut.\n  What provoked this response among the constituents in my State, and \nprovoked the approach that Senator Lieberman and I are taking, is that \nover a year ago we submitted a piece of legislation calling for a \nmoratorium, a delay on the designation process, so that we could bring \nsome rationality to the recognition process of the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs; it seemed to be out of control.\n  In fact, the previous Assistant Secretary at the BIA, on his \ndeparture, cited the significant problems that existed within the \nBureau of Indian Affairs in terms of its recognition process.\n  What happened in my State most recently was that two tribes sought \nrecognition, and the BIA rejected both tribes and came up with a third \napproval that had never been sought, despite the fact that the two \ntribes had been in opposition to each other during the recognition \nprocess. Needless to say, my constituents believed they did not have an \nopportunity to be heard and don't understand how it is that when a \nrecognition is being sought, all of a sudden a third alternative \nemerges that was never on the table.\n  There is a concern that the Bureau of Indian Affairs is sort of out \nof control; that if this is the way things are going to proceed, we \nneed to put a hold on here to figure out how it will work so people \nhave an opportunity to respond.\n  There are 200 designation applications pending in 37 different \nStates. What I am talking about in my State, which is smaller than \nYellowstone National Park--I said to my colleague from Montana \nyesterday, I think there are ranches in Montana that are probably \nlarger than the State of Connecticut. So you can imagine, with nine \napplications pending in a State that is 100 miles by 40 or 50 miles, \nwith an impact on 3\\1/2\\ million people, this is not insignificant.\n\n  I sat here and voted for drought relief legislation. I voted for \nassistance to farmers in the Midwest. When there are hurricanes and \nfires, even though my State is not affected, I stand up and support \nthose efforts because I respect the needs of various States.\n  My State is now facing some real problems on this issue. And I am not \nasking to stop a process. I am not anti-Native American at all. My \nrecord is replete with indications of how strongly I feel about Native \nAmericans. But I have an obligation to stand and speak for my \nconstituency. And they are feeling threatened when they are not allowed \nto be heard. When they cannot participate in a debate that is going to \nhave a huge impact on their lives, it seems to me something needs to be \ndone.\n  If I wait much longer, then the issue is going to be over, because I \nwould vehemently oppose--vehemently oppose--any effort to reverse a \ndesignation and a recognition. That, to me, would be outrageous and a \ndreadful precedent. But once that recognition occurs, it is unlikely to \never be rolled back.\n  So what I am trying to do is not, in any way, to suggest that those \nwho have been designated or recognized--that anything be done there at \nall but merely in the future, as we are talking about this, shouldn't \nthe people of my communities be notified? My Governor, my attorney \ngeneral, the mayors of my towns that are surrounding these areas, \nshouldn't they be notified?\n  What about in the other 37 States where this is going to occur. It \nmay be in Connecticut today, but it may be your State next. I think \nbeing heard on these matters, being invited to participate--there are \nseven criteria that are listed in the regulations, and in some cases \nvarious criteria are totally disregarded. In some instances, the \ntechnical staff have made one recommendation and have been overruled by \nthe Assistant Secretary, totally disregarding all the efforts and work \ndone by the people at the BIA.\n  So I do not like doing this. This is not the way I normally proceed, \nbut I am in a tough place. I have to stand and speak for my \nconstituents. I am hopeful we can find some compromise in the next few \nminutes to avoid asking our colleagues to make choices on matters such \nas this. This is not how I like to proceed, but if I let this go and \nanother year comes and goes; and these processes go forward under a \nsystem, as it did with the two applications I just described, you can \nimagine how my constituents and yours may react down the road.\n  I also am concerned that this is going to devalue the recognition \nprocess. For those who get recognition, to suggest somehow the process \nwas not as thorough and as fair as it should be does a disservice to \nthose who deserve recognition.\n  So this process needs fixing. If we do not do that, everybody gets \nhurt by it and we build up a level of hostility that is unnecessary.\n  This is a moratorium. The moratorium could end next week. It need not \nbe a moratorium indefinitely. It just says a moratorium until you make \nthese fixes. No new law is being requested here--nothing. It just says \ncomply with the existing regulations and make sure the people are \nnotified and invited to participate in a debate that can have a \nprofound effect on their lives and their families. That is not too \nmuch to ask. It does not give them a veto power. It does not make it an \nadversarial proceeding. It just says we ought to invite people to \nparticipate. That is the American way. That is the way we do things.\n\n  So this amendment merely says to have a moratorium until these \nmatters are put in place and worked out. I do not know how my \ncolleagues may vote. I may lose today. But as I stand here, I promise \nyou, if you are one of the 36 other States and this comes to your \nState, then you are going to be standing where I am, and you are going \nto be insisting upon the same sort of thing.\n  We stand and vote to support each other's needs when they occur. I am \nasking my colleagues to support me in\n\n[[Page S8585]]\n\nthis particular case because my State is feeling it. And we are not \nanti-Native American at all. Quite to the contrary. We are deeply proud \nof the Mohegan and Pequot Tribes in my State. I strongly supported \ntheir recognition efforts. In fact, I have been highly criticized in \nbooks because I stood in support of them when they were under threat of \nnot being recognized.\n  So I will not take a back seat to anyone in my determination to fight \nfor them. But I need to fight for my constituency as well when they \nfeel as though they are not being served well by a process that is \nfundamentally broken. And when the Assistant Secretary for the Bureau \nof Indian Affairs says the system is broken, it is not working, then we \nought to pay attention. And that is what this amendment is designed to \ndo.\n  My fervent hope would be, with the staff of the committee, in the \nremaining 15 minutes or so we have, we put on the table an offer that \nwould make this moratorium only exist for 1 year, to clarify some \nlanguage they were concerned about. We can offer that, accept it, and \nmove on. We need not have this become a divisive debate.\n  I know the chairman of the committee and the ranking member are here, \nand they want to be heard. I have spoken my piece. I hope we can work \nit out in the next 15 minutes or so and then put this issue behind us. \nBut if we cannot, I am going to ask my colleagues to support my State. \nLook to your own States. If you are unclear, inquire, because the issue \nwill come to your State, I promise you, sooner or later. And this vote \nwill be looked back upon as to where you stood on this issue when you, \nall of a sudden, are confronted, as we were, with two groups seeking \nrecognition and neither one was approved, and then there is a third \none. That is how bad this system is right now. That is wrong. That is \nunfair. My people deserve better than that.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment if a compromise is \nnot reached.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and that the time be charged \nequally to both sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator from Connecticut \nwithhold his suggestion of a quorum call?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, I would defer to Senator Inouye, our \nchairman, if he wishes to speak first.\n  Madam President, I support a motion to table the Dodd amendment. Let \nme say at the outset, though, that no one questions Senator Dodd's \ncommitment to the Indian people of America. He has an exemplary voting \nrecord, and he has always been there when we needed help.\n  My problem with his amendment is that there has been almost no input \nfrom tribes themselves, and in the past they have opposed any \nmoratorium. We all know the problem that exists now with the \nrecognition process. We all know it needs to be streamlined and needs \nto be changed. It is replete with problems. We have heard it over and \nover.\n  We have had a couple hearings on this already in the Indian Affairs \nCommittee, and we intend to take it up again. Whether we have run out \nof time this year has yet to be determined.\n  But I was not aware there was going to be some discussion on a \ncompromise amendment. And because the unanimous consent request was \nentered into yesterday, many of us, including me, have made \nreservations on planes that we can't change. So I hope I am going to be \nable to be here to speak to it, but knowing how these things sort of \ncreep, I may not be able to do so.\n  So from my own standpoint, if I do have to leave, I am going to defer \nto our chairman, Senator Inouye. The Indian Affairs staff is working \nwith Senator Dodd's staff on an amendment that may be acceptable, but I \nwill certainly defer to my chairman in his decision of whether to \nsupport that amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, it is with some considerable reluctance \nthat I rise today to speak in opposition to the amendment proposed by \nmy good friend, the senior Senator from Connecticut, that would \nprohibit the expenditure of funds for the operations of the Branch of \nAcknowledgment until the Secretary of the Interior has certified to the \nCongress that certain administrative procedures have been implemented \nwith respect to the consideration of any petition submitted to the \nSecretary.\n  The provisions of this amendment are drawn from an authorizing bill, \nS. 1392, that is now pending in the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  At Senator Dodd's request, in July of this year I agreed to schedule \na hearing on S. 1392.\n  That hearing is to be held on Tuesday, September 17.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, I believe that \nSenator Dodd's request for a hearing in the authorizing committee \nreflects a position on which we can both agree that the appropriate \nvenue for the consideration of reforms to the Branch of Acknowledgment \nprocess is in the authorizing committee of jurisdiction.\n  In an effort to responsibly address the matter of whether there is \nsome urgency associated with effecting reform in the Branch of \nAcknowledgment that cannot await action by the authorizing committee, \nparticularly as such reform may affect the State of Connecticut, I \nauthorized my staff to contact the Department of Interior's Branch of \nAcknowledgment officials for information on the petitions currently \npending before the Branch.\n  The committee is advised that there are two petitions of tribal \ngroups located within the State of Connecticut that are currently \npending in the branch.\n  Both petitions are the subject of court-ordered negotiated \nagreements, and thus both petitions are subject to the ongoing \njurisdiction of the Federal district courts.\n  So for those members who believe that the Congress should forebear \nfrom injecting itself into pending litigation, the jurisdiction of the \nFederal district courts should be honored as well here and action \nshould not be taken on an amendment which would interfere with the \ncourts' jurisdiction. The court-ordered negotiated agreement for the \nSchaghticoke Tribe provides that the proposed finding whether positive \nor negative is due to be published on December 5, 2002.\n  Thereafter there is a 6-month comment period, followed by a two-month \nresponse period, both of which may be extended at the request of the \nparties.\n  If no extensions are requested or granted, then assuming a positive \nfinding, the earliest time in which a positive finding would become \neffective for purposes of any appeals by the State of Connecticut or \nother parties, is August 5, 2003.\n  For the Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe--under court order, the proposed \nfinding whether positive or negative is due to be published on January \n21, 2003.\n  Thereafter there is a 6-month comment period, followed by a 2-month \nresponse period, both of which may be extended at the request of the \nparties.\n  If no extensions are requested or granted, then assuming a positive \nfinding, the earliest time in which a positive finding would become \neffective for purposes of any appeals by the State of Connecticut or \nother parties, is September 21, 2003.\n  The other groups that will be affected by the amendment proposed by \nSenator Dodd are two petitioning groups of the Nipmuc Tribes of \nMassachusetts, the Mashpee Tribe of Massachusetts, the Snohomish Tribe \nof Washington State and the Burt Lake Band of Michigan.\n  I firmly believe that Senator Dodd's authorizing legislation can be \naddressed through the hearing process and acted upon well within the \ntime frame that is anticipated for action on the two pending petitions \nfrom Connecticut tribal groups, and thus, that it is not necessary for \nthe authorizing provisions of this amendment to be considered within \nthe context of the Interior appropriations bill.\n  In addition, I am certain Senator Dodd would agree with me that \nreforms of the magnitude proposed by his amendment merit the full \nconsideration of all those now involved or who may become involved in \nthe Federal acknowledgment process--including the administration, and \nequally important, the Nations of Indian country, as well as other \ninterested parties.\n\n[[Page S8586]]\n\n  There has been no hearing nor public record developed on the proposal \nadvanced in Senator Dodd's amendment, and I think it is incumbent upon \nus to develop such a record and to receive testimony on this proposal \nbefore any action is taken precipitously.\n  There are other proposals now pending in the Congress for the reform \nof the Federal acknowledgment process--Senator Campbell, the vice \nchairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, has one such proposal.\n  Clearly, the proponents of those measures would also wish to have \ntheir legislative initiatives given full consideration, and I believe \nwe should afford a full and fair opportunity for all such measures to \nbe considered rather than adopting one proposal that has not yet been \nthe subject of hearings.\n  Under current law, the Branch of Acknowledgment works with \npetitioning tribal groups in a cooperative process which is designed to \nassure that a petitioning group has submitted data sufficient to \naddress each of the seven criteria that petitioners must meet.\n  The regulations require the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs \nfor the Department of the Interior to provide notice of the petition to \nthe Governor and the Attorney General of the State in which the \npetitioning group is located.\n  It has been represented that the proposed amendment does nothing more \nthan codify the existing Branch of Acknowledgment regulation, but in \nfact, the proposed amendment proposes to replace most of the existing \nprocedural rules governing the acknowledgment process with a contested \nhearing process.\n  It would grant interested parties, and not petitioners, the power to \ncontrol the timing of the contested case and would prevent the \nexpenditure of any funds by the Branch of Acknowledgment if the Branch \ndoes not comply with the new procedural rules established by the \namendment.\n  The amendment requires the Secretary to consider ``all relevant \nevidence submitted by a petitioner or any other interested party, \nincluding neighboring municipalities.''\n  Upon the request of an interested party, the Secretary may conduct a \nformal hearing for interested parties to present evidence, call and \ncross examine witnesses, or rebut evidence even before a petition is \ncomplete.\n  A transcript of the hearing is to be made part of the administrative \nrecord upon which a decision may be based.\n  Nowhere in the existing administrative regulations is a contested \ncase hearing, such as the one proposed by my colleague's amendment, \nauthorized.\n  Instead, the general spirit of the regulations is to enable a \ncooperative relationship between the petitioning group and the Branch \nof Acknowledgment, as reflected by the authorization for a technical \nreview of each petition by the Branch of Acknowledgment and the \nopportunity to supplement or amend a petition before it is actively \nconsidered and to have information submitted by third parties who have \nlegal, factual, or property interests in the recognition decision to be \nconsidered.\n  The present administrative process allows for publication of a \nproposed finding, a 6-month comment period for all interested parties, \nand a 2-month response period for the petitioning group.\n  A final determination is then made and time lines are established \ngoverning requests for reconsideration and when the decision becomes \nfinal.\n  In contrast to the existing regulations, the proposed amendment \ncreates a contested case process the timing of which is controlled not \nby the Branch of Acknowledgment in conjunction with the petitioning \ngroup, but by those municipalities, counties, State attorney generals, \nState Governors, and other tribes falling within the notice provisions \nof the amendment.\n  Given the fact that the amendment proposes to include State, county \nand municipal governments from each area that the petitioning group was \nhistorically located--and that Federal policy forced not one but many \nrelocations of most tribal groups from their traditional areas--the \namendment contemplates the involvement of scores if not hundreds of \nsmall communities that no longer are in close proximity or have any \ngeographic relationship with the petitioning group.\n  With the exception of the continued application of the seven criteria \nin the existing regulations, almost every other aspect of the \nregulations would be changed under the amendment, including the burden \nof proof a petitioning group must satisfy to meet the criteria.\n  In addition, a petitioning group would be required to defend its \npetition whenever an interested party requests and is granted a \nhearing, even though that request may be made at a time where a \npetitioning group has not yet perfected its petition.\n  I am not suggesting that the proposals advanced in this amendment do \nnot merit the consideration of the Congress.\n  Indeed, as I have earlier indicated, the Committee on Indian Affairs \nhas scheduled a hearing on Tuesday, September 17 for that very purpose.\n  What I am suggesting, Mr. President, is that there is an appropriate \nvenue for the consideration of substantive changes in Federal Indian \nlaw and policy, and that venue is in the authorizing committees of the \nCongress.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the following statement in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as

Each team is composed of a cultural \n     anthropologist, a genealogist, and a historian. FY 2003 \n     funding for three teams and support staff for BAR is \n     $1,100,000. The additional funding would enable the BAR to \n     staff one additional research team and hire support staff who \n     would focus on administrative functions, such as FOIA \n     requests, preparation of administrative files for litigation, \n     and other time consuming responsibilities that are currently \n     handled by the professional research teams. Consequently, \n     this funding would allow four research teams to focus on \n     processing documented petitions.\n       Feasibility/capability of the proposed funding level or \n     language this fiscal year?: On November 2, 2001, General \n     Accounting Office (GAO), released a report on the \n     acknowledgment process titled ``Improvements Needed in Tribal \n     Recognition Process.'' The two concerns raised by GAO were \n     the need to improve the speed and transparency of the \n     decision-making process. These additional funds will enable \n     the Department to address these two identified concerns.\n       Is the program/project ranked on existing priority setting \n     system? This program was included within the total budget \n     priorities competing for increased funding. However, because \n     many other priorities, funding was not included within the \n     President's Budget Request.\n       Senate Action: Proposed at the President's Budget request \n     level; however S. 2708 was introduced on the floor which \n     amends the Department of the Interior's appropriations bill.\n       Senate Report Statement: None.\n\n[[Page S8587]]\n\n       Reference: S. 2708.\n       Effect of Senate Action: S. 2708 is an amendment to the \n     Department of the Interior's appropriations bill. The purpose \n     of this bill is ``[T]o prohibit the expenditure of funds to \n     recognize Indian tribes and tribal nations until the date of \n     implementation of certain administrative procedures.''\n       The Department should oppose this bill because it will \n     result in the Department being unable to comply with court \n     scheduling orders for issuing acknowledgment decisions and \n     because many of its provisions are ambiguous and appear to be \n     unworkable.\n       Sections 1(c)(1)(A) and 1(c)(1)(B) require notice to each \n     state, county and local government in the area where the \n     petitioner is located and in the area historically occupied \n     by the petitioning group. The acknowledgment regulations \n     already provide for written notice to the state and local \n     government where a petition is currently located and provide \n     for notice of the petition in the Federal Register and in \n     local newspapers. Written notice to governments where the \n     petitioner was historically located within 30 days of the \n     receipt of a letter of intent is unrealistic. There is \n     insufficient evidence in a letter of intent to identify these \n     locations.\n       Section 1(c)(1)(C) requires the Department within 30 days \n     to notify any Indian tribe and any other petitioner that, as \n     determined by the Secretary (i) has a relationship with the \n     petitioner (including a historical relationship); or (ii) may \n     otherwise be considered to have a potential interest in the \n     acknowledgment determination.\n       As with the prior provision, the difficulty with the \n     notification provision with the 30-day deadline, is that it \n     may be that until a petition processing is begun, or at least \n     until the preliminary technical assistance review, that the \n     Department will not know all of the petitioners, tribes, \n     states, and others that could be involved. Notice beyond that \n     in the Federal Register to such entities within 30 days of \n     the receipt of a letter of intent is not feasible.\n       Section 1(c)(2)(A) requires the Secretary to consider all \n     relevant evidence submitted by a petitioner or any other \n     interested party, including neighboring municipalities that \n     possess information bearing on the merits of a petition. The \n     Department already considers all evidence which is submitted \n     within prescribed time frames by petitioners and any other \n     interested party, including neighboring municipalities.\n       Under section 1(c)(2)(B), the Secretary, on request by an \n     interested party, may conduct a formal hearing at which all \n     interested parties may present evidence, call witnesses, \n     cross-examine witnesses, or rebut evidence presented by other \n     parties during the hearing.\n       The bill leaves unspecified who the hearing would be \n     before, when in the acknowledgment process this hearing would \n     take place, and the purpose of this hearing. Therefore, any \n     advantages of a hearing are unclear.\n       Further under the existing regulations, The Department \n     provides for hearings before the IBIA, an independent \n     administrative review body. If an additional hearing is \n     intended, it would further delay decisions on the petitions.\n       Under section 1(c)(3)(A), the Secretary shall ensure that \n     the evidence presented in consideration of a petition is \n     sufficient to demonstrate that the petitioner meets each of \n     the 7 mandatory criteria for recognition contained in section \n     83.7 of title 25, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect \n     on the date of enactment of this Act).\n       This section appears to restate the existing standard used \n     by the Department.\n       Under section 1(c)(3)(B), the Secretary shall consider a \n     criterion to be met if the Secretary determines that it is \n     more likely than not that evidence presented demonstrates the \n     satisfaction of the criterion.\n       The meaning of the stated standard is unclear, particularly \n     as to whether it changes the regulatory standard which \n     provides that a criterion shall be considered met if the \n     available evidence establishes a ``reasonable likelihood of \n     the validity of the facts relating to that criterion.'' It is \n     unclear if this provision would change the existing standard.\n       Under section 1(c)(4), the Secretary shall publish in the \n     Federal Register, and provide to each person to which notice \n     is provided under paragraph (1), a complete and detailed \n     explanation of the final decision of the Secretary regarding \n     a documented petition under this Act that includes express \n     findings of fact and law with respect to each of the criteria \n     described in paragraph (3).\n       The regulations already require that notice of the final \n     determination be published in the Federal Register. It is \n     ambiguous if the complete final determination is to be \n     published in the Federal Register which would be an \n     extraordinary and unnecessary expense. Presently, the \n     decisions are publicly available and will be posted on the \n     Internet as soon as possible.\n       Recommendation: The Department does not support this \n     amendment, and it opposes considering it as part of the \n     Interior Appropriations Bill.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, what I would like to propose is to \nconvert this amendment into a bill and have it referred to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs to give time to the respective staffs, the \nstaff of the committee and the staff of Senator Dodd, to work over this \nmeasure and come forth with a resolution of the matter. When that \nresolution is reached--and I gather it can be reached in 24 or 48 \nhours--we can once again bring up the new amendment and consider that.\n  If I may, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, last night I worked with Senators Inouye \nand Dodd until almost 11 o'clock. The arrangement made at that time was \nthat we would have a vote at 10:15 on the Dodd amendment. The Senators \nhave worked with their staffs and we are still going to have a vote at \n10:15 but not on the Dodd amendment. We are going to ask unanimous \nconsent to set that aside and to see if Senators Dodd, Campbell, and \nInouye can work out this problem that is now facing us. They do believe \nby early next week they can work something out.\n  I know some Senators are going to be upset that we are only voting on \na judge this morning, but there has been a lot of work going into \nhaving this amendment withdrawn. I think it is in the best interest of \nthe Senate that we not charge forward on something if it can be \nresolved. There will be a vote at 10:15. We will vote on Arthur Schwab, \nof Pennsylvania, to be a judge. We expect to announce that in a moment \nor two.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, before the unanimous consent request, I \nthank the distinguished majority whip. I thank my colleague from \nHawaii, my colleague from Colorado, and the Senator from Montana as \nwell. I apologize to colleagues who were counting on a vote. I know the \nleadership wants to have a vote. This matter is very important. If we \ncan resolve this by not having a divisive Senate on this issue, I think \nthat exceeds the importance of whether we have a vote. We are going to \ntry to work this out so we can deal with the underlying cause of the \namendment. I thank the Senators for offering my colleague from \nConnecticut and I a chance to come to a solution. We will ask unanimous \nconsent to temporarily set aside the Dodd-Lieberman amendment. Then \nthis will pop back up again, I presume, Tuesday when we come back after \nYom Kippur and deal with the matter. I am confident that at that time \nwe will have resolved this problem and we can vote on a compromise. I \napologize. We worked late last night. I thank the Senators and their \nstaffs. Senator Reid was on the phone until after 11:30. Time didn't \npermit us to get it done. I don't want to see the Senate vote on a \nmatter of this importance without trying to resolve the differences. We \nwill vote on a judgeship, but we will, at some point, vote on this \nmatter--a compromise or the Dodd-Lieberman amendment. I hope it will be \na compromise that will be satisfactory to everybody.\n\n  I thank the Senator from Nevada. He works hard to keep things on \ntrack. This is something which I think rises to the level of reaching a \ncompromise on an important effort.\n  Mr. REID. I simply say to my friend that I think we have far too many \nvotes here anyway that are not necessary. I think it shows the \nexperience and wisdom of the people who have been working on this \nissue, along with you and Senator Campbell. There is no need to have a \nvote on this matter. We may never have to have one. If we do, we will \nvote on it. I think a lot of people say ``I want a recorded vote'' \nbecause it looks good--or whatever reason. We spend far too much time \nvoting on matters that could be passed without a recorded vote. Even \nthough there is no vote on this amendment, I think the Senators have \nsaved us a lot of time.\n  The next vote will occur at 5 o'clock Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/13/senate-section/article/S8588-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8588]]\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF ARTHUR J.

Madam President, I yield such time as the Senator from \nPennsylvania may require to make a brief statement.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I thank the majority leader.\n  I have sought recognition to comment very briefly on the nomination \nof Arthur J. Schwab of Pittsburgh, PA. Mr. Schwab is an outstanding \nlawyer and will make an outstanding judge. His credentials include: \nGraduating cum laude from Grove City College; Order of Coif from the \nUniversity of Virginia Law School; an extraordinary litigation record \nas a trial lawyer, appearing in some 22 States, in addition to \nPennsylvania; in the Federal courts in Pennsylvania, he argued appeals \nin the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and \nEleventh Circuit Courts. He has an extraordinary litigation background \nand will make an outstanding judge.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the \nqualifications of Arthur J. Schwab.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Arthur J. Schwab graduated cum laude from Grove City \n     College in 1968. He then attended the University of Virginia \n     law school, where he graduated Order of the Coif in 1972. \n     After law school he was an assistant district attorney with \n     the District Attorney's Office of Allegheny County. He then \n     became a partner in the law firm of Mansmann, Beggy, McVerry \n     & Baxter, later named McVerry, Baxter & Cindrich, from 1970 \n     to 1988. He has also been Of Counsel to the law firm of \n     Tucker Arensburg, a shareholder of Grogan, Graffam, McGinley \n     & Lucchino, P.C. Currently, Mr. Schwab serves as the chief \n     counsel and chair of litigation at Buchanan Ingersoll, P.C., \n     in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n       Over the past 20 years, Mr. Schwab has developed a practice \n     in the areas of trade secrets, confidential information, \n     employment agreements, software copyright infringement, \n     trademark, unfair competition, and diversion of corporate \n     opportunities. He has tried cases in state and federal courts \n     in more than 22 different states, as well as in the Courts of \n     Common Pleas of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and in the \n     United States District Court for the Western District of \n     Pennsylvania. Mr. Schwab has also been responsible for cases \n     involving appeals to the United States Courts of Appeals for \n     the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and \n     Eleventh Circuits.\n       Mr. Schwab is also actively involved in his local \n     community, including serving as the co-chair of the Senator \n     John Heinz Level of Giving Division of the United Way of \n     Allegheny County. From 1979 to 1988, Mr. Schwab began an \n     extensive pro bono project concerning Child Advocacy for the \n     Allegheny County Bar Association that produced, with the \n     assistance of 60 Reed Smith attorneys, over 3400 hours of \n     representation of indigent children.\n       Once again, I believe that Arthur Schwab will be an \n     excellent addition to the federal bench and I urge my \n     colleagues to vote for his confirmation. Thank you.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today the Senate has confirmed its 76th \nand 77th new judges since the change in majority last summer, with the \nvote on Arthur Schwab, who is nominated to the Eastern District of \nPennsylvania and the vote earlier this morning on Jose Martinez, who is \nnominated to the Southern District of Florida. In less than 15 months \nwe have confirmed more judges that the Republican majority confirmed in \nits final 30 months in the majority. We have been more than twice as \nproductive as they were and Republicans are nonetheless complaining \nthat we have not worked three or four times as fast as they did to fill \nvacancies their inaction perpetuated.\n  The Senate has now confirmed more judges than were confirmed in all \nof 1989 and 1990, the first two years of the first Bush Administration, \nand almost 40 percent more confirmations than in the first 15 months of \nthe Reagan or Clinton Administration, both of which were cooperating \nwith a Senate majority of the same political party.\n  Another stark comparison would be between how we have proceeded this \nyear and how the recent Republican majority proceeded in the years they \nwere in the Senate majority but the President was a Democrat. In the \n1996 session for example, the second full year in which the Republican \nmajority was in control of progress on President Clinton's judicial \nnominees, the Republican majority allowed only 17 judges to be \nconfirmed the entire year. Not a single circuit court judge was \nconfirmed that entire session all year--not one.

Dorgan, Mark \n           Dayton, Debbie Stabenow, Jim Jeffords, Robert \n           Torricelli.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I am happy to yield to the Senator from \nIdaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the majority leader for yielding. He has just \nfiled cloture on the Byrd amendment. The underlying second degree is \nthe Craig-Domenici amendment to try to deal with forest health. I \nappreciate the frustration of time here and the reality we have to get \na lot of work done in the next several weeks to conclude the \nappropriations process.\n  It was never our intent to block the Byrd amendment. This is a \ncritical and necessary amendment that deals with fire itself and \nreplacing some of the moneys or refurbishing, replenishing some of the \nmoneys that have been spent fighting fires, primarily in the West but \nacross the country, in our public forests.\n  We are continuing to work. We had another meeting this morning. I \ntold all of my colleagues, Democrat and Republican alike, that Monday \nwas drop dead. I meant that only in the sense of the legislation \nitself. Clearly, we have worked hard. There have been some good faith \nefforts. There has also been a reality as to where all of the sides are \non this issue. Tragically enough, no matter what we accomplish, the \nforests of our country are going to continue to burn at a high rate \nbecause of their diminished health because of public policy over the \nlast good number of decades.\n  But on Monday, in visiting with Senator Reid, I hope we will have \nsomething we can vote on--or a clear decision that we cannot arrive at \nan agreement. I hope at some point, Leader, I can come to you and ask \nyou if you could vitiate the vote on cloture, that we could expedite \nthis ourselves. But there are a good number on my side, and some on \nyours, who want more debate and at least more discussion on this issue, \neven if we can have opposing positions on which to vote.\n  I do believe for the American people, who have seen the western skies \nfull of smoke now since the middle of June, it is important that this \nSenate express its will on this issue.\n  The Senator from South Dakota found an expression that fit his State. \nI do not criticize him for it because the Black Hills of South Dakota \nare in a state of forest health problems, as are other public forests. \nClearly, it is important that we not walk away from this session of \nCongress without the public knowing where we are on this issue because, \nas the Senator knows, no matter what we do, even if we can have some \naggressive effort on thinning and cleaning, the country must become \nready to accept, tragically enough, that we are going to lose 5 million \nor 6 million acres a year of old growth and watershed and wildlife \nhabitat to wildfires because of the public policy that has brought our \nforests to this current health environment.\n  But I hope we can make a step, probably not a big one but at least a \nsmall step, in the right direction of showing the public we can manage \ntheir land and we can do so in an environmentally sensitive way that \nwill replenish the health of these magnificent forests that have now \ngrown to a state of disrepair.\n  I understand where the leader is. I did want that expression out \nthere. I hope we can come to the majority leader on Monday and say we \nhave something, we hope you can vitiate, and we hope we can come to \nthis floor and debate this issue and get on with the process.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me respond to the Senator from Idaho. I would be \nmore than happy to entertain a consent agreement to vitiate the cloture \nvote on Tuesday if we arrive at a consensus about this over the \nweekend. We laid this bill down on September 4. It is now September 13, \nand I am told we have not spent this much time on any appropriations \nbill to date. So I attempted to be as patient as I could be with regard \nto the ongoing discussions. We have offered procedural arrangements to \ndeal with this. They have not been acceptable to some. We have offered \nas many different iterations of compromise as I think our imaginations \nallow. But if there is a productive and successful effort over the \nweekend, we will certainly revisit the question.\n  However, we have to move on, this is not only a fire amendment but it \nis a drought amendment, now, as a result of the overwhelming action \ntaken by the Senate just last week. This is a very important piece of \nlegislation, and we have to move along. There is too much work to be \ndone in too short a time.\n  So we will look at where we are on Monday and come to some \nconclusion. But if we are unsuccessful, we will have to move on with \nthe cloture vote on Tuesday.\n  I yield the floor and I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, before the majority leader leaves the \nfloor, I would like to comment on the discussion that just took place \nbetween the majority leader and Senator Craig and indicate to him I \nhave been a daily participant in those negotiations. I have tried to \nact in good faith; many have. But somehow or another, we make one step \nforward, and literally the next time we meet, it looks as if we have \ngone one and a half back. It is getting more difficult.\n  We don't intend to delay this bill once we know the good faith \nefforts of the Senators--which is about 10 of them--cannot reach an \nagreement. We will come forward. But we will have to take a little \ntime, as best we can, without delaying things too much, to let \neverybody know what has happened. It will not take too long for that to \noccur. There are other Senators who may feel differently. The amendment \nis a Craig-Domenici amendment. We put it together, gathered the \nSenators, but I wanted the record to reveal we are not interested in \ndelaying the good faith effort on this bill, but we have a powerful \nissue, as you well known, that burns at many of our hearts. I am sorry \nI had to use that terrible word. We are having burns elsewhere in our \nStates.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I had wanted to make some comments this \nmorning on the issue of homeland security. I understand we are \ncurrently back on the Interior appropriations bill; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask the chairman of the Appropriations Committee if he \nhas other business to transact on that appropriation. If not, I would \nlike to offer some comments on homeland security, which is the second \ntrack we have been working on this week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, if I may respond to the Senator's question \nwithout his losing his right to the floor? He has asked me a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I assume the Senate will return to homeland security this \nafternoon. The order is, I believe, 12 or 12:30?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, at 12 noon, with Senator Byrd having the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. At 12 noon, at which time, under the unanimous consent \norder entered last evening, I will get recognized.\n  Now, I intend to explain my amendment clearly because my amendment is \nnot adversarial to the Lieberman bill. My amendment improves, in my \njudgment--and I think people will agree once they really understand my \namendment--the Lieberman amendment, the Lieberman bill. Therefore, I\n\n[[Page S8590]]\n\nwill be explaining my amendment. That is in answer to the question of \nthe distinguished Senator.\n  At that time, if he wishes me to yield to ask questions about \nhomeland security, that will be fine, but I intend to take some time \nthis afternoon. At that time, the Senator can speak. As far as I am \nconcerned, if Senators are going to speak on the Interior bill at this \ntime, why, the Senator could get unanimous consent to speak out of \norder. I do not believe the Pastore rule has run its course yet. So the \nSenator could get consent to speak out of order for 10 minutes, 20 \nminutes, whatever he wants, and nobody is around here to object.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from North Dakota yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am pleased to yield to the Senator from Nevada for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. REID. We have the two managers of the Interior bill here now. We \nhave approximately an hour until we go to the homeland security bill. I \nhave looked to staff, and we have no amendments to clear at this time. \nThat is my understanding. So it would probably be to everyone's \nbenefit, because the cloture motion has been filed on the pending \namendment, that we go off this bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/13/senate-section/article/S8590-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, let me thank the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee and the ranking member. We have a very short \namount of time in which to do a great deal of business. I did not wish \nto interrupt their work on Interior if in fact there was an amendment \nthat was to be acted upon. I appreciate their courtesy.\n  Let me make some comments about the broad question of homeland \nsecurity and relate it to the discussion yesterday at the United \nNations that was offered by President Bush.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, will the distinguished Senator yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am pleased to yield for a question from the Senator \nfrom West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I wish I could be on the floor to hear what the Senator has \nto say. I have an appointment. I have to be down below this floor at 11 \no'clock, which is 1 minute or 2 from now. I will read the remarks of \nthe Senator. I know they will be good. If I can come back before he \ncompletes his remarks, I will do that.\n  Is it the understanding of the Senator that he will complete his \nremarks by 12 noon?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I have not been on the floor until now \nto speak about the homeland security bill and the issues surrounding \nthat bill. I have been thinking a lot about it, as have many of my \ncolleagues. We have had a good number of amendments, and I do not \nbelieve anyone here thinks the issue is whether we shall pass a piece \nof legislation dealing with homeland security. Of course we should \nenact a piece of legislation dealing with homeland security. We need to \nrespond to the President's request. We will do that. The question isn't \nwhether, the question is how.\n  There are many ideas about homeland security that come from all \ncorners of this Chamber. We ought to take the best of all of those \nideas and incorporate them into this legislation.\n  Yesterday the President spoke at the United Nations about the threat \nthat comes from Saddam Hussein and Iraq. Because that also relates to \nthe issue of homeland security, I wanted to make some comments of a \ngeneral nature this morning.\n  In my desk, I have a couple of pieces of materials taken from weapons \nthat were once targeted at the United States. I ask unanimous consent \nto be able to show them on the floor. I am doing this for a very \nimportant reason.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this piece of material is part of a wing \nstrut from a Backfire bomber that the Soviets used to fly. This \nBackfire bomber doesn't exist anymore. It wasn't shot down. It wasn't \npart of combat with the United States. This was sawed off of an \nairplane. The wings were sawed off of a Backfire bomber that used to \ncarry nuclear weapons--presumably that would threaten our country in \nthe middle of the Cold War. It was dismantled, sawed apart, and \ndestroyed. And in a sense, we purchased it. We paid for it under the \nNunn-Lugar program, in which we decided through arms control agreements \nwith the Soviet Union--and then with Russia--to reduce the number of \nnuclear warheads and reduce the delivery vehicles for nuclear warheads, \nbecause we believed that allowed us to step back from the dangers of \nnuclear war.\n  I hold in my hand part of a Soviet Backfire bomber that we didn't \nshoot down. We helped pay to saw the wings off this bomber.\n  This other material is ground up copper wire that used to be in a \nSoviet submarine that carried nuclear missiles with warheads aimed at \nthe United States of America. That submarine doesn't exist any longer. \nI am able to hold in my hand this ground up copper from that dismantled \nsubmarine because of an arms control agreement by which we negotiated \nwith the Soviets to reduce the number of nuclear weapons and reduce the \ndelivery vehicles for those nuclear weapons, and, therefore, have made \nthis a safer world. A bomber and a submarine that used to carry nuclear \nweapons no longer exists. We have made progress.\n  But there are, of course, somewhere in the neighborhood of 30,000 \nnuclear weapons that continue to exist on the face of this Earth. And \nmany in this world aspire to acquire nuclear weapons. Terrorist groups \nand other countries want to become part of the club that has nuclear \nweapons. Our children and their children are threatened by the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons.\n  It doesn't take 100 nuclear weapons or a thousand nuclear weapons to \ncreate chaos and hysteria and concern for the future of the world. It \njust takes one--just one nuclear weapon.\n  Today, if someone is notified that there is a nuclear weapon missing \nfrom the Russian arsenal and that has been stolen by terrorists and is \nput in the trunk of a rusty Yugo car on the dock at New York City, or \nin a container on a ship coming into the ports of Los Angeles--if just \none nuclear weapon is thought to be entering this country's space, its \nports, its docks, its cities--that is enough for the kind of nuclear \nblackmail that can cause chaos and hysteria and threaten a nuclear war.\n  The President gave a very forceful speech yesterday to the United \nNations. He is--and we are--concerned about Iraq and Saddam Hussein \nhaving access to weapons of mass destruction. He is--and we are--\nconcerned about the potential of a Saddam Hussein getting access and \nacquiring a nuclear weapon.\n\n  I don't diminish at all the concern about that. We ought to be \nconcerned about that. We and the President are all concerned about \nthat.\n  But let us understand that the broader issue of arms control and arms \nreduction ought to be front and center in this Chamber. This country \nneeds to be a leader in the world to help reduce the number of nuclear \nweapons and help prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to other \ncountries.\n  Regrettably, in recent years, some Members in this Chamber--and \nelsewhere in the Government of the United States--have expressed, if \nnot a benign neglect, an open hostility to arms control and arms \nreductions.\n  Let me go through a few of the things that have happened. We had a \nvote in this Chamber on the issue of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban \nTreaty. We should have such a treaty. After all, we don't test anymore \nin this country. The first George Bush Presidency said we will no \nlonger test nuclear weapons. But this Senate voted\n\n[[Page S8591]]\n\nagainst a Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty--despite the fact that \nwe unilaterally decided not to test, and have not tested for a decade. \nThis Senate turned that treaty down, sending a message to the rest of \nthe world that this is not our priority.\n  There is nothing more important, in my judgment, to the children of \nAmerica and to their children and their future than dealing with this \nquestion of a nuclear threat. The Soviet Union is gone. The Cold War is \nover.\n  The President's discussion about Saddam Hussein underscores the \nconcern about one dictator in Iraq--an evil man in Iraq who is seeking \nto get nuclear weapons.\n  But I am just saying that there is much more at stake than that. The \nIraq situation is at stake for us, and we need to respond to that. But \nthere is much more at stake.\n  So many others want to acquire nuclear weapons. There are so many \nnuclear weapons around in this world. I indicated that there are \nsomewhere between, perhaps, 25,000 and 30,000 nuclear weapons in \nexistence. A fair number of them for a number of reasons are not very \nwell controlled. So we need to talk in the broader context about what \nour responsibility is, and what our role is with respect to arms \ncontrol and arms reduction in the future.\n  The Senate was asked to consider the nomination of a fellow named \nJohn Holum, who the President said he wanted as senior adviser for arms \ncontrol. John Holum is a remarkable American, who has had incredible \nexperience, and he was nominated for the position of Under Secretary of \nState for Arms Control and International Security Affairs. He is \nsomebody who believes in his heart that we need to pursue negotiations \nand efforts to achieve treaties for nuclear arms reduction and to \nachieve progress in stopping the spread of nuclear weapons. But his \nnomination was blocked.\n  The President sent us instead John Bolton, who doesn't have \nexperience in arms control, who has never served in an arms control \nposition, who has expressed disdain for arms control and those who \npromote it, and who expressed disdain for the United Nations. He said:\n\n       . . . a building in New York has 38 stories. If it lost 10 \n     it wouldn't make a bit of difference.\n\n  And his nomination was approved by the Senate.\n  So we have someone in this area who really isn't interested in \npursuing the approach that we have used, which has been quite \nsuccessful in beginning the process of reducing nuclear weapons and \nreducing the nuclear threat.\n  We also have had discussions in recent months about perhaps \ndeveloping a new type of nuclear weapon. Perhaps a nuclear weapon can \nbe developed that will be a cave buster--some nuclear-tipped bomb that \nwill bust into caves and be more effective in dealing with the problem \nthat we encountered in Afghanistan where terrorists burrowed into \ncaves.\n  The minute you start talking about designing nuclear weapons--\nespecially a little nuclear weapon with a special nuclear tip that can \nbe used against caves--once you start talking about the potential to \nuse nuclear weapons, the genie is out of the bottle.\n  Our discussion in this country ought never to be a discussion about \nhow to use a nuclear weapon. That is not what we ought to be \ndiscussing.\n\n  We ought to be discussing our obligation to assume a world leadership \nposition to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and stop the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons. Do you want a future 10 years from \nnow or 40 years from now in which 50, 75, or 100 countries, including \nterrorists and rogue nations, have nuclear weapons at their disposal? I \ndon't think so.\n  We have had a 50-year effort in this country--50 years--to stigmatize \nnuclear weapons and brand them only as a weapon of last resort. We \nought not do anything to undermine that basic approach to nuclear \nweapons.\n  We are talking about homeland security in these days. When you talk \nabout nuclear weapons, you have to talk about homeland security against \nthe ultimate weapon; that is, a nuclear weapon. But there are many \nother kinds of weapons.\n  We may spend $7 to $8 billion this year, in this Congress, on a \nnational missile defense program, trying to build a missile that has \nthe capability of hitting a bullet with a bullet. The purpose of that \nis a defensive mechanism by which if a rogue nation or terrorist or \nsome other country were able to launch an intercontinental ballistic \nmissile against the United States, we would be able to shoot it down \nand prevent a nuclear attack using an ICBM.\n  We will spend an enormous amount of money on that, believing that one \nof the threats is an intercontinental ballistic missile coming in at \n14,000 miles an hour, with a nuclear warhead, sent by some rogue nation \nor terrorist state. It is one of the less likely threats; the Pentagon \nwill tell you that. Rogue nations and terrorist states would have a \nvery difficult time dealing with an ICBM, if they could acquire one in \nthe first place.\n  A far more likely prospect would be a container, on a container ship, \npulling up to a dock in New York City at 3 miles an hour, with a low-\nyield nuclear device in the middle of a container, in the middle of a \ncontainer ship.\n  There are 5.7 million containers that come into this country every \nyear to all of our ports and docks. These big ships pull up with \ncontainers stacked on top of their decks. Of the 5.7 million, 100,000 \nare inspected. So 5.6 million are not. I was at a dock in Seattle \nrecently, and they had pulled off a ship container, and they were \ninspecting it at the Customs facility. I asked them: What is this? What \nis in the container?\n  They said: Frozen broccoli, from Poland.\n  I said: Well, do you know anything about it, the frozen broccoli from \nPoland?\n  They said: No, but we'll show you.\n  They opened up the container, pulled the bag out, and ripped it open, \nand, sure enough, there was broccoli from Poland.\n  I said: How do you know what's in the middle of this container? You \njust pulled the one bag out.\n  They said: Well, we don't. We just opened it to see that it was \nfrozen broccoli from Poland.\n  So we have 5.6 million containers that come into this country, and \nthey are largely uninspected. Does anyone here not believe that port \nsecurity, the security of containers, is critically important?\n  Did you read the story about the fellow from the Middle East who \ndecided to send himself to Canada, presumably with the thought of \ncoming into the United States, and he put himself in a container? He \nhad a cot, he had potable water, he had a telephone, he had a computer, \nhe had a GPS system, he had a heater. And there he was living in a \ncontainer, on a container ship, shipping himself to Toronto, Canada.\n\n  Well, they found this guy. They thought he was a terrorist. I don't \nknow what the disposition of that was. But think of it, how easy it is, \nif 5.7 million containers come into this country, and we only take a \nlook at 100,000 of them. What is in the other 5.6 million?\n  That is a big homeland security issue. What are we going to do about \nthat?\n  We have heard discussions about the potential for a dirty bomb. The \nNational Research Council gave a long listing the other day with \nrespect to homeland security, about our shortcomings on preparedness to \ndefend against nuclear and dirty bomb threats, and against biological \nwarfare.\n  Here is what the report said. We have to develop vaccines for \nairborne pathogens--we are way behind in doing that--create better \nsensors and filters for dangerous chemicals; build a system to counter \nsabotage of the Nation's food supply; find better methods to fend off \nattacks on nuclear reactors, electrical power grids, and communications \nsystems; and develop defense in depth for airport and other \ntransportation security.\n  Much of what we are talking about in the current debate about \nhomeland security is organizational. We say, let's take a look at an \norganizational chart and find the boxes and evaluate how we can put all \nthese boxes together in a different way. And so you have, at the end, \n170,000 people in a new agency.\n  Putting agencies together in a way in which they are better prepared \nto deal with homeland security makes good sense to me. But there is not \na right or a wrong way to do it. There are a lot of different ideas on \nhow it might or might not work, and we will not know, perhaps for a \nyear or 2 or 3 or 4 years,\n\n[[Page S8592]]\n\nafter the Congress finishes its work, and the President signs the bill, \nwhether what we have done advances our interests or retards it.\n  It is reasonable to ask the question, if homeland security is going \nto be restructured, should we consider some change to the way we use \nthe FBI and the CIA, and the way we gather and analyze intelligence? I \nknow there is a portion of that in this bill, and I think this is a \nquestion we have to consider carefully.\n  Good intelligence is critical. I mentioned the issue of nuclear \nweapons. Russia, which is now the nuclear repository of the old Soviet \nUnion, has thousands of excess nuclear weapons in storage facilities \nthat fall far short of what we expect for decent security standards. We \nare told they have more than 1,000 metric tons of highly enriched \nuranium and at least 150 metric tons of weapons-grade plutonium, much \nof it in less than adequate storage facilities. That is enough for \n80,000 nuclear weapons, by the way.\n  In addition, dangerous biological pathogens are kept at scores of \npoorly guarded sites around the former Soviet Union.\n  Tens of thousands of former Soviet Union scientists and engineers are \nliving hand to mouth because of military downsizing and the collapse of \nthe economy. These are people who know how to make these bombs, were \ninvolved in the development of the Soviet nuclear capability.\n  We know that individuals and groups have attempted to steal uranium \nor plutonium from sites in the former Soviet Union dozens of times in \nthe past 10 years.\n  Former Senate Majority Leader James Baker and former White House \nCounsel Lloyd Cutler headed a panel last year that studied the threat \nto our country posed by nuclear weapons, materials, and know-how in the \nformer Soviet Union. Here is what the panel said about a scenario where \na terrorist would have access to some basic material and could get the \nengineers and scientists to put this together:\n\n       The national security benefits to the U.S. citizens from \n     securing and/or neutralizing the equivalent of more than \n     80,000 nuclear weapons and potential nuclear weapons would \n     constitute the highest return on investment in any current \n     U.S. national security and defense program.\n       In a worst case scenario, a nuclear engineer graduate with \n     a grapefruit-sized lump of highly enriched uranium or an \n     orange-sized lump of plutonium, together with material \n     otherwise readily available in commercial markets, could \n     fashion a nuclear device that would fit in a van like the one \n     terrorist Yosif parked in the World Trade Center in 1993. The \n     explosive effects of such a device would destroy every \n     building in [the] Wall Street financial area and would level \n     lower Manhattan.\n\n  The Baker-Cutler panel recommends spending a substantial amount of \nmoney, $30 billion over 10 years--three times what the administration \nis proposing--to secure weapons and fissile and biological material in \nRussia by expanding cooperative threat reduction, which is an important \npart of the outgrowth of the Nunn-Lugar program, and a range of other \nefforts.\n  So Iraq is important, but there are broader issues to consider as \nwell.\n  Incidentally, the President yesterday did the right thing by going to \nthe United Nations and saying to the U.N.: Look, you have had \nresolution after resolution after resolution, and Iraq has defied you. \nThey have failed to live up to their terms of surrender from the gulf \nwar, and they simply thumb their nose at your resolutions.\n  What the President said to the United Nations yesterday was: You had \nbetter decide whether you are going to pass resolutions and enforce \nthem or not. And the President said: We will take this to the National \nSecurity Council.\n  A lot of people were worried that he would not do that. I am glad he \nhas. It is exactly the right step. The notion of saying we don't care \nwhat the Security Council does or what the U.N. says, that is not the \nway to do it. The President yesterday did the right thing. He said to \nthe National Security Council and the United Nations: You need to begin \nenforcing what you are doing by resolution with respect to the country \nof Iraq.\n  I hope the United Nations will decide to do that. My hope is we can \nput together a coalition through the United Nations of coercive \ninspections that demand and achieve the inspections necessary to make \nsure we are not threatened by weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.\n  But let us agree that the problem is bigger than just Iraq, and let \nus decide to be a world leader in dealing with stopping the spread of \nnuclear weapons. Let's bring back the comprehensive nuclear test ban \ntreaty. Let's pass it. Let's send a signal to the world that we care \nabout the chemical weapons ban, because this country wants to lead in \nthe right direction to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction.\n  Now, let me say a few words about the proposed Department of Homeland \nSecurity. The President says to us he wants to put this agency \ntogether, and he wants to do it in a way that he has maximum \nflexibility with respect to all of these workers. Whatever we do, \nhowever we do it, we will give this President very substantial \nflexibility. But to suggest somehow that the basic protections that \nworkers expect and have received for many years in this Government of \nours should be discarded or disallowed makes no sense.\n  We propose to provide the same basic protections to workers in all of \nthese agencies that you have for civilian workers at the U.S. \nDepartment of Defense. That makes good sense.\n\n  I get tired of people saying: Federal workers, they are not worth \nmuch. They are people who can't find a job elsewhere.\n  We have terrific people working for the Federal Government. We have \ngreat people in public service--not just the Federal Government, but \nState and local government as well.\n  Among those people who filed out of the World Trade Center, we had \nfirefighters and law enforcement officers climbing the stairs. Some of \nthose firefighters were up on the 70th floor carrying 60-pound \nbackpacks, climbing up as that fire was coursing through that building, \nknowing they were risking their lives. They were not asking about \novertime or about how tough it might be, what the risk was. They were \ndoing their jobs--wonderful, brave people. There are a lot of people \nlike them all over this country in public service. This Government \nought to say to them: We value your work. We honor your work.\n  I don't want anything in this homeland security bill to in any way \ndenigrate the work of those public employees or pull the rug out from \nunder them. They are going to be our first defenders, the first line of \ndefense. They are the ones who will make this work.\n  We have a lot to do here. We have a government of checks and balances \nwhich requires cooperation, which requires that we work together. The \nPresident has some good ideas. I think our colleagues have good ideas. \nI think Senator Byrd does us a service by talking about how we put this \ntogether in the long term.\n  In politics, there are always a couple of sides. Each side too often \nwants the other to lose. We should get the best of both rather than the \nworst of each. That is especially true on homeland security.\n  It is up to us. The moment is now. The President is right to be \ntalking about concern of weapons of mass destruction. But is it not \njust Iraq. This is a much bigger subject. We need those who now talk in \nthe most aggressive ways about dealing with this issue to join us to \ndevelop new arms reduction strategies and to develop approaches by \nwhich the rest of the world joins us in stopping the spread of nuclear \nweapons.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I take a moment to speak to legislation \nthat has been introduced by myself along with a number of bipartisan \ncolleagues, which is entitled the Elder Justice Act of 2002.\n  The legislation has been introduced by me along with Senators Hatch, \nBaucus, Collins, Carnahan, Smith of Oregon, Lincoln, Bond, Torricelli, \nNelson of Florida, and also Senator Stabenow.\n  I will take a minute to just describe the problem we have in this and \noutline the features of the legislation. I think there are probably few \npressing national concerns of social issues that are as important and \nalso ignored as\n\n[[Page S8593]]\n\nmuch as elder abuse, elder neglect, and also the exploitation of elder \nAmericans.\n  This abuse of our seniors takes many different forms. It could be \nphysical abuse, sexual abuse, psychological abuse, and it could also be \nfinancial abuse. The perpetrator may be a stranger you have never heard \nof or never seen; it may be an acquaintance; it may be a paid caregiver \nin some institution; it may be a corporation; and, unfortunately, far \ntoo often it can be a spouse or another member of the elderly person's \nfamily.\n  Elder abuse happens everywhere--in poor, middle class, and upper \nincome households; in cities, suburbs, and in rural areas. It knows no \ndemographic or geographic boundaries.\n  The cost of such abuse and neglect is extremely high by any measure. \nThe price of the abuse is paid in needless human suffering, inflated \nhealth care costs for everyone, depleted public resources, and the loss \nof one of our greatest national assets: Of course, the wisdom and \nexperience of the elders in our country.\n  With scientific advances and the graying of millions of baby boomers, \nthis year the number of elderly on the planet will pass the number of \nchildren on the planet for the very first time. Although we have made \ngreat strides in promoting independence, productivity, and quality of \nlife, old age still brings inadequate health care, isolation, \nimpoverishment, abuse, and neglect for far too many elder Americans.\n  Studies we have looked at in our Aging Committee, which I have the \nprivilege of chairing, conclude that elder abuse, neglect, and \nexploitation are widely unreported. These abuses significantly shorten \nthe lives of older Americans. A single episode of mistreatment can \n``tip over'' an otherwise independent, productive life, triggering a \ndownward spiral that can result in depression, serious illness, or even \ndeath.\n  Too many of our frailest citizens suffer needlessly and cannot simply \nmove away and escape from the abuse. Frequently, they cannot express \ntheir wishes or their suffering. Even if they can, they often do not \nbecause they fear retaliation.\n  Congress has passed comprehensive bills to address the ugly truth of \ntwo other types of abuse--child abuse and crimes against women. These \nbills have placed these two issues into the national consciousness and \naddressed the issues at the national level.\n  These laws created new Federal infrastructure and funding--focusing \nresources, creating accountability, and changing how we think about and \ntreat the abuse of women and children. Most jurisdictions now have \nestablished coordinated social service, public health, and law \nenforcement approaches to confront these abuses.\n  It is interesting when we look at how Federal dollars are being spent \nin the area of abuse and neglect. On the chart, the area in red \nrepresents the money being spent with regard to child abuse--$6.7 \nbillion on various programs. On the other hand, if you look at what we \nare doing in the area of spousal abuse, domestic abuse, it is about \n$520 million. When you look at how much we are spending on the question \nof elder abuse, it is only a very small amount in comparison--\napproximately 2 percent of the money that is spent on trying to \nalleviate, understand, and prevent abuse. It is focused on the fastest \ngrowing segment of our population, where in our hearings in the Aging \nCommittee we have found it is a substantial and real problem.\n\n  I am not saying domestic abuse and child abuse should be terminated \nfrom the standpoint of spending money to prevent it. Of course not. It \nis a high priority. What we are saying is that we need more attention \non the question of how we treat, as a society, the elderly in our \ncountry, which is the fastest growing segment of our population.\n  Despite dozens of congressional hearings over the past two decades on \nthe devastating effects of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation, \ninterest in the subject has risen and fallen, it has waxed and waned. \nTo date, no Federal law has been enacted to address this issue of elder \nabuse in a comprehensive fashion.\n  In these hearings we had in the Aging Committee, elder abuse was \ncalled a disgrace, a burgeoning national scandal. Indeed, we found no \nsingle Federal employee working full time on the issue of elder abuse \nin the entire Federal Government, in any Department, anywhere.\n  I think the time has come to provide seniors a set of fundamental \nprotections. That is why, along with the colleagues I listed, we have \nintroduced S. 2933, the first comprehensive Federal effort to address \nelder abuse in the United States--the Elder Justice Act of 2002.\n  Our bill will elevate elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation to the \nnational stage in a lasting way. We want to ensure that there is \nFederal leadership to provide resources for the services, prevention, \nand enforcement effort to those on the front lines.\n  You know, a crime is a crime, no matter who the victim is, or \nwherever the victim happens to be, or whatever the age of the victim \nis. Crimes against seniors must certainly be elevated to the level of \nchild abuse and crimes against women.\n  It is clear, in confronting child abuse and violence against women, \nthat the best method of prevention has been a two-pronged approach--\nthrough both law enforcement and social services. With offices in the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, HHS, and the Department of \nJustice, our legislation will ensure a combined public health-law \nenforcement coordination at all levels.\n  In addition, because elder abuse and neglect have been virtually \nabsent from the national research agenda, our legislation establishes \nresearch centers of excellence and funds research projects to fuel \nfuture legislation that may be necessary.\n  These measures lay the foundation to address, in a meaningful and \nlasting way, a devastating and growing problem that has been invisible \nfor far too long. We can no longer neglect these difficult issues \nafflicting frail and elderly victims--American citizens.\n  This effort takes numerous steps to prevent and treat elder abuse. It \nimproves prevention and intervention by funding projects to make older \nAmericans safer in their homes, facilities, and in their neighborhoods, \nto enhance long-term-care staffing, and to stop financial fraud before \nthe money goes out of the door.\n  It enhances detection by creating forensic centers and develops \nexpertise to enhance detection of the problem.\n  It bolsters treatment by funding efforts to find better ways to \nmitigate the devastating consequences of elder mistreatment.\n  It also increases collaboration by requiring ongoing coordination at \nthe Federal level, among Federal, State, local, private entities, law \nenforcement, long-term care facilities, consumer advocates, and \nfamilies, to bring all of these agencies together in a coordinated \nfashion.\n  It aids prosecution by assisting law enforcement and prosecutors to \nensure that those who abuse our Nation's frail elderly will be held \naccountable, wherever the crime occurs and whoever the victim happens \nto be.\n  It also helps consumers by creating a resource center for family \ncaregivers and those trying to make decisions about the different types \nof long-term care providers.\n  The importance of defending our right to live free of suffering from \nabuse and neglect does not diminish with age.\n  If we can unlock the mysteries of science and live longer, what do we \ngain if we fail to ensure that Americans also live better lives and \nlonger lives, lives with dignity? More and more of us will enjoy a \nlonger life in relatively good health, and with this gift comes the \nresponsibility to prevent the needless suffering too often borne by our \nfrailest citizens.\n  I appreciate the work of the members of our Aging Committee and our \ncosponsors and their joint effort with me to put together this \nlegislation. I recommend it be considered by our colleagues and that \nthe Senate proceed ultimately to action on the bill, S. 2933, the Elder \nJustice Act of 2002.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S8594]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong support \nfor the convincing call to action against Iraq that President Bush \nissued yesterday at the United Nations to discuss the unique dangers \ncreated by Saddam Hussein's regime and to argue that it is imperative \nthat the international community, led by the United States of America, \nmobilize now to eliminate those dangers.\n  On September 11, 2001, a foreboding new chapter in American history \nbegan. On that day, our Government was reawakened in this new century \nto its oldest and most solemn responsibility: protecting the lives and \nliberty of the American people.\n  As we survey the landscape of threats to our security in the years \nahead, the greatest are terrorists--al-Qaida and rogue regimes such as \nSaddam Hussein's.\n  Saddam hates America and Americans and is working furiously to \naccumulate deadly weapons of mass destruction and the missiles, planes, \nand unmanned aerial vehicles to use in attacking distant targets.\n  Every day Saddam remains in power is a day of danger for the Iraqi \npeople, for Iraq's neighbors, for the American people, and for the \nworld. As long as Saddam remains in power, there will be no genuine \nsecurity and no lasting peace in the Middle East, among the Arab \nnations or among the Arabs, Israelis, and Christians who live there.\n  The threat Saddam poses has been articulated so often that some may \nhave grown numb to the reality of his brutality. But after September \n11, we must reacquaint ourselves with him because if we do not \nunderstand and act, his next victims, like Osama bin Laden's, could be \ninnocent Americans.\n  President Bush advanced that process with great effectiveness in his \nspeech at the U.N. yesterday, albeit after a season long on the beating \nof drums of war and short on explaining why war may now be necessary. \nBut the President did that yesterday in New York. Now we, in Congress, \nmust go forward together with him as the Constitution's competing \nclauses require us to do. Each of us must decide what actions will best \nadvance America's values and secure the future of the American people.\n  The essential facts are known. We know of the weapons in Saddam's \npossession--chemical, biological, and nuclear in time. We know of his \nunequaled willingness to use them. We know his history, his invasions \nof his neighbors, his dreams of achieving hegemonic control over the \nArab world, his record of anti-American rage, his willingness to \nterrorize, to slaughter, to suppress his own people and others. And we \nneed not stretch to imagine nightmare scenarios in which Saddam makes \ncommon cause with the terrorists who want to kill Americans and destroy \nour way of life.\n  Indeed, 2 days ago on September 11, 2002, the state-owned newspaper \nin Iraq showed a picture of the World Trade Center's Twin Towers in \nflames with the headline ``God's Punishment.''\n  This man--Saddam Hussein--is a menace to the people and the peace of \nthe world. It was his brutal invasion of his peaceful neighbor, Kuwait, \nin August 1990 that first and finally convinced America and the world \nthat Saddam had become a tyrant, like so many before him in world \nhistory, who had to be stopped before he did terrible damage to his \npeople, his region, and the wider world. I was privileged in January of \n1991 to join with my colleague from Virginia, Senator John Warner, in \nsponsoring the Senate resolution that authorized the first President \nBush to go to war against Saddam.\n  The American military fought bravely and brilliantly, in that \nconflict and won an extraordinary victory in rolling back Saddam's \ninvasion of Kuwait. But we did not achieve total victory. On April 9, \n1991, I came to the Senate floor and expressed my disappointment that \nour forces in Desert Storm had not been authorized to remove Saddam \nfrom power, while his military was in disarray.\n  I said then: ``The United States must pursue final victory over \nSaddam. We must use all reasonable diplomatic, economic, and military \nmeans to achieve his removal from power. Until that end is realized, \nthe peace and stability of the region will not have been fully \naccomplished.''\n  In 1997 and 1998, I joined with Senators Bob Kerrey, Trent Lott, and \nJohn McCain to introduce the Iraq Liberation Act, which established in \nlaw for the first time that it is U.S. policy to change the regime in \nBaghdad, not just contain it, and authorized specific assistance, \nincluding military training and equipment, to the Iraqi opposition in \nfurtherance of that goal. That declaration was based on Saddam's record \nof barbarism before, during and after the gulf war, and his repeated \nviolations of U.N. resolutions.\n  On November 13, 1998, after Saddam ejected the U.N. weapons \ninspectors, I said, ``If we let him block the inspections and the \nmonitoring that he agreed to as a condition of the cease-fire in the \ngulf war, then there is no doubt that one day soon, he will use weapons \nof mass destruction, carried by ballistic missiles, against Americans \nin the Middle East or against our allies.''\n  Since then, months and years have passed and the danger from Baghdad \nhas only grown greater. International pressure--legal, diplomatic, \neconomic, and political--has failed to change Saddam's behavior. \nGrowing stockpiles of Iraqi weapons, toxins, and delivery systems have \naccumulated. So too has a growing pile of U.N. resolutions which Saddam \nhas persistently defied. They testify to the repeated opportunities the \ninternational community has given him to prove he has changed and to \nhis determination nonetheless to remain a recidivist international \noutlaw.\n  As President Bush made clear yesterday, this must end. The hour of \ntruth and decision has arrived. This is Saddam's last chance, and the \nUnited Nations' best chance to show that its declarations of \ninternational law stand for something more than the paper on which they \nare written. It is time for all nations, law abiding and peace loving, \nto make clear that, after September 11, the world will not hesitate or \nequivocate while a tyrant stocks his arsenal and builds alliances with \nterrorists.\n  I am grateful that President Bush has effectively begun the critical \nwork of educating the American people, the Congress, and the world \nabout why. Our cause is just. The facts are on our side.\n  ``Making this case'' is not a burden. It is the vital responsibility \nof a democracy's leaders when they have decided that our Nation's \nsecurity may necessitate war.\n  It is an extraordinary opportunity, as well, to engage our allies in \nmeeting the greatest security threat of our generation before it is too \nlate--not just for us but for them. An opportunity to make the \nconsequences of repeated defiance of the United Nations painfully clear \nto Iraq, and to any other government that might follow in its criminal \npath. An opportunity to show the world's law-abiding, peace-loving \nMuslim majority--who share the same values we do, the same aspirations \nwe have for our families, and, I might add, the same extremist foes--\nthat as we oppose tyranny and terror, we will actively support them in \ntheir fight for freedom and a better life.\n  President Bush has acted wisely and decisively in asking the United \nNations to lead this noble effort, to insist that Iraq obey its \nresolutions, and to be prepared to enforce them militarily if Iraq does \nnot comply. But if Saddam does not comply, and the United Nations \nproves itself unwilling or unable to take decisive action, then the \nUnited States surely can and must assemble and lead an international \nmilitary coalition to enforce the United Nations resolutions and \nliberate the Iraqi people, the Middle East and the world from Saddam \nHussein. If we lead, I am confident many other nations will come to our \nside.\n\n  For more than 11 years now, since the early spring of 1991, I have \nsupported the use of military force to disarm Iraq and to remove Saddam \nHussein from power. In fact, since the Iraq Liberation Act was passed \nby Congress and signed by President Clinton in 1998, that has been the \nlaw of our land. Therefore, I am fully supportive of such military \naction now.\n  I know that many of my colleagues in the Senate believe thoughtfully \nand\n\n[[Page S8595]]\n\nsincerely that it would be preferable to give support to the President \nin two stages, first to endorse yesterday's call for U.N action, and \nthen to return later, if the U.N. does not act, to authorize the use of \nAmerica's military power against Iraq. Other Members of the Senate are \nunderstandably concerned that a debate on the question of war against \nIraq may be unnecessarily politicized if it occurs in the more heated \nenvironment of this fall's congressional elections.\n  But the White House has made it clear it will ask for a resolution of \nsupport and authorization in the very near future. Each member of the \nSenate must, and I am confident will, face that reality in a spirit of \nnon-partisanship, going where their hearts and heads take them, in \ndeciding how best to fulfill our Constitutional responsibility to \nprovide for the common defense in the current circumstances. For my \npart, I intend to work with Members of both parties in the Senate with \nthe White House to draft a Senate resolution that will receive the \nbroadest possible bipartisan support for the President, as Commander in \nChief, as he works to protect our Nation and the world from Saddam \nHussein.\n  On October 22, 1962, as nuclear weapons were being amassed in Cuba, \nPresident, Kennedy spoke to the Nation and warned Americans of the need \nto act in the face of the rising threat. President Kennedy's courageous \nand eloquent words can guide us now. He said on that occasion.\n\n       My fellow citizens, let no one doubt that this is a \n     difficult and dangerous effort on which we have set out. No \n     one can see precisely what course it will take or what costs \n     or casualties will be incurred. Many months of sacrifice and \n     self-discipline lie ahead, months in which many threats and \n     denunciations will keep us aware of our dangers. But the \n     greatest danger of all would be to do nothing.\n       The path we have chosen for the present is full of hazards, \n     as all paths are, but it is the one most consistent with our \n     character and courage as a nation and our commitments around \n     the world. The cost of freedom is always high, and Americans \n     have always paid it but there is one path we shall never \n     choose, and that is the path of surrender or submission.\n       Our goal is not the victory of might, but the vindication \n     of right--not peace at the expense of freedom, but both peace \n     and freedom, here . . . and, we hope, around the world. God \n     willing, that goal will be achieved.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/13/senate-section/article/S8595-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8595-S8609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HOMELAND SECURITY ACT OF 2002\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln).

Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWest Virginia is to be recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I do not expect to yield, except for \nquestions. I have several thoughts with respect to the pending measure. \nI can speak at great length. Only the Lord can intervene and make that \nstatement fall. But I don't expect to do that today.\n  House Republicans yesterday criticized the majority leader and the \nmanagers of the bill, Senator Lieberman, for not moving quickly enough \nto pass legislation to create a new Homeland Security Department. They \naccuse the Senate Democratic leadership of endangering the country by \nnot passing legislation.\n  We are going to hear more and more of that. There is no excuse for \nnot giving the people of this country a homeland security bill, said \nthe Speaker of the House yesterday.\n  Let me say again what the Speaker of the House yesterday said: There \nis no excuse for not giving the people of this country a homeland \nsecurity bill.\n  What a flimsy argument, with all due respect, and I have great \nrespect for the Speaker. I know the rules of the Senate and the House. \nI am not going to go beyond that quotation in referring to what the \nSpeaker of the House said. I am not going to go beyond that to in any \nway appear, in any way, and I do not now appear, even presume; I don't \nwant anyone to presume or to assume or to interpret what I say as any \npersonal criticism of the Speaker of the House of Representatives. But \nwhat a flimsy argument. We are going to hear that argument; we are \ngoing to hear it from other people. It will not be long in coming, if \nit has not already been expressed by others. But worse than flimsy is \nthe kind of argument we ought not be making. It is an empty argument. \nIt is shallow. That kind of argument cannot stand up under its own \nweight, that there is no excuse for not giving the people of this \ncountry a homeland security bill.\n\n  Let us be clear about a few things. Neither the House bill nor the \nPresident's proposal would create any new agencies. They are proposing \nonly to move existing agencies from one Department to another. The \nImmigration and Naturalization Service, the Customs Service, the Coast \nGuard, all of these agencies currently exist. They are operating. They \nare funded. And the people are out there working day and night. These \nagencies have been working around the clock since the terrorist attacks \nlast year on September 11. They have been out there working. They were \non the borders. They were patrolling the U.S. waterways last night, the \nnight before, and the night before that, and in all of the nights that \nhave occurred, beginning on September 11, and before.\n  Whether or not we create a new Homeland Security Department, and \nregardless of when we do it, these same agencies will continue to \nprotect our homeland. The funds are there. The funds are being used. \nThe people are there on the job. So do not have any concern about that. \nThey are not absent their protest and they are not empty handed. They \nare not empty handed. They are working.\n  Now, we must be careful about how we create this Department. And I \nwant to create this Department of Homeland Security; I want to create a \nDepartment of Homeland Security. But I am not one who wants to debate \nthe bill on the Senate floor for 2 days and vote on it. That is what \nthe House did, the other body. They have their own rules. I have been a \nMember, many years ago. I say ``many;'' many in the context of the \nordinary lifetime of many years ago. They have their rules. I don't \ncriticize that at all. They can operate fast. The House can operate \nquickly, they can operate fast, and so can the Senate, as we did last \nyear when we passed an appropriations bill within 3 days of the fall of \nthe towers, the Twin Towers. We passed an appropriations bill within 3 \ndays, a bill appropriating $40 billion.\n  The Senate can act fast, too. But thank God, the Senate has different \nrules from the rules of the other body. And that is no criticism of the \nrules of the other body. But why the hurry? Why pass a bill in 2 \ndays? Why should the Senate not take a little time and discuss this? \nThe people are out there. Our security people are at their posts. They \nhave been funded. As a matter of fact, the Senate has passed bills \ncoming out of the Appropriations Committee, chaired by me and with the \nranking member, Mr. Ted Stevens, a former chairman of that committee, \nand all of the members acting unanimously--Republicans and Democrats \nalike. We have provided funds, more funds than the President has been \nwilling to sign into law. We sought to provide $2.5 billion in a bill. \nAll the President needed was to sign his name. That was all he needed. \nTwo point five billion more would have been available--for what? For \nhomeland security. And the President had 30 days in which to sign that \nmeasure into law. He refused to sign it into law. So who is in a hurry?\n\n[[Page S8596]]\n\n  The real threat to the American people is that by transferring 22 \nagencies and 122,000 employees to this new Department, all at once we \nwill throw our homeland security efforts into a state of chaos and \ntherefore make the country even more susceptible to a terrorist attack. \nWhat is more, if we are not careful about how we create this Department \nand the authorities that we grant to this new Department with regard to \nits intelligence and law enforcement powers, we could do irreparable \nharm to the constitutional liberties of the American people.\n  For this reason, 26 leaders of nationally prominent conservative \norganizations have urged the Senate to exercise--and I use quotes--\n``restraint, caution, and deeper scrutiny before hastily granting \nunnecessary powers to a homeland security bureaucracy.''\n  Let me say that again: 26 leaders of nationally prominent \nconservative organizations have urged the Senate to exercise \n``restraint, caution, and deeper scrutiny before hastily granting \nunnecessary powers to a homeland security bureaucracy.''\n  I say to those who would say there is no excuse for not giving the \npeople of this country a homeland security bill: Don't push this \nSenate. Don't push it. The Senate will act in due time. Don't push this \nSenate. Back off. Don't push this Congress as a whole into unwise and \nhasty decisions that would make this country even more vulnerable to \nanother terrorist attack.\n  That attack can happen right now, later today, tonight. Why should we \nhurry in acting on this particular measure? The people are out there. \nThe people in the agencies, the Customs, the Coast Guard, the \nNaturalization and Immigration Service, at the ports of entry into this \ncountry, at the river ports, at the seaports, food inspectors, the \nhealth officials, the firemen, the policemen--they have been there. We \nhave done our part, up to this point, by funding those agencies that \nprovide security to the country, to the nuclear facilities, along the \nborder. We have funded them. We have provided more funds than the \nPresident himself has been willing to sign a bill for. They have been \nthere. He had days to sign that bill, but he didn't do it. Now the hue \nand cry is: Pass this bill, the homeland security bill.\n  The House of Representatives passed it in 2 days. That is all right; \ntheir rules will allow them to do that. But I say to the leadership in \nthe House, and to the leadership down at the other end of this avenue: \nDon't push the Senate. Don't push the Congress into unwise and hasty \ndecisions that would make this country more vulnerable to another \nterrorist attack. Don't push the American people. Don't push the \nAmerican people, I say, as I look through those electronic eyes, the \nlenses there. Don't push those people into handing over their civil \nliberties.\n\n  Now, pay attention. Not much attention has been paid thus far to my \nexpression of concerns about this hasty action on this legislation. But \ndon't push the American people into handing over their civil liberties \nin the name of homeland security. And some debate on this bill--when I \nsay this bill, the House bill or the Lieberman substitute--debate will \nsurface, will open the eyes of the American people and the eyes of \nSenators, to the threat of eroding the liberties of the American \npeople.\n  Don't risk eroding the liberties of the American people. It doesn't \nsound like passing a homeland security bill would do all that, does it? \nIt has an innocent sounding name, a good name. But let's take a look at \nthe bill. Read closely the bill. Don't push the American people into \nhanding over their civil liberties in the name of homeland security.\n  Everybody understands when our Nation is put on a wartime footing, we \nhave to put certain limits on ourselves. But take a look at this bill. \nTake a look at the bill. Don't risk eroding the liberties of the \nAmerican people and lead the public to believe this proposal is a \npanacea for homeland defense. That is what the administration is \npressing for. That is what those who are pressing the Senate are \npressing for when they argue that the Senate is endangering the \nsecurity of the American people by not quickly passing the President's \nproposal. I believe that the administration and others who take that \nposition have lost sight of the real goal here, which is not a Homeland \nSecurity Department but a more secure homeland.\n  The President and his administration seem more concerned with scoring \na political victory, maybe, than whether a Homeland Security Department \nwill actually work and will actually protect the American people from \nanother terrorist attack.\n  My interpretation of what is being done is--I have to say that I can \nbe wrong, too. Perhaps I am putting the wrong interpretation on it. \nPerhaps the President is not more concerned with scoring a political \nvictory than whether the Homeland Security Department will actually \nprotect the American people from another terrorist attack. I don't want \nto read it that way. I don't want to misinterpret it. I don't want to \nsee the President as doing that, or feeling that way about it. I don't \nwant to even assume that is his motivation. But that is the motivation \nof some. That is the motivation of some.\n  Forty-one Senators opposed the Thompson amendment to strike titles II \nand III from the Lieberman substitute. Yet there is only one Senator on \nthe floor defending those titles. I did not draft the language. Yet I \nam the only one fighting for it. I am the only one fighting at the \nmoment to retain titles II and III of the bill. I will have something \nto say about those titles at some point.\n  When I say titles II and III, I am talking about the Lieberman \nproposal. Let me briefly explain what my amendment does so those who \nare listening will understand that my amendment is not seriatim to the \nbill that has been introduced by Senator Lieberman. My amendment only \ngoes to title I of that bill. There are 24 titles to the bill. My \namendment only goes to title I of Mr. Lieberman's bill. I am not yet \naddressing the House bill. That is far worse. The House bill is really \na poison pill.\n  Mr. Lieberman's bill has 24 titles listed. My amendment only goes to \ntitle I.\n  Mr. Lieberman's proposal has encompassed in the bill that was \nreported by the committee a Department of Homeland Security. I am for \nthat. My amendment does not do otherwise in support of a Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  The Lieberman proposal provides for a Secretary. My amendment \nprovides for a Secretary.\n  The Lieberman proposal provides for a Deputy Secretary. My amendment \nprovides for a Deputy Secretary.\n  The Lieberman proposal provides for seven Under Secretaries. My \nproposal provides for seven Under Secretaries.\n  The Lieberman proposal provides for five Assistant Secretaries in \ntitle I. My amendment provides for five Assistant Secretaries in title \nI.\n  The Lieberman proposal proposes six directorates. My proposal \nprovides for six directorates in title I.\n  There is another directorate provided for in title XI. I don't touch \nthat at the moment. My amendment does not touch that. We are only \ntalking about title I in my amendment.\n  Thus far, the same superstructure that is provided for by Mr. \nLieberman is provided by the amendment which I have introduced--the \nsame thing; no change; nothing different about that.\n  The Lieberman proposal provides for a huge transaction here, which \nMr. Lieberman has told me involves 28 agencies and offices. We have \nheard the figure 22 bandied around here. I have seen those all over the \npress. I accepted that figure for a while, until I asked Mr. Lieberman \nhow many agencies are we really talking about. He said: I have counted \nthem, and I count 28 agencies and offices, and 170,000 Federal workers \nbeing transferred to this Department.\n  I don't say anything criticizing Mr. Lieberman's bill. I am comparing \nmy amendment in certain respects with the bill which was reported by \nthe Senate committee which Mr. Lieberman chairs and of which Mr. \nThompson is ranking member.\n  That bill provides for all this huge transaction--all of this \nmovement of people, all of this shifting around of people in the \nagencies, or among the agencies in which they are presently working. \nAnd it provides for all this to be done--for these agencies to be \nshifted into the new Department.\n  Their letterheads will probably change. Their telephone numbers will \nprobably change. The offices in which they serve today may or may not\n\n[[Page S8597]]\n\nchange. They may be moved up Pennsylvania Avenue to a new place. They \nmay have to move their desks and their telephones and their computer \nsystems. Their culture will change. They may not have the same \nassociates. They may not be located in the same location. Their \ntelephone numbers may be changed. Their missions may be changed. Their \nassignments may be changed. Their objectives, overall, may be changed. \nWe have seen the objectives of the FBI, for example, change since the \nSeptember 11 attacks.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Just in a moment, if I may, and then I will yield.\n  They are undergoing all of these changes. This will all be done \nwithin a period of 13 months following the signing by the President of \nthe act. Thirteen months after that act becomes law, all this will be \ncompleted. My amendment does not change that calendar date as to when \nthis massive transaction will be completed.\n  My amendment provides that at the end of the 13 months this is \nenvisioned as to be done the same way, the same thing--not the same \nway, but the same time period over all. Thirteen months occurs with \nrespect to the Lieberman bill and with respect to my amendment, if my \namendment is adopted--the same time period, 13 months.\n  So what is the difference? Under the bill, the committee bill, once \nthe Senate passes whatever it passes, and that is sent to conference, \nand it comes back, and it is signed into law, Congress is out of it \nexcept with respect to the appropriations that will go forward to the \nagency, to the new Department. When the Senate passes this bill and \nsends it to conference, for all purposes of amending that process in \nthe Senate, it is over. When it goes to conference, whatever comes back \nfrom the conference between the two Houses--the Republican-controlled \nHouse and the Democratic-controlled Senate--whatever comes back from \nthat conference is it.\n  We have one more--one more--chance, and that is in voting up or down \non that conference report. When that conference report comes back to \nthe Senate, it may not even look like the bill that passed the Senate. \nHa, ha, ha. Now, Senators, you may have an entirely different breed of \nlegislation on this bill when it comes back. It is there. You can vote \nit up or down. But, Senators, you will not be able to offer any \namendments to that conference report. You can vote it down, you can \nvote it up, but you cannot change it.\n  It may be virtually an entirely new proposition. Who knows what the \nconferees will agree to. Senators, you are having your last chance here \nwhen we vote, eventually, on this bill, if we do.\n  So why, why, why should Senators just roll over and play dead, as it \nwere; perhaps come to the floor, make a short speech--of 10 minutes, 15 \nminutes--in support of the bill, or a short speech in opposition to it? \nWhy should Senators have to do that within the next week, let's say, or \n2 weeks or 3 weeks? Why should Senators have to do that before a new \nCongress sits in January?\n  Let me repeat, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the \nCustoms Service, the Coast Guard, other existing agencies that provide \nsecurity to our country and to us--all of these agencies currently \nexist. The agencies have been working around the clock since the \nterrorist attacks last year. They were on the borders. They were \npatrolling U.S. waterways.\n  Whether or not we create a new Department of Homeland Security in \nSeptember, whether or not we create a Department of Homeland Security \nin October, whether or not we create a Department of Homeland Security \nin November, whether or not we create a Department of Homeland Security \nin December, these same agencies will continue to protect our homeland.\n  Now, back to my amendment, and then, shortly, I will yield to the \nSenator for a question.\n  What is the difference between the bill, then, and my amendment? I \nhave already said as to the superstructure, as to the overall time \nperiod of 13 months, we are in lockstep, we are in lockstep with Mr. \nLieberman and his committee.\n  Now, here is the difference. Here comes the difference: Remember, \nthis is all to be done within 13 months. Under the Lieberman committee \nproposal, once this bill that is before the Senate--once whatever the \nSenate passes, and it is concurred in by both Houses--whatever package \nis sent to the President, and he signs it, these things are going to \ntake place.\n  We are going to do it in the same period of time, but under the Byrd \namendment, all of this chaotic happening is not going to occur at once. \nWe are not going to pass the bill and send it to the President and say: \nNow, Mr. President, it's all yours. We're going to step off to the \nsideline. Congress is not going to have any more part in it. We have \npassed the bill. It sets up the new Department by legislation. It deals \nwith 22 or 28 or 30--that many--agencies and offices. So here it is. \nHere is the bill. Here is our bill. It's yours. Under the Lieberman \napproach, it's yours. You have 13 months to do it in. Have at it. Good \nluck. Good luck, Mr. President. Here's the package. It's all yours.\n  Can Senators imagine the chaos that will occur in trying to do all of \nthis in a way that is other than systematic and orderly?\n  My amendment provides an orderly process whereby on February 3--if \nthe amendment is included in the act--on February 3, the Secretary of \nthe new Department would send up his recommendations as to what \nagencies, what functions, what assignments, and so on, would need to be \ncarried out to complete the flushing out of this skeleton, of putting \ninto effect the establishment of the first directorate.\n  Remember, I said that there were directorates in the Lieberman bill. \nThere are Directorates in the Byrd amendment.\n  The Secretary of the Department of Homeland Defense, the new \nDepartment--which will be established by this law, if it becomes law--\nthe Secretary sends up his policies, his recommendations as to what \nagencies shall go into this new Directorate. That is on February 3.\n  The recommendations of the Secretary will be sent to the committee in \nthe Senate and the committee in the House that have jurisdiction over \nthis subject matter. Mr. Lieberman's committee and Mr. Thompson's \ncommittee, their committee will still be in the mix. Their committee \nwill still be front and center.\n  Under my amendment, we are not going to say: OK, Mr. President, here \nit is. Have a good time. Good luck to you. Enjoy what you are doing. We \nare just going to move off to the side.\n  Our committee is going to say: All right, we have a department. We \nare going to create this first directorate. We are going to have this \nnew Secretary of Homeland Defense send up his policy recommendations to \nthe House and Senate. They will be referred to the committees of \njurisdiction, Mr. Lieberman's committee in the Senate, and his \ncounterpart committee in the House. And those committees will take \nthese policy recommendations that have been sent up by the Secretary of \nthe Department of Homeland Security, and they will treat those as \nrecommendations for a bill.\n  They will look over those policies. They will debate them in the \ncommittee. They will report, ultimately, a bill which accepts the \npolicies or which amends those policies.\n  There will be, in my concept, an expedited procedure where that bill \ndoes not just go through the committee and lie there. But within 120 \ndays after the policies have been sent to the Congress by the \nSecretary, the Secretary then, 120 days later, or on June 3, would be \nrequired to send up his recommendations for fleshing out the next two \ndirectorates which are named in Mr. Lieberman's bill also.\n  The second proposal, there will be the Directorate of Intelligence \nand the Directorate of Critical Infrastructure Protection. Those \ndirectorates are named in the Lieberman bill.\n  But we say, now, the first directorate that we will deal with will be \nthe directorate of Border and Transportation Protection. All of these \ndirectorates are the same directorates as are provided for in the \nLieberman bill. But we are saying that the first directorate to be \ndecided upon and to be fleshed out will be the Directorate of Border \nTransportation and Protection.\n  That is February 3. So there is 120 days for action to be taken in \nmoving those agencies that are involved in the\n\n[[Page S8598]]\n\nDirectorate of Border and Transportation Protection into the \nDepartment. One hundred twenty days later, June 3, the Secretary will \nsend up his recommendations for the Directorate of Intelligence and for \nthe Directorate of Critical Infrastructure Protection; 120 days later, \nor October 1, the Secretary would send up his recommendations. And in \neach of these three phases, Mr. Lieberman's committee would take the \nrecommendations of the Secretary. And in each, the Lieberman committee \nwill report to the Senate a bill containing the recommendations of the \nSecretary. They may have been amended in the committee. They may have \nbeen modified somewhat. But Mr. Lieberman's committee would then report \nthat and so would the House committee report that bill to their \nrespective houses, and then the respective houses would take up the \nbill under expedited procedures, as I conceive it, expedited \nprocedures. So there could be no filibuster.\n  That committee can be discharged from the bill. If the committee \ncannot report the bill, the committee will be discharged, and it will \ncome to the full body, in the House or in the Senate, whichever is \nhaving a problem.\n\n  So we have three phases, each phase of 4 months. The first phase will \ntake a look at that, the committee does, the Senate does. There you go, \nyou have a directorate in being, one directorate, the agencies, the \nnumber of people that will be moved into that particular directorate, \nthat will be going forward.\n  When it comes time, on June 3, for us to take a look at the policies, \nat the recommendations sent by the Secretary ensuring the next two \ndirectorates, we will have the advantage of seeing the mistakes, seeing \nthe errors, seeing the faults, seeing the shortcomings of the way these \nagencies were moved into the first directorate. So we profit by staying \nin the mix. Congress profits, and the people represented by the \nCongress profit.\n  Perhaps I should not use the word ``profit.'' They ``benefit'' from \nthe experience in fleshing out that first directorate. Then comes along \nthe second and third directorates, every 4 months, and the same thing \nhappens. And then the fourth and fifth directorates come along 4 months \nlater, and the same thing obtains. The recommendations go to the two \ncommittees. They are reported out under expedited procedures. Each \nHouse would be required to go to the measure under expedited \nprocedures, and it is passed.\n  Congress stays in the mix. Why Congress? Because Congress is made up \nof the elected, directly elected, not sent here by any electoral \ncollege but directly elected by the people of Arkansas or the people of \nMinnesota or West Virginia. So Congress stays in the mix.\n  It is phased. There is an orderly process of doing what Mr. Lieberman \nwants to do and over the same time period. So we come out at the end, \n13 months; we have created this Department that Mr. Lieberman creates. \nWe have created six of the seven directorates that Mr. Lieberman's bill \ncreates, and we have set up the superstructure. We have appointed the \nsame number of directors, the same number of Secretaries, the same \nnumber of under secretaries, the same number of assistant secretaries--\nall of it.\n  We take Mr. Lieberman's proposal, but we say we won't just turn it \nover to the administration the day after it is passed. We will go off \nfishing, if it is summertime, or perhaps we can go play golf. We will \njust quit. That is the responsibility of the administration, his bill \nsays.\n  Mine says, oh, no. No. That is the responsibility of Congress and the \nadministration--Congress working with the administration; the \nadministration working with Congress in an orderly process. The people \nin 28 agencies won't have to be moving their desks all at once. It will \nbe some now; 4 months later, some more; 4 months later, the rest.\n  What's wrong with that? That provides an orderly process. Madam \nPresident, I think at this point I have explained enough of what my \namendment does to yield to the distinguished Senator from Minnesota for \na question. We will have plenty of opportunity later to explain what my \namendment does. I want people to go home this weekend to know what my \namendment does. That is it in a nutshell.\n  I don't claim to be a medicine man. I don't claim to be a magician. I \ndon't say watch what is in my right hand and don't watch what the left \nhand is doing. It is there. This is it.\n  Yesterday, included in the Congressional Record was a brief statement \nexplaining the amendment. I also tried to explain it on the floor \ntoday. I have been up all night and the night before with my wife in \nthe hospital. I sat right in her room all night, watching her and \nreading my Constitution again. It is a little hard to make things quite \ncome together as one would like when one has lost sleep. I merely \nmention that so that everybody will know that I have tried to explain \nthe purpose of my amendment, but not under the best conditions.\n  I yield now to the distinguished Senator from Minnesota for a \nquestion only, retaining my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Baucus). The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia, \nwhose explanation has been very clear--last night and also today. I \ntrust the Senator's amendment comes from wisdom gained from many years \nof watching executive branch organizations, new departments brought \ntogether, and, of course, the Senator has the sweep of history both in \nthis institution, and also I recall hearing the Senator last week quote \na Roman, and I must confess a week later, whose name and statement I \nhave forgotten, but which the Senator has remembered for all these \nyears. It was something to the effect that reorganizations are just \nanother way of delaying and confusing matters.\n  I wonder if the Senator can share some of that experience gained and \nthe insight into other organizations or reorganizations of Federal \nagencies, and how that might have suggested some of the oversight that \nthe Senator has in his amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the very dedicated, patriotic, able, \nand distinguished Senator for the diligence with which he pursues his \nresponsibilities as a U.S. Senator. I appreciate very much what he has \nsaid with reference to me. Those remarks are very flattering. They \nmight, if left alone, appear to be more than exactly the fact. I don't \nhave a lot of experience, but I have seen some departments created \nduring my tenure. I remember the new Department of Health, Education \nand Welfare, I believe it was called. I remember I was here and voted \nfor that Department; the new Department of Energy, I voted for that; \nthe new Department of Education, I voted for that; the new Department \nof Veterans Affairs, I voted for that.\n  Now, as to reorganizations, I can take a look at recent experience as \nto reorganizations. The administration, since the September 11 attacks, \nhas announced at least 3 major governmental reorganizations prior to \nthe President's proposal to create a new Homeland Security Department.\n\n  Last December, in response to numerous media reports criticizing the \nNation's porous borders, the administration proposed the consolidation \nof the Customs Service and the Immigration and Naturalization Service \nwithin the Justice Department. Last March, following the mailing of two \nstudent visas by the INS to two of the September 11 hijackers 6 months \nafter they crashed planes into the World Trade Center Towers, the \nadministration announced that the INS, the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, would be reorganized--split into a services \nbureau and a separate enforcement bureau.\n  Last May, following the reports about intelligence failures by the \nFBI, the administration announced a reorganization of the FBI. These \nreorganizations have either produced very little, or they have been \nreplaced by subsequent additional reorganization proposals. It is as if \nwe are spinning around in circles, with little left to show for all of \nthe energy that we have expended, little left but dizziness. To avoid a \nsimilar fate of this new department, which I support--I am not opposed \nto creating a new Department of Homeland Security. As a matter of fact, \nI urged that months ago.\n  The story behind that, which I recounted more than once, about the \nefforts of Senator Stevens and myself to have Tom Ridge, the Director \nof Homeland Security, which was created by\n\n[[Page S8599]]\n\nPresidential Executive order--not by statute--come up and testify \nbefore the Senate Appropriations Committee on the budget, on the \nhomeland security agency's budget, he would not come. I have gone \nthrough that ad nauseam, time and time again. I may go through it \nagain.\n  Right now, it is sufficient to say that we had an unfortunate \nexperience there. So I suggested that we have the Homeland Security \nDirector be a person appointed by the President, and with the consent \nof the Senate, requiring Senate confirmation of that position, that \nofficer. I recommended that, and we could not get him to come by \ninvitation, the President having put his foot down hard and in \nconcrete, being immovable, claiming that ``this is my staff person, \nthis is my adviser. He is not required to go up there.'' Well, with all \nof the responsibilities and the authorities that were being assumed or \ncarried out by the new Homeland Security Director, Mr. Ridge--he was \ngoing all over the country speaking to chambers of commerce, explaining \nhis work and the things we were doing and the things we needed to do to \nsecure our homeland--he would appear anywhere, anytime, apparently, \nbecause I read of many of his appearances around the country.\n  Each time I read about his being here, there, or out in Montana, or \nwherever, I thought: Why can't he come up before the people's branch \nand tell the people's representatives what he wants, what he needs, \nwhat this country needs, what the people need for their security and \nsafety? Why doesn't he come before the elected representatives of the \npeople? Oh, yes, he is an adviser to the President, but the President \nhas lots of them. He is on the staff of the President, yes. But this \nman is carrying a much larger bag of responsibilities than the ordinary \nstaff person, the ordinary adviser to the President.\n  I know the President has to have advisers to whom he can talk. They \ndo not need to come before Congress. I told the administration: Look, \nwe are not going to ask Mr. Ridge, your Homeland Security Director, who \nwas appointed pursuant to a Presidential order--we are not going to ask \nhim about his private conversations with the President. We are not \ninterested.\n  We want to ask this man, who is the point man for the administration \non homeland security--he is the person who is running around telling \neverybody what it is. He is the man running around all over the country \nspilling his beans to this agency, that agency, whatever agency, \nwhatever committee or whatever group of people, fraternal order or \ncivic order, whatever it might be--he is the man running all over the \ncountry talking to the people everywhere and going up to Canada. He is \nthe man who has gone down to Mexico and talked about various and sundry \nsubjects pertaining to border controls, surely, and so on.\n  Why can't he come to Jenkins Hill, on which this great architectural \nstructure has been for 200 years or thereabouts? Why can't he come here \nand answer questions by the people's elected representatives in the \nCongress? After all, it is the people's money. He is being paid out of \nthe pockets of the American people, this Mr. Ridge is. Pennies do not \nfall from heaven. He is being paid by the taxpayers, and the President \nis being paid by the taxpayers. Who pays him?\n  He says this man cannot come up, this man does not have to go up to \nCongress. That is the President talking. Who pays him? The people. The \npeople. Who pays us? The people. So the people are entitled to know a \nlittle about this, about how their moneys are being spent.\n  That is why we have public hearings in the Appropriations Committee \nand by the subcommittees of the Appropriations Committee. The hearings \nare in public. The hearings are open. There can be a huge audience out \nthere in some of those massive, handsome rooms over in the Senate \noffice buildings. People can hear. They can see on television. They can \nhear over the radio. They can hear their people, their representatives, \nand they can hear the President's man, all of us being paid by the \npeople, some of us being elected by the people.\n  But some of those who testify are not elected by the people. Tom \nRidge is not elected by the people; he has not been elected by the \npeople, except to run as Governor of Pennsylvania and run for \nmembership in the other body, which he has done. He has been Governor \nof Pennsylvania. He has been a Member of the other body of the \nCongress. So he is a man who knows a great deal about the subject \nmatter, and he has thrown himself into his work. He is the expert. He \nknows the answers to a lot of these questions. He is a very intelligent \nman, a very articulate person. He is the person in charge.\n  Why shouldn't the Congress hear him? They said: We will be happy to \nsend him up for briefings. He can meet with Senators and House Members \nand have little briefings, and we can tell you all about it. That is \nnot the point. His portfolio is much greater than the portfolio of an \naverage staff person of the President or an ``adviser'' to the \nPresident.\n  He is dealing with a subject that is virtually brand new to the \nAmerican people. Last September 11 brought to the view of the American \npeople something we had not seen before, something we had not \nexperienced before, and opened to all of us a new kind of world, and \nthe world is changed forever. Our country in some ways is changed \nforever. Every person in this country--man, woman, boy, or girl--their \nlife is changed forever. It is not going to be a short time. The \nPresident himself has said this war--they call it a war; it is a \ndifferent kind of war--this war is going to last a long time. It is \ngoing to take us a long time.\n\n  Does anyone think we are going to get all the terrorists ever? No. We \nhave not even gotten Bin Laden yet. We do not know where he is. He may \nbe alive; he may not be alive. But whether he is alive or not, his \nagents are spread, we hear, in 60 countries or more. This is something \nbig, and it affects our lives, it affects our work in the Senate.\n  Why shouldn't the person who is the top man in the United States with \nreference to homeland security appear before a Senate committee, the \nAppropriations Committee? We are not seeking to put him on the spot or \nto embarrass the President by some question, such as: Tell me about \nyour private conversations with your President. We are not going to do \nthat.\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee has been in business for 135 \nyears. This committee was established in 1867. Think of that. Two years \nafter the Civil War ended--1867. Fifty percent, or more--a very high \npercentage--a great majority of some of our students in the polls do \nnot know when the Civil War ended; they do not know that it even \noccurred in this country.\n  But we know that in 1867 this Appropriations Committee in the Senate \nwas established. Before that, the Finance Committee in the Senate, \nwhich had been established in 1816, did the appropriations work, as \nwell as raising taxes, and so on. In 1867, the Finance Committee did \nthat work no longer. Seven Members of the Senate were appointed to this \nnew Appropriations Committee. I believe it was seven Members. In any \nevent, the Appropriations Committee has been doing business ever since.\n  The way we have done business is the right way. We get testimony; we \nget people to appear before the subcommittees. There are 13 \nsubcommittees of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and every one of \nthose subcommittees has subpoena power in that Appropriations \nCommittee. That committee has subpoena power--the Appropriations \nCommittee. No wonder everyone wants on the Appropriations Committee.\n  That Appropriations Committee deals with the public purse, and by \nvirtue of this Constitution, the power of the purse is vested in the \nlegislative branch. Article I, section 9, of this Constitution, which I \nhold in my hand, vests the power of the purse in this body. So the \nright way to do it is to have public hearings.\n  The people need to know what questions are asked. The people need to \nknow what answers are being given.\n  It is out there. Everybody can see it. Everybody can hear it. There \nis a record of it.\n  Then when the appropriations bill is put together, the testimony of \nthese witnesses is read again. There are hearings printed. Hearings \nwill be available to members of the Appropriations Committee of what \nwas said during the testimony by Mr. Ridge, if he had come before the \ncommittee. And when the bill is taken up on the floor, there are\n\n[[Page S8600]]\n\nthe printed hearings. They are available. There is a committee report--\naha, a committee report on that bill--for the benefit of the Senators \nwho are to vote on the bill.\n  That committee report is important. It is really laughable that the \nadministration would propose that they would be willing to send up this \nman, who is the know-all, as far as anyone can know, about homeland \nsecurity and what is being done by our Government, or what we hope to \ndo--So the American people need to know that. The committee needs to \nknow that. But he is going to come up in a private briefing? That is \nthe administration's proposal: No, we will not let him come up there \nand get before that committee. No, no, no. He is the President's man. \nWe are not going to let him come up. You do not call Condoleezza Rice. \nHe is in the same position.\n  No, he is not. You cannot equate the one with the other in this \nrespect.\n  So the committee is going to write a report. How important is a \ncommittee report? Suppose there is a court case at some point with \nrespect to a provision in a bill. One of the things the court would \nneed to know is what was said in the committee. In order to get the \nintention of the legislators, in order for the court to interpret the \nintention of the legislators with respect to that particular bill or \nthat particular provision, the court may want to resort to a committee \nreport. That has happened before in this country.\n  What committee report is going to be around where we have a shadow \ngovernment, as it were, with the administration officials coming up to \nthe Senate and talking in private, behind closed doors? Oh, the doors \ncan be open, that is all right, but there is no record. The people out \nthere do not see what is going on. What kind of government is that?\n  This is an open government--it is supposed to be--with respect to its \nappropriations, with respect to our bills. How utterly foolish the \nadministration was to take that utterly foolish position in refusing to \nallow Tom Ridge to come before the Appropriations Committee of the \nCongress. That was utterly foolish. It poisoned the well.\n  The result was a provision which Senator Stevens and I wrote into an \nappropriations bill providing that the Director of Homeland Security \nwould indeed require confirmation by the Senate of the United States, \nand that appropriations bill came before the Senate not too long ago. \nNot one finger was raised against it. Not one Senator rose to strike \nthat language from the bill.\n  It was in the bill. Everybody knew it. The staff of every Senator saw \nit. They knew it, or they should have known it. Not one effort was made \nto remove it. That overall appropriations bill passed the Senate, \nincluding that provision, by a vote of 71 to 22--quite a secure \nmajority, 71 to 22. I will try to remember that. That bill was passed, \nincluding that provision.\n  I say to the distinguished senior Senator from Montana who presides \ntoday, that bill passed the Senate by a vote of 71 to 22, and went to \nconference.\n\n  Oh, wait a minute. The administration suddenly sees on the horizon, \nhere comes this bill, here comes this provision. Oh, Mr. Director, Mr. \nTom Ridge, you know the Senate has--here it is right here, this \nappropriations bill. They are going to make you come up there. They are \ngoing to make you come up there.\n  Mr. President, look at this bill here. The Senate is going to make \nthis man come before the Senate of the United States in the \nAppropriations Committee. The President will not be able to say, well, \nhe is an adviser of mine; he cannot come. The President will not be \nable to put his feet in concrete and say, this man is on my staff and \nmy staff people do not have to come.\n  Mr. President, it is in this bill. I do not care what you say. You \ncan veto the bill, if you want to. Do you want to veto that \nappropriations bill? Do you want to veto that appropriations bill \nbecause it has that provision? Then you will have to explain to the \nAmerican people why you will not let this man go before the \nAppropriations Committee of the Senate and answer questions of interest \nto the American people, questions dealing with their money, the money \nthey pay in taxes to pay your salary, Mr. President, and to pay your \nsalary, Mr. Ridge.\n  Oh, you cannot hide behind that desk any longer. That part of the \nshadow government just will not work any longer because this \nlegislation is going to require you to have that man of yours come up \nthere.\n  And you know what happened? Then down in the subterranean caverns, in \nthe ill-lighted recesses of the bowels of the White House, four solemn \nindividuals met one day and there was hatched the egg to provide the \nhomeland security proposal. There was the egg. I do not care how warm \nthe egg is, it still takes it 3 weeks to hatch. Try it sometime--3 \nweeks. But it did not take 3 weeks for that egg to hatch, not in that \nWhite House.\n  The administration wanted to get out front on this provision that was \nin the appropriations bill, written in there by Senators Byrd and \nStevens and supported by every member of that Appropriations Committee \nand not questioned by any Member of the Senate.\n  It is on its way to conference, Mr. President. I tell you, we have to \nact quickly, and the President did act quickly. They came out and \nunveiled this great proposal that came to life like Minerva who sprang \nfull grown and fully armed from the forehand of Jove. That is how it \ncame about.\n  Then there was Aphrodite who sprang from the ocean foam and was \ncarried by a seashell or a leaf to a nearby island and then went on to \nMount Olympus and appeared before the gods, and the gods were overcome \nby the beauty of Aphrodite. All of that happened. And the same way with \nthis egg that hatched, it just sprang into being all of a sudden and \nhere it was, this massive proposal by the President. He unveiled it, \nand they were quite successful in taking the people's eyes away from \nsome of the other things that were demanding attention in the \nnewspapers of the time. They took those things off the front page.\n  Here was a new Department. Since then, the President and all the \npeople in his administration, the King's men and women, have been out \nthere saying: Pass this bill, pass this bill, which was hatched by four \nindividuals. Let me see if I can remember their names. Mr. Ridge was \none. Mr. Mitch Daniels was another. He is the Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget. Mr. Gonzalez, I believe he is the President's \ncounsel, and Mr. Card, I believe. I hope I am right. I am. Someone \nnodded in the affirmative to me and so I am. There it was in the \nnewspapers. Those four gentlemen, very reputable persons, people of \nhigh caliber and unblemished reputations, as far as I know, and this \nwas their idea.\n\n  Now compare that group of four, working in the shadows, the dim \nlight. The lights may have gone out, but I expect there might have been \ncandles there, or perhaps oil lamps. I can just see the shadows, the \nfigures of the shadows moving back and forth in those caverns, on the \nwalls of those caverns, as the men remonstrated, and said this: We \nought to have this, we ought to have that. Whatever they say. Anyhow, \nthat was hatched down there.\n  Now that was a different committee. Four individuals, from the \ncommittee that wrote the Declaration of Independence. By the way, I \ncarry that Declaration of Independence right here in my shirt pocket. \nWho was on the committee that wrote that Declaration of Independence? \nThomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman, and \nLivingston. So there were five. My, my, look at those giants, five \ngiants who wrote the Declaration of Independence. Had they been \narrested by the British for treason, they could have been sent to \nEngland and they could have been hanged. And so could the others who \nsigned that Declaration of Independence. The signers are all listed in \nthis little book I hold in my hand.\n  They were doing things that challenged. They were doing things for \nwhich they were willing to give their lives. They would have given \ntheir lives, had they been tried for treason. Those men committed \ntreason against the government under which they then lived. The far \nreaches of the Parliament's hand, the King's hand, from Great Britain, \nfrom England, could have snatched them, taken their fortunes, taken \nthem to England, tried them, taken their lives. So they pledged their \nlives, their fortunes, their sacred vows.\n  How about those four in the White House? Were they pledging their \nlives\n\n[[Page S8601]]\n\nand fortune? Quite a different committee, I must say.\n  Anyhow, with all respect to the four men who are public servants, and \nwho are doing their best, as they see it, for their President--quite a \ndifferent matter.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I yield to the distinguished Senator for a question, \nretaining my right to the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I have listened carefully to your dissertation of the \npast and the responsibilities that all of us have to make sure we \nuphold the Constitution. And I also recognize that what the \nadministration was doing in this regard, and agree with the Senator \nthat what happened at that time, was most unfortunate.\n  Is the Senator aware the administration has compared the creation of \nthe Department of Homeland Security to the reorganization of the \nGovernment set forth by the passage of the National Security Act of \n1947?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, allusions to that act, the National Security Act, \nwhich was created in 1947 after a period of at least 3 or 4 years. This \nSenator is aware of the allusions that have been made to that act and \nthe references that have been equated, the reorganization of the \nGovernment under the Bush Administration and how it is compared.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I have done some research on the creation of the \nDepartment of Defense that I would like to share with my friend. I \nfound the research helpful in putting the current debate in context.\n  First, I agree this proposal is similar in scope to the 1947 debate, \nbut there are also some notable differences between the 1947 debate and \ntoday's dialog.\n  Mr. BYRD. I would like to hear those.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. The Bush administration proposal and the Lieberman \nsubstitute we are debating represent a dramatic reorganization of the \nFederal Government. The most obvious difference between the process in \nthe 1940s and this summer is time. The creation of the Department of \nDefense was a collaborative process between the executive branch and \nCongress, measured not in days and weeks but years.\n  Proposals for combining the military services were first considered \nin Congress in 1944. President Harry Truman became keenly involved in \nthe effort and sent a message to Congress at the end of 1945 proposing \nthe creation of the Department of National Defense. Congressional \nhearings were held on the matter throughout the following year. In \n1947, the President sent legislation to Congress that, after additional \nhearings and congressional input, was finally passed and signed into \nlaw in July of 1947.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is certainly laying down a very impressive \npremise for the question which he will ultimately ask. Please go ahead. \nThe Senate needs to hear this.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Additionally, Congress made significant changes in the \nDepartment of Defense in 1949. Thus, the thoughtful and deliberate \nprocess to create an effective Department of Defense did not happen in \na summer, a year, or even one session of Congress.\n  Mr. BYRD. How about that. Right.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. It took 5 years and was founded upon discussion, \ndebate, and compromise.\n  Mr. BYRD. Say that again.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. It was founded upon discussion, debate, and compromise.\n  Let me be clear that I am not advocating we take 5 years to debate \nthe proposal before us, only that we ought to be thoughtful and \ndeliberative. This current reorganization will affect the lives of \nevery American for years to come. Unfortunately, the current \nadministration has made it clear it will veto any legislation that is \nnot almost identical to its proposal.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Say that again, please.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. It is clear it will veto any legislation that is not \nalmost identical to its proposal.\n  Recently, President George Bush, speaking about this legislation, \nsaid: The Senate had better get it right.\n  I agree with the President that we do have a solemn responsibility to \nconsider, debate, amend, and strengthen this legislation. I am sure the \nPresident understands that the Senate's deliberate consideration of \nthis bill is an integral part of the process of ``getting it right.''\n  As the President's father said, a time of historic change is no time \nfor recklessness.\n  Mr. BYRD. Right again. What was that?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. A time of historic change is no time for recklessness.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. As my friend from West Virginia knows, when Congress \ncreated the Department of Defense, the affected agencies had input into \nthe process.\n  Here is another significant difference between the development of the \nDepartment of Defense and the current debate over homeland security.\n  In the 1940s, the executive branch agencies affected by the proposed \nreorganization were participants in the process. The Army, the Navy, \nand the Joint Chiefs of Staff proposed specific plans for \nreorganizations as early as 1945. And the Army and Navy were consulted \nprior to the President submitting draft legislation in 1947, 2 years \nlater. This cooperative approach in developing a workable new \nDepartment contrasts starkly with the way the administration developed \nhomeland security draft legislation.\n  A small group of advisers, which the Senator has explained well, \nworking in secret in the White House, developed the present Bush \nproposal. Members of Congress and the Secretaries of the affected \nCabinet agencies were reportedly not even informed about the proposal.\n  Mr. BYRD. How about that.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Amazing.\n  As I have said many times, I understand, in the wake of the horrific \nevents of September 11, we would look for ways to strengthen our \nNation's defense to prevent any further catastrophe. I fully support \nthat goal, but we must be cautious, to make sure that we work to \ncorrect what went wrong and not interfere with what went right.\n  We know what went wrong, and I firmly hope we, as a nation, will \ndevelop a comprehensive plan to address the shortcomings of our \nintelligence gathering and communication efforts which, to me, were the \ncore of the problem.\n  Mr. BYRD. Right on. Right on.\n  Let me hear that said again. I want to be sure I remember that.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. We know what went wrong, and I firmly hope that we, as \na nation, will develop comprehensive plans to address the shortcomings \nin our intelligence gathering and communication efforts.\n  Because of the similarity of the September 11 attacks and the attack \non Pearl Harbor, over 60 years ago--which I am just barely old enough \nto remember, being 5 at that time, but I remember that day to this \nmoment--we should remember the finding of the Joint Congressional \nCommittee that investigated Pearl Harbor, that:\n\n     . . . the security of the nation can be ensured only through \n     . . . centralization of responsibility in those charged with \n     handling intelligence.\n\n  That, to me, is the key that we have to look at for a resolution of \nthis problem.\n  I hope we will learn a lesson after the tragic events that occurred \non September 11. Correcting intelligence failures must be the hallmark \nof any new Department of Homeland Security.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding, and I look forward to continuing \nthis debate and considering this important legislation.\n  In closing, I hope we will take our time in creating this new \nDepartment and that we will protect the role of the legislative branch \nthroughout this process. I commend Senator Lieberman for leading debate \non this important topic, but I also thank my friend from Virginia. In \nthe 200-year history of this body, there has never been a more vigilant \ndefender----\n  Mr. BYRD. Would the Senator mind repeating that and addressing his \nremarks to the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator----\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes, right. I also thank my friend, the Senator from \nWest Virginia, Mr. Byrd. In the 200-year history of this body, there \nhas never been a more vigilant defender of the legislative branch than \nthe Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. I didn't \nwant him to repeat what he said for that part. But I wanted him just--\n--\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I wanted to repeat it for that part.\n\n[[Page S8602]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator. He referred to this Senator as the \nSenator from Virginia. That was inadvertent and it was pretty much out \nof levity, in a way, that I wanted him to get the States right and \nrecognize me as a Senator from West Virginia, which he knows. People do \nhave that slip of the tongue. It happens many times.\n  But what the Senator said--putting that entirely aside--is what I \nhave been saying. We need to take the time and not act in haste. That \nis what we are being pushed to do, and the press, the media has not \npaid enough attention, in my judgment, overall, to this bill and to the \nLieberman substitute. Somebody hasn't been listening.\n\n  My colleagues, I do not believe, have been listening. That is why I \nsaid slow down a little bit here.\n  I am grateful to the divine hand that brought these Senators to the \nfloor. At least this Senator from West Virginia is getting a little \nattention. It is not that I want attention, but this Senator from West \nVirginia is getting a little attention as to what he is saying, why \nthis stubborn guy from West Virginia--I will call him a guy--this \nstubborn upstart from West Virginia is trying to stop the train, trying \nto stop our hurrying forth, acting in the least amount of time, acting \nalmost immediately to give to the President this legislation creating a \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  At last, at last, at last two of my colleagues have asked questions \ntoday. I am sure there will be other Senators who will do the same, now \nthat I am beginning to break through, get through the ice, get through \nthe veil that this is a measure that is vitally important to every \nindividual in this country today, every man, woman, boy, and girl. It \ngoes beyond just creating a Department of Homeland Security.\n  That is what the distinguished Senator said. He is talking about \nintelligence. He is getting into the intelligence area of what is \ninvolved here. It is much more involved than just creating a Department \nof Homeland Security. I am for that. I have been for it. But I am glad, \nI am grateful to the distinguished Senator for what he has said here. \nHe has capsuled this very large subject with respect to the National \nSecurity Act, how time passed, the steps that were taken, the pauses \nthat occurred, the scrutiny that was given, and the fact that the heads \nof the military branches--the Navy and the Army and others--their \nthoughts were acquired, their recommendations were acquired, their \nadvice was sought as to the creation of this new department of defense. \nSo they had input into it.\n  It wasn't done overnight. It didn't grow up like the prophet's gourd, \novernight. It took time and that was a wise move.\n  I thank the Senator for going into that particular aspect of this in \ndepth. He has been thorough in what he has said with respect to the \ncreation of the department of defense. I am grateful and the American \npeople can be grateful to the Senator for what he has said, what he has \ncontributed here today in just the few minutes he held the floor and he \nzeroed right in on one of the things that I eventually wanted to get \nto, and there are others.\n  I am not going to say anything further now, if the Senator wants to \nask a further question.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. No. I am very pleased to have been able to have this \ntime with the Senator, and I look forward to working with him.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator. I am delighted. I am just delighted \nthat he came to the floor and made this statement. I am delighted that \nhe believes we should take our time. Not an exorbitant amount of time, \nnot an inordinate amount of time, but take time, the necessary time to \nscrutinize this proposal and act. It is not so important that we act \nquickly; it is important that we do it right. That is all I have been \nsaying. Let's do this right.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. I again thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I think the Senator from Vermont is very enlightening as \nto the timing of that crisis--also following right in the aftermath of \nWorld War II, certainly another time where this country faced a very \ngrave threat, leading into the beginning of the Korean war where the \ncountry again faced another enormous threat.\n  I wonder if the Senator can comment on how that experience should be \ninstructive to the Senator's amendment. It seems the Senator has \nforeseen the kind of timetable of bringing back from these various \ndirectorates their preliminary plans that would lead to a far more \ninsightful and, I think, constructive reorganization than the one that \nis contemplated by the proposal of the administration.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I think I grasped the question that was \nasked. It was well put. I think I have a problem with the Senator's \nmicrophone and where he is standing. Would he shorten his question?\n  Mr. DAYTON. The Senator from West Virginia has an amendment which \nwould seem to embody the intention of what occurred post-World War II, \nwhich was the sequential development of a department of such critical \nimportance. I wonder if there is a parallel to be drawn there to \ninstruct all of us that the approach being recommended by the learned \nSenator from West Virginia is the one that is going to likely produce \nthe much more beneficial result to the country rather than the helter-\nskelter that would go forward without the Senator's direction.\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely. The Senator, by his question, has really \nanswered his question. We saw that the country took more time in the \n1940s to create a Department of Defense. It took time. It had the input \nof the heads of the military branches and their advice. Mr. Truman took \ntime. It wasn't enacted during the heat of battle. The thought was \nthere. The suggestion was there. Committees held hearings, and \nbuildings were proposed during that time. But it was after the war that \nthe Department of Defense was created. It wasn't all done in a hurry. \nThere was need to do something along those lines. Many Members of \nCongress introduced legislation to carry out the results, to create and \nreorganize the Government in that respect. The military people who were \ndirectly involved and had input put.\n  We may be in a situation here where we can't wait 4 years, or 3 \nyears, or 2 years, as was the case there. But there is a direct \nparallel. They took their time. In taking their time, it didn't mean \nthey were just dragging their feet. They took time. During the time \nthat was passing, they talked about this; they got the advice of the \nmilitary. They were preparing all along their action--but do it right; \nnot do it quickly but do it right.\n  The same is true here in many respects. The point is that we must not \ndo it quickly. We are being urged in the Senate: Get on with it, pass \nit. The President, with his backdrop as he goes around the country and \nappears before the military organizations and others: Do it, do it, do \nit now.\n  There was a little ad I used to hear on television not too many \nmonths ago: Do it now; do it here. Do it now; do it here. Well, that is \nwhat I am hearing: Do it now, do it now, do it now, do it here, do it \nquickly. I am saying no, no. The object is, do it right--not do it by \nthis weekend or not do it by next weekend, and not to do it in a hurry, \ndo it right.\n  This is a far-reaching measure. If this act is passed as the \nadministration wants it passed, believe you me, it is going to affect \nthe civil liberties of Americans. That is what I am saying. Just hold \non a minute.\n  In the bill by Mr. Lieberman that came out of his committee--I will \nrefer to that momentarily to just kind of jar the senses of Members of \nthe Senate who have not been paying very much attention--many of them. \nThey are busy people. They have their attentions drawn to other very \nimportant matters all the time. There is just not enough time allotted \nto us as Senators to do our work right in every case. There just isn't \nenough time.\n  I just want to read one provision from Mr. Lieberman's bill. It is on \npage 186 of the bill. It is title III that sets up a national strategy \nfor combating terrorism and the homeland security response.\n  Under title III of the committee bill, in section 301 designated \n``Strategy,'' under the first paragraph:\n\n       The Secretary and the Director--\n\n  That means the Director of the Department of Homeland Security, and \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security--\n\n\n[[Page S8603]]\n\n\n     shall develop the National Strategy for Combating Terrorism \n     and Homeland Security Response--\n\n  They shall do this. I will read it--\n\n     for detection, prevention, protection, response and recovery \n     to counterterrorism threats, including threats, vulnerability \n     and risk assessment and analysis, and the plans, policies, \n     training exercises, evaluation, and interagency cooperation \n     addresses each such action relating to such threats.\n       Responsibilities Of The Secretary.\n       The Secretary shall have responsibility for portions of the \n     Strategy--\n\n  Strategy with a capital S--\n\n     addressing border security, critical infrastructure \n     protection, emergency preparation and response, and \n     integrating State and local efforts with activities of the \n     Federal Government.\n\n  Next paragraph:\n\n       Responsibilities Of The Director.\n       The Director shall have overall responsibility for \n     development of the Strategy--\n\n  Again, with a capital S--\n\n     and particularly for those portions of the Strategy \n     addressing intelligence, military assets, law enforcement and \n     diplomacy.\n\n  Next paragraph:\n\n       Contents.\n       The contents of the Strategy--\n\n  Strategy with a capital S--\n\n     shall include--\n\n  Get that: The contents of the Strategy which will be developed by the \nSecretary of the Department and the Director--\n\n     shall include:\n       (1) a comprehensive statement of mission, goals, \n     objectives, desired end-state priorities and \n     responsibilities;\n       (2) policies and procedures to maximize the collection, \n     translation, analysis, exploitation, and dissemination of \n     information relating to combating terrorism and the homeland \n     security response throughout the Federal Government and with \n     State and local authorities;\n       (3) plans for countering chemical, biological radiological, \n     nuclear and explosives and cyber threats.\n\n  Now get this. Paragraph 4 is one of the items that will make up the \ncontents of the Strategy with a capital S--strategy that is developed \nby the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and the \nDirector of Homeland Security--the Director. Here is someone I want the \nSenate to be required to confirm--this Director. We will provide for \nthe confirmation of the Secretary. But I want the Director confirmed, \ntoo.\n  Get this. This is paragraph 4 of the Strategy with a capital S. There \nis much more to be said about this Strategy set forth in title III. But \nlisten to this. This is part of the plan, part of the Strategy.\n\n       (4) plans for integrating the capabilities--\n\n  My--\n\n       And assets of the United States military into all aspects \n     of the Strategy. . . .\n\n  Now, does that get the attention of any Senator? We have something we \ncall posse comitatus--some would say comitatus, which would be correct, \ntoo--both. But there are laws, there are statutes, that have to do with \nposse comitatus. And I shall have a speech to make on posse comitatus, \nor comitatus, at some point, hopefully, or likely, if we continue.\n  But forgetting the statute for a moment, listen to this. The \nSecretary and the Director are going to draw up a strategy for dealing \nwith this homeland security. And what is part of something that this \nbill is requiring that they include in their plans, and that they have \nthe authority to develop and include in its strategy? Let me read that \nagain. It says:\n\n       The contents of the Strategy shall include--\n\n  And we jump down to (4):\n\n     plans for integrating--\n\n  What does that mean?\n\n     integrating the capabilities--\n\n  My, ``the capabilities.'' What are they talking about, \n``capabilities''?\n\n     . . . include . . . integrating the capabilities and assets--\n\n  What does that mean, ``assets''?\n\n     of the United States military into all aspects of the \n     Strategy.\n\n  Now, what do we have here? What are we dragging into this \nlegislation? Why, that should cause every Senator in this body to raise \nan eyebrow. What are we talking about here? What are we voting for? I \nwill have more to say on this.\n  I believe that at last I am getting a little attention to what I say \nabout this homeland security.\n  Let me read that again so it will be in the Record for the weekend, \nand Senators can think about it a little bit. And the media may have \nhad their attention called to something here that is in this bill. Let \nme tell you something. I expect Senators would open their eyes even \nmore as to what is in the administration's plan and what is in the \nHouse bill. But just in the Lieberman bill, which, as I say, is an \nimprovement over these other approaches by the administration and the \nHouse, the House of Representatives--let me read that again:\n  ``The contents of the Strategy''--this is in title III--``The \ncontents of the Strategy shall'' be developed by the Director of \nHomeland Security and by the Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity--yes, my attention has been called to an error I made. The \ncorrect title of the Director is the Director of the new Office for \nCombating Terrorism. I referred to the Director of Homeland Security. \nThis is the exact title of the director. And this, the Lieberman bill, \nand these two titles here, have to do with this new office. These two \ntitles in the Lieberman bill have to do with the establishment of this \nnew Office for Combating Terrorism, established in title II. So I will \njust refer to this as the director.\n  The Director and the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security \nwill devise this strategy for securing the country. That is what we are \nall talking about. But this bill requires that among the \nresponsibilities of the Director are these:\n\n       The Director shall have overall responsibility for \n     development of the Strategy, and particularly for those \n     portions of the Strategy addressing intelligence, \n     military assets, law enforcement, and diplomacy.\n\n  And among the ``Contents'': ``The contents of the Strategy shall \ninclude''--(1), (2), (3,) and now (4)--there are nine items to be \nincluded in ``The contents of the Strategy.'' The fourth one is this:\n\n       plans for integrating the capabilities and assets of the \n     United States military into all aspects of the Strategy. . . \n     .\n\n  Now, what are we going to have? A police state? Are we going to have \nthe Army and the Navy, the Marines--are they going to get involved? I \ndon't think anybody wants to do that. I don't think anybody is thinking \nof that.\n  But look at this language, what it says. We have to contemplate the \nunintended consequences of what we do here. Even at best, if we have \nboth eyes and both ears, and the full attention and focus of our \ncollective brains, and we pass an item, we give it careful attention, \nthere may still be unintended, unforeseen consequences that will flow \nfrom that act that we passed.\n  How much more so might that happen if we pass an act in a hurry and \ndon't apply the full focus of our faculties in addressing that \nlegislative matter? The question answers itself.\n  Finally, let me just read, once more, item No. (4) in ``The contents \nof the Strategy'':\n\n       (4) plans for integrating--\n\n  ``Integrating,'' what does that mean?\n\n     integrating the capabilities and assets of the United States \n     military. . . .\n\n  We all know what that means when we talk about the military and the \ncapabilities of the U.S. military--\n\n     plans for integrating the capabilities and assets of the \n     United States military into all--\n\n  Not just a few, all--\n\n     aspects of the Strategy.\n\n  Well, I just wanted to read into the Record that excerpt from the \ncommittee bill.\n  Now, perhaps by the fact that these two distinguished Senators asked \nme questions today about it--a relative of the Senator from Minnesota \nwas a signer of the Constitution of the United States, signing from the \nState of New Jersey on that occasion. So this fine Senator is here on \nthe floor today and has asked me questions. And the equally fine and \ngood and able Senator from Vermont has asked some questions.\n  So at last--at last--hallelujah, we are getting some questions. \nSomebody is beginning to pay attention to what is in this measure.\n  Perhaps the greatest and the gravest defect of the National Security \nAct to reorganize the Armed Forces, continuing in this vein, was the \nfailure of Congress to provide oversight of the CIA. When the Central \nIntelligence Agency was established, there was no congressional \noversight. It was responsible only to the National Security Council and \nthe President, and what a mistake that turned out to be.\n\n[[Page S8604]]\n\n  As a result, the late Clark Clifford wrote: ``The CIA became a \ngovernment within a government.''\n  Listen to that--became a government within a government. That is \nexactly what we have here. We have the makings of a government within a \ngovernment. If the administration were to have its way, we would have a \ngovernment within a government. We would have a government that is run \nout of the White House, and the Cabinet officers would be put to one \nside. The Secretaries of the various Departments, just put them aside. \nPut the Congress off limits, forget it. We will run things from this \nWhite House. That is what I am concerned about, as I see here.\n  As the late Clark Clifford wrote:\n\n       The CIA became a government within a government which could \n     evade oversight of its activities by drawing the cloak of \n     secrecy around it.\n\n  (Mr. WYDEN assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. BYRD. There you have it in a nutshell. The CIA became a \ngovernment within a government which could evade oversight of its \nactivities by drawing the cloak of secrecy around it.\n  For years my immediate predecessor as majority leader was Senator \nMike Mansfield. There has been presiding in the chair up until a moment \nago the Senator from Montana, Max Baucus, but now we have another \nSenator in the chair. That majority leader from the State of Montana--\nat the time, Senator Mike Mansfield--argued for the CIA to be brought \nunder congressional supervision. There was Mike Mansfield. There was my \npredecessor as majority leader of the Senate. He was majority leader \nmany years. I was his successor.\n  The late Mike Mansfield said:\n\n       What I am concerned with is the CIA's position of \n     responsibility to no one but the National Security Council.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       The CIA is free from practically every form of \n     congressional check.\n\n  That was his caution. He said:\n\n       There is no regular methodical review of this agency.\n\n  Now hear the voice of the late Mike Mansfield coming down through the \nyears. Listen to him. Listen to the late Mike Mansfield:\n\n       What I am concerned with is the CIA's position of \n     responsibility to no one but the National Security Council. \n     The CIA is free from practically every form of congressional \n     check.\n\n  The late Senator Mike Mansfield cautioned:\n\n       The CIA is free from practically every form of \n     congressional check. There is no regular methodical review of \n     this agency.\n\n  Senator Mansfield pointed out:\n\n       Our form of government is based on a system of checks and \n     balances.\n\n  Hear that. Hear the voice of Mike Mansfield, his words coming down \nthrough the years, reverberating in this Chamber. I hope they will be \nreverberating in the hearts and minds of the men and women who sit \ntoday in this great body, the august 100, the special 100 who have been \nelected by 280 million people in phases; according to our illustrious \nFramers, three classes--so that there would be a staged rotation of \nthis body, with the Senate in transition all the time, so there would \nnever be a completely new Senate, so there would never be a new \ncomplete turnover of the Senators. Today they number 100.\n\n  The House, theoretically, can turn over in 2 years. We could have a \ncompletely new House, theoretically, in 2 years under the Constitution. \nBut not here. One-third of the Senate only every 2 years, one-third of \nthe Senate only; and then another third for 2 years; and then the third \nthird for 2 years. That was the genius of the Framers.\n  Here we have a continuing body, and we have checks and balances \nwritten into this Constitution. And there was Senator Mansfield \npointing it out:\n  Our form of government is based on a system of checks and balances.\n  They are written into this Constitution which I hold in my hand.\n  I saw some of the greatest of the figures in our Government last \nSunday on television. There was the Secretary of State. There was the \nVice President of the United States, who is the President of the Senate \nbut who cannot address the Senate except by unanimous consent. There \nwas Dr. Condoleezza Rice, a very able person who is not confirmed by \nthe Senate. She was on television. And there was the Secretary of \nDefense, Donald Rumsfeld, on television. There were others. I listened \nto all of them.\n  I don't often listen to television, even on Sundays, when more of the \npeople who are most often seen and heard and read about in the media \nare on the Sunday shows. But I listened to them all last week because I \nexpected them to say something about this subject of the war, the \nsubject of an attack, an attack on a sovereign state.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Will the Senator from West Virginia yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. BYRD. Let me finish this thought, and I will be happy to yield.\n  I saw all those on television. They were talking about the President \nlaunching an attack on Iraq.\n  I have no brief for the Government of Iraq. I have never met Mr. \nRitter. I know nothing about Mr. Ritter. I think Iraq under the current \nregime is a threat. But not one of those individuals who are high in \nthe Government of this country--not one--mentioned the Constitution of \nthe United States. Every one of them had to swear an oath to protect \nthe Constitution, but not one mentioned this Constitution. And to hear \nthem talk, we were ready to go to war. We were prepared to go to war. \nThe President had the authority--I am putting that in my words--the \nPresident had the authority to go to war, to launch an unprovoked \nmilitary attack on a sovereign state. He has just assumed that he has \nthat power under the Constitution. No, not under the Constitution. It \nis assumed that the President of the United States has that power. \nThere are smart lawyers around and they can take either side of the \ncase and come up with a good argument. They can win either side--most \ngood lawyers, who can take either side. But not Senators who have sworn \nto support and defend this Constitution and who are here in this \naugust, 100-Member body. And I have seen this whole body change, except \nfor one person. I have seen the whole body--300 Members of the whole \nbody--change three times in my 44 years in the Senate. But not one \nmentioned the Constitution.\n\n  I know what the Constitution says. The Constitution says that \nCongress shall have power to declare war. We can split hairs all we \nwant, but there are the words. I know there are traditionalists who \nbelieve every word of that Constitution, and that was the position that \nwas generally held in this country up until the Korean war. But there \nare revisionists today who want to change that. They want to give the \nPresident power; they think he should have it. So that is what we hear \nfrom those who want the Commander in Chief to have that power.\n  The Commander in Chief was a title to be given to the civil authority \nat war--not to the military--and to make sure of that we don't have a \nfour-star general sitting as Commander in Chief; we don't have a three-\nstar general, or a two-star general, or a one-star general. We don't \nhave a military officer sitting in that Oval Office. No, we have a man \nof the people, who is a civil authority. He is the President of the \nUnited States. He is the Commander in Chief.\n  You fellows with the stars on your shoulders, don't get too heady \nhere. This Constitution says, in essence, a civilian, a civil officer, \na civil authority shall sit at the top.\n  Those revisionists ought to read the ``Federalist Papers,'' also. \nWhat do we have here? Our constitutional government that the Framers \ngave us in 1787--once the States, in their conventions, had ratified \nthat Constitution--nine of them--said, in essence, the power to declare \nwar and the power to make war shall not be reposed in the same hands.\n  So that person, who is Commander in Chief, is the civil authority \ndown there. He is Commander in Chief, but he cannot declare war, except \nin a circumstance where this Nation is being subjugated to a sudden \nattack. The President has inherent power under the Constitution. I \ndon't think anybody disagrees with that. The President has inherent \npower to use the military forces at his command in order to repel a \nsudden attack--sudden, unforeseen, where maybe Congress is at home, \nCongress is out on recess, Congress has gone home for the Christmas \nholidays, or the Thanksgiving holidays, or the Jewish holidays, or \nCongress may have\n\n[[Page S8605]]\n\nrecessed for a month in August and they are not here. But the President \nhas inherent power in this Constitution to use the military to repel a \nsudden attack against this country or its military forces. Nobody \nargues with that.\n  What is being debated here is the President launching, through some \nfigment of the imagination, or some resolution which has run its \ncourse, and under the term ``Commander in Chief,'' an unprovoked attack \nagainst a sovereign state--to use a military offensive. We are not \ntalking about a defensive situation. We are talking about an offensive \nsituation in which the President of the United States would attack a \nsovereign state--in this case, Iraq.\n\n  I think Iraq poses a threat under the present regime. I don't argue \nwith that. I don't have any argument with the fact that Saddam Hussein \nis an evil man. Of course, we are all evil; every man is. The Bible \nsays no man is good. If we look at the programming that appears on our \ntelevision stations, we will probably conclude that this country is not \nexactly a nation that is not evil. It is an evil nation in some \nrespects. So let's be careful. I would be careful throwing that word \naround--``evil''--and saying that this is a war between good and evil. \nIt may be a war against evil, but it is not necessarily between a good \nnation and an evil nation. But that is off on another track.\n  The power to declare war and the power to make war are under \ndifferent hands. Those powers are reposed in different entities. Our \nConstitution reposes the power to declare war in Congress, the duly \nelected, directly elected Representatives of the American people. Of \ncourse, the Members of the Senate were not directly elected by the \npeople back in those days, but there was a requirement that the power \nto declare war was in Congress. Congress is made up of two bodies. At \none time it was elected by the respective State legislatures, but no \nmore. That has been changed by constitutional amendment, as we all \nknow.\n  Today, the points are still there. The basis is still there. \nDeclaring war and making war are two different things, and the Framers \nsaw to it that the Commander in Chief would be not a person who would \ndeclare war. That is the person who will make war. That was discussed \nin the Constitutional Convention and that is the way we have it today.\n  Now, I, therefore, say that this President is not authorized to \ndeclare war. Why? Because there has not been a sudden, unforeseen \nattack on the United States.\n  Iraq is not attacking the United States at the moment. If the \nPresident were to launch a sudden offensive on Iraq, where is his \nauthority to do so? He is not doing it to repel a sudden attack against \nthe United States. No, he is doing it because he knows, as I know, that \nSaddam Hussein is a threat to us all, to the safety of the people in \nthis area, his own people, and the people in the region, and a threat, \nif you carry it far enough, to us. It is not all that sudden, and who \nshould declare war in that event? Congress, not the U.N.\n  I applaud the President for going to the U.N. and laying out his case \nas to why the U.N. had its chances, had failed, had not lived up to its \nresponsibilities, and he made that case well. But the case has not been \nmade. It will be talked about eventually; it is being talked about a \ngreat deal now. I read all about it in the newspapers, I see it on \ntelevision and hear it on the radio. The case is now being made for an \nattack unilaterally by this country against a sovereign state when this \ncountry has not been attacked.\n  The purpose is not to repel a sudden invasion of the United States or \na sudden attack. If the President were to do this, it would be \nunprovoked at this moment. Where is the President's authority? They say \nit is in the resolution adopted by Congress in 1991. It is not there. \nThe authority is not there for the President today to launch an \nunprovoked attack against Iraq. They said it was in the resolution last \nyear. I say the authorization is not there. It is not there. We can \nargue and talk all night about that, but it is not there. Show me; \nanyone, show me. It is not there.\n  They say he is the Commander in Chief. Well, so what; he is the \nCommander in Chief. Once war is declared or authorized by the Congress, \nthen the Commander in Chief will make the war. We will have one head at \nthe military and that was the right thing to do. Then an attack, if it \nis authorized by Congress, can go forward.\n  Let's don't meddle with this Constitution. There will always be \ndefenders of this Constitution, and there are some who will remind the \ncountry of the Constitution when they are on television. So do not \nassume or take for granted that the President has that power. It is \nthis Constitution, the Constitution of the United States, with 39 names \nattached to it.\n  Not one word do I hear by those who appear on television, not one \nword about the Constitution. I said that yesterday. I am going to say \nit again today. Not one word did I hear. Perhaps I missed something, \nbut I do not think I did. Not one word. They all just assume that the \nPresident is going to do it, he has a right to do it, he has an \nauthority to do it. If our administration has its way, we will take \nthis fellow out, and we will take him out unilaterally; we are not \ngoing to wait on anything.\n  Wait a minute, there came a second thought. Some people began to ask \nquestions. Other nations began to ask questions. Our friends began to \nask questions. Our friends in the region began to ask questions, and so \na decision came. And so, we will hold up a little bit here. We will go \nto the U.N. That is right. That is good. Go to the U.N.\n  The U.N. should face up to its responsibilities and should lay down \nthe precepts as to why this regime must go. The U.N. should express a \nworld view to get the other nations of the world to see it is in their \ninterest that there be a regime change or that there be inspections--\nbona fide inspections, not like the inspections that were going on up \nuntil a few years back, in 1998, I believe.\n\n  The President has done that. I say let's don't close our eyes to the \nfact that this Constitution still lives.\n  Mr. President, I apologize to the Senator from New York. I did not \nreally intend to talk that long. I intended to yield the floor for a \nquestion from her, and I intended to do it earlier. I am very happy, \nwith my apologies, to yield to the distinguished Senator. She is a very \ndistinguished Senator from the State of New York; she is a former First \nLady of this Nation. I yield to her.\n  I am grateful that she has a question, that she has perhaps some \nquestions. I am glad somebody is beginning to listen. So I yield to the \nSenator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Chair does not recognize the Senator from New York. The \nSenator from West Virginia has the floor. I yield to the Senator from \nNew York, Mrs. Clinton, for a question on the condition that I retain \nmy recognition from the Chair as holding the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair acknowledges the Senator from New \nYork to ask a question.\n  Mr. BYRD. This Senator has yielded. The Chair can't yield to the \nSenator from New York for a question. I may not have yielded. Now, Mr. \nPresident, I only yield to the Senator from New York, Mrs. Clinton, for \na question. Under the rules, I can do that, and I do that with the \nunderstanding that I do not yield the floor. So if I yield the floor, \nhow can the Senator from New York be recognized? The Senator from New \nYork is recognized by virtue, under the rules, of my yielding for a \nquestion.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia. \nI thank him for the courtesy of yielding to me for a question, but I \nthank him even more for his stalwart defense of our Constitution and \nhis constant reminder of our founding document and the principles that \nit contains.\n  I ask the Senator from West Virginia, is it not also the case that \nunder the Constitution, this issue about congressional power was very \nwell debated, thought through, written about by our Founders, and that \namong the powers that were granted to the Congress was the power of the \npurse, the power to make the decisions about how the people's money \nwould be used? Is that a correct reading of the Constitution that we \ncherish so greatly?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from New York, \nMrs.\n\n[[Page S8606]]\n\nClinton, is preeminently correct. That authorization for power of the \npurse is found in section 9 of article I of the Constitution.\n  Tie that together with the first section of article 1 and we find \nwhere laws are made and the fact that appropriations may be withdrawn \nfrom the Treasury in consequence only of an appropriation by law. \nCongress has to pay and pass the laws. The Senator is preeminently \ncorrect.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Is it not the case that in the Senator's capacity as \nthe chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee that the committee, \nunder the Senator's leadership, has held a number of hearings about the \nvarious needs that our country faces with respect to both military and \nhomeland security?\n  Mr. BYRD. Again, the Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Is it further the case that in taking testimony and \nreceiving evidence, the Senator has helped to create a better \nunderstanding of what the needs are that we should be meeting as we \nattempt to prepare our country for the unfortunate but realistic \npossibilities of terrorism?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in response to the question, that has \ncertainly been the intention of the Senator from West Virginia who \ncurrently is the chairman of the Appropriations Committee in the \nSenate. That is the intention, and I believe I am beginning to be \nsuccessful in getting some ears attuned. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Further to that point, I believe it is the fact, is it \nnot, that in the course of examining the many needs which our country \nhas, in order to deal with the vulnerabilities we currently experience, \nthe Senator has come up with a number of items that the Appropriations \nCommittee has determined would further our security, fulfilling the \nresponsibility that the Congress is given under our Constitution?\n  Mr. BYRD. In response to the question from the distinguished Senator \nfrom New York, Mrs. Clinton, that is absolutely correct. Senator \nStevens, as the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, and I--\nand the full committee of 29 members made up of 15 Democrats and 14 \nRepublicans--have responded in that spirit, and we have provided for \nthe consideration of the Senate and ultimately the entire Congress our \nviews as to the appropriations that are needed.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Is it further correct that among those items the \nSenator has reviewed, studied, and analyzed for the validity of their \nclaims and the importance of their priorities, was a recognition we had \nsome additional work to do because of the terrible attacks of September \n11? And as a Senator from New York, I want to pause for a moment and \nacknowledge with great gratitude the leadership of the Senator from \nWest Virginia in this body and the response of this Nation. We had some \nunfinished business that we learned about because of those horrific \nattacks on September 11, which the Senator from West Virginia is \nattempting to address.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in response to the question from the very \nable Senator from New York, Mrs. Clinton, I respond in the affirmative \nwith a resounding ``yes.''\n  The Senator from New York has written me on two occasions about the \nneeds of her constituents. And without losing my right to the floor, I \nask unanimous consent that--I believe the Senator has sent me one or \ntwo letters. She has spoken to me a number of times off the floor and \non the floor in this regard. My memory is not infallible, but she sent \nme one or two letters. I do not have them right now, but I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record, at the conclusion of \nour remarks that are taking place in this colloquy, those two letters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit No. 1)\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank the Senator from West Virginia because these \nare matters of grave importance to my constituents. Beyond that, they \nare of great importance to all Americans. I very much appreciate the \nSenator's attention because he has studied these issues, he understands \nhow we have to demonstrate clearly our resolve and our preparedness.\n  I ask the Senator from West Virginia, as he has moved forward with \nhis work on behalf of the Appropriations Committee, and very \nimportantly the work of homeland security, if he has determined there \nis a need for additional money to be sent to our frontline responders, \nour frontline soldiers, our firefighters, our police officers, our \nemergency workers, so they may do the important job of protecting us as \nwe expect them to do?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for \nstating so lucidly and so articulately a reference to the needs of the \npeople of her State, in reference to the needs of the people who are on \nthe ground, in reference to the needs of the first responders, in \nreference to the needs of the firefighters. She is preeminently correct \nin her summation of what has happened in that Mr. Stevens and I--and \nagain the full Appropriations Committee, Republican and Democratic--\nacted in a very bipartisan way, have time and again responded \naffirmatively and effectively to the needs of the people of New York \nand the people of the Nation.\n  New York was attacked, and within 3 days my committee, the committee \nof Mr. Stevens, the Appropriations Committee, appropriated $40 billion.\n  Time and again, we have responded, and time and again the \ndistinguished Senator--both Senators from New York, the Senator who is \nnow at her desk and the senior Senator from New York who talked with me \nbefore having to catch an airplane today and had to leave. He could not \nbe on the floor today because he had something else he was required to \ndo and was expected to do. So he is not present now, but he talked with \nme today on the floor when the Senate returned to the homeland security \nbill. And while the Senate was on the Department of Interior \nappropriations bill, he talked with me again about the needs of his \nState, the State which he so ably represents. And just a few days ago, \nwithin this last week it was, the Senator from New York came to see me \nin my office. It was not the first time she had come to me to talk \nabout the needs of that great city, the city of New York, and its great \npeople. Many times, she and the senior Senator, Mr. Schumer, have come \nto my office.\n  Last week, she came to my office in the early evening hours of the \nday and expressed to me the need for three items especially. She wanted \nthose items in the appropriations bill. We are debating an \nappropriations bill and it is taking a long time. It should not take \nthis long. We ought to have had this bill passed and sent to the \nPresident.\n  In this Appropriations Committee which I chair and which Mr. Ted \nStevens, I will say, cochairs realistically, that committee has \nreported all 13 appropriations bills several weeks ago which have to be \npassed this year. They have been reported from my committee. They have \nbeen sent to the Senate and they appear on the Senate calendar.\n  Those 13 appropriations bills are very slow in getting to the \nPresident. Not one has gone to the President. The House Appropriations \nCommittee--and I do not speak with disrespect there; they have a \nwonderful chairman over there in Congressman Young and a wonderful \nranking member over there in Dave Obey. They speak their minds. They \nspeak their hearts. But that chairman over there has some people, other \nhigh offices he has to deal with in that body. He cannot always do what \nhe may wish to do. The House is a little different from the Senate. In \nthe Senate, of course, we can talk and kind of speak our minds, and we \ncan take independent actions here.\n  That Senator from New York who holds the floor over there at this \nmoment, she is standing right by her desk. She came to my office last \nweek and importuned me to find a way at some point that she would like \nto introduce an amendment or she wanted an amendment introduced or \nwanted to amend one of those bills, take care of those three items in \nparticular that she addressed to me. And then, lo and behold, earlier \nthis week I held up a letter brought to me, delivered to me, not by the \nU.S. Mail but by someone from the Senator's office. I believe she came \nby my office and did not find me in the office at that time, so she \nleft a letter, which I have already gotten consent to have printed in \nthe Record.\n\n[[Page S8607]]\n\nShe wrote me a letter. She was not just saying, I want mine. She was \nsaying, these are needed, also by the people in the other States of \nthis Union.\n  So yesterday Senator Stevens and I joined in an amendment to the \nInterior appropriations bill which comes out of the Appropriations \nsubcommittee that I chair, the subcommittee on the Department of the \nInterior. In that amendment, Senator Stevens and I have entered and \noffered, we have attempted to address the needs of the firemen, of the \nsecurity of our nuclear plants, and other pressing homeland security \nneeds among which are the three items in which the Senator expressed \ninterest.\n  So, time and again we have done this. Time and again, the Republicans \nand Democrats on that subcommittee have joined to deal with the home \nsecurity needs.\n  So the answer is, yes, those needs have been expressed by the \nSenator, those needs have been addressed by the Appropriations \nCommittee, and even now, or when the Senate gets back on the Interior \nappropriations bill, there is the amendment by Senator Stevens and \nmyself which will address some remaining needs in the amount of over \n$900 million in that amendment.\n  So it is national in scope, but within that national-in-scope measure \nis the State of New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank the Senator for his understanding and \ncompassion and his leadership.\n  As I yield back the floor because of a courtesy that was extended to \nme by the Senator to be part of this colloquy, I point out that dealing \nwith homeland security is a very heavy responsibility.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield for the purpose without losing my \nright to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank the Senator because he has shouldered this \nheavy responsibility.\n  We have a process that we have had for many decades about the money \nwe appropriate for our military, and the needs are discussed within the \ncivilian and military leadership of the Department of Defense. It comes \nto the Congress, and there is a process.\n  But we are faced with new challenges. It is my observation and \nopinion that the Senator from West Virginia and his very worthy \ncolleague, the Senator from Alaska, have taken it upon their shoulders \nto create a process where none was before so we could begin to address \nthese very serious issues--not wait for a Department to get set up, not \nwait for it to get organized or get its first budget.\n  But right now, in the face of the ongoing threats, of having an \norange-level threat just a few days ago, it brings home how important \nthe work is the Senator is doing. I express my gratitude to him. I \nthank him for the courtesy of yielding to me for these questions.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 3, 2002.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriations,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I want to thank and commend you again \n     for all your hard and important work to help New York recover \n     from the terrorist attacks and on the issue of homeland \n     security more generally. We are all greatly indebted to you.\n       As the FY 2003 Interior Appropriations bill comes to the \n     floor tomorrow, I understand there may be some effort to \n     offer an amendment to provide the emergency funding requested \n     by the Administration to battle the wildfires in the western \n     part of the country. As a part of this effort, I thought I \n     would raise a couple relevant items of particular importance \n     to me that were left shortchanged by President Bush's \n     decision to not make the emergency designation on the $5.1 \n     billion you included in the FY 2002 Supplemental \n     Appropriations bill. The following emergency items are \n     especially relevant to address the urgent needs of \n     firefighters and emergency responders in New York and across \n     the country:\n       $90 million to HHS/CDC for clinical examinations and the \n     monitoring of long-term health consequences for police, fire \n     and other first responders at Ground Zero. Each day there are \n     new reports of emergency rescue personnel who worked at the \n     World Trade Center site suffering from respiratory and other \n     ailments. The $12 million appropriated last year provided \n     sufficient funding to begin baseline screenings for \n     approximately one-third of the workers at the site. This \n     additional funding is necessary to continue the screenings \n     for the remaining first responders, as well to monitor their \n     health for the coming years.\n       $150 million in firefighting grants as authorized under the \n     FIRE Act. As you know, fire departments from New York and \n     across the country have filed applications that exceed $3 \n     billion in need for $360 million in available resources. \n     These resources will help our fire departments meet the \n     demands and safety needs of our communities.\n       $100 million in grants to make fire and police equipment \n     interoperable--these resources are split evenly between FEMA \n     and DOJ's Office of Domestic Preparedness. One of the primary \n     causes of the death of most firefighters on September 11th \n     was their inability to communicate with each other and with \n     the Police Department. These resources are critically needed \n     to protect the health and lives of our bravest domestic \n     soldiers.\n       As you can see, these are all emergency items and ones that \n     you had the foresight to include in the Supplemental \n     Appropriations bill Congress passed earlier this year. I very \n     much appreciate all your hard work and support in making sure \n     these important items get the funding they so critically \n     need.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 10, 2002.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to follow up on my letter \n     of September 3 with some recent findings on the health of \n     emergency response workers at the World Trade Center site.\n       New information on the health impacts of working at Ground \n     Zero was released yesterday in the New England Journal of \n     Medicine and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's \n     Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (attached). This new \n     data confirms, what many of us have known for some time, that \n     there will be continuing health consequences for the workers \n     and volunteers who responded at the World Trade Center site. \n     Specifically, Dr. David Prezant and colleagues presented new \n     data showing that both a ``World Trade Center cough'' and \n     permanent, asthma-like symptoms are directly correlated with \n     intensity of exposure to the collapse of the towers. In fact, \n     in just six months since the attacks, eight percent of those \n     highly exposed displayed the cough, and twenty-three percent \n     of those highly exposed showed asthma-like symptoms. Of those \n     identified with the cough, 87 percent also had \n     gastrointestinal reflux disease.\n       In addition, during the 11 months after the attacks, the \n     number of respiratory medical leave incidents increased five-\n     fold and the number of stress-related incidents increased \n     seventeen-fold among FDNY workers. As of the end of August, \n     more than 360 firefighters and EMS workers remained on \n     medical leave or light duty assignment because of respiratory \n     illness that occurred after WTC exposure, and 250 FDNY rescue \n     workers remained on leave with service-connected, stress-\n     related problems. It is estimated that 500 FDNY workers will \n     have to retire on the basis of their injuries in the \n     aftermath of the WTC attacks.\n       With this new evidence, which was also reported this \n     morning on the front page of The New York Times, I feel more \n     strongly that we must immediately provide the emergency \n     funding you included in the FY 2002 Supplemental \n     Appropriations bill earlier this year. As we have discussed, \n     the three key pieces are:\n       $90 million to HHS/CDC for clinical examinations and the \n     monitoring of long-term health consequences for police, fire \n     and other first responders at Ground Zero.\n       $150 million in firefighting grants as authorized under the \n     FIRE Act.\n       $100 million in grants to make fire and police equipment \n     interoperable. These resources are split evenly between FEMA \n     and DOJ's Office of Domestic Preparedness.\n       I look forward to working with you on this as we proceed on \n     the FY 2003 Interior Appropriations bill.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                           Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New \nYork for her questions and her comments.\n  Mr. President, I have been informed that the distinguished occupant \nof the chair, Mr. Wyden, has to leave soon, has to depart the chair; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is correct, but \ngiven the importance of the matters of the Senator from West Virginia, \nI want to make sure the Senator from West Virginia gets all the time he \nneeds to complete his remarks, and I will stay for this.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I have been a Member of \nthis body 44 years. I don't think I have ever seen a time when I was \npressed to complete my statement on the premise that there were no \nother Senators available to preside over this body and that the \noccupant of the chair would have to leave soon, thus forcing me to \ncomplete my statement before I intended to complete it.\n  This comes down to a pretty serious juncture. I will not go any \nfurther than\n\n[[Page S8608]]\n\nto say that in this body no Senator should be required to end his \nstatement on the basis that after a certain hour there will be no \nfurther Senators available to preside. Now, Mr. President, that is \npretty serious.\n  I have been a Senator a long time, 44 years come next January 3. I \nhave been a Member of the Congress for 50 years come next January 3. \nNever have I had it put to me that at a certain hour we will have no \nmore Senators available to preside. Now, something is wrong with the \nSenate if it has come to that. Suppose I want to speak until 6 o'clock \nthis evening. Suppose I want to deliver a speech that I consider very, \nvery important.\n  I am not here addressing a Mother's Day speech, making one of my \nholiday speeches. I am not here talking about Mother's Day or Christmas \nDay or Thanksgiving or Independence Day. I am addressing what I \nconsider to be one of the most important questions to come before this \nSenate in my 44 years in this Senate. I am very well aware of the fact \nthere needs to be a Senator in the chair as I speak. As President pro \ntempore of this body, I should know that. The office of President pro \ntempore is a constitutional office, unlike the office of, say, the \nmajority leader, minority leader, majority whip, or minority \nwhip. These are offices and officers who are voted on by this body and \nelected by this body. But I am President pro tempore of the U.S. \nSenate. I am the 86th President pro tempore of the U.S. Senate. The \nPresident pro tempore is the President of the Senate for a time being, \ntemporarily, while the Vice President, who is the President of the \nSenate, is away, is not presiding, or is assuming the responsibilities \nof the Presidency in the event, very unfortunate event that that should \nhappen. The President pro tempore, he is the first constitutional \nofficer elected by the Senate in March 1789. He is a constitutional \nofficer. You don't find words in the Constitution about the majority \nleader or minority leader or majority whip or minority whip. I have \nbeen in at least three of those positions, majority leader, majority \nwhip--at least two of them. And minority leader, so I have been three \nof them. But the President pro tempore is a constitutional officer.\n\n  I happen to be a Senator from West Virginia. And I happen to have on \nmy heart, which is heavily burdened, a speech. And I want to unburden \nmy heart.\n  I don't intend to take undue advantage of the person who is presiding \nnow. Perhaps he is caught in the unfortunate circumstance that there is \nno other Senator available to take the chair, in which case nobody will \nhear me; I cannot speak.\n  This Senator wants to raise a concern, wants to express a concern \nabout the situation, if we have come to that in the U.S. Senate. \nSenators ought to ponder that. And there ought to be some Senators at \nleast who would be willing--and I am sure there are Senators in town--\nnot every one of the Senators who happen to not be on the floor today, \nnot every one of them is absent from the city. They know what their \nduties are as Senators. I know what my duty is. It is my duty to get \nout of my bed and come here and preside, if no other Senators can be \nfound and if it is important that the Senate stand in--I get out of my \nbed if that happens. I know what my responsibilities are, and it kind \nof offends me that we seem to have come to a situation this afternoon \nwhen no other Senators ``are available to take the chair,'' and the \nSenator in the chair has to leave shortly.\n  I am very thankful to the Senator in the chair. I asked him a \nquestion and he, I am sure, needs to go soon. But he has expressed the \nviewpoint and the willingness to stay here as long as I want to speak.\n  I am not going to take advantage of him and pretty soon I will yield \nthe floor. But I would put it in these words: It is a dreadful thought \nto me, when I am told that there are no other Senators available. I \ndon't say this critically of the individual who carried this message to \nme. It is not the making of that individual, that person who is \ncarrying out the duties of that person in doing that. I am sure there \nmust be difficulty in finding Senators.\n  But what is wrong? What has become of the Senate and its place in the \nConstitution? What has become of the Senate? It has been here, now, for \n215 years. What has become of the Senate? What has become of the \nSenate, the greatest deliberative body, we hear so often, a body in \nwhich a Senator can stand on his or her feet and speak as long as those \nfeet can carry that Senator?\n  The floor cannot be taken from a Senator unless he has offended the \nSenate and a point of order is made that the Senator take his seat and \nhe is required to take his seat. If he speaks in terms that are \noffensive to another Senator, that person's character, he might be \nasked to take his seat. Or if he speaks offensively concerning a State \nof this Union, he might be required to take his seat.\n\n  But now I am going to be required to take my seat because there is no \nother Senator available, I understand, to take the duties of the chair.\n  Mr. President, we ought not in this Senate to have that situation \narise again, and I am sorry it arose because it kind of takes away from \nthe theme that I was trying to say here. But it is worth bringing out. \nCertainly, I think it is worth surfacing because, if that is going to \nbe the situation, then we are in bad shape.\n  The distinguished Democratic whip earlier today told me that he had \nan engagement. He had an appointment, I believe, back in his home \nState. He had to leave at around 3 today and I understood that. That is \nfine. He told me in plenty of time. He told me this probably before \nnoon today that if I was going to make a lengthy speech, he would have \nto leave. So I understand that. But there should be some other Senator \nwilling to take the chair, and I have a feeling there are other \nSenators in town who would come and preside if need be.\n  All that aside, now, let me close my remarks. In closing I want to \nthank the officers of the Senate, the staff members of the Senate who \nhave to remain here. They are here in front of us--the Parliamentarian, \nthe journal clerk, the reading clerk and counting clerk and the pages \nand the people at the desk. They are here. I want to thank them and \napologize for my taking the time this afternoon, but we all know what \nthe responsibilities are of officers of the Senate. We know what the \nresponsibilities of clerks and employees of the Senate are when we sign \non, and we know what the responsibilities of Senators are when we sign \non.\n  Having said that, I offer my apologies to everyone if I imposed on \ntheir time. I offer my apologies, most appropriately and more \nprecisely, to the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden, who is presiding at \nthis moment and who has very graciously indicated his willingness to \nsit in that chair until I close.\n  The whip asked me to close the Senate. So if the whip or the majority \nleader had any special requests or any Senator had any special request \nto make before I close the Senate, I will be very happy if someone \nwould present me with those requests.\n  In the meantime, let me close my printed remarks. It is only a page \nand a half, and they will go very fast.\n\n       Our form of government--\n\n  Senator Mansfield pointed out--\n\n     is based on a system of checks and balances. If this system \n     becomes seriously out of balance at any point, the whole \n     system is jeopardized.\n\n  Senator Mansfield noted:\n\n       There is a profound difference between an essential degree \n     of secrecy to achieve a specific purpose and secrecy for the \n     mere sake of secrecy. Once secrecy becomes sacrosanct, it \n     invites abuse.\n\n  Senator Mansfield recognized, as I do, that the CIA is by nature and \nnecessity a secretive organization, but it is not an organization that \nshould operate outside our constitutional system, not outside our \nsystem of government.\n  With the Senate select committee to study government operations with \nrespect to intelligence agencies--in other words, the Church Committee, \nnamed after the chairman of that committee, the late chairman, Frank \nChurch, the Church Committee--we embarrassingly and tragically learned \njust how ``seriously out of balance'' that agency was.\n  The Senate committee discovered that the CIA had been involved in \nillegal, improper, and unethical activities, including the overthrow of \ndemocratically elected governments, attempted assassinations of foreign \nleaders, and in violation of foreign countries.\n\n[[Page S8609]]\n\n  In testimony before the Church Committee, the late Clark Clifford \nacknowledged:\n\n       The lack of proper controls has resulted in a free-wheeling \n     course of conduct on the part of operations within the \n     intelligence community that has led to spectacular failures \n     and much unfortunate publicity.\n\n  That was one of the architects of the National Security Act of 1947 \nspeaking.\n  Three decades after its enactment, Mr. Clifford was complaining about \ncontinuing imperfections and the damage that had been done to our \ncountry.\n  I am very concerned that 30 years from now Congress will be \nstruggling to rectify the problems we will be creating with the hastily \nconsidered enactment of this legislation as it is written, creating the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, according to the legislation that is \nwritten and before the Senate.\n  How much harm could be done in the meantime cannot be imagined. I am \nreferring to damage to the rights and the liberties that we hold most \ndear: civil rights, labor rights, labor protections, civil liberties of \nall Americans.\n  I will go into those further. I intended to get into some of them \nthis afternoon. I will not do so. I am talking about damage to our \nconstitutional process.\n  I see one other Senator, the distinguished Senator on the Republican \nside of the aisle. I assume he would like to take the floor, if I give \nit up. I didn't intend to give it up until we adjourned. But if the \ndistinguished Senator wishes me to yield to him 5 minutes before I \nadjourn the Senate, I will adjourn in the absence of the majority whip \nand the majority leader. But I will do so by their request.\n  Does the Senator wish me to yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Does he wish me to yield for a statement?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would like to make a statement. I had hoped to speak \nfor 10 or 15 minutes. I understand we have a problem. I have been here \nsince before noon. I know the Senator had his time reserved, as he has \nevery right to do. I was hoping I would have a few moments to talk \nabout the important developments with regard to the President's \nposition on the United Nations and Iraq. I believe it is important to \nmake some remarks today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Chair is here for the \nduration, as long as it may take to complete his remarks.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this is the Senator to whom the Senator from \nAlabama is addressing his remarks. This Senator will answer the \nSenator.\n  Mr. President, since there is another Presiding Officer at the \nmoment, the distinguished Senator from Minnesota, who has been in his \nindividual chair in the Chamber--he sits over here to my left--all \nafternoon during all of the time that this Senator has been talking \nabout the homeland security matter. He is still here. I thank him. He \nhas taken the chair to relieve Senator Wyden. I am glad of that. I am \nstill not going to impose on the Senate. But I am going to hold the \nfloor until the Senator from Alabama gets through with his statement.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that I may yield to the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, for not to exceed 15 \nminutes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator may proceed on the statement \nonly, that I may retain my rights to the floor, and that he may proceed \nfor not to exceed 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia. \nI appreciate his leadership in the Senate, his concern for our \nconstitutional order, and his serious historical understanding of the \nseparation of powers. We might not always agree on where those \nseparations are, but I certainly respect his dedication to preserving \nthose separations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/13/senate-section/article/S8609-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8609-S8611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             PRESIDENT BUSH'S ADDRESS TO THE UNITED NATIONS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I believe it is important today to talk \nabout the remarks President Bush made at the United Nations. I believe \nhe has made a courageous call on the United Nations to defend its \ncredibility in its dealings with Iraq by ensuring that Iraq does not \ncontinue to update its weapons of mass destruction and does not \ncontinue to violate with impunity the 16 U.N. resolutions of which he \nis in violation. I think those remarks were a true example of world \nleadership.\n  President Bush spoke as one who knows right from wrong, who has \nhonest convictions, and he has the courage to express and to act on \nthem. In direct words, he detailed the incontrovertible case that \nSaddam Hussein deliberately used his promises at the time of his defeat \nin the Gulf War as a considered strategy to cause the allies to stop \ntheir hostilities before removing him from power, which has proven to \nbe a trick. Since then, his actions have clearly confirmed his \ndeception and have shown his insincerity, his duplicity, and his \ncomplete rejection of the U.N. resolutions--his rejections, indeed, of \nthe United Nations itself and of the United States and the nations that \njoined together to defeat him in 1991. He rejects them. He does not \nrespect them and his promises made to them.\n  Those agreements, he has said he will follow, but he has never \nintended to follow them because he doesn't give them respect or \ncredibility.\n  The ``Economist'' magazine of London said it is well and good to talk \nabout multilateralism, but it asked, ``what happens when people agree \nto things and do not do them?'' That brings up a problem, particularly \nwhen their failure to do so deals with matters that threaten the peace \nof the world.\n  I don't think anyone can deny that Saddam Hussein's consistent policy \nhas been to defeat, obstruct, and get around the agreements he has \nmade.\n  Some tell us that the world--the international community--is all \nagainst us. They say we are acting unilaterally. Some leaders around \nthe world have indeed said that. But the truth is that President Bush \nis consulting regularly with world leaders. His speech to the U.N. \nstruck the right balance. And progress is being made in obtaining \nsupport around the world--with not enough help, I am afraid, from this \nCongress.\n  But who would ever deny that Saddam Hussein is a unilateralist? With \nwhom did he consult before he invaded Kuwait in 1991? With whom did he \nconsult before he utilized poison gas to kill thousands of his own \ncitizens, the Kurds, in the 1990s?\n  Who did he consult with, what other nation did he consult with, when \nhe plotted to assassinate the former President of the United States of \nAmerica? Who has he consulted with, as he deals to construct, develop, \nand produce weapons of mass destruction?\n  So I would like, Mr. President, to just make a few comments here to \nbring us some perspective that I think is very important at this time \non the kind of support we have around the world.\n  First of all, I think one of the clearest-headed nations--a nation \nthat consistently gets it right around the world on matters of foreign \npolicy--the United Kingdom, is in total support of the United States. \nIndeed, it was reported in the paper today that they were moving troops \ninto the Middle East, and prepared to use them, if necessary, with us.\n  So the Foreign Minister of the U.K., commenting on President Bush's \nspeech to the U.N. said it was ``tough and effective'', and the speech \nreceived quite good remarks from the British leadership.\n  The Belgian Foreign Minister, heretofore a critic of the United \nStates action, Louis Michel, said, after the speech: ``Now we have to \npress Iraq.'' He added, if the U.N. ``doesn't deliver, it will be \nuncomfortable for some European countries not to support the United \nStates.'' That was in today's Washington Times.\n  Kofi Annan, the Secretary General of the U.N., who has criticized the \nUnited States recently, also ``urged Council members yesterday to take \naction or lose legitimacy.''\n  Even France, which has been pretty outspoken against the United \nStates actions, accusing the United States of unilateral activities, \nhas said: ``We\n\n[[Page S8610]]\n\ndon't have sympathy for the Iraq regime.'' And their Foreign Minister \nfurther added that ``he defies the authority of the Security Council, \nraises the threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and, \ntherefore, jeopardize the stability of the region.''\n  The Danish Prime Minister's views were remarkable. A few days ago, on \nSeptember 11, in an op-ed piece here in the Washington Times, Anders \nFogh Rasmussen, the Danish Prime Minister, said, in a strong statement \nof affection and support for the United States wrote:\n\n       Our common values, shared destiny and visions have been \n     further fortified by the horrors of September 11.\n       On the first anniversary of that somber date, Danes will \n     think back with sympathy and sorrow on the victims of the \n     terrorist attacks against the United States and their \n     bereaved families. One year later, our solidarity with \n     America is undiminished.\n       September 11 was a defining moment calling for determined \n     action in defense of humanity and fundamental freedoms. \n     Acting can entail dangers but the dangers of inaction are \n     far, far greater. In the face of today's new threat, the only \n     way to pursue peace is to pursue those who threaten it.\n\n  He goes on to add:\n\n       America and Denmark see eye-to-eye on the real challenges \n     facing us today. In the fight against terrorism, Denmark was, \n     is and will be fully behind the United States. Our best \n     soldiers have been in Afghanistan on the ground and in the \n     mountains, fighting alongside U.S. special operations forces. \n     The danger is far from over and the international community \n     must not waver now.\n\n  So said the Prime Minister of Denmark.\n  Representatives of the Romanian Government have been in town \nrecently, and they have expressed strong support for the United States \nposition in Iraq.\n  Norway, the Norwegian Foreign Minister, after the speech by President \nBush, made these comments: ``We are challenged to live up to our \nresponsibilities.'' And then he said something that I think is true for \nmost of the world leaders: ``I guess we'll have to choose among a lot \nof bad options, really.''\n  Nobody wants to choose. Nobody wants to have a war. We wish it were \nnot so. But we have bad options here. And the President is confronting \nus with the truth, the history of violations by Saddam Hussein. He is \nforcing world leaders. He is forcing the U.S. Congress. And, frankly, \nas I have gone back and studied the history of Saddam Hussein, and the \nviolations are more explicit, more repeated, more deliberate than I had \nremembered actually.\n  So I think that is where we are today. And one reason it is \nappropriate for the United States to be most aggressive in leading this \neffort is that we are the ones--the United States military--that is \noverwhelmingly enforcing, as best we can, the resolutions of the United \nNations in Iraq today.\n  Many people do not realize that our planes are enforcing a no-fly \nzone over Iraq today. They fly every day. They are attacked on a \nregular basis. And we respond and retaliate on a regular basis, \nattacking Iraq. And they have surface-to-air missiles that they utilize \nagainst our aircraft. So far they have not been able to knock down one \nof our aircraft.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, I know that is a matter of concern to \nyou as a member of the Armed Services Committee. But it is a real \nmatter of significance that we are carrying this burden. How long do \nthey want us to carry it?\n  The Economist magazine, in an article on this entire matter, voting \nin their editorial for war, said that the ``box is leaking,'' our \nability to contain him cannot continue. And who did they suggest are \nsuffering most? The people of Iraq, the children of Iraq, because of \nthis diabolical leader that they have.\n  So, yes, we have to take action. We cannot continue to delay. We have \ntroops there in the region that are specifically there to make sure he \ndoes not expand again as he did when he attacked Iran. And that war \ncost 1 million lives in Saddam's failed attempt to defeat Iran and take \nthat territory from Iran; in addition to the gulf war.\n  He moved, after the gulf war, 80,000 troops down on the Kuwait \nborder, causing us to have to respond out of fear he might once again \nattack Kuwait.\n  We have Patriot batteries in Saudi Arabia designed to shoot down \nSaddam's Scud missiles. I visited a Patriot battery with my legislative \nassistant, LTC Archie Galloway. And we visited the Alabama National \nGuard unit that mans a Patriot battery on duty to shoot down Iraqi Scud \nmissiles, if need be at our expense, this very day.\n  So that is not a problem that has been on the front burner of most of \nthe nations of the world. They are not deeply involved in these \nmatters. They are not paying that cost every day, as we are. They are \nnot confronting the reality of Saddam Hussein's duplicity.\n  But the President is leading us to understand. So I think it is now \nimportant for this Congress to speak. Are we with the President or are \nwe against him? We don't need to be rushed, but we need to get busy in \ndiscussing this issue. It is not a new issue.\n  Most of the evidence is there for the world to see, and has been \nthere for many, many years. So we need to make clear whether we will \nsupport the President or not. And if we do not, what are we saying? Are \nwe undermining Secretary of State Colin Powell's ability to negotiate \nwith foreign nations? Are we encouraging the Socialist left in Europe \nto believe that if they object and fight and complain that they can \nultimately prevail, and the United States will fail to act? Are we \nencouraging radical groups in moderate Arab nations to put more and \nmore pressure on the Arab leaders of those countries who might at least \nprivately be sympathetic to our efforts, by failing to support clearly \nthe President of the United States?\n  I believe we will act to support the President. I believe this \nCongress will move. We need to do it before we recess. If we do not, it \nwill be unhealthy for our country. Am I confident we will vote in \nsupport of the President and his proposals and give him authority to \ntake the action necessary to preserve and protect our security \ninterests? Yes, I am. Let me tell you why.\n  There are several important factors. In 1998, this Senate detailed, \nas I indicated on the floor of the Senate earlier in the week, a list \nof direct violations of United Nations resolutions by Saddam Hussein. \nOn August 14, 1998, the President of the United States, President \nClinton, signed Public Law 105-235 which declared that:\n\n       The Government of Iraq is in material and unacceptable \n     breach of its international obligations.\n\n  It urged the President to ``take appropriate action in accordance \nwith the Constitution and relevant laws of the United States to bring \nIraq into compliance with its international obligations.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 15 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I still have the floor, do I not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, inasmuch as I still have the floor and the \ndistinguished Democratic whip has asked me to adjourn the Senate in his \nabsence, I will yield to the Senator 1 additional minute. I have a few \nbrief comments with regard to what the Senator has said. I will be glad \nto yield, if there is no other objection, to the Senator for an \nadditional minute without losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his \ncourtesy.\n  It is time for this Congress to relook at our record of involvement \nwith Iraq and study it, to take new testimony, have new hearings, and \nto stand up, and put up or shut up. We need to be with the President or \nnot with the President. I am convinced this Congress will be with the \nPresident. We do not need to undermine his ability to be effective in \npolicies that we support by delaying our support for them.\n  I urge this Senate to move expeditiously, to not wait on the U.N., \nwhich is not elected by the people of the United States to decide this \nissue but to decide ourselves that we support the President's policies; \nmake that clear, give him the authority he needs to be effective in \nprotecting the United States and this world from a savage and dangerous \ncriminal, Saddam Hussein.\n\n[[Page S8611]]\n\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/13/senate-section/article/S8611-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8611-S8614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HOMELAND SECURITY ACT OF 2002--Continued\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator from Alabama. I have long \nhad as my friends Senators from Alabama. When I came to the Senate, \nthere were Senators Sparkman and Lister Hill. There have been a \nsuccession of Senators from Alabama. Especially, I want to mention the \nlate Senator James Allen from Alabama. I have had very good relations \nwith the Senators from Alabama.\n  I consider myself as being on the same footing, same level of good \nrelations with the distinguished Senator from Alabama who has just \naddressed the Senate.\n  I do want to comment briefly on two or three things that he said.\n  He first indicated, when I yielded to him, that he and I had often \nagreed on matters and that there were times when we might disagree as \nto our interpretations of the Constitution. That can be very true.\n  Today, I have been talking about a phrase which, when joined with the \npreceding language, amounts to a sentence, a clause: The Congress shall \nhave power to declare war.\n  There is no reason for anybody to misinterpret that. I hope the \nSenator from Alabama wouldn't misinterpret what is in plain view, \nwritten in plain English, and has been in that Constitution now for \nover 200 years. I hope there is no matter of misinterpreting that \nplainly spoken clause in the United States Constitution: The Congress \nshall have power to declare war.\n  I hope we don't have to argue about how to interpret those plainly \nwritten, well-understood words from the English language that Congress \nshall have the power to declare war. That is what I have been talking \nabout.\n  The distinguished Senator went on to say, we need to be with the \nPresident of the United States; we need to support the President of the \nUnited States.\n  I like to be with the President of the United States on most matters. \nAnd in the final analysis, I may be with the President on this one. But \nit is not a matter of being with the President or supporting the \nPresident. I maintain that we need to be with the Constitution of the \nUnited States. We need to support the Constitution of the United \nStates. It is not damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead; it is not damn \nthe Constitution, full speed ahead.\n  I want to be with the Constitution. Count me on the side of the \nConstitution. I want to support the Constitution first, last, and all \nthe time, I say to the Senator. And maybe I will be with the President \nin due time. But I am not one who says this is a matter that has to be \nhurried before the election. What is this? Is this the October surprise \nin August or in September? This is a matter of great moment. And \nhinging on the decisions of this Senate may be the lives of many \ncitizens.\n  In the second book of Samuel, I remember the story there which is \ntold of a rich man and a poor man who lived in the same city. The rich \nman had huge herds of sheep, cattle, and lambs. The poor man had one \nlittle lamb. The poor man had one little ewe lamb. Everywhere that poor \nman went, that little lamb went. That little lamb was the sole \npossession the poor man had. When he ate, he fed that little lamb from \nhis bowl, from his pot, or whatever it might have been. The poor man \ncared for that little lamb and it loved him. He shared his food and he \nshared his shelter with that little lamb.\n\n  Presently, a traveler visited the rich man, and the rich man wanted \nto present a feast to the traveler. He wanted to show courtesy and all \nof the niceties of being a man of hospitable nature. He wanted to \nspread food before the stranger. Did he take from his lambs, his herds? \nHe had huge herds. He had vast possessions. He had barns in which he \nstored the product of the fields. He had vast lands. He had servants. \nHe was well off. He had many, many lambs.\n  Did he take one of the lambs from his own herd? No. He took the one \nlittle lamb that the poor man had and served it up, may I say to the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama. He served that little lamb, the \nonly lamb that the poor man had. He didn't ask for it. He just took it. \nHe took that little lamb from the poor man and served it up to his \nguest.\n  Now, why do I say this? Why do I refer to second Samuel today? There \nare many mothers in this land who won't get to vote on this matter. \nThere are many mothers in this land who have but one little lamb. I \nknow we have a volunteer military now, and those who volunteer \nunderstand what their responsibilities are. They know they may have to \nsacrifice their lives, and they volunteered to do it. Nevertheless, \nthere are those in the service who are the little lambs of mothers who \nare at home at night thinking about their little lambs and praying for \ntheir little lambs.\n  Now, here we are about to be faced with a proposition in which these \nrepresentatives--these mothers of the sons and daughters who are in the \nservices--will not be asked for their vote. There are those who \napparently are under the impression that the Congress doesn't need to \nbe asked for its vote--the Congress, the elected Representatives under \nthis Constitution.\n  Yet some have suggested that the President has the authority. He can \ngo. Some say he is right and he should attack unilaterally. That is \nwhat we have been talking about in the last few weeks. People were \nunder the impression that this might be a unilateral attack by the \nUnited States against a sovereign state that was not attacking the \nUnited States. Of course, we all agree about this imp who is head of \nthat government. But that is a sovereign state. That state is not \nattacking us.\n  I am not arguing that Iraq it is not a threat, but is it such a \nthreat, is it so impending, is it so immediate that the Commander in \nChief, who is the civil authority over the military in our system of \ngovernment, can send men and women in the military to war, send them to \ngive their lives, to shed their blood, without asking the Congress? Is \nhe the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end, of this \ndecision?\n  The President is the Commander in Chief. He is not a four-star \ngeneral. Under our system, it is meant to be that way. He is not a \nfour-star general. This is a republic, a constitutional republic, and \nwe have a legislative branch and a judicial branch. These are separate \nbranches. Are we, the Congress, going to stand by and say I am with my \nPresident, right or wrong?\n  No, I don't subscribe to that. Every Senator in this body knows I \nhave spoken out in opposition to Democratic Presidents--President \nClinton being one. I am not speaking from the standpoint of a Democrat. \nI am speaking from the standpoint of a duly elected Representative of \nthe American people who have sent me here to this body under a \nconstitutional system that observes a separation of power. No, don't \ntell me you are either with the President or against the President. \nThat is what I have just heard.\n\n  I am with the Constitution. Mark me down for the Constitution.\n  Now, I will have both ears open and hear the arguments that are made. \nI have already applauded the President for going to the United Nations. \nI think the U.N. has been derelict in its duty. It has stood by \nsupinely while 16 of its resolutions have been ignored. I don't \ndisagree with that; the President did the right thing in doing that. \nThere should not have been all this talk in the newspaper, on the \ntelevision, and on the radio, and through the media--the many men and \nwomen of the Government taking the attitude, apparently, that the \nPresident has the authority to go to war if he wants to; he has the \nauthority. That is not so.\n  We are not talking about a mere skirmish. We are not talking about a \nsituation in which another country has attacked our country or launched \nan attack on our military forces. This is not a skirmish that we have \nlooming out here. This is war. The weapons that may be unleashed in \nthis war will not have been unleashed, perhaps, in previous wars. But \nwe still have a Constitution. I don't care how many, or how loud they \nmay talk or speak. I am going to be at least a single voice saying that \nwe live, we work, we act by the Constitution of the United States when \nit comes to declaring war and making war. You can have a thousand \nvoices, but they will not drown out mine.\n  I am going to be heard, if God gives me the privilege of standing on \nthis floor and speaking. I don't know how long God may give me that \nprivilege. But as long as I can speak, I will. I am not the greatest \ndefender of the Constitution that ever lived. I know a lot\n\n[[Page S8612]]\n\nabout American history, and I know a lot about the Daniel Websters who \nspoke in support of the Union that was created by this Constitution, \nwhich I hold in my hand.\n  This is no Johnny-come-lately to this Senate. I have seen 300 \nSenators come and go except for one Senator. There have been others in \nthis body who have defended this Constitution as valiantly as any could \ndefend it.\n  Don't say to me you are either with the President or you are not with \nthe President. That is not the case. I am with the Constitution of the \nUnited States, and I am with the Commander in Chief of the United \nStates when Congress declares war.\n  I know there have only been five declarations of war. I know there \nhave been seven other wars that have been carried on, not by \ndeclaration but by congressional statute. Congress authorized them. \nThere have been many smaller wars, conflicts, military skirmishes, and \nso on. But this is a major question facing this country. It will not be \na military skirmish if it happens, and many a mother will cry on her \npillow because her lamb, perhaps her only lamb, will have his life \ntaken.\n  Mr. President, I say let's hear what the ordinary people--I want to \nuse the word ``ordinary'' because that fits me exactly. I came from the \nother side of the tracks. I did not grow up in the boardrooms of this \ncountry. I was never on any corporate board. The only business I ever \nhad was a small grocery store. My wife did most of the work in that \nlittle grocery store. She put me through college. So I am from the \nother side of the tracks.\n  I have known times when I did not know what my next job would be. I \nhad a family early. My wife and I have been married 65 years, 3 months \nand 15 days today. We were poor. When I was married I was making $70 a \nmonth, working 6 days a week, long hours a day, and for a while in that \nperiod walking 4 miles to work and 4 miles from work if I could not \ncatch a ride on a milk truck or bread truck.\n  I am from the other side of the street. I am not a pampered brat who \nnever knew the need for a nickel, never knew the need for anything, had \neverything given to me. I do not find any fault with people who are \nborn lucky. What I am saying is there are many more people like this \nman from the other side of the tracks in this country, and there are \nmany more mothers from that side of the tracks than there are those who \nnever knew what it was to have to wipe the sweat from their brow for \ntheir daily bread; never had to get their fingernails dirty; never had \nto wear tennis shoes in the snow. Those are the people who fight in \nwars. They are the people whose sons and daughters die in wars, but \nthey are not the people who are at the high echelons of Government who \ndo the voting.\n  In this instance, yes, we are going to have a vote. You can bet on \nthat. We will have one. I said all along we ought to vote. That is what \nI am saying today. Congress should vote. But I am not for an ``October \nsurprise'' in August, and I am not for voting on this matter before the \nelection.\n  Look behind that drapery. Draw aside that veil. What do you see? It \nhas to be voted on before the election? Forget it. If circumstances \ndevelop that truly can convince, can be persuasive beyond a semblance \nof doubt that Congress ought to act tomorrow or the day after tomorrow \nor next week, yes, but that convincing case has not been made.\n  A convincing case was made to the United Nations yesterday with \nrespect to the failures of the United Nations, the fact that that body \nhas been recreant in carrying out their responsibilities, a very \nconvincing case made by the President of the United States. But no \nconvincing case has been made in the press or in this body that we must \nact to give the President authority to invade a sovereign nation now or \nbefore the election. That case has not been made.\n  Make the case and make it here. And believe me, there will be plenty \nsaid on both sides. If our Nation is at war with another country, I \nwill do everything I can to support that war.\n  I helped to build the liberty ships and the victory ships in the \nshipyards of Baltimore and the shipyards of Tampa, FL during World War \nII. I was a first-class welder who helped to build ships to carry the \nfood and commerce for the engine of war in World War II. I helped to \nbuild the ships to convey to the military in Europe, in northern \nAfrica, in the Pacific. These ships carried the munitions of war. We \nhelped to keep the food lines and the blood lines open with those \nships. So there are many ways to serve. But believe you me, this \nSenator is not now or ever going to be stampeded into voting for or \nagainst this subject just to be with or without the President. I am \nwith the Constitution. If that is the argument we are going to hear, it \nis not going to be a very persuasive argument. You are either going to \nbe with this President or not with him.\n  Who made this President? He is a very respectable individual who \ncomes from a fine family. I served here with his father who became \nPresident. Who made him? How did he become President? Somebody had to \ncast votes to elect him President. How long will he be President?\n  The Constitution made this President. The Constitution was here \nbefore this President or any other President. Who made the President? \nWho is going to be with the President? I will first be with the \nConstitution. I may be with the President later, but first is the \nConstitution.\n  Don't come here saying we are either with or without the President. \nThat is not the question. The question is: Are we with the \nConstitution? Are the people's representatives going to make a \ndecision? When that time comes, then there might be some good arguments \nto go to war with Iraq, even to stand alone and go to war. Maybe \narguments can be presented. There may be evidence by then. Who knows? I \ndo not know, but we have to see it. The evidence is not there yet that \nwe have to act so hastily, that we have to act before the election.\n  What does the election have to do with it? What does the election \nhave within itself to do with it? The election will go forward. What is \nto keep Congress from voting on this matter after the election? Why \ndoes it have to be before the election? Is that the ``October \nsurprise'' in September or October, before November? Let's not be too \nhasty. That is what I have been saying about this legislation with \nreference to homeland security. Let's don't be too hasty. Let's do it \nright. Remember that mother's lamb.\n  The distinguished Senator asked: With whom did Hussein talk? With \nwhom did he consult? He may not have consulted anybody; that is too \nbad. Hussein should have had a free and independent Senate. Hussein \nshould have had a Senate where voices could be heard, voices in \nopposition to Hussein, voices of caution, openly and freely where all \nthe public could hear. Yes, Hussein should have had that. There was no \nSenate like this Senate in Hussein's government. I am talking about a \nfree, separate branch, that is independent, where there is free, \nunlimited speech--except for unanimous consent or cloture--where there \nis a Senate that controls the purse strings. Yes, I say Hussein should \nhave had that. He should have had a Senate like this Senate. It is not \nled around by any President's chain. No President chains this Senate.\n  There are no chains on this Senate. It is a free and independent \nSenate. Yes, Hussein should have had a Senate such as this one, where \ndebate would have been heard. But he does not have that. With whom did \nhe consult? Certainly not an Iraqi Senate, like this one.\n  The same could be said of Emperor Justinian who ruled in \nConstantinople, on the great golden horn. Justinian sent thousands of \npeople to their deaths in the Nika rebellion. Justinian did not have a \nSenate.\n  What about Ivan the Terrible, who had tens of thousands massacred? \nIvan the Terrible did not have a Senate. There was no Senate in \nMuscovy.\n  Peter the Great sent thousands of men to labor and to die in the \nswamps to build the city of Petrograd, Leningrad. But Peter the Great \nhad no Senate to caution him, no Senate that controlled the purse \nstrings.\n  Yes, with whom did Hussein consult? That is a good question. But we \nknow that Hussein had no Senate.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. No, not yet. I will yield maybe later. I will be glad to \nyield--does the Senator have to leave the\n\n[[Page S8613]]\n\nfloor? I will yield right now. He is about to leave the floor in a \nhuff, I believe. I hope he is not. Maybe I am misinterpreting him.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may yield to the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama for a question without losing my \nright to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia. \nThe Senator is so eloquent in defending the prerogatives of this \nSenate, and I thank him for that.\n  We do not need to rush into this. I am of the belief--and I ask the \nSenator if he would consider the possibility that he would be willing \nto support the commencement of debate and a vote, if we could do so, \nbefore we recess because we may be into January before we return, and I \nthink it could complicate matters.\n  If I was inarticulate, I apologize, but my request would be that we \nconsider the policies, not the President. It is not a personal thing; \nthe Senator from West Virginia is correct. Let us consider those \npolicies so the world would know whether we are going to support that \nor not. I know the former Vice Presidential nominee for the Democratic \nParty, Senator Lieberman, is supporting these policies, and I think \nthere is a majority here. I think the Senator from West Virginia may \nwell agree at some point, after he has had full time to digest and \nconsider it, but I do believe and hope that the Senator would consider \nallowing us to have a vigorous debate and a vote as soon as we possibly \ncould.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will respond to the question that has been \naddressed to me, and it is a good question, a thoughtful question. May \nI just say I hope the Senator will join me in insisting that this \nSenate debate the homeland security legislation and not rush that \nlegislation. That is a part of national defense as much as anything. It \nis the defense of our homeland. So I hope the Senator will be one of \nthose who will join me in taking our time to thoughtfully debate a very \nserious matter, namely, the creation of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  Now, more to the question as it was addressed to me, the answer is I \nsupport debate on the question as to whether or not the Congress should \nauthorize the Commander in Chief to make war. I have asked my staff to \nconsider language for such a question to be presented to the Senate. My \nstaff has been working on such a matter. I hear that Mr. Levin is going \nto hold hearings in the Armed Services Committee, on which the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama serves so well.\n  It is good that Senator Levin is going to do that. It is good that \nthe distinguished Senator from Delaware, Mr. Biden, chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, will hold hearings. The chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee, Senator Graham, may hold hearings. So all these \nthings are well and good. They are all necessary under the \ncircumstances. We should understand what the witnesses say in those \nhearings.\n  Our three chairmen should not just invite administration witnesses. \nApparently they already have their minds made up. Invite them, but \ndon't just not stop at that. Apparently they have their minds made up. \nI heard three or four of them on Sunday talk shows last Sunday. I \nalready mentioned that. They are all from the same viewpoint, and not \none mentioned the Constitution of the United States. Yes, I favor that \nthe Congress vote, up or down. I have said that before today. I have \nsaid that many days. I think the Congress should vote up or down on the \nquestion.\n  This is the question as to whether or not Congress will authorize and \ndeclare war, if it comes to that. This will be no minor skirmish. This \nwill not be a little group out on a party and they happened to run into \nsome other people, they got mixed up and got to fighting, and two or \nthree were killed. This is not a minor skirmish. I said, yes, this is a \nsolemn question because it does involve a dictator such as Saddam \nHussein, one who has killed his own people, gassed his own people, one \nwho has shown no compunction about using biological or chemical \nweapons. We know he has done that. We know he can do that.\n  But the question is, what is it that makes it so urgent that all of a \nsudden here comes something like a cloud over the western hills and \nblows into the Capital City, here is a looming storm that just came up. \nLord, this may be a torrent. It may flood ourselves. It may kill \npeople. We have to do something about it right now. What can we do as \nmere mortals? It is not quite like that.\n  I have already said the President has inherent power without asking \nanybody. If Congress is out of town, he does not have to ask Congress. \nIf this country is attacked, he has the inherent power to repel the \nattacker. I don't argue about that. But that is not the situation. What \nis so new? We have known these things now for months or years.\n  May I say to the distinguished Senator from Alabama, would the \nSenator show me the courtesy of just finishing? I know there may be \nsome who think I am long winded.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I had something I had to take care of, and I thank the \nSenator, but I will be glad to stay a few more minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Cicero was asked what speech by Demosthenes he liked best; \nand he said, the longest.\n  So it is all right. One can be long winded if he has something to \nsay. And he may have to say it over and over and over in this \nsituation.\n  I say, yes, yes, in answer to the Senator, I am for a vote. But I \nhave to see evidence that requires us to vote now or tomorrow. We have \nhad this evidence all this while, at least a long while, 3 months or 4 \nmonths or 3 years. So why the sudden rush that we have to vote before \nthe election? I think we should vote after the election so Senators \nwill not be persuaded or moved one way or the other, because of an \nelection, as to how they vote. They are voting to send that little lamb \nto the slaughter. Should we do that in a hurry? No. I say let's delay.\n  I have said all I will say in answer to the distinguished Senator, \nunless he has another question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia \nfor his courtesy and his thoughtfulness. I just ask that he consider, \nin evaluating his decision, the difficulties it provides for the United \nStates if we cannot get a vote of support. If we are not for it, let's \nsay so. If we do not believe and we are not going to fund--which is our \nultimate power, to cut off funds--let's say so, and we get on with \nsomething else.\n  I strongly believe we should proceed. Senator Warner, who was \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee or ranking member on the Armed \nServices Committee, said there were nine hearings last time before the \ngulf war, with a period of intense debate. The Senator is correct, we \nought to have hearings and we ought to have debate. It is just a \nquestion of, as soon as we get that and people feel ready, the sooner \nwe get started and the sooner we complete it, I think the Nation will \nbe better off.\n  I respect the views of the Senator and the concerns. As the Senator \nknows, under our Constitution we have elections all the time, one \nfollowing the other. There is never a time that someone does not have \nan election in mind, unfortunately.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator avoids the question he put to me. He is talking \nabout an election that will come upon us in November--this coming \nNovember. I understand what he is saying. He is saying we ought to take \naction before the election. Then he says we ought to hear what the U.N. \nsays. And I say, let's not be in all the hurry. We ought to hear what \nthe U.N. says. Let's see what world opinion is. We ought not go into \nthis alone.\n  If this man is a threat to world peace, the United States should not \nhave to go it alone. Perhaps he will have to be removed. But we have a \nlittle bit of time, surely.\n  I say to the Senator, let's take the time. Let's debate the question. \nLet's debate it and reach a decision on the basis of what the \nConstitution tells us.\n  Let me just continue. I didn't want the Senator to leave. I thought \nhe was about to leave.\n  Let me continue. He said, with whom does he consult? That is a good \nquestion. I have already responded. I also talked about Justinian. I \ntalked about Ivan the Terrible. I talked about Peter the Great. Now, \nlet's go to Stalin. With\n\n[[Page S8614]]\n\nwhom did he consult? With whom did Adolph Hitler talk? With whom did he \nconsult?\n  It was not a free and independent Senate. If they had a free and \nindependent Senate that had control of the power and control of the \npurse strings, history might have been different. Hundreds of thousands \nof lives might have been saved.\n  Mr. President, let us not act in haste. Let us forget about our \npolitics. Let us not be for or against a resolution on the question of \nwar or peace on the basis of what party we belong to. Let us put that \nquestion in a way that we will be with and in support of the \nConstitution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/13/senate-section/article/S8614-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record an article from the Wall Street Journal dated September \n11, 2002.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 11, 2002]\n\n                            We Will Prevail\n\n                          (By Theodore Olson)\n\n       From a speech by Solicitor General Theodore Olson to the \n     Federalist Society on Nov. 16, 2001, Mr. Olson's wife, \n     Barbara, was one of the airplane passengers murdered on Sept. \n     11, 2001.\n       September 11, 2001 was unprecedented in our nation's \n     history. Our country has been attacked before. Our soldiers \n     and innocent citizens have been the victims of terrorism \n     before. But never before in our history have so many civilian \n     citizens, engaged in the routines of their daily lives, who \n     neither individually nor collectively had done anything to \n     provoke the savage attack that they were to experience that \n     day, been brutally murdered for the simple reason that they \n     were Americans, and because they stood, in their countless \n     individual lives, for all the things that America symbolizes.\n       As President Bush immediately recognized, Sept. 11 was an \n     act of war. But it was much more than that. It was also a \n     crime, an act of pure hatred and unmitigated evil.\n       The victims were of all races, backgrounds, religions, ages \n     and qualities. They had one thing in common. They were nearly \n     all Americans. Their lives were extinguished because they \n     were the embodiment of the aspirations of most of the world's \n     peoples. The people who killed them hate the beacon that \n     America holds out to people who are impoverished, enslaved, \n     persecuted and subjugated everywhere in the world.\n       The men who planned the savage acts of Sept. 11 cannot \n     prevail as long as American ideals continue to inspire the \n     people they hope to tyrannize and enslave.\n       It is a cynical lie that the animals that killed our loved \n     ones were motivated by Islam, or because this nation of ours \n     is anti-Islamic. Enshrined in the First Amendment to our \n     Constitution is freedom of expression and the free exercise \n     of religion. This continent was populated by people who \n     crossed a terrifying ocean to reach a rugged and inhospitable \n     frontier to escape religious persecution.\n       From its birth, this nation and the American people have \n     offered sanctuary and shelter to all faiths. Our \n     Constitution--always with the support of our people--has \n     extended its embrace to the unpopular, the unusual, the \n     unconventional and the unorthodox. We protect not only those \n     who will not salute our flag, but those who would spit upon \n     it or burn it. We pledge our allegiance to a Constitution \n     that shelters those who refuse to pledge their allegiance to \n     it.\n       It is true, I suppose, that there are many in the Middle \n     East who hate this country for its support of Israel. But how \n     tragic and misguided to despise us for extending comfort and \n     defense to a people who have so long, and so recently, been \n     the victims of indescribable ethnic persecution. Nor has \n     America's support for Israel ever been rooted in or \n     manifested by hostility to the Muslim faith or those who \n     practice it. The terrorists and their apologists have lied \n     about these things, but what is another lie when their \n     goals and tactics are so vastly more evil?\n       The terrorists can succeed only through corruption and \n     brutality. Thus they must tear down America and its system of \n     laws which shields its people from those malevolent acts. \n     They can enslave the people they wish to subjugate only by \n     keeping them poor and destitute, so they must undermine and \n     discredit the one place in all the world that stands the most \n     for the rule of law and allows its people the opportunity to \n     rise above all those conditions.\n       Abraham Lincoln was paraphrasing our Declaration of \n     Independence when he characterized our nation as having been \n     ``conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that \n     all men are created equal.'' That revolutionary document set \n     down our collective belief in inalienable human rights, the \n     proposition that governments derive their powers from the \n     consent of the governed, the principle that tyrants who would \n     oppress their people are unfit to be rulers of a free people, \n     and the right to the pursuit of happiness.\n       The terrorists of Sept. 11 cannot prevail in a world \n     occupied by the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution \n     and its Bill of Rights, the Emancipation Proclamation, the \n     Gettysburg Address, the Statue of Liberty, the World Trade \n     Center, the Pentagon, the Capitol, the Supreme Court and the \n     White House. They cannot co-exist with these ideals, these \n     principles, these institutions and these symbols. So they \n     cannot survive, much less prevail, in the same world as \n     America.\n       America is not today, or ever, without imperfections and \n     shortcomings. Implementation of our lofty ideals has never \n     been without error, and some of our mistakes have been \n     shameful. But the course of our history has been constant, if \n     occasionally erratic, progress from the articulation of those \n     lofty ideals to the extension of their reality to all our \n     people--those who were born here and those, from hundreds of \n     diverse cultures, who flock here.\n       There is no segment or class of the world's peoples who \n     have exclusive claim on the term ``American,'' and no segment \n     of the world's population to whom that claim has been denied. \n     We welcome 100,000 refugees per year into this country. Over \n     650,000 people immigrated legally to America in the most \n     recent year for which we have reliable statistics. Over five \n     million people are in this country today who were so \n     desperate to come here that they did so illegally.\n       There are more Jews in New York City than in Israel. More \n     Poles in Chicago then any city in the world except Warsaw. \n     America is home to 39 million Irish-Americans, 58 million \n     German-Americans, 39 million Hispanic-Americans and nearly a \n     million Japanese-Americans. And there are seven million \n     Muslims in America, nearly the population of New York City.\n       How tragic it is that the agents of the Sept. 11 terrorist \n     acts were people whom we welcome to this country, and to whom \n     we extended all of our freedoms, the protections of all of \n     our laws, and the opportunities this country affords to \n     everyone to travel, work and live. But we welcome immigrants \n     because nearly all of us are immigrants or descendants of \n     immigrants who came here to enjoy freedoms, rights, \n     liberties, and the opportunity, denied elsewhere, to pursue \n     happiness and prosperity.\n       Ronald Reagan often said that ``every once in a while, each \n     of us native-born Americans should make it a point to have a \n     conversation with someone who is an American by choice.'' Mr. \n     Reagan was fond of quoting from a letter he received from a \n     man who wrote, ``you can go to live in Turkey, but you can't \n     become a Turk. You can't go to live in Japan and become \n     Japanese, [and so on for Germany, France, etc.]. But . . . \n     anyone from any corner of the world can come to America and \n     be an American.''\n       So it is particularly sad and a bitter irony that the 19 \n     savages who took the lives of thousands of Americans were \n     able to come here because we welcomed them, and trusted them, \n     and allowed them to learn to fly our airplanes and gave them \n     the freedom to travel. They took these precious gifts and \n     turned them into instruments of hatred and death.\n       It has, I suppose, always caused some resentment that we \n     believe so passionately and unquestioningly that the freedoms \n     we value should belong to all people. But we know that these \n     are enduring values. We can debate nearly everything else, \n     but we don't need to debate that. We know that these \n     principles lift everyone up.\n       We have now been reminded, in the most horrible way, that \n     there are those who not only hate our principles, but who \n     would dedicate their lives--and surrender their lives--to \n     banish those ideals and the incentives they provide for \n     tyrannized and impoverished people everywhere to do what \n     Americans did in 1776. We have tragically learned again, in \n     the most unthinkable fashion, that our values and our \n     principles are neither self-executing nor self-sustaining, \n     and that we must sacrifice and fight to maintain what our \n     forebears sacrificed and fought to bequeath to us.\n       And now the rest of the world is learning again that \n     Americans will not flinch from that fight or tire of it. \n     Americans will fight, they will sacrifice, and they will not \n     give up or leave the job unfinished. This war is for all \n     living Americans. It is for the parents, grandparents and \n     great-grandparents that fought and sacrificed to come here. \n     And it is for our children and generations to come. And it is \n     for those who choose to become Americans in the future.\n       America will not lose this war because we cannot even \n     consider that we will lose what centuries of Americans fought \n     to create, improve and maintain. We cannot, and we will not, \n     betray the people who gave us this glorious heritage. We \n     cannot and will not, dishonor or wash away the memories of \n     those who somehow clawed their way out of poverty, tyranny \n     and persecution to come to this country because it was \n     America, and because they were willing to risk death to \n     become Americans, and to give their children\n\n[[Page S8615]]\n\n     and grandchildren the opportunity and freedom and inspiration \n     that makes this place America. Americans could no longer call \n     themselves Americans if they could walk away from that \n     legacy.\n       People who write for newspapers and who offer opinions on \n     television, or who send advice to us from other parts of the \n     world, sometimes say that America is too rich, lazy, \n     complacent, frightened, soft and enervated to fight this \n     fight. That we have no stamina, strength, will, patience, or \n     steel. That we will collapse.\n       They are so wrong. We will prevail for the very reason that \n     we have been attacked. Because we are Americans. Because the \n     values that made us free, make us strong; because the \n     principles that made us prosperous, make us creative, \n     resourceful, innovative, determined and fiercely protective \n     of our freedoms, our liberties and our rights to be \n     individuals and to aspire to whatever we choose to be. Those \n     values and those characteristics will lift us and will defeat \n     the black forces who have assaulted our ideals, our country \n     and our people.\n       The very qualities that bring immigrants and refugees to \n     this country in the thousands every day, made us vulnerable \n     to the attack of Sept. 11, but those are also the qualities \n     that will make us victorious and unvanquished in the end.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/13/senate-section/article/S8615-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FOOD FOR GUNS PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this Saturday the Detroit Police Department \nwill begin a new gun buyback program offering a $25 gift certificate \nfor gas and a $25 gift certificate for food to anyone who brings in an \nunloaded gun. Last year, a very successful similar effort took more \nthan 600 guns off the streets of Detroit.\n  During the past week, volunteers from the Youth Initiative Project, \nan organization dedicated to drug prevention and stopping youth \nviolence, have gone door-to-door informing people throughout the \ncommunity of the program. In addition, the Youth Initiative Project is \na planning a Family Safety Fun Day to coincide with the gun buyback \nprogram that will distribute trigger locks and information on gun \nsafety.\n  There have been 14 young people killed by guns this year in metro \nDetroit. In response to these tragic shootings, the Youth Initiative \nProject held a town hall meeting at the Redford Branch of the Detroit \nPublic Library on how to prevent gun violence. Some of the organizers \nwere trained this summer at the Youth Action Institute, a three day \nconvention in Washington, D.C. sponsored by the Alliance for Justice. \nThese same volunteers are planning three more town hall meetings in \nDetroit and then will move their program into local schools.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in commending the Detroit Police \nDepartment for this positive approach to getting guns off the streets \nand the Youth Initiative Project for their efforts to make the day a \nsuccess and their commitment to educating their peers on gun safety.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/13/senate-section/article/S8615-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              NEEDED: REGIME CHANGES IN BURMA AND CAMBODIA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on August 1, 2002 the United States and \nthe Association for Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN, signed a ``Joint \nDeclaration for Cooperation To Combat International Terrorism.''\n  Through this Declaration, both Burma and Cambodia affirmed \ncommitments ``to counter, prevent, and suppress all forms of terrorist \nacts . . .'' and pledged to view ``acts of terrorism in all its forms \nand manifestations, committed wherever, whenever, and by whomsoever, as \na profound threat to international peace and security. . . .''\n  Lest the irony of these commitments be lost on my colleagues, let me \nsay a word or two about each country.\n  For over a decade, the people of Burma have been under the repressive \nmisrule of military thugs who have systematically ruined the economy, \nwhile profiting from illicit activities, imprisoned political \nopponents, (including those legitimately elected by the people of \nBurma), raped ethnic girls and women, forced into labor children and \nvillagers, and squandered scarce financial resources on military \nweapons and nuclear technology, at the expense of the welfare of their \ncompatriots.\n  Just last week, two members of the youth wing of the National League \nfor Democracy--the legitimately elected representatives of the people \nof Burma--were arrested and sentenced to three years in prison for \npossessing a journal published by exiled dissidents. By any definition, \nthe State Peace and Development Council's rule in Burma has been a \nreign of terror.\n  In neighboring Cambodia, the ruling party is led by a former Khmer \nRouge guerilla whose penchant for violence is well known, and \ndocumented, throughout the region. In July 1997, Prime Minister Hun Sen \nstaged a bloody coup d'etat to oust his royalist rivals, and he is the \nprime suspect in a brutal assassination attempt on the country's sole \nopposition leader, Sam Rainsy.\n  That attempt, which occurred during a political rally on Easter \nSunday in 1997, failed, but killed and injured scores of Cambodians. \nAmerican democracy worker Ron Abney was injured in the terrorist \nattack, and has long suspected that Hun Sen was the devious mastermind. \nTo this day, Ron and all victims of Hun Sen's terror are awaiting \njustice.\n  I am also troubled by news reports that Heng Sean, an opposition \nactivist, was murdered in Kampong Cham over the weekend. It appears \nthat Mr. Heng's only crime was to support Sam Rainsy and his agenda for \nreform.\n  For my colleagues less familiar with Cambodian affairs, I recommend \nreading ``The Cambodian Conundrum'' by veteran journalist Nate Thayer, \nForeign Service Journal, March 2002, which provides keen insights into \nthe previous Administration's ``blind eye'' foreign policy in Cambodia.\n  Given the actions of Southeast Asian hardliners in Rangoon and Phnom \nPenh, last month's pledges to combat terrorism ring hollow. It would \nserve American interests in the war on terrorism--as well as benefit \nthe welfare of the people of Burma and Cambodia--for regime changes to \noccur in those countries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/13/senate-section/article/S8615-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8615-S8616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     UNITED STATES POLICY ON SUDAN\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on the situation \nin Sudan, a county characterized by brutal fighting and tremendous \nsuffering, a country in which an estimated two million people have died \nin just the past decade from war-related causes, and where millions \nmore have been displaced.\n  In July, I held a hearing on U.S. Policy in Sudan in my capacity as \nchairman of the African Affairs Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee. At that time, I praised the administration for \ndevoting high-level attention to the plight of the Sudanese people. As \nI noted then, the President and the Secretary of State have spoken out \nabout Sudan. The President appointed Senator John Danforth to be his \nSpecial Envoy for Peace in Sudan. USAID Administrator Andrew Natsios \nwas named Special Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan. As a result of \nSenator Danforth's efforts, the International Eminent Persons Group has \ninvestigated means for preventing abductions and slavery and has \nreported on its findings. And in July, negotiations between the \nGovernment of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Army, or SPLA, in \nMachakos, Kenya produced a broad framework for ending the civil war and \nproviding the people of the south with the means to exercise their \nright to self-determination. All of this deserves praise.\n  But currently, the negotiations are troubled. The Government of Sudan \npulled its negotiators out of Machakos in response to the SPLA's \ncapturing the strategic garrison town of Torit on September 1. Many \nobservers, including key American officials, believe that the process \nis not permanently derailed but merely disrupted. Still, this \ndisruption calls the world's attention to a rather telling point. There \nis no ceasefire on the ground in Sudan, and not only do military \nengagements continue, so too do attacks on civilians and the \nmanipulation of humanitarian assistance. The situation of the Sudanese \npeople has not improved despite the developments at the negotiating \ntable.\n  I continue to support the administration's efforts to work with \nInter-governmental Authority on Development, IGAD, to facilitate the \npeace process. But given this disconnect between reality on the ground \nand rhetoric in negotiations, given the troubled recent history of \nUnited States-Sudanese relations, given the scale and scope of the\n\n[[Page S8616]]\n\nabuses committed against civilians regularly in that troubled country, \nthis effort requires something of a leap of faith. I do not criticize \nthe administration for taking the leap, I believe that it was a correct \nand courageous decision to work with the Government in Khartoum and \nwith the SPLA to try to find a path to peace in Sudan. But I do \ncriticize the administration for not taking the confidence-building \nmeasures, including those identified by Senator Danforth, seriously \nenough, leaving us with little in the way of concrete reassurances that \nour leap was a wise one.\n  Specifically, I am referring to issue of the civilian bombing \nmonitoring team. In the July hearing, I asked Assistant Secretary of \nState for African Affairs Walter Kansteiner about the bombing of \ncivilian targets. Senator Danforth succeeded in getting both the \nGovernment of Sudan and the Sudanese People's Liberation Army to agree \nto allow a monitoring team to verify their stated commitment not to \nintentionally attack civilian targets. That happened in spring. But at \nthe time of the hearing, we still had no monitors on the ground. \nMeanwhile, reports of attacks on civilians persist. What are we waiting \nfor, I asked. When will the team be functioning on the ground?\n  I was told that this effort was taking shape, and that the team would \nbe functioning by the end of August. But today, the team is still not \nin place, still not functioning. We cannot even move to the very \nimportant work of trying to link documented incidents of attacks on \ncivilians to clear consequences, because we remain, apparently, \nincapable of deploying a qualified and appropriately equipped team of \npeople with experience in Sudan and in human rights monitoring.\n  I spend a great deal of time trying to call the administration's \nattention to very serious issues in sub-Saharan Africa that are \ndeserving of more American time and interest. I do not have to do that \nwhen it comes to Sudan. Bringing peace to Sudan appears to me to be \nthis administration's most significant policy initiative in the region, \nand I commend the administration for its efforts. That said, this \nelement of the effort, following up on the commitments obtained by \nSenator Danforth relating to the bombing of civilian targets, this \nelement of the effort is quite plainly falling short.\n  If the administration needs additional resources, personnel, or \nlogistical capacity to make this happen efficiently and effectively, I \nknow that many in Congress stand ready to help. Many of my colleagues \nhave long history of working to address the crisis in Sudan, notably my \npartner in on the African Affairs Subcommittee, Senator Frist, and I \nadmire their commitment and their work. In calling attention to this \nissue, and in criticizing the administration for its failure to move \nforward on the civilian bombing monitoring issue, I do not seek to \ninject partisanship into the Sudan policy debate. But I do want to make \nit clear that this is not a small thing and not a secondary priority. \nThe administration's capacity to help bring peace to Sudan is strongest \nwhen the diverse community of Sudan advocates and the entire Congress \nis united in support for that effort. We need to sustain our faith in \nthis endeavor with concrete steps even as our country continues to \nfacilitate big-picture negotiations. And so I encourage the \nadministration to make deploying a qualified and well-organized \nmonitoring team at the earliest possible date a real priority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/13/senate-section/article/S8616-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               IN RECOGNITION OF BISHOP WILLIAM T.

During this time, he has \nchampioned issues which empower the family, church and community, and \nis the founder of the Community Development Corporation, known as the \nNew Garden State Caring Families and Neighborhoods, Inc. In 1997, he \nwas recognized as one of the 100 Most Influential Persons in the State \nof New Jersey and was given the Man of Distinction Award of his \nJurisdictional efforts in 1998.\n  Bishop Cahoon has always believed that ``We must minister to the \nrealities of our unique communities through whatever social, economic, \npolitical and spiritual means necessary.'' It is this openness to new \nideas of ministering to the people of New Jersey that inspired the \nrecent Holy Convocation, the goal of which was to the paradigm shift to \nministering in the 21st century.\n  It was an honor to see Bishop Cahoon at work during the recent Holy \nConvocation and I wish him the best in his mission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/13/senate-section/article/S8616-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE JEWISH NATIONAL FUND\n\n Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the Jewish \nNational Fund as the group celebrates its 100th anniversary on October \n6, 2002. Without the efforts of the Jewish National Fund, the nation of \nIsrael might very well not exist. Today, through the efforts of the \nJNF, Israel not only exists as a Jewish State, but flourishes despite \nnumerous geographic and political changes.\n  The Jewish National Fund was established at the Fifth Zionist \nCongress in 1901 with the express purpose of allowing Jews from around \nthe world to join together and make the Zionist dream a reality. Jewish \ncommunities from around the world participated by collecting donations \nin signature ``Blue Boxes.'' These donations were used to purchase the \nland that would one day become the state of Israel. Jews disunited \ncould not achieve their nationalist dream and create a Jewish state in \nthe land of Israel, but together, through the work of the Jewish \nNational Fund, they began to build a nation. JNF purchased the land, \ndeveloped and built the infrastructure, and planted the forests that \nmade the country green. I am confident that through the dedication and \nhard work of the Jewish National Fund, Israel will continue to thrive \nfor the next 100 years and beyond.\n  Since 1901, the Jewish National Fund has planted over 220 million \ntrees, built over 120 dams and reservoirs, developed over 250,000 acres \nof land, created more than 400 parks throughout Israel and educated \nstudents around the world about Israel and the environment. The Jewish \nNational Fund is also active in funding arid land research and has \npartnered with the USDA Forest Service and the Arizona-based \nInternational Arid Lands Consortium.\n  This past year marked a great milestone for the Jewish National Fund. \nThe group celebrated a great century and witnessed the birth of their \ndream: a thriving Jewish homeland. I wish the Jewish National Fund the \nbest of luck as they embark on their second century of service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/13/senate-section/article/S8616-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8616-S8617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO ALBERT GREENE CLAY\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the \nlate Albert Greene Clay, a man whose contributions were instrumental to \nthe tobacco and horse industries, and whose presence was well-known at \nthe University of Kentucky.\n  A native of Mount Sterling, KY, Albert received a bachelor's degree \nfrom Duke University in 1938, and attended Harvard Business School in \n1939. On October 26, 1939, Albert married his college sweetheart, \nLorraine Case Newlin. I would like to take this opportunity to express \nmy sincerest condolences to his family, especially his wife Lorraine, \nhis sons Robert and John, his daughter Charlotte Clay Buxton, and seven \ngrandchildren.\n  Albert left behind a legacy as an individual whose contributions to \nthe tobacco industry are far-reaching and long-lasting. He played a key \nrole in the establishment of the Burley Auction Warehouse Association \nin the 1940s, and continued his involvement by serving as chairman and \npresident of the organization's board for 25 years.\n  Albert's leadership extended to the national level, where he served \nas director of the National Tobacco Tax Council, Burley and Dark Leaf \nTobacco\n\n[[Page S8617]]\n\nExport Association and Tobacco Growers Information Committee. In 1977, \nhe was appointed by the Carter administration to serve on the \nAgriculture Policy Advisory Committee for Trade Negotiations.\n  Not only did Albert's accomplishments encompass the tobacco industry, \nbut they also extended into another important facet of his native \nState--the horse industry. Albert helped found the American Horse \nCouncil in 1969, and continued to serve as secretary of the \norganization for many years. His passion for horses benefited students \nat the University of Kentucky, where Albert played a vital role in the \ncreation of the institution's Equine Research Foundation. He served as \nchairman there from 1988 to 1998 and was also instrumental in the \nformation of UK's Maxwell Gluck Equine Research Center. Albert \nmaintained his involvement in the university, serving on the UK board \nof trustees, and as chairman of the board for several years.\n  I would like to express my appreciation for Albert Greene Clay's \noutstanding contributions to both the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and the \nentire United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/13/senate-section/article/S8617-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak \nabout hate crimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in \nMarch of last year. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred July 20, \n2001, in Cullman, AL. Two black men were attacked inside their car \nafter arriving at a party. The assailants, three white men, smashed the \ncar with baseball bats and cut a racial slur into the side of the car. \nAuthorities investigated the incident as a possible hate crime.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/13/senate-section/article/S8617-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           100TH ANNIVERSARY OF BIG BASIN REDWOODS STATE PARK\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate \nthe Big Basin Redwoods State Park of Santa Cruz County in California on \ntheir 100th anniversary.\n  Established in 1902, Big Basin Redwoods State Park is California's \noldest State park. Big Basin Redwoods is the birthplace of the original \ncoastal redwood conservation movement. Today the results of the \nconservation movement can be seen in the 18,000-plus acres of \nCalifornia redwood forest.\n  The park has the largest continuous stand of Ancient Coast Redwoods \nsouth of San Francisco. Additionally, Big Basin Redwoods State Park is \nconsidered by many to be the birthplace of both the park and \nenvironmental movement in California.\n  At the turn of the 20th century, the remaining redwood forests were \ndisappearing at rate that threatened massive destruction of the ancient \ntrees. The only redwood forests left in America ranged from Oregon to \nBig Sur. Concerned citizens and organizations such as the Sempervirens \nClub, persuaded then-Governor Henry T. Gage to sign legislation that \nwould set aside land for a redwood park.\n  Today, the ensuing generations of those environmentally concerned \ncitizens are celebrating the 100th anniversary of the preservation of \nthe California redwood lands. The perseverance and dedication to \nprotecting primeval forest places that the founders of the Big Basin \nRedwoods State Park exemplified are recognized and celebrated today. \nWithout such dedication to the environmental movement hundreds of \nforests across the country would have been destroyed.\n  The Big Basin Redwoods State Park contains both cultural and \nhistorical sites of national importance, wildlife habitats, natural \necological preserves, and recreational opportunities for the public. \nThe Big Basin Redwoods State Park is a unique and uncommon place of \nhistorical and primeval environmental importance. Therefore, special \nrecognition is deserved on September 13, 2002, the 100th anniversary of \nits founding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/13/senate-section/article/S8617-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nHONORING WALTER J. SCHRAMM THE OUTSTANDING OLDER WORKER OF SOUTH DAKOTA \n                                FOR 2001\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I wish to publicly commend Walter \nSchramm, a resident of Winner, SD, on his selection as last year's \nOutstanding Older Worker of South Dakota.\n  The Outstanding Older Worker award is sponsored by Experience Works a \nnational, nonprofit organization that provides training and employment \nservices for mature workers. Walter will be honored in Washington, \nD.C., September 17-21, at the annual Experience Works Prime Time Awards \nProgram. He will join 51 other outstanding older workers representing \neach State, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Due to the \ntragic incidents of September 11, 2001, and the subsequent cancellation \nof the Experience Works Prime Time Awards Program, Walter will be \nrecognized at this year's event.\n  After serving in the Pacific theater in World War II as a Marine Air \nCorps pilot, Walter returned to the United States to complete his \nmilitary service and start a career. With little money, and no retail \nexperience, he opened the Schramm Furniture store in Winner. His lack \nof business knowledge and experience was overcome by his tremendous \nwork ethic and strong sense of community. Walter's hard work and \ndedication over the years have helped him succeed and grow as a small \nbusiness owner, and today, his two sons, Jeff and Tom, share the \nbusiness with their father.\n  For the past 56 years Walter has been the owner/president of Schramm \nFurniture, Inc. At age 85, he continues to work six days a week, nine \nhours a day. Walter opened his business with the motto: ``Provide good \nservice to the customer and they will come back.'' Though times have \nchanged, Walter's motto has remained the same, and today, just as 56 \nyears ago, customers continue to return to Schramm Furniture for its \nreliable customer service.\n  Walter's tremendous contributions to the community, and civic/\nbusiness leadership have set him apart from other outstanding senior \nworkers. He is a member of the Chamber of Commerce and Rotary \nInternational, Trinity Lutheran Church, the SD Retailers Association, \nthe Winner Athletic Association, and a lifetime member of the American \nLegion and VFW.\n  This prestigious honor is a reflection of his extraordinary service \nand commitment to the Winner community. Through his outstanding \ncommunity involvement and dedication to service, the lives of countless \nSouth Dakotans have been enormously enhanced. His wonderful example \nserves as a model for other hard working and dedicated individuals \nthroughout South Dakota to emulate.\n  Walter Schramm is an extraordinary person who richly deserves this \ndistinguished recognition. I strongly commend his years of hard work \nand dedication, and I am very pleased that his substantial efforts are \nbeing publicly honored and celebrated. It is with great honor that I \nshare his impressive accomplishments with my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/13/senate-section/article/S8617-4", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8617-S8618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nHONORING RUSSELL WYATT THE OUTSTANDING OLDER WORKER OF SOUTH DAKOTA FOR \n                                  2002\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

Russell will be honored in \nWashington, D.C., September 17-21, at the annual Experience Works Prime \nTime Awards Program. He will join 51 other outstanding older workers \nrepresenting each State, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.\n  At age 76, Russell Wyatt continues to own and operate Wyatt's Real \nEstate and Appraisal Service in Hot Springs. Russell's hard work and \ndedication over the years has helped him succeed and grow as a small \nbusiness owner.\n\n[[Page S8618]]\n\nHis entrepreneurial spirit has led to many tremendous accomplishments, \nand helped him adapt to a rapidly changing workplace.\n  However, it is Russell's tremendous contributions to the community, \ncivic leadership, and volunteer work that set him apart from other \noutstanding senior workers. He helped organize the Oral Volunteer Fire \nDepartment and Southern Hill's Real Estate Board, promote the Miss \nSouth Dakota Pagaent, and bring a Pamida Store and Civic Center to Hot \nSprings. Hot Springs residents have come to count on his hard work and \ndependability.\n  This prestigious honor is a reflection of his extraordinary service \nand commitment to the Hot Springs community.

Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Ira \nYellin, who passed away on September 10. He was only 62 years old.\n  My heart goes out to his wife, Adele, to his daughter Jessica and his \nson Seth, to his mother Dorothy and his two brothers, Marc and Albert.\n  Ira was a true visionary, a man who championed the restoration of \ndowntown Los Angeles long before it was popular.\n  His own restoration of the Grand Central Market, an enduring emblem \nof the ethnic diversity that is Los Angeles, is perhaps the greatest of \nhis many accomplishments as a real estate developer.\n  Yet Ira was involved in so much more than real estate. He was a civic \nand community leader, and served as a past president of the American \nJewish Committee and a member of the board of the Skirball Cultural \nCenter and the J. Paul Getty Trust.\n  The son of a Talmudic scholar, an ex-Marine, an urban pioneer, a \npolitical and social activist, Ira was an optimistic man of boundless \nenergy. Not even the lung cancer that he battled so bravely over the \nlast year could slow him down.\n  Up until the very end of his life he maintained his commitment to his \nwork, to his community and, above all, to his loving family, in a way \nwhich has earned my highest admiration and my deepest affection.\n  Ira Yellin was a wonderful man who will be sorely missed, yet both \nhis notable achievements and his engaging personality have made a \nlasting impact on all of us. He will not be soon forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/13/senate-section/article/S8618-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communication was laid before the Senate, together with \naccompanying papers, reports, and documents, which was referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-9007.

A bill to amend title 36, United States Code, to clarify the \nrequirements for eligibility in the American Legion; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the American \nLegion Amendment Act to make technical changes to the membership \nqualifications in the Federal charter of the American Legion.\n  Under the American Legion's current charter, a veteran who leaves the \nArmed Services may become a member of the American Legion if he or she \nserved since ``August 2, 1990 through the date of cessation of \nhostilities, as decided by the United States Government'' and ``was \nhonorably discharged or separated from that service or continues to \nserve honorably after that period.'' At this point, the United States \nGovernment has not issued a cessation of hostilities decision for U.S. \nmilitary operations during this period. For those military men and \nwomen who are no longer serving, they have discharge papers stating \nthey served honorably during that period which makes them qualified for \nAmerican Legion membership. Yet, servicemembers who served since August \n2, 1990, and are still on active duty, have no discharge papers for the \nperiod, and are not officially serving after the cessation of \nhostilities. Therefore, they are not eligible for membership in the \nAmerican Legion despite their dedicated service in our nation's Armed \nForces.\n  The bill that I am introducing today would change the standard for a \nveteran to qualify for membership in the American Legion to ``continues \nto serve during or after that period.'' This change would make it clear \nthat membership is open to the thousands of active duty personnel who \nserved during operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, in addition to \nthe operations that followed in Iraq, Bosnia, Kosovo, and Afghanistan.\n  As my colleagues in the Senate know, the American Legion continues to \nbe one of our Nation's most effective advocates on behalf of America's \nveterans, as well as a pre-eminent service organization. The American \nLegion has grown to nearly 3 million members whose efforts are truly \nmaking a difference in communities throughout our country. As the \nfather of a son who served in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Afghanistan, I am \npleased to offer the American Legion Amendment Act that will offer him \nand his military colleagues the opportunity and the honor to join the \nAmerican Legion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S8620]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2934\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CLARIFICATION OF REQUIREMENTS FOR ELIGIBILITY IN \n                   THE AMERICAN LEGION.\n\n       Section 21703(2) of title 36, United States Code, is \n     amended by inserting ``during or'' after ``continues to serve \n     honorably''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 2935. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \ngrants for the operation of mosquito control programs to prevent and \ncontrol mosquito-borne diseases; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as you know, the State of Louisiana, \nalong with many other States, has for the past several months been \nunder siege. The enemy is small, but powerful, and great in number. \nHard to detect, they sneak up on you and with one attack, they can \nchange your life forever. To date, 10 Louisianans have lost their lives \nin our war against mosquitos and the West Nile virus that they carry \nand 222 more have been injured. In Baton Rouge, our State capital, 42 \npeople have been reported to have been infected with the disease and \nthree have died. Only Illinois, with 292 human cases and 11 deaths, has \nexperienced more casualties from the virus than Louisiana.\n  I am here this morning to introduce legislation that asks for Federal \nassistance for States to ``M.A.S.H.'' out this predator and stop the \nspread of this disease. Throughout the history of Louisiana, spraying \nfor mosquitos and dredging the water they breed in has been a common \noccurrence. Until now, however, it was done because mosquitos were \npests and they could carry deadly germs. Now, our State and local \nofficials are spraying around the clock in a desperate race to control \nthe worst outbreak of West Nile the Western hemisphere has ever seen. \nThere is no specific treatment for West Nile, nor a vaccine. The most \neffective way to protect our citizens against this deadly virus is to \nstop it before it happens.\n  I think that is clear that there is an urgent need for this bill to \nbecome law. If passed, it can have an immediate effect in saving on the \nlives of people in my State and throughout the nation. I want to be \nclear, however, that this is not an effort to supplant state's \nresponsibility in this area, but to supplement it. Our State has and \nwill continue to dedicate a great deal of State and local resources \ntoward ``Fighting the Bite.'' On September 5, 2002, the State of \nLouisiana began distributing $3.4 million in state funds to support the \nlocal governments in their efforts to combat West Nile. The Department \nof Health and Hospitals is spending over $200,000 on a public education \ncampaign asking people to do their share to avoid leaving standing \nwater and other mosquito havens. Two-thirds of Louisiana's population \nis covered by an active mosquito control program and those without \nmosquito control programs are using spray trucks provided by the \nLouisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry.\n  One might think that given the national public health threat imposed \nby the spread of West Nile that there would already be Federal funding \nof this type available. Natural disasters such as this require the \nFederal, State and local governments to work together in a coordinated \nfashion to bring immediate relief to affected citizens, to educate the \npublic, and to prevent the disease from inflicting further harm. Our \nNation's first experience with the West Nile Virus taught us that \neffective treatment and prevention of this deadly disease also requires \ncoordination among the many Federal agencies with expertise and \njurisdiction. The formation of a West Nile Virus Coordinating \nCommittee, chaired by CDC and composed of representatives from USDA, \nthe United States Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center, \nthe Environmental Protection Agency, and the Defense Department was the \nfirst step in this direction.\n  Louisiana's experience, thus far, has proven the necessity of this \ncoordinated approach. However, Federal leadership must continue to be \nstrengthened, and coordination must continue to be improved between \nFederal agencies involved in West Nile. One of the shortfalls, and \nperhaps the easiest to address, is the lack of an effective funding \nsource for mosquito control. In August of this year, the CDC endowed \nthe state of Louisiana with $3.4 million to use in the fight against \nWest Nile. The CDC money, though, cannot be spent on chemicals or \nspraying, rather it must be spent on surveillance, education and \ntesting. It is for this reason that our Governor, and the Governor of \nMississippi appealed to FEMA for their help in increasing much needed \nabatement activities. This request was denied.\n  West Nile is one of many vector borne diseases spread from birds to \nhumans by mosquitos. If our Nation's public health system is to respond \naccordingly, then they must have the aid of effective mosquito \nabatement programs. This bill puts that system in place. I am pleased \nto by joined by my senior Senator from Louisiana, as well as Senators \nGregg and Hutchison. I am hopeful that before long this bill will be \nsupported by the majority of the Senate. I ask the majority leader for \nhis help in seeing to it that this bill is passed as soon as possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2935\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, the West Nile virus has reached epidemic \nproportions. My home State of Louisiana has seen cases of the disease \nskyrocket in recent months, with 222 cases and 9 deaths reported to \ndate. But this is not a problem isolated in one State or one region. \nThe Centers for Disease Control, CDC, have reported cases of this \nmosquito-borne illness in humans in 30 States and the District of \nColumbia. It is clear, as we have seen in Louisiana, that State \ngovernments are overtaxed in money and man-power and simply cannot \ncontinue to fight the spread of this disease on their own. The Federal \nGovernment needs to work hard and fast to combat this potential public \nhealth crisis and assist the hardest hit areas in preventing the loss \nof even more lives.\n  Earlier this year, my colleagues in the House of Representatives, \nCongressmen Billy Tauzin and Chris John, introduced legislation that \nwould make grants available through the CDC to help States in \nestablishing and maintaining mosquito control programs and prevent \nmosquito-borne illnesses. Today Senator Landrieu and I have introduced \ncompanion legislation to the House bill, The Mosquito Abatement for \nHealth and Safety Act, H.R. 4793, of the same title in an effort to \nquickly make resources available to local governments in Louisiana and \nacross the country that have been on the front lines fighting the \nspread of the West Nile outbreak.\n  Both bills would provide money to improve assessment tools, including \nsurveys of potential mosquito breeding areas, and support research \ninitiatives to develop methods of controlling insect populations that \nspread disease and pose a health threat to humans. In disbursing grant \nmonies, the CDC would give priority to those areas with reported \ninstances of mosquito-borne illnesses in humans or animals.\n  The country is experiencing an outbreak that is both unfortunate and \nalarming. Only through improved coordination of state and federal \nagencies can we begin to address this problem and spare further cases \nof this deadly disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/13/senate-section/article/S8621-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8621-S8622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             SENATE RESOLUTION 327--HONORING ERNIE HARWELL\n\n  Ms. STABENOW (for herself and Mr. Levin) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of S. Res. 327, submitted earlier today by Senators \nStabenow and Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 327) honoring Ernie Harwell.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased and honored to join my \ncolleague from Michigan, Senator Stabenow, in offering a resolution \ncommemorating the achievements and retirement of Ernie Harwell. Ernie, \na Hall of Fame broadcaster, will conclude his remarkable 55-year career \nupon calling his last game for the Detroit Tigers this season. For most \nof the last 42 years, Ernie has served as the voice of the Tigers, and \nI know that Detroit fans, as well as baseball fans everywhere, will \nmiss Ernie's distinctive voice and irreplaceable baseball wit. In a \ncity rich with baseball tradition, Ernie is as much of a part of Tiger \nbaseball as the Olde English D and Tiger Stadium.\n  For four decades, Ernie Harwell's unwaveringly calm voice has \nprovided Tigers fans with an incomparable mixture of play-by-play \ndescription, baseball history, and sensible statistics. Much of Ernie's \nappeal grew out of the fact that he almost never lets emotion overtake \nhim. He lets his words, his description of the game, paint a vivid \npicture of the events for the listeners at home.\n  Ernie Harwell was born on January 25, 1918, in Washington, GA. As a \nboy, he delivered newspapers on a route that included the famed author \nMargaret Mitchell's home. Before launching his sports career, Ernie \nserved as a Marine in World War II. He also acted in several movies \nincluding ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'' He began his baseball \ncareer as a sportswriter and copy editor for the Atlanta Constitution. \nLuckily for us, he did not stay in that position long; in 1943 he left \nto become an announcer for the Southern Association's Atlanta Crackers.\n  Ernie's skills were quickly recognized in Atlanta, and in 1948 he \nbecame the only announcer ever traded for a player! Branch Rickey, the \nGeneral Manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, traded catcher Cliff Dapper to \nthe Crackers to allow Ernie to break his contract. His tenure in \nBrooklyn was highlighted by calling Jackie Robinson's best season, \n1949, when Robinson was awarded the Most Valuable Player award for the \nNational League while leading the Dodgers to the pennant.\n  The next year, Ernie left Brooklyn to go across town and call New \nYork Giants games on the burgeoning medium of television. While there, \nhe called Willie Mays's debut game in 1951 and Bobby Thomson's ``Shot \nHeard 'Round the World'' at the end of that season when the Giants won \nthe pennant. Unlike Russ Hodges' who shouted ``The Giants win the \npennant!'', Ernie stuck to his style and simply said ``it's gone'' when \nthe ball shot off Thomson's bat. That was all baseball fans needed.\n  After a short stint as the first broadcaster of the Baltimore \nOrioles, he was hired as the voice of the Detroit Tigers, where he has \nstayed for 42 of the last 43 years. Ernie quickly became a part of the \nTigers family. ``If you do this job for a while in one city and you're \npretty good, you become part of the family,'' he once said. ``They take \nyou to the beaches and the mountains and the cottages, the workplace \nand the kitchen. That's gratifying, but it's sort of humbling, too, \nthat people are that interested and they listen.''\n  Ernie called the 1968 and 1984 World Series that crowned the Tigers \nworld champions. He was in Detroit for the\n\n[[Page S8623]]\n\ncareers of many baseball's greats, including the soon-to-retire Travis \nFryman, now with the Cleveland Indians. Fryman, one of Ernie's favorite \nplayers in Detroit, presented him with an Indians hat and jersey during \nthe Tigers' last trip to Cleveland. During that series, Indians \nofficials named the visiting radio booth in the Jacobs Field press box \nthe ``Ernie Harwell Visiting Radio Booth.''\n  The true devotion of Tigers fans to Ernie Harwell was made loud and \nclear when the Tigers' then-new management informed Ernie that 1991 \nwould be his last season as the Tigers' broadcaster. They said they \nwanted to go with a younger and newer voice. Following a public outcry, \nthe Motor City brought home its familiar voice in time for the 1993 \nseason. He has been with Detroit ever since.\n  Ernie's achievements have been recognized on both the local and \nnational stage. He has been voted Michigan Sportscaster of the Year 17 \ntimes and is a member of the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame. In 1981 he \nwas just the fifth broadcaster to be elected to Baseball's Hall of \nFame. In 1988 he became a member of the Radio Hall of Fame and the \nfollowing year he was elected to the National Sportscasters Hall of \nFame.\n  Ernie's talents extend beyond the microphone. He is an accomplished \nauthor and songwriter. He has authored such books as Tuned to Baseball, \nDiamond Gems and The Babe Signed My Shoe, and coauthored or contributed \nto several other books about the game of baseball. In addition to his \nliterary works, Ernie has also had more than 50 of his songs \nprofessionally recorded.\n  Considering that he has announced games over an unprecedented seven \ndecades, Ernie will always be remembered best as a broadcaster; \nhowever, his personality and earnestness have endeared him to \ngenerations of listeners as a friend. To say that Ernie Harwell is \nbeloved by the citizens of Michigan would be an understatement, which \nis why it comes with great regret that we are marking his retirement.\n  Ernie Harwell once said that a successful play-by-play man ``should \nhave the enthusiasm of a fan, the background knowledge of a writer, the \nreflexes of a ballplayer, and the impartiality of an umpire.'' I think \nhe has exemplified these qualities, and he brought so much more to the \ngame. Ernie Harwell is a Detroit hero and a baseball legend. While some \nof the Tigers' recent years have been forgettable, Ernie Harwell will \nnever be.\n  As much as we will miss Ernie, we wish him well as he begins his life \naway from the microphone. I join the citizens of Michigan in thanking \nErnie Harwell for his decades of outstanding service to the Detroit \nTigers and the broadcasting community. I know my colleagues in the \nSenate will join me in supporting this resolution in his honor.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to submit a resolution, along \nwith Senator Levin, to honor Ernie Harwell, the voice of the Detroit \nTigers. As Tiger fans across the country know, Ernie Harwell is \nretiring this year after broadcasting major league baseball for 55 \nyears, the last 42 of which were in Detroit.\n  Ernie Harwell has broadcast some of the great moments in baseball, \nincluding the debut of Willie Mays, Bobby Thompson's ``shot heard round \nthe world'' and Hoyt Wilhelm's famous no hitter against the Yankees in \n1958.\n  In addition, he also called the Tigers' last two World Series \nvictories in 1968 and 1984. He also brought to life the performances of \nsome of baseball's greats, like Sparky Anderson, Kirk Gibson, Al \nKaline, Denny McLain, Alan Trammel and many others.\n  Tigers fans have such fond memories of Ernie Harwell, it is hard to \nbelieve that he will not be in the broadcast booth next year. Since \nSunday, September 15 is Ernie Harwell Day at Comerica Park in Detroit, \nSenator Levin and I wanted to take up and pass this resolution \ncongratulating Ernie on his great career and wishing him the best of \nluck in retirement.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this resolution.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nand the preamble be agreed to en bloc, that the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating thereto be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following finding:\n       (1)(A) According to the International Committee of the Red \n     Cross, there are tens of millions of landmines in over 60 \n     countries around the world, and it has estimated that as many \n     as 24,000 people are maimed or killed each year by landmines, \n     mostly civilians, resulting in amputations and disabilities \n     of various kinds.\n       (B) While the United States Government invests more than \n     $100,000,000 in mine action programs annually, including \n     funding for mine awareness and demining training programs, \n     only about ten percent of these funds go to directly aid \n     landmine victims.\n       (C) The Patrick Leahy War Victims Fund, administered by the \n     United States Agency for International Development, has \n     provided essential prosthetics and rehabilitation for \n     landmine and other war victims in developing countries who \n     are disabled and has provided long-term sustainable \n     improvements in quality of life for victims of civil strife \n     and warfare, addressing such issues as barrier-free \n     accessibility, reduction of social stigmatization, and \n     increasing economic opportunities.\n       (D) Enhanced coordination is needed among Federal agencies \n     that carry out assistance programs in foreign countries for \n     victims of landmines and other victims of civil strife and \n     warfare to make better use of interagency expertise and \n     resources.\n       (2) According to a review of Poverty and Disability \n     commissioned by the World Bank, ``disabled people have lower \n     education and income levels than the rest of the population. \n     They are more likely to have incomes below poverty level than \n     the non-disabled population, and they are less likely to have \n     savings and other assets . . .

What a great day for free peoples, for people who have the \nliberty and freedom to speak. It devised a system of government, a \ngovernment of the people, by the people, and for the people--a \ngovernment of separation of powers and checks and balances.\n  I thank those Framers for what they did on July 16, 1787, when they \ndecided under a great compromise which provided for a Senate--a Senate \nwhere Members would represent the States with two Senators from each \nState so that a small State, or a large State, or medium-size State \nwould have an equal voice in this Senate. Let us remember that as we go \nalong.\n  Again, I say that day on September 17, 1787, there were 39 signers \nwho put their names on this Constitution, including John Milton Niles, \na Senator from Connecticut. And his relative sits in the chair today, \nSenator Dayton from Minnesota.\n  Let me begin again so that the Record will show it as read in its \ncompleteness and without interruption.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business \ntoday, it stand in adjournment until 9:30 a.m., Tuesday, September 17; \nthat following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed \nexpired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for \nthe two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the \nSenate be in a period of morning business until 10:30 a.m., with \nSenators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each, with the first \nhalf of the time under the control of the majority leader, or his \ndesignee, and the second half of the time under the control of the \nRepublican leader, or his designee; that at 10:30 a.m. the Senator \nresume consideration of H.R. 5093, the Interior Appropriations Act; \nthat the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. for the weekly \nconferences; that at 2:15 p.m. the Senate resume consideration of H.R. \n5005, homeland security; that at 4:15 p.m. the Senate resume \nconsideration of the Interior Appropriations Act with 60 minutes of \ndebate, equally divided between the chairman and the ranking member of \nthe subcommittee, or their designees, prior to the vote on cloture on \nthe Byrd amendment; further, that the live quorum with respect to the \ncloture motion filed today be waived; and that the cloture vote occur \nat 5:15 p.m., Tuesday, September 17, without further intervening action \nor debate.\n  Before the Chair puts the question, let me consider what I just said.\n  Mr. President, I add this request, which is my own request: That when \nthe Senate resumes consideration of H.R. 5005, the homeland security \nbill, I be recognized at that point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
