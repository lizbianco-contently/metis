We praise you for the freedom of religion in America \nguaranteed by the Bill of Rights and the Constitution. There is no \nseparation between God and State. With gratitude we declare our motto \n``In God we trust.'' Though that trust may be expressed in different \nreligions, we do proclaim You as ultimate Sovereign of our Nation. Our \nFounders declared their trust in You and in each stage of our \ndevelopment You have guided us through peril and prosperity, peace and \nwar. Thank You for Your faithfulness to respond to our confession of \ntrust in You.\n  It is with reverence that in a moment we will repeat the words of \ncommitment to trust You which are part of our Pledge of Allegiance to \nour flag: ``One Nation under God, indivisible.''\n  Help us to savor these words this morning. May we never lose a \nprofound sense of awe and wonder over the privilege You have given us \nto live in this religiously free land. Renew our sense of \naccountability to You, and never take for granted the freedom we enjoy \nor the accountability we have to You. As we declare our convictions in \nthe Pledge, we affirm that patriotism is an essential expression of our \ntrust in You.\n  Specifically for today and its pressing agenda and challenges we \naffirm we are one Senate united under You to lead a nation that is free \nto say confidently, ``In God We Trust.''\n  God our Sovereign, we continue the work of this busy week with the \nwords and music of the Fourth of July celebration sounding in our \nsouls. We pray together today, remembering the first prayer of \ndependence prayed for the delegates to the Continental Congress in 1774 \nthat eventually led to the Declaration of Independence in 1776.\n  Now before the fireworks begin, work in us the fire of that same \ndependence on You that has been the secret of truly great leaders \nthroughout our history. We pray for the women and men of this Senate. \nEnlarge their hearts until they are big enough to contain the gift of \nYour Spirit; expand their minds until they are capable of thinking Your \nthoughts; deepen their mutual trust so that they can work harmoniously \nfor what is best for this Nation. You know all the legislation to be \ndebated and voted on before recess. Grant the Senators an unprecedented \ndependence on You, an unreserved desire to seek Your will, and an \nunlimited supply of Your supernatural strength.\n  With renewed dependence on You and renewed interdependence on one \nanother as fellow patriots, help us to be willing, in the spirit of our \nFounders, to stake our reliance on You and pledge our lives, fortunes, \nand sacred honor for the next stage of Your strategy for America: God \nbless America!

Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Minnesota how \nlong he is intending to speak?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from Texas, probably about 3 \nminutes. I want to talk about disaster assistance in Minnesota.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Minnesota be allowed to speak for approximately 3 to 4 \nminutes, after which I ask unanimous consent to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          FLOODS IN MINNESOTA\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, as any number of my colleagues may have \nnoted, if they have been watching CNN, northwest Minnesota in the last \n3 weeks has been deluged by heavy rainfall causing disasters in 13 \nnorthwestern Minnesota counties. We have had massive flooding.\n  Earlier this week, the President rightly declared these counties \ndisaster areas, which will bring much needed FEMA assistance to \nindividuals and businesses. More help is needed, and the Minnesota Farm \nService Agency has estimated that we have 2 million acres in northwest \nMinnesota that are affected by the flooding, and the losses are \nexpected to be about 70 percent. Most of the producers have carried \ncrop insurance, but the crop insurance cannot come close to \ncompensating for these losses. What I am worried about is FEMA can help \nus with public infrastructure and SBA can help some of our small \nbusinesses, but we need disaster relief for our farmers. Without \ndisaster relief, there is no future for them at all.\n  The President and the administration are saying that there will not \nbe any more disaster relief money and that whatever assistance goes to \nthese farmers has to come from the farm bill. In other words, money has \nto be taken from other farmers, taken from corn growers, wheat growers, \nsoybean growers. The President and the administration are saying that \nour farmers cannot expect any relief until the year 2008, no matter \nwhat. That is not going to work for northwestern Minnesota.\n  The farm bill which we passed is not a disaster assistance bill. It \nis a bill to stabilize farm income. It is a bill about the rural \neconomies, but it is not about disaster relief. Disaster relief is all \nabout ``there but the grace of God go I''--fire in Arizona, drought in \nSouth Dakota, flooding in northwest Minnesota.\n  When the Congress decides to help areas affected by hurricanes and \nfires, we do not tell people to pull their emergency assistance out of \nsomebody else's highway fund.\n  Sometimes the Federal Government needs to be there for people, and \nthis is one of those cases. I will be visiting northwest Minnesota \nagain this week on Saturday afternoon. It is very important that the \nadministration provide this much needed assistance. I do not think as a \nSenator, in the almost 12 years I have been in the Senate, I have ever \nvoted against disaster relief for any part of the country, because, \nagain, I think this goes to the essence of who we are as a community. \nNobody asked for the flooding. Nobody asked for 2 million acres of \nfarmland, 70 percent of it, to be destroyed. Nobody asks for hurricanes \nor tornados. Nobody asked for the drought. It is ``there but for the \ngrace of God go I.'' We come together as a community and we provide the \nhelp for people. That is what disaster relief is about.\n\n  I come to the floor to call on the administration to change their \nmind and to make a commitment to providing this assistance. We had it \nin the farm bill in the Senate. It was taken out in conference \ncommittee for 2001. Now we are talking about even more damage for 2002.\n  There is no more important issue for the State of Minnesota than to \nget the help for these farmers. Otherwise, they will not be there. It \nwill be all over. I appeal to the White House: Please change your mind \non this matter. We need the help in Minnesota. There will be other \nStates that will need the assistance, as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/27/senate-section/article/S6178-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of an \namendment that 16 of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have \ncosponsored. The amendment is very straightforward. It is to improve \nthe minimum criteria for the 2005 BRAC Commission, that the military \nand the department must follow when evaluating the Nation's military \ninfrastructure. The amendment would also make the process more \ntransparent.\n  I want to be clear that by offering this amendment, I do not intend \nto revisit the debate we had last year. While this Chamber remains \nsharply divided over the merits of another round of base closures, we \ncan certainly agree a round of closures riddled with mistakes could be \nmore costly than no closures at all.\n  In fiscal year 2002, the National Defense Authorization Act unleashed \na powerful bureaucratic process when it authorized another round of \nclosures in 2005. The Pentagon has often said that there are 20 to 25 \npercent excess military structures and that nine members of the \ncommission may well recommend the closure of as many as 100 military \ninstallations in this Nation.\n  Those are not decisions to be taken lightly. We have seen from the \nVieques fiasco that once a national asset like a training range is \nclosed, it cannot be replaced.\n  We have also seen past commissions commit costly blunders. In 1995, \nthe commission recommended the closure of Reese Air Force Base in \nLubbock, TX. The Air Force said it had surplus undergraduate training \ncapacity. Only a few years later, the Air Force reported it was nearly \n2,000 pilots short of its authorized end strength. At great expense to \nthe taxpayer, the Air Force responded by standing up Moody Air Force \nBase.\n  In 1995, Fort Buchanan, Puerto Rico was realigned, and all of its \nhousing was conveyed to the community. Two years later, U.S. Army South \nwas relocated there from Panama. The Secretary was forced to come back \nto Congress to seek permission to rescind the housing conveyance.\n  In 1995, Fort Greeley, AK, was realigned, its tenants relocated, and \nthe housing area was relinquished. Five years later, the decision was \nmade to utilize Greeley as the critical test bed for our emerging \nnational missile defense system.\n  As we can see, even in peacetime, correctly forecasting requirements, \neven just a few years into the future, is nearly impossible.\n  The authorization bill already directs the commissioners to consider \na handful of very broad criteria when evaluating our military \ninfrastructure. But in an era where the meaning of commonly understood \nwords is a matter of debate, specificity is everything.\n\n  The amendment goes one step further. The Commissioners are authorized \nto consider additional criteria, many not included in last year's \nauthorization bill. One of these is force protection. The threat posed \nby terrorists to our forces has been demonstrated too vividly to leave \nthis out. Look at Khobar Towers, look at the USS Cole. We must have \nforce protection wherever our troops are in the field, and it should be \nan additional criterion for any enduring installation.\n  Lessons learned from previous rounds of closures include the \ndisparities between anticipated and actual savings is another suggested \ncriterion--who could oppose this commonsense suggestion?\n  Of course, there are bases overseas as well as those in America that \nare affected by the base-closing commission, so the criteria in this \namendment are in no way exhaustive or restrictive. The Commission may \nconsider any other criteria it considers appropriate. But it is an \nattempt to enumerate a minimum number of criteria that would have to be \naddressed by the Commission when they are making their very important \ndecisions potentially closing as many as 100 military installations.\n  In addition to sharpening focus, this amendment would also increase \ntransparency. It requires the formula to be used in assigning weight to \nthe various criteria to be published in the Federal Register. By \npermitting greater insight into the workings of the Commission, we can \nreduce some of the anxiety communities will experience as we near 2005. \nGreater transparency will also help us limit the number of potential \nand very costly mistakes.\n  We will place a tremendous amount of trust in the nine members of the \nCommission. Their decisions will impact hundreds of communities across \nour Nation. It is entirely reasonable to demand a degree of \ntransparency into the process.\n  In a recent letter, the general counsel of the Department of Defense \nwrote to express the Department's opposition to this amendment. The \ncounsel justifies the Department's opposition by arguing that the \nproposed criteria ``are redundant to existing provisions,'' and ``the \nproposed requirement to weight the selection criteria is unnecessary.''\n  As an example of this alleged redundancy, the counsel points out that \nour amendment requires that the selection process address ``force \nstructure and mission requirements through 2020,'' and that the current \nlaw also requires the Secretary of Defense to develop a force structure \nplan based on, among other factors, an assessment of the probable \nthreats to national security through 2025.\n  This is true. However, the general counsel fails to mention that the \ncurrent law requires the Secretary of Defense to submit the plan in \nsupport of the Department's fiscal year 2005 budget. That budget will \nnot be submitted to Congress until February or March of 2004, months \nafter the December 31, 2003 deadline for publishing the proposed \ncriteria for base closing in the Federal Register. Without our \namendment, the criteria will be established before the Secretary has \nreported his assessment of our long-term threat, the necessary force \nstructure, and hence the most appropriate infrastructure needs of the \nmilitary.\n\n[[Page S6180]]\n\n  Members of this administration have said on previous occasions that \ndoing a BRAC before our future force structure has been determined is \nlike getting the cart before the horse.\n  The general counsel also contended in the letter that the amendment's \nrequirements that the criteria be weighted is unnecessary because the \ncurrent law:\n\n     . . . requires the Secretary of Defense to ensure that \n     military value is the primary consideration. . . .\n\n  True. Our legislation would not change this. The real question is, \nExactly how will the Department measure military value? Clearly, there \nare many factors that comprise this measurement. The current law \ncontains at least five components of military value. Is it unreasonable \nto ask which of these is the more important? They can't all be of equal \nvalue. At some point the Commission will rank them, giving each \ncriterion a different relative weight. All we are seeking is insight \ninto the process. Without knowledge of how the Commission weights the \ncriteria, we will once again be left, as we have seen in past BRACs, \nwith a secretive process in which the nine members of the Commission go \ninto a room with a list of bases and then reappear with a final list of \nclosures. There is no public insight into the Commission's rationale at \nthis point.\n  Our legislation would require that the relative weighting be \npublished, and thus provide the public with a greater understanding of \nthe process.\n  I think the general counsel's response shows a level of \nmisunderstanding of the concern that people have about base closings. \nThis has been a secretive process in the past, one in which there has \nbeen no necessity to reveal the rationale and the Commission has not.\n  I do not doubt the Department will eventually start looking at these \ncriteria more carefully. I certainly hope, before we go into this 2005 \nround, which will probably be the last round of base closures, that the \nDepartment will report on what our 20-year strategy is going to be, \nwhat our necessary force strength will be, and what our training \ninfrastructure requirements will be.\n  Today we don't know that. We could not know that today for 2020. The \nDepartment has not put that forward. Clearly the Department has been \nfocusing on the war on terrorism, as they should. But to go into the \nnext round of base closings, we must determine what our threats are \ngoing to be for 20 years and assess just how much it is going to cost \nto close a base or how much it would cost if we need to reopen it.\n  It is clear that did not happen in all cases during the 1995 round. \nCosts continue to be much more than were estimated by the Commission.\n  The environmental cleanup is still costing us hundreds of millions of \ndollars in the Military Construction Subcommittee, where I am the \nranking member, and we are paying costs that were never envisioned by \nthe 1995 base-closing commission.\n  I am going to withdraw my amendment because I do think the Department \nof Defense has other concerns that are clearly taking priority at this \ntime, and I understand that. But I am going to keep this amendment \nalive for the future because I believe the Department needs to come \nforth with weighted criteria, with a clear 20-year strategy before they \nset the criteria for base closings.\n  We need to know what the war on terrorism is going to entail over the \nnext 20 years. How are we going to protect our troops wherever they may \nbe? How are we going to make sure we have the training capability that \nwe thought we had at Vieques, but then all of a sudden people protested \nand we withdrew? So now we do not have a good live-firing training \nrange for the Navy to substitute.\n  How could we possibly go forward in 2005 without this information?\n  I urge the Department of Defense to work with me to come up with \nclear, weighted criteria prior to the 2005 round of base closings.\n  I withdraw the amendment and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The time is controlled by the majority leader or his designee.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I just wished 2 minutes for comment.\n  Mr. REID. I have a problem. We have a lot of time after the cloture \nvote. Senator Stabenow has about 30 minutes of material to jam into 20 \nminutes, so I think we should start with that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/27/senate-section/article/S6180-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6180-S6182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise this morning to speak about an \nincredibly important subject that affects every senior, every family, \nevery worker, every business owner in our country. This is something we \nhave been talking about for a long time but we are now poised to act. I \nwant to commend our Senate majority leader, Senator Daschle, for \nunderstanding the critical nature of prescription drug prices for our \nseniors, for our families, for our businesses in the country, and for \nscheduling this debate in July, an important time in the midst of so \nmany issues that we know are pressing. He understands--and I appreciate \nthat our leadership understands--the critical nature of our seniors \nhaving to struggle to get their prescription drugs every day and the \ngigantic rising costs for our business community. The fact is that \nworkers have to negotiate pay freezes in order to have the health care \nthey need.\n  This is an issue that affects everybody. We have the opportunity to \nact in the Senate. There are those who will be acting in the House of \nRepresentatives on a plan that, with all due respect, I believe and \nmany colleague believe, just isn't good enough. We have the opportunity \nto do the right thing to make a real difference to provide for a \nMedicare prescription drug plan that will pay for the majority of the \nbill for the average senior, and also lower prices for everyone.\n  I want to share with colleagues today results from a study that was \ndone by Families U.S.A. and released on Monday that tracks the rising \nprices of prescription drugs. It continues to be astounding. They have \nindicated that over the 5-year period--from January 1997 to January of \nthis year--the prices of the prescription drugs most frequently used by \nolder Americans rose, on average, 27.6 percent--way above the rate of \ninflation.\n  No wonder our seniors are having to choose between food and paying \nthe electric bill and getting their medicine. No wonder our small \nbusiness community is seeing premiums rise by 30 or 40 percent. The Big \nThree automakers in my State are struggling with the huge price \nincreases for health insurance.\n  We are seeing an explosion of prices for prescription drugs which is \nabsolutely not sustainable, and it is absolutely not justified.\n  Let me read from two of the many examples that were given by Families \nU.S.A. Premarin, an estrogen replacement drug, rose 17.5 percent--\nnearly seven times the rate of inflation. Lipitor, which we hear so \nmuch about, a cholesterol-lowering drug, rose 13.5 percent--more than \nfive times the rate of inflation.\n\n  That is astounding when we look at the fact that the taxpayers of \nAmerica underwrite basic research; we provide tax incentives, tax \ncredits, and tax deductions so the drug companies can write off the \ncost of research. We give them patents so they do not have competition \nfor up to 20 years in order to recover their costs. Then we see the \nhighest prices in the world being paid by our seniors--being paid by \neveryone in the United States. This explosion in prices makes no sense.\n  I am so pleased, as we come to this debate in the Senate, that out of \nthe debate we will include not only a Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit, which is authored by the Presiding Officer, as well as Senator \nGraham of Florida, Senator Kennedy, and many of us who join together to \nprovide real coverage and real help for seniors, but we also intend to \ntackle the pricing issue.\n  One of the things I found astounding in this study is the fact that \nup to 10 top generic drugs--in other words, unadvertised brands that \nare equivalent to the advertised brands, but they just don't cost as \nmuch--of the 10 generic drugs, 9 did not increase in price at all last \nyear. Nine out of ten of the generic drugs looked at did not increase \nat all. On the other hand, by contrast, only 3 of the 40 brand-named \ndrugs did not increase last year.\n\n[[Page S6181]]\n\n  I have talked about the fact that in our plan we provide incentives \nand encourage the use of unadvertised brands. We will be offering \nimportant amendments to close loopholes which allow brand-name \ncompanies to stop the generic companies from going on the market to \ncompete with lower prices.\n  These are very important issues.\n  We have two goals in the Senate: To provide a real Medicare \nprescription drug benefit, and at the same time to lower prices for \neveryone.\n  We want to open the border to Canada so we can get prescription drugs \nat lower prices. We want to provide other opportunities, such as \ntackling exorbitant costs of advertising that cause these prescription \ndrugs to rise so quickly.\n  What does this mean for real people? We know there is a real \ndifference between the House and the Senate. The House plan will cover \nabout 15 to 20 percent of the average bill for an average senior. We \nare looking at covering 70 to 80 percent--a huge difference.\n  What does that mean to the average senior?\n  I have set up a Prescription Drug People's Lobby in Michigan where we \nask people to come to my Web site. They can log onto my Web site by \nlogging onto Senator Debbie Stabenow, and they can find out what we are \ndoing to lower prices and to provide Medicare prescription drug \ncoverage. I have asked people to share their stories and their \nstruggles. I want to share two of those today.\n  Shawn Somerville from Ypsilanti, MI, is a granddaughter who is \nexpressing great concern for her grandmother. She said:\n\n       Just this last Christmas, my grandmother was hospitalized \n     because she stopped taking her prescription so she could \n     afford Christmas presents for all of us grandkids. She later \n     died from an undiagnosed ulcer. It was very sad to me that \n     these drugs are so expensive.\n       Do they need to be?\n\n  Do they need to be? No, Shawn. They do not need to be.\n  We don't need another grandma choosing not taking her medicine this \nChristmas so she can buy Christmas presents for her grandchildren. This \nis the United States of America. We can do better. It is shameful that \nwe have not done better. We intend in the Senate to come forward with a \nplan that will do better.\n\n  I have been getting e-mail from the Prescription Drug People's Lobby \nfrom around the country. I will share one more before turning to my \ncolleague from Minnesota, who has been such a leader on this issue.\n  This is from Lydell Howard from Inglewood, CA. She wrote:\n\n       My grandfather, Esco Howard, a 75-year-old retired LTV \n     Steel worker recently experienced what we thought to be \n     impossible. He and his spouse in March 2002 were sent a \n     letter to advise them that they would no longer be covered by \n     a medical plan as provided by LTV Steel, as of March 31, \n     2002. This was due to the financial constraints of the \n     company.\n\n  This is happening all across our country.\n\n       We (the family and grandparents included) were devastated. \n     What would they do? How could they then survive?\n\n  What would they do?\n\n       Since March 31, my grandparents have been faced with \n     exorbitant medical prescription costs. Their finances \n     absorbed by the cost of medical and prescription costs, now \n     average nearly $900 per month for prescription costs alone, \n     with an income of about $1,300 per month.\n\n  Nine hundred dollars a month. That is hard to fathom--somebody \nretired coming up with $900 a month.\n  This way of living is terrorizing seniors, disabled persons, and \ntheir families. This movement to expand Medicare to include a \ndescription plan is the answer. But it also must be affordable to all \npeople of concern.\n  Lydell Howard, I couldn't agree more. That is what this is all \nabout--providing real medical help, and real Medicare help for \nprescriptions for your grandparents, and making sure prescriptions are \naffordable to everyone.\n  I will say, as I have said so many times before, that we know this is \nan uphill battle. There are six drug company lobbyists for every Member \nof the Senate. People have to be involved and have their voices heard \nin order for us to be successful.\n  I will conclude by once again encouraging people to join us by going \nto fairdrugprices.org, and sign a petition calling on Congress to act--\nget involved and share your stories with us.\n\n  I now yield to my colleague from Minnesota, who has been such a \nchampion and a voice for people on this issue and so many others. I \nknow he is standing up every day on behalf of our seniors and our \nfamilies to lower prescription drug prices.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would like to not rush through this. \nWe only have 10 minutes. I will use 5 minutes and then yield 5 minutes \nto my colleague from Florida, who has been such a leader on this issue, \nalong with the Presiding Officer. Listen, I could go through this for \nhours. I don't know how to do this in 5 minutes, but let me try.\n  I thank the Senator from Michigan. I think people get a whole lot \nmore faith in politics and then people in politics when they not only \ncampaign and say they are going to do something but, once in the \nSenate, they make this their passion and their goal. I say to the \nSenator from Michigan, you have done that. Every single day you have \nbeen focused on prescription drug coverage for people. I thank you for \nthat.\n  The House has a plan, and I simply have to point out to the Senate \nthat I do not see it as a great step forward. I see it as a great leap \nsideways. I think people will come to see it the same way. People in \nMinnesota will.\n  There are a number of problems. Part of it is ideological. When we \npassed Medicare in 1965, it was an enormous step forward. I will tell \nyou, for my mom and dad, who are no longer alive, it made all the \ndifference in the world. It meant there would be coverage for them.\n  This was a Government program that, really, I put in the same \ncategory as Social Security. It was an enormous step forward, not just \nfor senior citizens but made our country better. It made us a better \ncountry.\n  What we want to do on the Senate side is extend prescription drugs as \na part of Medicare. On the House side, basically what they are saying \nis, there is no guarantee of any benefit. But what they do say is, \nseniors will be entitled to some sort of coverage through drug-only \ninsurance plans or through Medicare HMOs. By the way, a number of these \nprivate health insurance plans, I say to my colleagues from Ohio and \nMichigan, are telling me they are not going to provide the coverage for \nthem because it will not work for them. The only people it will work \nfor are people who will not need it, and they will not have a large \nenough pool, so it will not be profitable.\n  But on the House side, apparently Republicans have said they do not \nwant to extend this on to Medicare, in which case, really, they are \ninterested in going down the road of privatizing Medicare. We are not.\n  The second point is a real important one. If you are going to have \nprescription drug coverage that works for people, you have to keep the \ncopays or deductibles sufficiently low and premiums sufficiently low so \nthey can afford it. And it has to provide real catastrophic coverage. \nThat is what people worry about the most.\n  On the House side, you have this peculiar feature of between $2,000 \nand $3,700 there is no coverage. While people continue to pay premiums, \nthey do not get any coverage. I think probably close to half of the \nsenior citizens in this country actually are paying more than the \n$2,000 in expenses for prescription drugs; and they do not get any \ncoverage whatsoever in the House plan. It does not make a whole lot of \nsense. This is truly one of those examples where the Devil is in the \ndetails.\n  I guarantee you, when senior citizens--and it is not just about \nsenior citizens; it is their children and their families; we are all in \nthis together--see there isn't any coverage, people are going to say: \nWhat is this about? This does not meet our needs.\n\n  The third issue which is important to me is that the House plan says \nwe want to make sure that low-income seniors--the profile is not very \nhigh; it is not true the majority of senior citizens are ``greedy \ngeezers'' playing all the swank golf courses around the country--\nprobably a full 75 percent have incomes below $30,000 or $35,000 a \nyear.\n  For low-income seniors, the House says, of course we would not have \npeople paying, that it would be coverage they could afford, it would be \nfree coverage, except then they have an assets\n\n[[Page S6182]]\n\ntest so that if you have a savings account of more than $2,000, or you \nhave a car that is worth $4,500, or you have a burial plot worth more \nthan $1,500, you would not necessarily be eligible for any help \nwhatsoever. That strikes me as being stingy. To tell you the truth, it \ndefies common sense. We ought not to be having this kind of stringent \nassets test when it comes to whether people can afford prescription \ndrugs.\n  My final point--and I could spend a lot of time on this--I am a \ncosponsor of the Senate bill. I think it is extremely important. I \nthank both my colleagues. I would love to see us have some cost \ncontainment. I think we should do it. I could talk about three options, \nbut with only 30 seconds, I am only going to talk about one, because I \nhave been working on it for several years. And so have Senator \nStabenow, Senator Dorgan, and Senator Jeffords.\n  I do believe at the very minimum we ought to allow our citizens to \nreimport these prescription drugs from Canada, according to all of the \nFDA safety guidelines. There is no reason in the world why our \npharmacists, our wholesalers, and our families cannot reimport drugs, \nwhere they can get a\n30-, 40-, or 50-percent discount. There is no reason whatsoever. I \ngrant you, the pharmaceutical industry will not like this.\n  But what we also have to do is make sure there is a way we can reduce \nthe costs. I think that would be a helpful addition to what I think is \na very important piece of legislation.\n  I say to my colleagues, I think the House bill is a nonstarter. I \nthink it is a great leap backwards. I think we have a much stronger \nbill. I look forward to the debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, first, I commend my two colleagues for \ntheir eloquent statements. I commend the Presiding Officer for his \ngreat leadership on this effort to pass a prescription drug benefit \nthis year.\n  The most fundamental reform for our Nation's Medicare Program is its \ntransformation from a program that has focused, since 1965, on dealing \nwith people's needs after they were sick enough to go to the doctor or \nthe hospital and to create a modern commitment to good health.\n  Access to medications is an absolutely central part of that \ncommitment to good health. Access to medications not only helps people \nlive longer, happier, healthier lives, but it also will help Medicare \nsave money.\n  These truths are particularly important to the most vulnerable of our \nelderly, those who are too well off to qualify for Medicaid, the \nprogram for poor Americans, but are too poor to afford their medically \nnecessary prescription drugs.\n  There are approximately 10 million older Americans living on an \nannual income of $13,000 or less per year. Of that 10 million, 5.5 \nmillion have no prescription drug coverage because they do not qualify \nfor Medicaid.\n  These Americans face the tough choices of deciding whether they can \nafford their prescription drugs. One example of this is Mrs. Olga \nButler of a beautiful community in central Florida, Avon Park.\n  Mrs. Butler receives a monthly Social Security check of $672, which \nmakes her barely over the income limit for Medicaid coverage. This \nmeans that the 67-year-old Olga has to pay for her own medications, \nsometimes having to make the choice among food, rent, and her \nprescriptions.\n\n  Olga is on Lipitor and clonidine for her hypertension and high \ncholesterol. She pays $95 per month for Lipitor and $22 per month for \nclonidine. These prescription drugs not only improve the quality of \nOlga's life, but they are helpful in warding off a possible stroke or \nheart attack, for which she is at great risk.\n  In addition to the personal devastation of having a stroke or a heart \nattack, these would cause significant additional costs to the Medicare \nProgram.\n  An average hospitalization for a typical stroke patient costs \nMedicare $7,127.59. Physicians' time, tests, and consultations will \nadd, on average, another $1,600 cost to Medicare. This is an avoidable \nevent.\n  If Olga can continue to take her medications, chances are she will \nnot have a stroke, she will not have a heart attack, and, if she is \nfortunate, she will not need further hospitalizations, nursing facility \ncare, and rehabilitation services. This, of course, is expensive, but \nit is also avoidable.\n  You might ask, why are you discussing this issue of the poor, but \nabove Medicaid eligibility, elderly? Don't both competing prescription \ndrug plans that have been offered for Medicare offer similar benefits \nto Olga Butler? The answer is, not quite.\n  Under the House Republican plan, which I understand may be debated \ntoday and where I know there are considerable misgivings among Members \non both sides of the aisle, maybe one of the reasons for those \nmisgivings is the fact that, before Olga can receive any help with her \ndrug costs, she must pass an assets test. An assets test?\n  For the first time in the history of Medicare--for the first time \nsince 1965--we are about to impose an assets test in order for a low-\nincome Medicare beneficiary to be eligible for prescription drug \nassistance.\n  What does this mean to Olga Butler? It means she must deplete her \nlife's savings to less than $4,000, sell off her furniture and personal \nproperty that is worth more than $2,000, get rid of her burial fund if \nit exceeds $1,500, and sell her car, if it has a value of more than \n$4,500--all of these in order to qualify for low income assistance \nunder the inadequate Republican proposal.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes to complete my \nremarks.\n  Mr. REID. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I look forward to an opportunity to \ncontinue to outline the circumstances under which Olga would be \ndisadvantaged if the plan being considered in the House today were to \nimprovidently be adopted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/27/senate-section/article/S6182-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4033\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the Chair. I call up amendment No. 4033.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Cleland], for himself and Mr. \n     McCain, proposes an amendment numbered 4033.\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n            (Purpose: To increase active duty end strengths)\n\n       On page 91, strike lines 1 through 4, and insert the \n     following:\n       (1) The Army, 485,000.\n       (2) The Navy, 379,200.\n       (3) The Marine Corps, 175,000.\n       (4) The Air Force, 362,500.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend, my \nVietnam brother, Senator McCain, for joining me in offering an \namendment that I think is critical to the future of our military forces \nand particularly critical to the future outcome of the war against \ncatastrophic terrorism. That phrase ``catastrophic terrorism,'' I \nborrow from Senator Sam Nunn, who once occupied this seat in this \naugust body and whose opinion in terms of military and defense matters \nI respect tremendously.\n  Today I introduce, along with Senator McCain, an amendment to the \nDefense authorization bill that begins to address the concerns \nexpressed by the uniformed leadership of the Armed forces and \nreinforced by visits to our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and \ntheir families around the world.\n  President Franklin Roosevelt once said to the members of his \ngeneration--which includes my mother and father. My father served at \nPearl Harbor after the attack, so I grew up with the notion that this \nNation should respond wholeheartedly to an attack on itself--``To some \ngenerations, much is given. From some generations much is required. \nThis generation has a rendezvous with destiny.'' I think this \ngeneration has our own rendezvous with destiny and that destiny is to \nwin the war against catastrophic terrorism, to defend our homeland and \nto hang together as Americans while we are doing it.\n  Regarding our efforts militarily, I support the President and our \nmilitary commanders 100 percent. However, I also firmly believe we must \nincrease the numbers of our active duty military personnel if we are to \nbe able to fight the war on catastrophic terrorism successfully. Our \nmilitary is currently winning the battle. But we will lose the war if \nwe continue to ignore the fact that our forces are critically over-\ndeployed and being asked to do too much with too little.\n  There is a Latin phrase which tells us, ``If you wish for peace, \nprepare for war.'' The United States is increasing its resources to \nprepare to fight this war. This Defense authorization bill represents \nthe largest defense authorization bill in American history--$394 \nbillion. Additionally, we are dramatically increasing our intelligence \ncapabilities, especially human intelligence. We are boosting the CIA \nwith more money and people, while the FBI is creating a super squad \naimed at fighting terrorism around the globe. In the past 2 weeks, the \nPresident requested Congress create a Cabinet office of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  We are very fortunate to have a superb military force that is highly-\nskilled, highly-trained and highly-motivated.\n  The problem is that they are also over-committed. Our forces are \nover-deployed and they won't be able to do it much longer. We are out \nof balance, with our commitments far outpacing our troop levels, and \nthe situation is only getting worse. As can be seen on this chart, as \nthe size of our force structure has continually declined since Vietnam, \nthe number of contingency deployments has continued to grow with no end \nin sight. As a matter of fact, we all read in the papers almost daily \nwhere our military forces have been expanded in terms of commitments--\nto Yemen, Pakistan, the Philippines, the Republic of Georgia, and so \non.\n  Since the end of Operation Desert Storm in 1991, the armed forces \nhave downsized by more than half a million personnel. I do not think \nthe American people really understand we won Desert Storm in 1991 with \nhalf a million more people on active duty, trained and ready to fight, \nthan we have now. We do not have those half a million people, and our \ncommitments have continued to increase. Today, a Desert-Storm size \ndeployment to Iraq would require 86 percent of the Army's deployable \nend strength around the world, including all stateside deployable \npersonnel, all overseas-deployed personnel, and most forward-stationed \npersonnel.\n  Contrast that drop in personnel with the dramatic rise in the number \nof deployments for the same time frame. The Army alone is deployed in \nover 100 countries, with over 10,000 troops in Bosnia, Croatia and \nHungary.\n  Even more dramatic is the fact that deployments have increased 300 \npercent since 1989, and the fall of the Soviet Union. The tempo of \nthose deployments has increased from one every four years to one every \n14 weeks.\n  That was prior to September 11. In the war on terrorism, we now face \na far broader challenge and for a longer, unspecified duration. The \nDepartment of Defense has ordered new deployments in the last several \nmonths to Afghanistan, Yemen, the Philippines, Georgia, and Pakistan. \nTo make this possible, we have activated more than 80,000 guard and \nreserve troops and instituted stop-loss for certain active and reserve \ncomponent specialties. ``Stop-loss'' means you are not getting out of \nthe military; we have a war on. That is what ``stop-loss'' means.\n  This is not a way to fight a war when our strategic national \ninterests are at stake. The President has rightly told the country to \nbe prepared for a long war. That is highly appropriate. However, the \nDepartment of Defense requested only a modest increase, a little over \n2,000 personnel, in Marine Corps personnel this year. In the face of \nmounting evidence that our people and their families are hurting from \nthe strain of this new war, there are no current plans by Department of \nDefense to increase end-strength for American soldiers, sailors or \nairmen. The Department of Defense may not have plans to increase our \nend-strength authorization, but I do, along with Senator McCain and \nothers.\n  As the chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, I propose to authorize an increase of 5,000 \npersonnel\n\n[[Page S6184]]\n\nfor the Army, 3,500 for the Navy, 3,500 for the Air Force and 2,400 \nadditional Marines as part of the fiscal year 2003 budget. This \nrepresents an increased authorization of 12,000 personnel beyond the \nadministration's request. This initial increase begins to address the \nneeds of the armed forces, the needs they themselves feel are crucial.\n  During the past year, most of the senior uniformed leadership in \nWashington and around the globe have related manpower concerns and the \nstrain it has created on their service either in testimony or in the \nmedia. It is time to respond to their concerns.\n  Recently, two-regional combatant commanders testified that their \nforces were stretched thin and inadequate to carry out their assigned \nmissions if operations in the war on catastrophic terror continued at \ntheir current pace. I see no sign the war is abating. I see every sign \nit is escalating. In addition, the Joint Chiefs of Staff have \napparently cited manpower needs as one criteria leading to a \nrecommended delay in any possible military action against Iraq; a \nconclusion also reached during a Pentagon computer-simulated exercise \nthis past Spring.\n  This authorization process is inevitably about setting priorities, \nand this amendment addresses the crucial need of our most important \nresource and highest priority, the men and women who serve in our armed \nforces.\n  In addition to this needed increase in authorized end-strength for \nthe next fiscal year, I had hoped to offer a sense of the Senate \nresolution that would demonstrate the commitment of this body to the \ncontinuing need to address authorized end-strength levels as we fight \nthis war on terror and simultaneously meet this Nation's military \ncommitments around the globe. However, this resolution was ruled non-\ngermaine and cloture prevents its offering. This does not negate the \nfact that there is a need for almost 26,000 additional personnel over a \n5-year period to meet the shortages expressed by our senior uniformed \nleadership, soldiers, and families. My plan would bring our current \ncommitments and authorized troop levels into greater balance.\n  If fully implemented, over the course of a 5-year period, the Army \nwould grow by over 1 percent annually resulting in an army end-strength \nof an additional 25,000 extra soldiers.\n  The Air Force would require an increase of 2,500 airmen in fiscal \nyear 2004 and 2,000 in fiscal year 2005.\n  The Navy would have a requirement for 1,000 additional sailors in \nfiscal year 2004.\n  This responsible and incremental increase in authorization \nacknowledges that the activation of the reserve components and stop-\nloss are only temporary fixes to a larger problem. In addition, this \nplan begins the dialogue on the long term personnel needs that this new \nwar on terror requires. Though this multi-year plan will not be \nincluded in this bill, I will continue to pursue this issue within this \nbody. It is imperative that we continue to recognize that this is a \nlong term problem that must be addressed with long term plans in order \nto meet the commitment our young service men and women deserve.\n  Just a personal note: I have been on the short end of a no-cost, guns \nand butter policy before. It was called Vietnam. I don't want to hide \nthe costs of the war on catastrophic terrorism. I don't want to see \nthis happen again. In Vietnam, we had the men but not the mission. The \ndraft easily provided us with the personnel we needed but never \nanswered the question of how to properly use the troops we were putting \nin harm's way. American soldiers paid the price. In the war on \nterrorism, we have the mission, but we do not have the people. American \nservicemen and women will pay the price again if we do not act.\n  Right now, our military is on a collision course with the reality of \nfamilies they do not see, training they are not receiving and divisions \nborrowing from each other to meet requirements and survive. We can \nprevent tomorrow's losses, but we have to act today. We must be on the \nstrategic offensive against catastrophic terrorism with enough people \nand resources to make the terrorist lose. I support the Defense \nDepartment's internal look at reallocating spaces to the warfighting \nunits. This however, should be complimentary to a plan to provide the \nmost critical weapon in our arsenal--American service men and women. I \nrespectfully request that my distinguished colleagues join me in \nsupporting our men and women in uniform by providing them what they \nneed to fight and win this war on terrorism and meet our commitments \nabroad at the same time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment by my \nfriend, Senator Cleland of Georgia. The reality is there are some \n80,000 reservists who are now being extended on active duty--some of \nthose reservists voluntarily, some involuntarily--because of the \ndramatically increased commitments of manpower as a result of the war \non terror precipitated by the events on September 11.\n  Some of our most valued members of the military are our reservists. \nThey have filled incredibly important and vital missions in defense of \nthis country not only since September 11 but in every previous conflict \nin which we have been engaged in the last century.\n  Right now, many of these men and women who are being involuntarily \nextended believe they have performed the function of a reservist, and \nthat is to be called up in time of an emergency. Their lives have been \ndisrupted; they are having to tell their families they do not know when \nthey will be able to return to their homes, their families, and their \njobs. Remember, these reservists, the overwhelming majority of them, \nhave jobs and homes in their communities in which they live. Many of \nthem are very far away from home on ships at sea and overseas in many \nplaces.\n  The reality is, as patriotic as these men and women are, they are not \ngoing to remain in the reserves if they are forced to remain \ninvoluntarily for an extended period of time.\n  The Pentagon has been very reluctant to increase the end strength of \nthe military, which means that men and women who would be in active-\nduty forces would then take up these duties presently being performed \nby reservists. The reason is pretty obvious. What it does is it \nincreases costs rather dramatically. When you look at the personnel \ncosts associated with enlarging the size of the military, they have a \nvery significant budgetary impact.\n\n  The Cleland amendment tries to increase end strength because we know \nwe are in a protracted war, we are in a war that will not end soon, and \nit will require an increased number of personnel in the military. \nSenator Cleland's amendment is rather simple. It increases the allowed \nend strength--in other words, to the layperson, this is the allowed \nnumber of men and women in the military. It gives significant \nflexibility to the Secretary of Defense and the administration.\n  But we need to send a signal to all of the military that we are \nwilling to increase the size and strength of the military to whatever \ndegree is necessary to successfully prosecute the war on terror. Part \nof that, obviously, reservists being extended involuntarily, is that we \ndo not have enough men and women in the military. We are willing to \nprovide the weapons systems, the increased procurement--some of it far \nless necessary than the increased number of personnel in the active-\nduty armed services.\n  Senator Cleland, who keeps in very close touch with the men and women \nin the military, including those very large numbers who are based in \nthe State of Georgia, and I have come to the conclusion that we need \nvery badly to increase end strength, maintain the viability of the \nreserves, but also to successfully prosecute the war on terror.\n  I thank Senator Cleland for his amendment. It is a worthy amendment. \nIt provides a great deal of flexibility to the Defense Department. We \nneed to send a signal, especially to the reservists who are being \nextended involuntarily for an indefinite period of time,\n\n[[Page S6185]]\n\nthat we intend to increase the size of our military so they will not \nhave to.\n  Here is a reality: They are not going to keep these men and women in \nthe reserves if they believe they are going to be involuntarily \nextended. Senator Cleland has information about how many times \nreservists have been called up, particularly in recent conflicts, \nincluding that in the Persian Gulf.\n  At least those conflicts were of relatively short duration. But these \nmen and women who held jobs in their own communities and were members \nof the Reserves did serve their country at considerable sacrifice.\n  I thank Senator Cleland for his amendment. I strongly support it, and \nI hope my colleagues will support it as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I share the views as expressed by our \ndistinguished colleague from Arizona and, indeed, the distinguished \ncolleague from Georgia, about the problems facing the men and women in \nthe Armed Forces today, particularly the Reserves, the Guard, and \nothers. They have very loyally and patriotically accepted the call to \nleave their families, their jobs, and go on an active duty status.\n  Further, both Senators are quite accurate as to the current stress \nthat is being put on the active force, now augmented by the call-ups of \nthe Guard and Reserve--nevertheless, the total force as we refer to it \ntoday--the stress that is being put on them and their families by the \ndeployments worldwide. I take absolutely no exception to their \nobservations.\n  I at this point want to seek some clarity as to the interpretation of \nthe amendment before I ask the Chair to call up a second-degree \namendment to see if, in fact, that may not be necessary.\n  I say to my distinguished colleagues--either Senator may answer--is \nthis amendment paid for by offsets from other provisions in the bill?\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the Senator from Virginia for his support. This \namendment is discretionary. There is no money to pay for it, so it is \ntherefore discretionary on the services. If they meet this increased \nend strength, they have to take it out of their own hides. So it is \ndiscretionary upon the services.\n  Mr. WARNER. My next question would be: title X governs this process \nof the end strengths and has done so for many years. The practice of \nthe committees of the armed services--certainly the Senate committee--\nis simply to establish new end strengths and then they are incorporated \ninto the continuing language of title X, which is in permanent law and \ndoes not need to be revised annually. Does this amendment in any way \nrevise the provisions of title X?\n  Mr. CLELAND. The distinguished Senator is correct. This does not \nrevise title X.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I understood the Senator, it does not in any way seek \nto revise the language in permanent law of title X?\n  Mr. CLELAND. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my distinguished colleagues, it has been the \npractice of the conference committee on the authorization side each \nyear, in reconciling the differences between the House and the Senate--\nif the Senator from Georgia first would recite his understanding as to \nwhat is in the House bill now? And, should this measure be adopted on \nthe floor today, what would be the differences that the House and the \nSenate would have to reconcile?\n  Mr. CLELAND. I say to my distinguished colleague from Virginia, my \nunderstanding from staff is that the House has raised the floor--the \nfloor, not the ceiling. It has raised the floor. And we do not. We just \nestablish a new ceiling that is discretionary.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I understand it, the Senator quite \naccurately pointed out there is a floor in the House bill. We do not \nhave a floor, it is your understanding, in the Senate bill; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. CLELAND. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. So that issue would, then, be before the conference?\n  Mr. CLELAND. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Let's assume for purposes of this debate that the \napproximate cost of the amendment, I say to the Senator from Georgia, \nwould be about $500 million; is that correct?\n  Mr. CLELAND. The Senator from Virginia is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would it not be incumbent upon the Senate conferees to \nfind within this bill that will be passed shortly the $500 million in \norder to accept the provisions reconciled, as you say, by the House and \nthe Senate?\n  Mr. CLELAND. I say to my distinguished friend from Virginia, as far \nas I know, it is discretionary upon the conference committee because it \nis based on a discretionary item, independent of the budget. It is not \nan obligation, to my understanding, of the conference committee to come \nup with the money.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say, Mr. President, that my recollection--having had \nthe privilege of serving as a conferee for, I think, all the 24 years I \nhave been here--is that it has been the practice that on this type of \nlegislation, although it is discretionary--that is, in the manpower \narea--it has been incumbent upon the Senate to find within our bill the \n$500 million for purposes of reconciliation in the conference. That has \nbeen our practice.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I could finish, I will then be glad to yield. If that \nbe the case, I should like to alert colleagues that we would have to \nlook at all the programs, the full scope and full range of all programs \nin our bill to generate that $500 million. The consequences would be \nthat in some areas there would have to be reductions in those measures \nwhich Senators thus far have believed were secure as a part of this \nbill. Would I not be correct?\n  Mr. CLELAND. No, that is not my understanding. I say to my \ndistinguished colleague from Virginia, my understanding is that this \naddresses the floor, not the ceiling. It has not been the intent and is \nnot the intent of this amendment to take away from any other part of \nthe Defense authorization bill. It is the intent of this amendment to \nauthorize the services, if they so desire, to go to a new level of \ntroop authorization if they can find the money. It is discretionary \nupon them and discretionary to the conference committee.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator from Arizona wished to address the issue.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I wish to respond to the Senator from Virginia. We have \nother items in this bill--which is authorizing how many billions of \ndollars?\n  Mr. WARNER. About $379 billion.\n  Mr. McCAIN. About $379 billion, which, in the view of most objective \nobservers, would probably not have the priority of the men and women in \nthe military. I know of no higher priority. That is the reason why the \nSenator from Georgia and I made a tough decision here, saying: Look, we \nwill leave it up to the conference to find the money. I could give the \nSenator a list of projects that are authorized in this bill, which I \nthink, according to most objective observers, many of which could be \ndescribed as porkbarrel projects, which have a far lower priority than \nthat of the men and women in the military.\n  We are facing an urgent problem. We are facing a serious problem. We \nthink it deserves the attention of the Senate and, following passage, \nof the conference. It is not unusual to put in a provision on the floor \nthat is not funded. That is why we do have conferences. Certain \ntradeoffs are made. There will be tradeoffs made between the conferees \nfrom the Senate and the House.\n\n  I understand the difficulty that is entailed, but I also understand \nbetter the difficulty that right now the men and women in the military \nare having in carrying out their functions, their duties, and their \nmissions.\n  I hope the Senator will understand that we believe this issue is \ntranscendent to a $500 million out of a $379 billion piece of \nlegislation.\n  I thank my friend from Virginia. I understand it places a very tough \nburden on both the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Michigan, \nwho will be in charge of carrying this bill through the conference. I \nthank my colleague.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Virginia yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from Georgia and the Senator from Arizona have \nidentified a very critical unmet need. In fact, the Army has already \nindicated\n\n[[Page S6186]]\n\nit is going to try within its own funds to increase its end strength. \nSo by the time we actually get to conference, we may find that they \nhave already achieved what this amendment urges them to do and \nauthorizes them to do.\n  That is the point, No. 1.\n  No. 2, it seems very clear from the answers of the Senator from \nGeorgia that this is a discretionary matter--that it does not raise the \nfloor; it raises the ceiling, unlike the House, which does raise the \nfloor. The amendment of the Senator from Georgia raises the ceiling but \nleaves the floor where it is. Therefore, the discretion remains.\n  Given those clear responses I think this amendment is something we \nshould support because I think the responses leave the discretion with \nthe Department of Defense, unlike the House bill. That makes this a \nconferenceable item.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I could ask my chairman, and, indeed, the sponsors, I \nam sympathetic to what our two colleagues are trying to do. What I am \nendeavoring to do is make clear the responsibility of the conferees \nonce we get there. That is my basic concern because I have an \nobligation, as, indeed, my chairman does, in the conference to try to \nprotect the integrity of the Senate bill, which has hundreds of \ndifferent items from throughout this Chamber on both sides of the \naisle.\n  What is the chairman's view? Are we or are we not obligated? I \nbelieve, with the traditions of the past, that the Senate conferees \nwould be obligated to find the 1-2 billion dollars. What is the \nchairman's view on that?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That we should also try to maintain the Senate position on \nthis, which is that the ceiling would be raised and the floor would not \nbe raised. That remains. It leaves it as a discretionary matter, as the \nSenator from Georgia clearly said, with the Department of Defense.\n  We would do our best, as we always have, to find the funding for that \nhigher level. We may leave it up to the military to find it within \ntheir own funds with the direction from us in report language--the \nconference managers' language directing the military to find it within \ntheir own funds.\n\n  There are a lot of possibilities.\n  But the point the Senator from Georgia made, and the Senator from \nArizona as cosponsor made, it seems to me, is that it is unassailable \nthat we have overused our reservists. We have to find a way to correct \nthat. This is an effort to push us in that direction. It leaves it as a \nconferenceable issue because the floor in the House is raised to where \nthe ceiling is, but in the Senate bill, with the amendment of the \nSenator from Georgia, if adopted, the floor remains the same. It is the \nceiling which is raised.\n  It gives us some important added impetus to add end strength--as it \nshould.\n  I think we all agree that we have to find a way to do this in order \nto reduce the overuse of reservists.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have another question for the chairman \nand the sponsors. Again, I am sympathetic to what we are trying to do. \nBut at the same time, I find within the existing framework of the law--\nthat is title X--I would like to read that:\n\n       Section (c) item (1) increase the end strength authorized \n     pursuant to subsection (a)(1)(B) for a fiscal year for any of \n     the armed forces by a number equal to not more than 2 percent \n     of that end strength.\n\n  The existing law gives the Secretary of Defense the right to go to \nnot only the end strength submitted by our two colleagues--that is \nroughly 1 percent over the current table in our bill--but could go to \neven another percent of 2 percent.\n  It is not clear to this Senator exactly what the pending amendment \ndoes that the Secretary does not already have the authority to do. \nEverything that the pending amendment, one way or another, urges be \ndone, he has the right. I say this respectfully to the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan, our chairman.\n  Yesterday, on missile defense, let's say it was a top priority of the \nSenate to focus this, as the Senator from Arizona said, to cure the \nproblems associated. Fine. I have no objection to that. But I do not \nlike to see the Senate adopt an amendment which does nothing to change \nthe authority of the Secretary of Defense under the existing law.\n  The question is, What does this amendment do that existing law does \nnot permit the Secretary of Defense to do?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would say there are two answers to that.\n  First, since this would be a new level--a new ceiling--the Secretary \nof Defense would have authority to go 2 percent above this additional \nlevel. The ceiling would be higher. So the Secretary would have that \nsame discretionary 2 percent, but it would be above a higher ceiling.\n  That is the first answer.\n  The second answer, it seems to me, is that the Senator from Georgia \nand the Senator from Arizona have identified in their amendment a \nproblem which we all understand exists, and they have focused this \nissue into an amendment.\n  That amendment, if adopted, it seems to me, gives additional \nmomentum. We have to seek new ways to try to meet that end strength--to \ntry to fund it. We have to look to additional ways to try to fund it \nbecause the tradition which the Senator from Virginia pointed out is \nthat we have traditionally funded the authorized end strength. That \nmeans we have one of two options, or three. Either we have to tell the \nDepartment of Defense that they have to find the funds to do this \nwithin their own funds or we have to find the funds to do it at our own \nconference, or the third option is that we would begin a new tradition, \nwhich is that we don't fund the authorized level. That would be the \nleast desirable of all three.\n\n  But, nonetheless, it would be a new tradition.\n  Let me just sort of summarize that. We can either direct inside of \nour conference report that the Department of Defense fund the \nauthorized end strength with the amendment of the Senator from Georgia, \nor we can find the funds ourselves to do that in conference, or we can \njust simply not follow the tradition, which I happen to think is a good \ntradition, but, nonetheless, is an option.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I understood my chairman, one of the options is to \ndirect the Department to fund the levels in this amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Within their own funds.\n  Mr. WARNER. I understand that. But clearly the Secretary of Defense \nmay not exercise the discretion which our colleague from Georgia leaves \nin place to go to that end strength. So we can't direct them to do \nsomething unless the Secretary of Defense takes a prior action; that \nis, exercise the discretion to go to this new end strength level. Am I \nnot correct?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think our conference could actually direct the Secretary \nof Defense to do it out of their own funds. I think that is an option.\n  Mr. WARNER. But still under the amendment of the Senator from Georgia \nmaintains the discretion to go to new levels or not.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is right. I am talking about what the conference \nreport does. The Senator's amendment leaves that discretion there. But \nbecause of the tradition, we fund that authorized level, which the \nSenator from Virginia has pointed out, and we may decide to look to a \ndifferent approach which would be to direct the Secretary of Defense to \nmeet that level out of his own funds. It is a different approach, but \nit is an important amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is an entirely different step with \nthe conference taking that action. Then we would be taking the \ndiscretion away from the Secretary that he now has with regard to these \nend strengths. I would not favor that because of the following reasons: \nWe reposed by law, in the Constitution, the Commander in Chief who in \nturn selects his Secretary of Defense. I think they must be given the \nmaximum latitude possible as the executive branch. They are the \nmanagers.\n  I am always concerned when the Congress tries to mandate that they \nshould do A, B, or C when it is their collective judgment that A, B, or \nC not be done.\n  I hope in the conference we don't reach that. But let me just point \nout the following.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield on that point, we do mandate end \nstrength. It is called the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. With discretion.\n  Mr. LEVIN. No, not on the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I understand. But when we put in our end strength, the \nSecretary still has the discretion. To the credit of our Secretary, he \nhas, if I\n\n[[Page S6187]]\n\nunderstand--and I pose this to the Senator from Georgia as a question--\nalready exercised his discretion with regard to the Marine Corps, and \nhas gone to that level with the Marine Corps and found the funding to \nachieve it in this bill.\n  Am I not correct?\n  Mr. CLELAND. As the Senator pointed out, it was in the President's \nbudget request--that the only increase in personnel asked for was about \n2,300 personnel in the Marine Corps. That is in the President's budget. \nThat is a request of us which we accede to in this Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  My amendment says, in effect, that basically this is inadequate. \nOther services need additional strength, and this authorizes the \nservices to go to a higher end strength if they can find the money.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. But am I not correct that the Secretary has already \ntaken the action to meet the purport of the amendment by the Senator \nfrom Georgia as regards the Marine Corps?\n  Mr. CLELAND. It seems to me the President of the United States, in \nhis budget, authorized 2,300 additional personnel and gave the money \nfor that, and we have included that in the Defense authorization bill. \nWhat this amendment says is that in the collective judgment of those of \nus who are involved in this personnel debate, that is not adequate \nenough to meet the needs of our commitments, especially in this new war \nwe are fighting.\n  You can see here the tremendous imbalance we have presently. These \nlines shown on the chart have to begin coming together. We have to \nbegin matching our personnel with our commitments or else we will \ncontinue to strain our personnel to the limit. That is why we have the \nauthorization for the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force, as well as the \nMarine Corps, to go to a higher level.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that was essentially a reiteration of your \nbasic argument for the amendment.\n  My question was very narrow, very focused, and required, really, a \nyes or no answer.\n  Has not the President already, with the Secretary of Defense \npreparation of the budget, reached the figures for the Marine Corps \nwith an increase and paid for it?\n  Mr. CLELAND. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is all I wanted to establish. So that shows the \nSecretary of Defense is proceeding in an orderly manner, at least with \none service, to achieve the goals the Senator from Georgia has been \nreciting.\n  Mr. CLELAND. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. And it is my thought that in due course the \nSecretary of Defense will address each of the other services. So long \nas it is my understanding from this important colloquy that in no way \ndoes your amendment alter title X, alter that discretion, then, Mr. \nPresident, I shall not bring up my second-degree amendment to it. The \npurposes of that amendment have been achieved during the course of this \ncolloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I hope we can now adopt this amendment.\n  I thank the Senator from Georgia for his persistence on this issue. \nHe has identified a critically important unmet need for this country. \nWe have reservists who have been away from their jobs for a much longer \nperiod of time than anyone intended. We have to address that issue.\n  The Army has told us they are going to do their best to address this \nissue. The Navy has listed the increase in end strength as their No. 1 \nunfunded priority.\n  So I think the need is there. The focus upon this unmet need by the \nSenators from Georgia and Arizona will help us to, hopefully, advance \nthis to the point where we can actually find the funds for the increase \nin end strength. One way or the other, we have to address this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the concerns of the Senator from Virginia, \nand perhaps others, have been satisfied. We are prepared to accept the \namendment on a voice vote.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia for his colloquy which has clarified this issue. It has helped \ngain support for the amendment. I thank the distinguished chairman, \nSenator Levin, for his help. And I thank especially my colleague, \nSenator McCain, for pushing this issue forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 4033.\n  The amendment (No. 4033) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3975\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to call up amendment No. \n2514, which I understand has already been recommended for inclusion in \nthe managers' package and has been cleared on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator restate the amendment \nnumber, please.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I will send that amendment up in just a \nmoment. But I understand this amendment has been accepted on both sides \nand may be included in the managers' package. I want to take a minute \nto explain this amendment in a little more detail, if I may.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Levin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The underlying amendment we have been considering in regard to this \nparticular subject has to do with our shipbuilding program and the \nimportance of our Navy to the strength of our forces.\n  Let me first, though, thank Senator Cleland and Senator McCain for \ntheir very excellent work in calling to our attention another shortage, \nif you will, which is our end strength, our shortage of personnel, of \npeople we can actually send to the front lines, wherever those front \nlines might be. More and more, it is clear to us some of those front \nlines might be here on our own home soil, but also we need men and \nwomen to support our soldiers and sailors and airmen who have to be \ndeployed miles and miles away from our homeland.\n  So I thank them for their good work. I am proud to be able to support \nthat amendment as well.\n  But I bring to the Senate this particular amendment on shipbuilding \nbecause it points to yet another unfortunate shortfall of our overall \ndefense structure. Now is a time when we really have to focus and make \ntough decisions about how we are going to allocate these resources, \nagain trying to meet the President in his total budget request, which \nthis Senate has done, this Congress has done, and is in the process of \ndoing under the leadership of Senator Levin and Senator Warner.\n\n  But within that total amount we are allocating for defense, there is \nsome real debate about how that money should be allocated and spent, \nand that is what this broad debate is about.\n  One of the issues I want to spend a few minutes speaking about is \nshipbuilding. I would like to begin by reading into the Record just a \nshort clip from the American Shipbuilding Association entitled ``The \nDefense Shipbuilding Industrial Base--An Industry At Risk,'' which was \nwritten in May of 2001.\n  This report says:\n\n       In 1987, the United States had a naval fleet of 594 ships. \n     Today, the fleet numbers 316 and is dropping. The annual \n     numbers of naval ships procured is at the lowest level since \n     1932; the size of the Navy's fleet is the smallest since the \n     year before we entered World War I; and while the fleet has \n     been cut almost in half, the number of overseas deployments \n     has increased 300 percent.\n\n  As you can see from the chart, this is one of our mighty aircraft \ncarriers and is one of the Navy's pride and joy. We just do not have \nenough aircraft carriers and other different elements of our fleet.\n  This report goes on to say:\n\n       Our Commanders-in-Chief are on record that they cannot meet \n     the Nation's military and foreign policy strategy with a \n     fleet of less than 360 ships, yet Navy budgets [we are \n     considering today] are providing for a fleet of fewer than \n     200 ships.\n\n  This is unacceptable. It cannot stand. We need to change these trend \nlines.\n  Continuing:\n\n\n[[Page S6188]]\n\n\n       This disconnect between national requirements and budgets \n     increases the risk of instability in many regions of the \n     world, jeopardizes the lives of Americans, jeopardizes our \n     economic prosperity, and threatens our peace and national \n     security.\n       The historically low rate of naval ship production over the \n     past eight years has also severely weakened the very industry \n     upon which the Navy depends today and tomorrow for its ships. \n     If decisive action is not taken now to reverse the decline in \n     naval ship production, the Nation [could potentially] lose \n     the industrial capability to restore the fleet to the level \n     the Nation requires to maintain global peace and stability.\n       It is the role of our military leaders to define the forces \n     they require to meet their military missions.\n\n  Let me tell you why this is important as related to the Navy, let's \nsay, and the production of airplanes for our Air Force.\n  There is a difference, not that we don't need both; we need a robust \nAir Force as well as a robust Navy. But the way that we prepare and \nbuild and invest is different. Because of the magnitude of ships, \nbecause we don't order them by the thousands, we order them by tens and \ntwenties, not thousands, the same sort of procedures cannot be \neffectively applied. We need to understand those differences.\n  This report goes on to say:\n\n       For example, a fighter pilot or commercial passenger is in \n     an airplane for only a limited number of hours, whereas a \n     ship is a self-sustained city at sea that serves as home to \n     sailors for months on end. The production time of an airplane \n     is measured months, the production time of a ship is measured \n     in years. With respect to government orders, the airplanes of \n     the same design are bought in quantities of hundreds whereas \n     ships are procured in quantities of tens or even less, and \n     each ship of a class is highly customized. The same holds \n     true in commercial transactions, where only one or two ships \n     of the same design will be bought by an individual customer \n     and each customer demands customized designs. Airlines buy \n     quantities of aircraft that are in production for commercial \n     market in competition with other models being produced. \n     Another major difference is that there are a limited number \n     of countries with airplane manufacturers versus the number of \n     countries with shipbuilders. Therefore, there are many more \n     international competitors for ship orders than for planes.\n       Given these differences, it is not surprising that a \n     Department of Defense acquisition policy tailored for planes \n     will not work for ships.\n\n  Therefore, I have offered this amendment which will help to move us \nin a direction to increase our production level and turn around the \ndisturbing trend line.\n  The next chart I have illustrates the trend line. We have been on a \nshipbuilding program. We were well on our way in 1997 to 1998, 1999 and \n2000, moving up. No one has worked harder than Senator Kennedy, who is \nthe chair of this subcommittee and has added to the President's budget \nsome significant shipbuilding, and the Presiding Officer, as chairman \nof the Armed Services Committee, has done an outstanding job trying to \nchange this trend line.\n  This amendment, which has been accepted, will make this trend line go \nin a more positive direction. As you know, there is a great need.\n  There is an old quote about the military that says: When it comes to \ndebating matters of war, it is the amateurs who talk about strategies \nand the experts who talk about logistics. This is because so much of \nthe planning that goes into war is centered on two simple questions: \nHow are we going to get the troops to the fight; and how are we going \nto supply them once they get there?\n  The answer to both of these questions is a strong and robust Navy. \nThe conflict in Afghanistan today clearly demonstrates this.\n  Again, not to say that the Air Force and the Army don't have to meet \nspectacular and important missions, but we cannot be the strong and \nvital force we need to be to fight this war on terrorism, to support \nour allies around the world, and to project power around the world \nwithout a robust Navy. This amendment will help us to move in that \ndirection.\n  In an environment where we cannot afford basing rights for our \ntroops, the ships of our Navy become floating sovereign bases a world \naway from American soil. Our campaign in Afghanistan proves this point. \nCurrently, 30 percent of our Navy is deployed in support of Operation \nEnduring Freedom, and a majority of our fighter sorties, 85 percent \nflown over Afghanistan, were sea-based. So if we don't have the ships \nto serve, not only as supply lines but as places where our troops can \nbe secured while they carry out the missions and the battle, we will be \nseriously crippled in our efforts.\n\n  All of the Marines and many special operations troops that have \nserved in Afghanistan were based on ships. There is no doubt if we did \nnot have a sizable Navy, we would not be able to execute as well as we \nare in our Afghanistan campaign.\n  Furthermore, there is no doubt that even with a 318-ship Navy, it has \nbeen stretched very thin. Even though we are in a time of war and even \nthough we are about to approve the largest increase in defense spending \nin the last two decades, we are simply not procuring naval ships at a \nrate that will sustain a strong Navy in the future. If the size of our \nNavy fleet continues to decline, I fear we will not be able to carry \nout the missions before us.\n  Essentially, this amendment states that it is a national policy of \nthe United States to maintain a strong and robust Navy, with the \nappropriate number of ships to protect our interests both at home and \nabroad. Congress has done this before in asserting our policy regarding \nmissile defense, which we have just successfully debated and on which \nwe have come to consensus.\n  This amendment would require the Secretary of Defense to lay out the \nbudgetary plans necessary to maintain a strong Navy. The underlying \namendment requires DOD to submit an annual ship construction plan as \npart of the DOD budget. Each year the Secretary of Defense must provide \na plan for the construction of combatant and support ships that support \nthe national security strategy or, if we have no such strategy, will \nsupport what is called for in the QDR, the Quadrennial Defense Review.\n  If the national security strategy or the QDR, if it calls for 318 \nships, or if it would call for 375 ships with 12 carrier groups and 12 \namphibious ready groups, as Admiral Clark, Chief of Naval Operations, \nhas testified to as recently as February, whatever number is decided \non, the Secretary must provide in detail budget plans for the \nconstruction of these ships.\n  Of course, it looks out over 30 consecutive years. It is not \nsomething we are trying to do next year. This amendment will require \nthe details of such plan to be included. It is consistent with and \nstrengthens the underlying bill, on which the Presiding Officer has \nworked so hard and effectively. The plan must describe the necessary \nship force, how many carriers, submarines, destroyers, transport ships, \net cetera.\n  It also requires that the estimated levels of funding necessary to \ncarry out the plan and a discussion of the procurement strategies on \nwhich the estimated funding levels are based.\n  Finally, it requires a certification from the Secretary of Defense. \nThe Secretary must certify that both the current budget and the future \nyear's defense programs submitted to Congress provide for funding ship \nconstruction for the Navy at a level that is sufficient for the \nprocurement of ships provided for in the plan.\n  I am pleased this amendment was accepted. Shipbuilding is important \nto our overall defense plan. The industry itself is important to so \nmany of our States, our industrial complex from California to Maine to \nLouisiana. As a Senator from Louisiana, I am particularly proud of what \nour companies and our businesses, both large and small, contribute to \nthe shipbuilding strength and capability of America.\n  From a defense perspective, as well as an industrial base \nperspective, as well as from economic strength, this amendment is very \nimportant as we structure a Department of Defense that can fight the \nnew wars, that can take us to new places in ways that we can be \nconfident we can fight and stand strong for American values and \ndemocracy for ourselves, for our interests, and to help our allies \naround the world.\n  We fight every day to get good, solid land bases to operate. We are \ngoing to build or are in the process of building some of the finest \nairplanes ever created. Those are important to our Army and our Air \nForce. But our Navy cannot be shortchanged. If it is, it will be to our \nperil and to democracies everywhere.\n  We are fighting battles where we have no land bases from which to \nlaunch and supplies cannot be moved across land. They have to be based \non\n\n[[Page S6189]]\n\nthe sea. We cannot do that without a strong Navy.\n  For Louisiana, this is important, but it is much bigger than our \nState. It is important to the Nation.\n  So I thank the Senate for their acknowledgement of the importance of \nthis amendment. I also thank the subcommittee, led by Senator Kennedy, \nwho, through his hard work, has added three ships to the underlying \nbudget. We added a submarine, a DDG-51, and a LPD-17.\n  I also thank Senator Reed for his work on shipbuilding. He has done \nan outstanding job. Again, we have added to the President's request. I \nwas proud to support that in the underlying bill. This amendment takes \nus a step even further to make sure our Navy is strong, robust, and can \nsupport the great work and great mission of our armed services and our \ndefense.\n  (Mrs. CLINTON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a quick comment?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I congratulate the Senator on her amendment, which we have \naccepted. It takes an important step in assuring that we are going to \nhave the kind of Navy that we need, for which our Quadrennial Defense \nReview provides. Her amendment is going to help us get to the point we \nmust reach that not only identifies the need, but the roadmap. Her \namendment makes an important contribution.\n  As chairman of the Emerging Threats Subcommittee, she has become a \ntrue expert. She was way ahead of her time in identifying the threats \nthat have befallen us. As chair of that subcommittee, she has become an \nexpert on the Navy. Her contribution to the committee is immense, and I \nthank her for that.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the chairman. I wish to acknowledge the work of \nthe Senator from Virginia as well, who, of course, led the Navy as \nSecretary of the Navy for many years and now serves in such a \ndistinguished capacity. Truly, his voice has been one, over the last \nseveral decades, that has helped to keep our Navy strong. He was \ninstrumental in helping us make some real progress in this area of the \nunderlying bill.\n  I thank the Senator from Virginia for his support of this amendment \nbecause without his support we would not have been able to adopt it. I \nthank him for the work he does on shipbuilding for our Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank our colleague, a valued member \nof the committee.\n  We can clear two amendments; am I correct?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, we will continue to clear amendments. \nThe Senator from Virginia was on the floor with the distinguished \nmajority whip last night clearing a package of amendments. The \namendment I am going to offer was in that package. Simply because of \nclerical oversight--and staff had worked 15 hours yesterday--it was \ndropped.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4169\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I send this amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is in order.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4169.\n\n       Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \n     further reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To temporarily authorize higher partial basic allowance for \n      housing for certain members assigned to privatized housing)\n\n       On page 130, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 604. TEMPORARY AUTHORITY FOR HIGHER RATES OF PARTIAL \n                   BASIC ALLOWANCE FOR HOUSING FOR CERTAIN MEMBERS \n                   ASSIGNED TO HOUSING UNDER ALTERNATIVE AUTHORITY \n                   FOR ACQUISITION AND IMPROVEMENT OF MILITARY \n                   HOUSING.\n\n       (a) Authority.--The Secretary of Defense may prescribe and, \n     under section 403(n) of title 37, United States Code, pay for \n     members of the Armed Forces (without dependents) in \n     privatized housing higher rates of partial basic allowance \n     for housing than those that are authorized under paragraph \n     (2) of such section 403(n).\n       (b) Members in Privatized Housing.--For the purposes of \n     this section, a member of the Armed Forces (without \n     dependents) is a member of the Armed Forces (without \n     dependents) in privatized housing while the member is \n     assigned to housing that is acquired or constructed under the \n     authority of subchapter IV of chapter 169 of title 10, United \n     States Code.\n       (c) Treatment of Housing as Government Quarters.--For \n     purposes of section 403 of title 37, United States Code, a \n     member of the Armed Forces (without dependents) in privatized \n     housing shall be treated as residing in quarters of the \n     United States or a housing facility under the jurisdiction of \n     the Secretary of a military department while a higher rate of \n     partial allowance for housing is paid for the member under \n     this section.\n       (d) Payment to Private Source.--The partial basic allowance \n     for housing paid for a member at a higher rate under this \n     section may be paid directly to the private sector source of \n     the housing to whom the member is obligated to pay rent or \n     other charge for residing in such housing if the private \n     sector source credits the amount so paid against the amount \n     owed by the member for the rent or other charge.\n       (e) Termination of Authority.--Rates prescribed under \n     subsection (a) may not be paid under the authority of this \n     section in connection with contracts that are entered into \n     after December 31, 2007, for the construction or acquisition \n     of housing under the authority of subchapter IV of chapter \n     169 of title 10, United States Code.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, this is an amendment requested by the \nDepartment of Defense relating to certain basic allowances for housing \nin order to facilitate efforts to construct barracks for the most \njunior enlisted personnel. I understand it has been cleared on the \nother side.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The amendment has been cleared.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4169) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4170\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I send to the desk an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4170.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To set aside $20,000,000 for the disposal of obsolete vessels \n                 of the National Defense Reserve Fleet)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 305. DISPOSAL FOR OBSOLETE VESSELS OF THE NATIONAL \n                   DEFENSE RESERVE FLEET.\n\n       Of the amount authorized to be appropriated by section \n     301(a)(2) for operation and maintenance for the Navy, \n     $20,000,000 may be available, without fiscal year limitation \n     if so provided in appropriations Acts, for expenses related \n     to the disposal of obsolete vessels in the Maritime \n     Administration National Defense Reserve Fleet.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, this amendment relates to the MARAD \nobsolete vessels, which are currently in the James River and are \nbecoming a very serious hazard to the environment. I spoke earlier this \nmorning with the chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator Hollings. \nHe agrees that this amendment is in the interest of all parties and \nexpresses his support for it.\n  The amendment would simply transfer a certain sum of money--the same \nsum having been designated in the House bill--for the purpose of \nenabling MARAD to proceed to correct this potential environmental \nproblem and, hopefully, removing these vessels at the earliest possible \ndate.\n  Madam President, this amendment would make additional funding \navailable in fiscal year 2003 for the disposal of obsolete vessels in \nthe National Defense Reserve Fleet, also known as the\n\n[[Page S6190]]\n\n``Ghost Fleet.'' Because of their interest in this issue, I have worked \nwith Senators Hollings and McCain to develop this amendment and believe \nthat I have their support. Both Senators, however, have made it clear \nthat the funding language for disposal of obsolete National Defense \nReserve Fleet vessels included in section 3501 of H.R. 4546 is \npreferred to the funding language included in this amendment. I \nappreciate your concerns and will ensure that these concerns are \nconsidered in conference.\n  Since 1994, the Maritime Administration or MARAD has been compelled \nto rely exclusively on the domestic scrapping market because of \nenvironmental concerns related to overseas ship sales and scrapping. \nUntil October 2000, however, MARAD was statutorily prohibited from \npaying for scrapping services, which effectively precluded the use of \nthe domestic market. After the prohibition was removed, MARAD disposal \nefforts were further hampered by inadequate funding.\n  The amendment provides that $20 million be made available for MARAD \ndisposal of obsolete vessels, an $8.9 million increase to the budget \nrequest. The additional funding will address a funding shortfall and \nhopefully help to avoid an environmental nightmare.\n  There are 135 obsolete vessels in the fleet slated for scrapping, 29 \nof those vessels are considered a high risk to the environment, and 23 \nof those high risk vessels are located in the James River near Ft. \nEustis, Virginia. Such vessels contain large amounts of oil \ncontamination and other hazardous substances, such as asbestos and \npolychlorinated byphenyls (PCBs) These vessels pose a risk to the \nenvironment because their advance age and poor condition could result \nin the release of hazardous substances near sensitive environmental \nhabitats.\n  A growing number of regulators, marine inspectors, environmentalists, \nand workers who oversee the ``Ghost Fleet'' suggest that an \nenvironmental disaster is likely--if not imminent. In 1999, the fleet \nbarely survived the 40 mph winds and rough water caused by Tropical \nStorm Floyd. Although none of the vessels leaked, 30 vessels broke away \nfrom their moorings resulting in a two week recovery effort and a $3 \nmillion investment in a new mooring system. Given the current condition \nof the fleet, disaster may occur with or without another sever storm. \nFor example, the Mormac Wave is a 40-year old retired cargo carrier \nwith peeling lead paint and thick, jet black oil that has leaked from \nholding tanks to form a 3-foot-deep lagoon in the rusted hull of the \nvessel. Although workers who maintain the Wave and other deteriorated \nvessels endeavor to keep the nightmare from becoming a reality, they \nare fighting a losing battle.\n  As a result, it is vital that Congress ensure that MARAD have \nadequate resources to address this problem. It is my hope that the \nadditional funding authorized by this amendment will help to accelerate \nthe scrapping of vessels that are in the worst condition, most of which \nare located on the James River.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the amendment is cleared on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4170) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3975\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, at this time I call up amendment No. \n3975.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Stable Transitions in \n     Education for Armed Services' Dependent Youth Act''.\n\n     SEC. 1302. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) States are establishing new and higher academic \n     standards for students in kindergarten through grade 12;\n       (2) no Federal funding streams are specifically designed to \n     help States and school districts with the costs of providing \n     military or mobile students who are struggling academically, \n     with the extended learning time and accelerated curricula \n     that the students need to meet high academic standards;\n       (3) forty-eight States now require State accountability \n     tests to determine student grade-level performance and \n     progress;\n       (4) nineteen States currently rate the performance of all \n     schools or identify low-performing schools through State \n     accountability tests;\n       (5) sixteen States now have the power to close, take over, \n     or overhaul chronically failing schools on the basis of those \n     tests;\n       (6) fourteen States provide high-performing schools with \n     monetary rewards on the basis of those tests;\n       (7) nineteen States currently require students to pass \n     State accountability tests to graduate from secondary school;\n       (8) six States currently link student promotion to results \n     on State accountability tests;\n       (9) thirty-seven States have a process in place that allows \n     charters to be a useful tool to bridge the gap created by \n     frequent school changes;\n       (10) excessive percentages of students are not meeting \n     their State standards and are failing to perform at high \n     levels on State accountability tests; and\n       (11) among mobile students, a common thread is that school \n     transcripts are not easily transferred and credits are not \n     accepted between public school districts in the United \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 1303. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this subtitle is to provide Federal support \n     through a new demonstration program to States and local \n     educational agencies, to enable the States and local \n     educational agencies to develop models for high quality \n     military charter schools that are specifically designed to \n     help mobile military dependent students attending public \n     school make a smooth transition from one school district to \n     another, even across State lines, and achieve a symbiotic \n     relationship between military installations and these school \n     districts.\n\n     SEC. 1304.

Madam President, there have been many very good \namendments brought to the floor that have been accepted, which have \nstrengthened the underlying bill. I want to speak for a moment about \nthis amendment in the hopes that, if we cannot adopt it today, at least \nwe will begin a very serious discussion of this issue. It is an issue \nthat the occupant of the chair has worked on very hard on in her \ncareer, and many Members on both sides of the aisle feel strongly \nabout--that is, education and the quality of education in our country.\n  This particular amendment is in relation to the quality of education \nafforded to the hundreds of thousands of dependents of our men and \nwomen in the military. I will begin by expressing an overall thought \nthat we are becoming wiser and wiser in Congress on this issue of \neducation, recognizing that it truly is an issue of economic \ndevelopment.\n  It truly is an issue of strengthening our Nation. We cannot have an \neconomically strong and militarily secure nation moving in a \nprogressive way without an excellent school system. No matter where a \nchild is born--rural or urban, on the east coast or west coast--if we \ndo not do a better job as a nation of giving our children a quality \neducation, the future of our Nation will not be as bright, and it could \nput us in jeopardy.\n  I also make the argument that for our military, the same holds true. \nIt is not just about providing our military with the most extraordinary \nweapons. It is not just about training our military men and women to \nthe highest\n\n[[Page S6194]]\n\nlevels. It is not just providing them the basics in terms of fair \ncompensation and health care. We have an obligation to make sure, when \nour men and women sign up to be in our military and they have made \nthese sacrifices, that we provide them, between the Department of \nDefense and the Department of Education, a quality education for their \nchildren.\n  When we send our soldiers into battle, we want them focused on the \nbattle and mission at hand. We do not want them worried, as they \nnaturally would be, about spouses and dependents at home, about their \nhappiness, about their comfort, about their security. It makes our \nmilitary stronger when we provide good, quality-of-life issues for \ntheir families at home. One of the ways we can do that is by improving \nthe schools for military dependents.\n  There are over 800,000 children who are military dependents out of an \noverall force strength of 1.4 million adults connected to the military. \nMany of them are school-age children. Because of the specific demands \nof our military, which are very unlike the civilian sector because of \nthe way it is structured, many move every 2 years. Some military move \nfrom the east coast to the west coast, moving families with them. It is \nvery difficult providing an excellent education generally, and yet the \nmilitary has even more challenges.\n  What is the solution? I offer this amendment--and hopefully we will \nbegin discussing it--to strengthen our military schools in the United \nStates in a creative way. This amendment will set up the possibility of \na pilot program to help create military charter schools around the \nNation in partnership with local public school systems to provide an \nopportunity not only for our military dependents, but this framework \nwill also help communities that have a large military presence. The \nbenefit overall is that the community gets a better school, a school \nthat has the opportunity to provide an excellent education.\n  The second benefit is that our military children have that \nopportunity, as well as the children whose families might not have any \nconnection to the military. It gives them an introduction into what \nmilitary life can be like.\n  This is a partnership. It is a pilot program that will help establish \ncharter schools, and that is basically what this amendment attempts to \ndo.\n  Also with this amendment, which is an important consideration for \nmilitary children as they move from community to community, there is \ncreated for the first time what we call an academic passport. It helps \nto stabilize and standardize the curriculum without micromanaging, \nwithout dictating what the curriculum should be. It tries to set up a \nnew approach or a new framework for our local elementary and secondary \neducation districts for use throughout the country to set up a \nstandardized curriculum so that if children have to move from community \nto community, they can keep up as one school might require 3 years of a \nforeign language or 2 years of algebra or 1 year of algebra, or a whole \ndifferent curriculum. That is part of this amendment. It is something \nabout which military families feel very strongly. I hope that with this \nnew pilot program to help create charter schools with a new academic \npassport, we can begin to focus some of our resources--again, not all \nwithin the Department of Defense; some of this is within the \njurisdiction of the Department of Education--to create something \nexciting and wonderful for these 800,000 children.\n\n  Madam President, 600,000 of these children are in public schools \ntoday, at great stress sometimes to those public districts; 100,000 of \nthese children are either in private schools or are home schooled; and \nonly 32,000 of the 800,000 are in Department of Defense schools. As \nshown on this map, these schools are concentrated in a few States. \nThere are only 32,000 children, as I said, of 800,000 dependents. Some \nof them are overseas; approximately 73,000 are overseas; 32,000 of our \nmilitary children are in schools in New York, Kentucky, Virginia, North \nCarolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama.\n  As my colleagues can see, dependent children of military personnel \nare in public schools throughout the country. Sometimes they are good \npublic schools; sometimes they are not so good. We are working hard to \nmake every public school excellent, but I think we have a special \nobligation to our military families to make sure that those children \nare getting an excellent education.\n  I would like to tell you why with a chart that shows the percentage \nand status of degrees among the general population and our military \npopulation.\n  If you look at the general population, nonofficers in our military, \n91.5 percent have only a high school degree or GED--91 percent. In our \ngeneral population, it is about 80 percent--20 percent have college \ndegrees or above; 75 to 80 percent have only high school. This is a \nvery upwardly mobile group of Americans. These are men and women with \ngreat discipline, great patriotism, great commitment to the Nation. \nObviously, they are serving their country, but they are committed to \ntheir families and their communities.\n  As one can see, the officers exceed the general population at large. \nAlmost 40 percent have advanced degrees; 50 percent or more have \nbachelor degrees. This is a very upwardly mobile population. If we can \nprovide excellent schools and opportunities for this 91 percent, I \nthink we will be doing a very good job in helping to strengthen our \nmilitary but also helping our country be a better place. It is truly \nsomething on which we should focus more.\n  In conclusion, let me show a picture of a school of which I am very \nproud. It might be one of the first military charters, if not the \nfirst, in the Nation. This is a school we are building and will \nactually be cutting the ribbon for this week in Belle Chasse, LA. This \nis a state-of-the-art, brandnew public school in Plaquemines Parish.\n  There is a very important naval reserve base there. It is 90,000 \nsquare feet, 37 classrooms, a gymnasium, cafeteria, a media center, a \nyouth center, administrative offices, and although one cannot tell \nexactly from this picture, wonderful classrooms and a very high-tech \ncommunication and computer system. Six hundred of the children from \nthis military base will be able to attend a state-of-the-art school \nthat was built in a public-private partnership. I am very hopeful this \nmodel, based on this amendment--which, again, I am offering only for \nconsideration and will ask to be withdrawn in a moment so we can \nconsider it at a future time--will be something we can share with the \nrest of the Nation and help build opportunities for our military \ndependents to go to excellent schools and to help the local school \ndistricts to give nonmilitary children an opportunity to attend world-\nclass, first-class centers of education.\n  I think we can work all day long on pay raises, on building more \nships, and on building a stronger Air Force, but truly I think focusing \non educational opportunities, both for the adults in our military but \nparticularly for their children, will help us build morale, help us \nimprove retention, will help us strengthen our military in the \nintermediate and the long term, and it is something that, with a little \ncreativity and a little bit of thinking outside of the box, I am \nconvinced we could finance the construction of these schools by \nreordering some of the streams of revenue and end up coming out with \nsome excellent facilities around this Nation to serve both our military \nand our nonmilitary families and do a great job for our Defense \nDepartment and a great job for our country. That is what this amendment \ndoes.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3975 Withdrawn\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 3975 be \nwithdrawn until a further time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise today to speak on one of the \nmost important pieces of legislation that we will consider this year; \nthat is, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003. \nThis important bill authorizes funding to strengthen our military, to \naddress the challenges of today, and to anticipate the threats of \ntomorrow.\n\n[[Page S6195]]\n\n  We are a nation at war. This bill recognizes the critical role that \nour Armed Forces play in the war against terrorism and in securing our \nhomeland. It will help ensure that our troops are better paid, better \nhoused, and better equipped than ever before. I had the privilege of \nvisiting our troops in central Asia last January. I was a member of the \nfirst bipartisan Senate delegation to visit our troops on the front \nlines in the war zone. I was inspired by the patriotism and \nprofessionalism of our men and women in uniform.\n  As long as they know our Nation is united behind them, they are \nwilling to bear any hardship no matter how harsh, undertake any mission \nno matter how dangerous, and willingly risk their lives each and every \nday just by doing their jobs.\n  The obligation on us, in return, is clear. The legislation before the \nSenate recognizes our obligation to improve the quality of service for \nour American forces who need and deserve the finest equipment and the \nbest resources to combat any threat.\n  For example, the bill includes a 4.1-percent across-the-board pay \nraise for our military personnel and an increase in the housing \nallowance that will reduce the average out-of-pocket expenses for off-\npost housing to 7.5 percent in 2002. This represents significant \nprogress toward the goal of elminiating by 2005 the need for our \nmilitary personnel to reach into their own pockets to pay for housing. \nI also support, and cosponsored, an amendment adopted by the Senate \nearlier this week that will repeal the prohibition on concurrent \nreceipt of non-disability retired military pay and veteran's disability \npay for our military retirees, eliminating an inequity and allowing \nthese veterans to collect the full amount they have earned.\n\n  This bill also begins to address the needs and concerns of our \nreserve forces. Specifically, it includes a study that will require the \nDepartment of Defense to assess the compensation and benefits of our \nreservists, who have been called upon more and more to serve our \ncountry and protect our freedoms. Under the total force concept, more \nthan 80,000 Selected Reserve and National Guard personnel are now on \nactive duty, nearly 9 months after the attacks of September 11. This \nstudy is the first step to ensuring that our reservists receive the \ncompensation and benefits that are proportional to the commitment and \nservices that they provide.\n  While the bill reflects significant investments in our national \ndefense--including a significant increase to respond to the attacks of \nSeptember 11--it will take several years of sustained increases in \ndefense spending to completely recover from the ``procurement holiday'' \nof previous years.\n  I stand with the majority of the Armed Services Committee that \nbelieves more needs to be done to address the shipbuilding shortfalls \nthat this administration inherited from the previous administration.\n  The Navy's shipbuilding program simply is not adequate to meet the \nneeds of a more dangerous world. I am particularly concerned about the \nunder-funding of the Navy's destroyer, or ``DDG-51'' program, which \nserves as the backbone of the Navy's surface fleet. This bill fully \nfunds only two DDG-51s next year despite the clear need for a third. I \nam therefore pleased that the Senate version of the bill does include \nan increase of $125 million above the administration's request toward \nthe procurement of an additional much-needed destroyer.\n  During the committee markup, Senator Warner, with my strong support, \noffered an alternative shipbuilding proposal that would have provided \neven more to meet the need for more ships through an additional $1 \nbillion. Also, the alternative would have provided multi-year authority \nand additional advanced procurement for several shipbuilding programs. \nFurther, it would have restored $690 million of the almost $900 million \ncut in various missile defense programs. I am very disappointed that \nthis shipbuilding initiative was rejected in committee on a straight \nparty-line vote as, ultimately, there will be a high price to pay if \nthis shipbuilding trend is not reversed. We are making some progress. \nThe out-year budgets for the Department of Defense have improved \nmarkedly in investing more resources into rebuilding our Naval Fleet.\n  I am encouraged and optimistic, however, that the Navy and its \nindustry partners have heard our concerns about this egregious \nshortfall. Just recently an agreement was reached by the Navy, General \nDynamics and Northrop Grumman Ship Systems to transfer ship \nconstruction between the two corporations' shipyards. The terms of this \nagreement is based on adding two additional DDG ships to the Navy's FY \n2003 shipbuilding plan, which will be awarded to the Bath Iron Works in \nmy State. Bath Iron Works has a long tradition of producing quality \nships for the Navy. This agreement will immediately transfer DDG 102 to \nthe Bath Iron Works facility for construction.\n  Further, as a result of this agreement, the Navy is expected to \nrealize significant net cost savings on these programs, which could \nthen be used to further invest in additional shipbuilding initiatives. \nThe increased number of DDGs at Bath should provide increased stability \nand predictability at the yard, and maintain the critical surface \ncombatant work force for the industrial base to remain competitive for \nthe DD(X) family-of-ships.\n  The swap agreement has also led to discussions and a tentative \nagreement on the price and terms of a new DDG multi-year procurement. \nThis contract, once awarded, will provide seven ships over the next \nfour years, including three DDG swap option ships that Bath alone will \nhave the opportunity to bid on. This new multi-year procurement \ncontract will be the largest contract award in Bath's history. Let me \nstate that again, this pending multi-year contract will be the largest \ncontract awarded in Bath's history, and begin to remedy the shortfall \nin our naval fleet.\n  While the debate continues on how to transform our armed forces, the \nSenate is taking action to support our armed forces and the \nadministration's priorities. I would like to take this opportunity to \nacknowledge and thank Chairman Levin and our senior Republican, Senator \nWarner, for their tireless efforts to tackle the tough issues and \nproduce an authorization bill that funds a number of critical \npriorities and provides support for the men and women of our armed \nforces.\n  Our armed forces stand ready. Now it is our responsibility to equip \nand support our men and women to meet the threats and challenges of \ntoday and those of tomorrow.\n  I believe the legislation before us is a strong step in the right \ndirection, and I am pleased to have had an opportunity to shape this \nlegislation as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, On May 14, Department of Defense \nofficials announced that they intended to classify details of future \nflight tests of the national missile defense system. This occurred \nafter the Senate Armed Services Committee had completed its work on the \nDefense authorization bill, so we were unable to address this issue in \nthe committee version of the bill. The issue needs to be addressed, \nhowever.\n  The administration claims that placing a shroud of secrecy around the \nnational missile defense testing program is necessary to prevent \ndetails of its operation from being revealed to potential enemies. One \ncan argue whether such secrecy is truly needed, since we are many years \naway from deployment an effective national missile defense systems.\n  What is not arguable is that Congress has a right and obligation to \nknow the results of such critical tests, regardless of whether they are \nclassified.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Reed and myself would ensure that \nCongress gets regular reports, classified as necessary, on the results \nof each national missile defense flight test, 120 days following the \ntest.\n  The reports should describe the objectives of each test, and whether \nthe objectives were met. Such information\n\n[[Page S6196]]\n\nis absolutely essential for Congress to be able to understand and \nevaluate the performance of the national missile defense system.\n  The word in the modified amendment is ``thorough.'' This amendment \nensures that constitutionally mandated oversight will, in fact, \ncontinue to be respected.\n  I hope all of my colleagues will support this important amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4029\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 4029.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. REED] for himself and \n     Mr. Levin proposes an amendment numbered 4029.\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require a report on the results of each flight test of the \n        Ground-based Midcourse national missile defense system)\n\n       On page 34, after line 23, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 226. REPORTS ON FLIGHT TESTING OF GROUND-BASED MIDCOURSE \n                   NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) Requirement.--The Director of the United States Missile \n     Defense Agency shall submit to the congressional defense \n     committees a report on each flight test of the Ground-based \n     Midcourse national missile defense system. The report shall \n     be submitted not later than 90 days after the date of the \n     test.\n       (b) Content.--A report on a flight test under subsection \n     (a) shall include the following matters:\n       (1) A detailed discussion of the content and objectives of \n     the test.\n       (2) For each test objective, a statement regarding whether \n     the objective was achieved.\n       (3) For any test objective not achieved--\n       (A) a detailed discussion describing the reasons for not \n     achieving the objective; and\n       (B) a discussion of any plans for future tests to achieve \n     the objective.\n       (c) Format.--The reports required under subsection (a) \n     shall be submitted in unclassified form, with a classified \n     annex as necessary.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4029, As Modified\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I also at this time seek unanimous consent \nto send a modification of the amendment to the desk and have it \nreported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, reserving the right to object--I shall \nnot--the Senator submitted the amendment to me. I have been in \nconsultation with the Department of Defense. We came back with certain \nmodifications. The Senator has modified this amendment consistent with \nthose recommendations that I received from the Department of Defense.\n  I have no objection to the Senator modifying the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 4029), as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 34, after line 23, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 226. REPORTS ON FLIGHT TESTING OF GROUND-BASED MIDCOURSE \n                   NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) Requirement.--The Director of the United States Missile \n     Defense Agency shall submit to the congressional defense \n     committees a report on each flight test of the Ground-based \n     Midcourse national missile defense system. The report shall \n     be submitted not later than 120 days after the date of the \n     test.\n       (b) Content.--A report on a flight test under subsection \n     (a) shall include the following matters:\n       (1) A thorough discussion of the content and objectives of \n     the test.\n       (2) For each test objective, a statement regarding whether \n     the objective was achieved.\n       (3) For any test objective not achieved--\n       (A) a thorough discussion describing the reasons for not \n     achieving the objective; and\n       (B) a discussion of any plans for future tests to achieve \n     the objective.\n       (c) Format.--The reports required under subsection (a) \n     shall be submitted in classified form and unclassified form.\n\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator from Virginia for his help on this \namendment.\n  I think this is an opportune time to call for passage of the \namendment prior to any other discussion at this time. I urge passage of \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. WARNER. We have no objection, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4029), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I congratulate the Senator from Rhode \nIsland on his amendment. I think he may want to take a minute to \ndescribe it. I will yield the floor for that purpose, and then I would \nlike to add a comment on it of my own.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have spoken to the two managers of the \nbill. It appears this is the last hurdle before final passage of this \nlegislation. The staff is working now on a unanimous consent agreement. \nWe will have final passage at or around 2 o'clock today.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Sounds good.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, may I say to the distinguished leader \nthat we have, as I am sure each manager has, tried to contact all \noffices and all Senators who have expressed any desire to either speak \nor submit amendments otherwise. But, as I understand it, we will \nhopefully vote around 2 o'clock. Can we allow a reasonable period such \nthat if there is anything I have left undone Senators may contact me, \nor reciprocate on your side? Perhaps we can get a unanimous consent \nrequest in 15 or 20 minutes to lock in the vote at 2 o'clock.\n  Mr. REID. It takes the staff a while to do the unanimous consent \nrequest. It will take 15 or 20 minutes to do that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator from Nevada will yield for an additional \nquestion, there are a number of amendments which I understand may be \nworked out between now and 2 o'clock.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. We would make sure that any consent allows that to take \nplace.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Virginia for his \nhelp and cooperation, and the Senator from Michigan for his \naccommodation.\n  This is an amendment that responds to an announcement made by the \nMissile Defense Agency shortly after the conclusion of our committee \ndeliberations. The announcement was that they would classify the \ndetails of all future flight tests of the national missile defense \nsystem--now called the land-based midcourse system.\n  I believe Congress needs information of that kind. I also believe \nthose unclassified portions of the tests should be available to a \nbroader community, particularly the scientific community.\n  The amendment that has been agreed to and included in this bill would \nrequire the Missile Defense Agency to provide to the Congress within \n120 days a thorough report of the details of the tests. And it would \ninclude both an unclassified format and a classified format so that \nthose items the Defense Department and the Missile Defense Agency \nbelieves should be secret will be kept secret, and it will be reported \nto us in a classified form.\n  Let me say that one of the persistent criticisms of the first test of \nthe missile defense system--the land-based midcourse system--was the \nfact that the tests were unrealistic. In fact, this criticism--\nparticularly by the scientific community--led the Missile Defense \nAgency to adopt a much more realistic, thorough, and exhaustive test \nprocess for our missile defense system.\n  That criticism, in effect, has been very helpful to the development \nof the national missile defense. I think it is something that should be \nencouraged--certainly not discouraged.\n  This view is also shared widely in many other places. Yesterday USA \nToday had an editorial which said ``The Pentagon policy wrongly shields \nmissile defense data.''\n  They went on to point out that past scientific commentary about the \nperformance of weapons systems has been very valuable in terms of \nimproving those systems. They point specifically to the Patriot system. \nInitially, the Defense Department claimed that the Patriot was wildly \nsuccessful in the gulf war.\n  It turned out that a scientist at MIT was able to look at some of the \nnews video. He observed, based on his scientific training, that these \nclaims were dubious. In fact, he proved to be correct. Once the \nPentagon publicly acknowledged that the effectiveness of\n\n[[Page S6197]]\n\nthe Patriot was not as they had originally claimed, it was the \nbeginning of serious work to accelerate the development of additional \nimprovements. That improvement is now the PAC-3 system, a much more \ncapable system.\n\n  I believe honestly that the Defense Department would have tried to \nmove to a better version of Patriot anyway, but certainly the public \nscrutiny of this type of information helped that process move forward \nmuch more expeditiously.\n  As USA Today points out, we could spend up to $100 billion under the \nadministration's missile defense plan. As they say:\n\n       Taxpayers deserve assurances beyond the Pentagon's word \n     that the system works.\n\n  This is particularly important when, at the same time the Missile \nDefense Agency is talking about putting a much broader cloak of secrecy \naround what they do, they are also saying they want to have a \ncontingent deployment of missile systems as early as 2004.\n  Again, some of these tests are not even scheduled to take place until \nafter that date. Yet they are talking about a system in which they want \nto have something ready by 2004.\n  I fear that the pressure to put something in the field by 2004 will \novercome the willingness to be as clear and transparent as you want \nthem to be about these tests.\n  I hope this amendment will reinforce the Defense Department's view \nthat these details are useful for the Congress and, in unclassified \nform, useful for the scientific community.\n  As a former director of operational testing, Phil Coyle, stated in a \nWashington Post article, on June 11, the new classification policy that \nis being proposed by the Missile Defense Agency is, in his words, ``not \njustified by either the progress and tests so far or by the realisms of \nthe test.''\n  We are still at a very rudimentary stage, a stage in which details of \nthe test will help inform the Congress, will help inform scientific \nobservers, and, I hope, will help us keep this system on track and keep \nthe system, in effect, honest, so that if people are looking closely, \nall the t's will be crossed and all the i's dotted.\n  I must also say, at this point, too, that General Kadish, \nparticularly, has committed himself and budget dollars to ensure that a \nmuch more realistic and much more rigorous form of testing is employed. \nThat is commendable and, indeed, is supported in the underlying \nlegislation by our authorization.\n  Testing and reporting of results is very important because, as I \nmentioned many times, the comments of outside authorities, scientists, \nare very useful. The Union of Concerned Scientists, for example, \nprepared a report about the first several tests of the ground-based \nmidcourse system. They made several valuable suggestions.\n  First, they suggested that you make the end game more realistic. By \nthat, they meant we make the engagement with the kill vehicle and the \nenemy warhead much more realistic than the tests were at that stage. \nThat is being done, not solely because of the UCS recommendation, but \ncertainly it helped move along, I think, the concentration on more \nrealism.\n  They also talked about more realistic test conditions. Some of these \nthings do not strike me, at this juncture, as particularly sensitive \ninformation.\n  They talked about the geometry of the interception, whether it is the \nsame flight track for the enemy warhead as well as for the interception \nvehicle, the kill vehicle.\n  The time of day: If we are only testing at the same time of day, when \natmospheric conditions and sunlight or starlight are most opportune to \ndiscriminate a warhead from decoys, that is not a realistic test.\n  The weather conditions: Are we testing in foul weather as well as \nfair weather?\n  The flyout range, the altitude of the intercept--there are many \nthings that are very important. And we should have an idea, on an \nunclassified and classified basis, of these parameters. And the \nscientific community should at least have an indication, on an \nunclassified basis, of what is taking place.\n  I believe the amendment is important. It is useful. I am \nextraordinarily pleased that the ranking member, the Senator from \nVirginia, was helpful in getting this done so expeditiously.\n  One final point, we are simply codifying what I believe and what I \nknow to be the intent of the Department of Defense.\n  In that same USA Today article previously mentioned, Secretary \nAldridge wrote:\n\n       There is not now, and can never be, any component of this \n     missile defense program classified beyond the reach of the \n     security clearances of its congressional overseers. Congress' \n     constitutionally mandated oversight will always be respected.\n\n  That constitutionally mandated oversight has been codified in this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards). The Senator From Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I make these few remarks concerning the \nReed amendment now before the Senate.\n  With the modifications that I have proposed and the majority has \naccepted, I am not objecting to the inclusion of this amendment in the \ndefense authorization bill. These modifications were at the request of \nthe Department of Defense. But I do have concerns with its substance, \nconcerns that are shared by the Administration and, specifically, the \nDirector of the Missile Defense Agency.\n  This amendment offered by Senator Reed would require the Director of \nthe Missile Defense Agency to submit a report to the congressional \ndefense committees on each flight test of the ground-based midcourse \nmissile defense system, what we used to call the national missile \ndefense system. This amendment would add an additional three to five \nreports a year to the long and continually growing list of reports that \nthe Missile Defense Agency must submit to Congress annually.\n  Last year, at the insistence of our majority, the defense \nauthorization act required several reports to Congress on missile \ndefense. I strove, with some success, to assure that those reports were \nconsistent with what Congress requires of other defense programs. This \nyear, the bill our majority crafted in committee imposes five new \nreporting requirements related to missile defense, including annual \noperational assessments on research and development programs, annual \nassessments of military requirements for all Missile Defense Agency \nprograms, and detailed cost information on several missile defense \nprograms--information, I might add, that in some cases simply isn't \navailable.\n  My specific concerns are, as follows:\n  First, this amendment requires a report on every single flight test \nof the national missile defense system. I am unaware of any other \nprogram in the Department of Defense for which we in Congress impose \nsuch detailed reporting requirements. As I stated earlier, my intent \nlast year was to make reporting requirements on missile defense \nprograms consistent with those for other defense programs.\n  Second, this amendment adds to the already substantial reporting \nburden on the Missile Defense Agency. I would note that the Secretary \nof Defense, in a letter to Chairman Levin and me, informed us that our \nbill, even prior to this amendment, ``would impose a number of \nburdensome statutory restrictions that would undermine our ability to \nmanage the [missile defense] program effectively.'' The Office of \nManagement and Budget reiterated this view. A few moments ago, I spoke \nto General Kadish, the Director of the Missile Defense Agency, who \nechoed these concerns even as he reiterated his willingness to provide \nCongress with all information on tests to facilitate our legitimate \noversight function.\n  Third, Congress already has a process to gain all the information \nthat it desires on a test or tests. We need simply ask for a report or \na briefing, and the Missile Defense Agency has responded, is \nresponding, and will respond. I have heard no allegation that \ninformation on tests has been denied to the appropriate committee, or \nis not available on request.\n  I fully concur with those who believe that Congress should have \naccess to all relevant information related to missile defense tests. I \nhave relayed the assurances I received that the Missile Defense Agency \nwill provide us with this information. All members, and staff with \nappropriate clearances, will have access to this information. Indeed, \nCommittee staff received a classified\n\n[[Page S6198]]\n\nbriefing related to targets and countermeasures prior to the last long-\nrange missile defense test.\n  In the interest of comity and the desire to complete work on this \nimportant legislation expeditiously, I will not oppose inclusion of \nthis amendment in the pending bill. I will work during our conference \nwith the House to improve the provisions on missile defense.\n  Mr. President, we had to handle this amendment very expeditiously in \norder to achieve our 2 o'clock objective to have final passage. I did \nreview it very carefully with the Department of Defense. We did make \nthe technical changes. But I would have to say that I hope there is no \ninference, from this amendment as it now has been amended, that the \nDepartment would not have responded to the Congress had the Congress \nrequested any information under any tests.\n  So the amendment points up the importance of and the interest in the \nCongress, but at the same time Congress could have obtained the same \ninformation, as required by this amendment, had it taken the \ninitiative. Am I not correct in that, I ask the Senator?\n  Mr. REED. If the Senator will yield, you are absolutely correct. What \nI would suggest is, because of the highly technical nature of the whole \nprogram, often we do not know what questions to ask at times. As a \nresult, with this reporting requirement, I think we will fulfill our \nconstitutional obligation.\n  I guess I would respond, finally, by saying there is a saying from a \nfamous poet from New England, Robert Frost: ``Good fences make good \nneighbors.'' Perhaps if we look at this as a good fence, we will be \nbetter neighbors with our friends in MDA.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was in discussion with the President pro \ntempore of the Senate on something very important; and that is when he \nis going to give his Fourth of July speech, at which I try to be \npresent every year. I think we may be fortunate enough that the Senator \nmay give that speech this afternoon when we finish this bill sometime.\n  I think I am now in a position to enter a unanimous consent request \nfor this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following passage of S. \n2514, it be in order for the Senate to consider, en bloc, the following \ncalendar items: Nos. 371, 372, 373--these are S. 2515, S. 2516, and S. \n2517--that all after the enacting clause be stricken in each bill, and \nthat the following divisions of S. 2514, as passed by the Senate, be \ninserted in lieu thereof, as follows: S. 2515, division A; S. 2516, \ndivision B; and S. 2517, division C; that the bills be read three \ntimes, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, en \nbloc; that the consideration of these items appear separately in the \nRecord.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that with respect to S. 2515, S. \n2516, and S. 2517, as passed, that if the Senate receives a message \nfrom the House with regard to any of these measures, the Senate insist \non its amendment or disagree to the House amendment, and agree to or \nrequest a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two \nHouses; and that the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the \npart of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to discuss with the distinguished \nleader from Nevada and the chairman of the committee and the \ndistinguished minority member the amendment I have with Senator Smith.\n  This is an extremely important amendment. We have been trying to work \nout the details with respect to the majority and minority. I want to \nmake sure that our right to offer that amendment is protected.\n  It is not clear to me, with respect to the unanimous consent request \nposed by the distinguished Senator from Nevada, that our right to offer \nthe Wyden-Smith amendment, which is of enormous importance to the State \nof Oregon, would be protected. If I could yield to the distinguished \nchairman and ranking member so this point could be clarified, I am \nspeaking on behalf of both myself and the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator from \nFlorida be recognized for 5 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, it is my understanding \nthere is no amendment connected with this; is that correct?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. It is an amendment that has already been \nadopted.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wanted to again thank the \nleadership of our Armed Services Committee, the distinguished Senators \nfrom Michigan and Virginia, respectively, the chairman and ranking \nmember of our committee, for the acceptance last evening of an \namendment I had offered that was cosponsored by a number of Senators, \nincluding several on our Armed Services Committee, concerning a \nrequirement that the Department of Defense will do an investigation and \nwill report to the Congress on a regular basis about the biological and \nchemical testing that may have put some of our service men and women \nand, indeed, some civilians in harm's way.\n  Certainly, that wasn't the original intent when these tests were \nconducted back in the fifties, sixties, and seventies. But, indeed, \nthat has been the upshot of what we now find out, in some cases, 30, 40 \nyears later--even a half century later--that there may have been \nexposure that is causing our veterans to now need to know what the \nwhole truth is in order to fix the past mistakes where veterans have \nbeen exposed to toxic substances, particularly from this chemical and \nbiological testing, and to get full disclosure of this testing because \nit has been classified over the past number of decades. The veterans of \nthis country certainly have a right to know, particularly with regard \nto getting them to come in and get the health care they need if, in \nfact, the health care is required.\n  Now, that is a general statement. Let me kind of flush it out with \nsome specifics. In the sixties and the seventies, ships of ours in the \nPacific were gassed with biological and chemical substances and, in \nsome cases, simulants or simulations of those substances. That was a \nprogram under the acronym of SHAD, Shipboard Hazard and Defense. It was \nostensibly to test those ships' ability to react and protect themselves \nif an enemy came out and suddenly tried to put these biological or \nchemical agents on our ships in order to immobilize and to kill our \nNavy.\n  In some cases, we were told these were not the actual materials, such \nas nerve gas, but that it was a simulant of nerve gas. Years later, \ndecades later, we are finding that these simulants that were used are \nhaving an effect on the people who were sprayed; and, indeed, there \nactually may have been some exposure to the actual chemical and \nbiological agents instead of just the simulants. There were 113 of \nthese tests. Only 6 have been declassified. Of those 6, a population of \n4,300 veterans have been identified to be contacted and, to date, only \n622 have been written to when the Department of Defense declassified \nit, gave it to the Veterans' Administration. They wrote the letters and \nsaid: If you are having any effects, come into the veterans medical \nfacility. Of those 622, a good number of them were in Florida, which is \nhow I first started hearing about this.\n  Senator Cleland will have hearings this fall on this very same issue, \nbut what we are going to look into in this amendment, just attached \nlast night to DOD, is the shipboard gassing in the sixties and \nseventies.\n  What Senator Cleland's committee is going to look into is the overall \ntesting because, lo and behold, I started\n\n[[Page S6199]]\n\ngetting all of these ruminations coming out of Florida about some \nmysterious tests that were conducted in the fifties at the old Boca \nRaton Airfield, an old World War II airfield, and an 85-acre parcel to \nthe north that apparently is still undeveloped. But guess what has \ngrown up around it. Florida Atlantic University, one of our major \nuniversities, was built on this site. The Boca Raton Airport, one of \nthe major general aviation airports in Florida, is right there.\n  When I requested this information from the DOD back in February, as \nthe junior Senator from Florida, DOD wrote back and said it is \nclassified. Well, thank goodness that Senator Levin, our chairman, has \ntasked Senator Cleland, our Personnel Subcommittee chairman, to get \ninto this because our committee is clearly capable of handling \nclassified information.\n  So I want the leadership to know how much I appreciate them doing \nthis so the veterans will have full disclosure--were they in harm's \nway?--now that we are just finding out three and four decades later, \ncertainly incited by these letters that, as we speak, are being mailed \nout to these veterans all over the country.\n\n  Thanks to the chairman and the ranking member, they accepted this \namendment, which will be etched into law in our DOD authorization bill. \nThen, as we pursue the larger bill, including all the tests, other than \njust SHAD, Senator Cleland's subcommittee will get into this \ninvestigation.\n  It is my understanding that Senator Rockefeller, the chairman of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee, is also interested in having hearings on \nthis very same subject. I am so grateful to the leadership of this \nbody, on behalf of the veterans of Florida in my case, and on behalf of \nthe veterans of this country, to find out what happened--to peel back \nthe onion and see what really happened--and if there is a problem, we \ncan get these veterans into the medical facilities.\n  I thank the chairman for making this possible. I thank the \ndistinguished assistant majority leader for giving me this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Nelson for his \ndetermination and passion on this issue. It will benefit the veterans \nwho may have been affected. We are happy to work with him. Hopefully, \nhis leadership will produce the critically necessary information we \nneed to help with their medical situation. They are all in his debt and \nthis body is as well.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I understand Senator Hutchinson has some \nremarks he would like to give in offering an amendment, and then after \n10 minutes he will withdraw that amendment. I want to make sure he is \nin agreement with this before I ask unanimous consent.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Hutchinson be recognized for 10 \nminutes to offer an amendment, and then at the end of that 10 minutes \nto withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4069\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4069.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Hutchinson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4069.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 305. CLARA BARTON CENTER FOR DOMESTIC PREPAREDNESS.\n\n       Of the amount authorized to be appropriated by section \n     301(a)(5) for operation and maintenance for defensewide \n     activities, $3,000,000 shall be available for the Clara \n     Barton Center for Domestic Preparedness, Arkansas.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate my colleagues giving me an opportunity to \nspeak on this amendment. I think it is very important to our country. \nIt is a matter that, after cloture, is not germane, and I intend to \nwithdraw it. But I give notice that this is an important issue for our \ncountry and I intend to talk about it in the future. It is a matter \nthat is critical to the protection of our military.\n  Today we are deploying our troops across the world to fight the war \non terrorism, and it is clear our enemies have been actively attempting \nto acquire biological weapons.\n  We know Saddam Hussein has been relentless in his pursuit of \nbiological weapons. Yet even with this knowledge, we continue today to \ndeploy our troops without adequate vaccine protection. The shortage of \nanthrax vaccine, due to the failure of BioPort, has been well \npublicized. However, as we meet today, our military has no stocks of \nvaccines against a range of other pathogens that we know could be used \nagainst our troops.\n  According to unclassified documents released by the Pentagon, there \nare at least 10 nations right now pursuing biological weapons programs. \nBased on media reports, we know these nations include Iraq, Iran, and \nNorth Korea. In 1998, the Department of Defense instituted a program to \nvaccinate all uniformed military personnel against anthrax, but because \nof the debacle that has occurred since then, the resulting vaccine \nshortage, that program was curtailed and is only now beginning to get \nback in motion.\n  Today, only 526,000 service members have received any vaccine doses. \nThe vast majority of these have received fewer than the recommended six \ndoses. Soon it is expected that DOD will announce a new anthrax policy \nwhereby only troops being deployed to so-called high-risk areas will be \nvaccinated. I look forward to learning what areas are designated as \nhigh-risk areas. Given what occurred on 9-11, even the Pentagon itself \nshould qualify.\n  The tragedy of this situation is that there is no reason for us to be \nin this position. The DOD over a decade ago realized our nation needed \na reliable source of vaccine. The private sector is simply unable to \nmeet the requirement for vaccines against biological weapons. The \nproduction of these products is not profitable, the need is too small, \nthe infrastructure costs are too high, and the liability is too great.\n  There is no greater proponent of the private sector than I. However, \nthroughout the past decade private industry has declined to participate \nin this market. In fact, the only company that is chosen to contract \nwith the Pentagon is BioPort. We know that has not been an altogether \nsatisfactory experience.\n  This problem has been examined many times over the past decade. In \nfact, it has been studied twice by the Department of Defense. Both \ntimes, the conclusion was that our Nation needed a government-owned, \ncontractor-operated vaccine production facility. This is referred to as \na GOCO.\n  In January of 1991, Project Badger presented a report to DOD entitled \n``Long Term Expansion of Production Capability for Medical Defense \nAgainst Biological Warfare Agents.'' That is a long title, but the \nconclusion was that we needed to construct a Government-owned facility \nto provide assured manufacture of products against agents of biological \norigin.\n  At that time, DOD began site selection. They began planning for such \na facility. In 1994, they prepared a study entitled ``Department of \nDefense Vaccine Production Facility: An Economic Analysis of \nAlternatives.''\n  They were moving ahead. Then, the previous administration reversed \ncourse and decided to rely solely upon the commercial sector. After \ndumping over $120 million, we are only now beginning to receive anthrax \nvaccine. We do not want to repeat that.\n  In November of 2000, the Department of Defense completed another in-\ndepth\n\n[[Page S6200]]\n\nstudy of a potential GOCO, which included detailed cost and design \nestimates. In February of 2001, the Department prepared a comprehensive \nlife cycle cost estimate.\n  Finally, last July the Pentagon released its latest study, ``Report \non Biological Warfare Defense Vaccine Research & Development \nPrograms.'' This study once again came to the same conclusion, was \nprepared by a team of DOD personnel, industry leaders, and academics, \nand it included a letter from former Surgeon General David Satcher, all \nof it endorsing the concept of a GOCO.\n  Since September 11, the establishment of a GOCO has been recommended \nby other organizations outside the Department of Defense.\n  In November of 2001, the Institute of Medicine at the National \nAcademies issued a statement saying:\n\n       The establishment of a government-owned, contract-operated \n     facility for research, development, and production of \n     vaccines is essential.\n\n  I repeat, the Institute of Medicine concluded that such a facility is \nessential. In December of 2001, the Advisory Panel to Assess Domestic \nResponse Capabilities for Terrorism, headed by former Virginia Gov. Jim \nGilmore, issued a report, with their recommendation:\n\n       The establishment of a government-owned, contractor-\n     operated national facility for the research, development and \n     production of vaccines and therapeutics for specified \n     infectious, especially contagious diseases, is needed.\n\n  I offered an amendment to our DOD authorization bill, a critical bill \nfor our troops, that I believe would provide protection for our men and \nwomen in uniform. This amendment was cosponsored by Senator Hutchison \nof Texas, Senator Mikulski of Maryland, Senator Lincoln of Arkansas, \nSenator Sarbanes of Maryland, and Senator Roberts of Kansas. All of \nthem have cosponsored it. They recognize that it would ensure that our \ntroops receive the protection they require. We have seen DOD study the \nmatter twice; we have seen the Institute of Medicine-issued opinion; \nformer Surgeon General Satcher recommended the building of a GOCO.\n  All of these independent evaluations have concluded the same, and it \nis simply this: The private sector, for all of the good that it does, \ncannot, against some of the boutique biological pathogens and threats \nthat may exist now and in the future against our troops and against our \ncivilian population, and will not in the future see this as a \nprofitable commercial venture.\n  The insurance for the American people, and the insurance for our men \nand women in uniform, is to have a Government-owned production \nfacility, contractor-operated, to ensure that vaccine will always be \navailable if and when it is needed.\n  I will withdraw the amendment I have offered. However, I will \ncontinue to bring this issue before the Senate. Our troops deserve \nmore, I believe, than they are getting right now, and I intend to \ncontinue to pursue this issue as long as it takes until our troops are \nprotected, whether it is through the homeland security bill or the \nDefense appropriations bill or other vehicles we may have, because this \nis vitally important.\n  It is important for our country. It is important for our troops. It \nis the right thing to do. We have waited too long to act, and should \ndelay no longer.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 4069 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Pacific Northwest must have a search \nand rescue capability. The vast expanses of Federal land in our part of \nthe country mean our citizens constantly face the risk of disasters and \naccidents, far from help. Local communities, many of them with tiny \npopulations, do not have the resources to provide search and rescue \nservices to the extraordinarily large surrounding wilderness areas.\n  The amendment I offer this afternoon on behalf of myself and Senator \nSmith is a compromise. It would not have been our first choice. In an \neffort to work with our colleagues and appeal to our colleagues on a \nbipartisan basis, we offer this compromise to preserve a search and \nrescue capability in our region. Without this capability, the Pacific \nNorthwest faces the certain loss of lives for disasters, fires, and \naccidents that are unique to our region.\n  This amendment authorizes a total of $4.8 million to the Oregon \nNational Guard to upgrade three Blackhawk helicopters of the National \nOregon Guard to the capabilities of the UH-60Q search and rescue \nhelicopters similar to upgrades in the past. It would increase the \nauthorization for military personnel by $1.8 million to ensure the \nOregon Guard can respond to emergencies that require rapid medical \nattention.\n  Particularly during this season we are concerned about the host of \npossibilities that can strike our local communities, tragedies we have \nalready seen won in recent difficulties in our region. We cannot afford \nto play Russian roulette with the safety, health, and security of our \ncitizens.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Wyden-Smith amendment that we \nhave worked on with both the majority and the minority for many days.\n  I reserve my time to speak later in the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I thank my colleague for being a partner in this \ncause to preserve in the Pacific Northwest a search and rescue \ncapability.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an amendment with Senator \nWyden to preserve a truly invaluable search and rescue capability in \nthe Pacific Northwest.\n  On May 30, all eyes in Oregon and across the nation watched as brave \nOregonians put themselves in harms way to rescue climbers on Mt. Hood.\n  The rescuers included members of the Oregon National Guard, the \nPortland Mountain Rescue, and the Air Force Reserve 939th Air Rescue \nWing, whose members have been lauded for scores of rescues on Mt. Hood \nand the Oregon Coast, not to mention rescues in our neighboring state \nof Washington. In fact this rescue wing volunteers for these types of \nrescues.\n  Recently, nine climbers were swept into a 20-foot deep crevasse on \nMt. Hood. Tragically, three of the climbers did not survive, but the \nskills of the rescuers ensured that others would survive.\n  This rescue highlighted the skills of the Rescue Wing and the \nimportance Oregonians place on the Wing's capabilities in the region. \nWhile adverse wind conditions most likely sent one of the helicopters \ninto an inevitable crash, the highly skilled pilot of the 939th ensured \nthat the crew survived and that all on the ground were unharmed.\n\n[[Page S6204]]\n\n  Just one week prior, the 939th rescued a sick climber from Mt. Hood's \nSandy Glacier. I believe this rescue highlights the Wing's \ncapabilities: Late in the evening, the 304th Rescue Squadron used its \nnight vision capabilities to spot the climber at an elevation of 8,750 \nfeet.\n  The Pave Hawk, equipped with a hoist, lowered down Steve Rollins of \nPortland Mountain Rescue onto the Glacier to assess the climber. After \nbeing secured to the hoist, the climber and rescuer were raised into \nthe helicopter and transported to safety.\n  Mr. President, Oregonians were devastated to hear of Air Force plans \nto take away the 939th Search and Rescue Wing out of the state.\n  Oregonians realize that the 939th's mission is to rescue our brave \nmen in combat. In fact, we believe that the members of the 939th are \namong the very best trained in the nation. We know this because we know \nthe Oregon terrain and we have witnessed first-hand their skill under \nmost challenging conditions.\n  My original amendment with Senator Wyden would have prohibited the \nuse of funds to take this search and rescue unit away from the Pacific \nNorthwest. Senator Wyden and I understand the committee members have a \nproblem with this amendment and we therefore introduced another \namendment that would not interfere with the Air Force's force \nstructure.\n  The managers have told Senator Wyden and me that they would support \nthis compromise: it authorizes a total of $4.8 million for the Oregon \nNational Guard to be able to perform this mission.\n  I appreciate the assistance from Senators Warner, Levin, Lott and \nStevens, and look forward to working with them on this important issue.\n  Mr. President, let me close by illustrating why this is so important \nto me and all Oregonians.\n  The pioneer spirit of the Oregon Trail did not end with the \nsettlement of the valleys of Oregon. That spirit and bravery is very \nmuch still alive in my state.\n  But Oregonians cannot go any further west. They can only go up--into \nthe skies and into the mountains. It is there that the modern-day \npioneers meet with both triumph and tragedy, and their lessons are \nlearned.\n  The lessons of last week on Mt. Hood are harsh one that remind us of \nhuman frailty and the unbending forces of nature.\n  Not unlike the tragic events of the last year, what I saw in the \nrecovery on Mt. Hood also illustrates the bravery and compassion \ninherent in us all, and I want that spirit to continue in Oregon.\n  Mr. President, this is the spirit that is the bedrock of America's \nArmed Forces. It is clear to met that removing the 939th from Oregon \nwould truly be a tragedy without a lesson.\n  Again, on May 30, Oregonians became aware of a unit called the 939th. \nPrior to that, very few Oregonians would have any idea it was there, \neven though throughout the year, every year, the 939th has saved people \ntrapped in natural disasters or engaged in recreational activities or \nsometimes just going about their business.\n  Truly, what they saw on May 30 was a tragedy that unfolded on \nnational television when nine hikers climbing Mount Hood lost footing, \nfell into a crevice in which a number of them were killed. Many \ndifferent units, from police, the Oregon National Guard, and the Air \nForce 939th search and rescue, came to their rescue.\n  They volunteered to do this. The 939th is always training to be \nprepared to help in military situations. They say these real-life \nsituations are truly the best training they can have. In the course of \ntraining, they have saved countless human lives.\n  About a year ago, Senator Wyden and I were informed that the Air \nForce was to move the 939th from Oregon. I am not one to interfere with \nbasing decisions of the Air Force. When this happened, it was clear to \nevery Oregonian that we needed them. So Senator Wyden and I tried to \nmake the case a few weeks ago that they ought to stay. Senator McCain \nof Arizona pointed out we should not be telling the Air Force where to \nbase their people. I think he has a good point.\n  Senator Wyden and I are offering a compromise to say, fine, let us \nhave the upgrades in the helicopters. Let us have the personnel for the \nOregon National Guard. By the way, these upgrades have been made \navailable in most of the 50 States, but not Oregon. All we are saying \nis we need some military component in the Pacific Northwest. The 939th \nis going to Arizona. I do not begrudge that to my colleagues from \nArizona. I love Arizona and I love my colleagues. My Udall ancestry is \nall from there and I want Arizonans to have all the search and rescue \ncapability they need. But, doggone it, why take it from Oregon and say \nyou cannot have any comparable replacement? We are talking peanuts here \nwhen it comes to issues of life and death.\n  So I plead with my colleagues to allow this authorization because the \nwhole country had the case made for them on national TV when they saw \nthis rescue effort tragically end in a crash but with no additional \nloss of human life.\n  I wish the 939th well as they go to Arizona. This $4.8 million that \nit takes to upgrade these helicopters and to provide some personnel is \nprecious little to ask in an authorization as gargantuan as this. So I \nappeal to the hearts and the feelings of all 50 States. Don't leave the \nPacific Northwest without this capacity.\n  I have the privilege of sitting in Mark Hatfield's seat. Mark \nHatfield, for reasons of personal conscience, was not a big advocate of \nmilitary expenditure. The military money went in other places. He \nbrought other kinds of expenditures to Oregon, I grant you. But what \nlittle we have probably puts Oregon the 50th of 50 States in receiving \nmilitary appropriations. I say $4.8 million is not too much to ask.\n  I yield the floor and ask for the consideration and votes of \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I have spoken to the proponents of this bill and Senators \nMcCain and Kyl. I do not know how much more time the Senators from \nOregon want. They originally told me they wanted about 10 minutes. I \nthink they used about that. The Senators from Arizona indicated they \nwould take about 15 minutes, 20 at the most--10 for Senator Kyl and \nSenator McCain, in reverse order.\n\n  I am not asking unanimous consent at this time, but I hope that would \nbe about all we need to talk on this amendment. We will have a vote on \nit. We were very close at one time to final passage. We will propound \nsome unanimous consent requests in the near future, but I am indicating \nto Senators, maybe there will not be too much more talk on this?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. WYDEN. It is not clear to me what the Senators from Arizona \nintend. Certainly I understand the desire of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nevada to move expeditiously. I think both of us will try to do \nthat.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield, I say to Senator Reid we are \ngoing to have to, because of a previous unanimous consent agreement, \nget unanimous consent to allow a second-degree amendment to be \nconsidered. That would have to be the first order for us, to be able to \nget that.\n  Mr. REID. I understand.\n  Mr. McCAIN. We were seeking that because we were under the \nimpression, clearly a false one, that the Wyden-Smith amendment would \nbe ruled, postcloture, nongermane. The Wyden-Smith amendment is germane \nso we had wanted to propose a second-degree amendment. If one of the \nSenators from Oregon objects, then obviously we hear the objection.\n  Could I be recognized, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent a second-degree amendment on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Kyl, to the Smith amendment, be taken up \nat this time.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I regret Senator Wyden chooses to take \nwhat I think is an unwise course because I have to tell Senator Wyden \nnow that I will fight in the conference--and I will be a conferee--to \nhave it either amended as we want it done or to take it out completely.\n\n[[Page S6205]]\n\n  I think I may have the support of my colleagues because it really is \nunreasonable of Senator Wyden to object because it was clear, and \neverybody is clear, that we were under the impression that the \namendment was nongermane. We would have filed a second-degree amendment \nif it had been germane.\n  I do not question the choice of the Senator from Oregon, but I can \nassure the Senator from Oregon that, No. 1, Senator Kyl and I could \ncare less whether it went to Arizona or Alaska or New Jersey. I have \nsteadfastly opposed micromanaging any of the services.\n  By the way--Senator Kyl is going to want to talk about this a little \nbit--it is up to $69,000 per person we are going to expend on this, \nwhich is quite a remarkable expense that they have.\n  Second, if the Oregon National Guard wants to spend money, let them \ntake it out of their existing funds. They are perfectly capable, under \ntheir budgetary and decisionmaking process, to make a decision that \nthey want to upgrade their aircraft with the existing funds that they \nhave.\n  I do not think Senator Kyl and I would demand a vote on this. I will \nleave it up to Senator Kyl. But I assure Senator Wyden I would not have \ntreated him in the same fashion. But I yield the floor.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have already yielded the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to make clear how extensive the \nefforts have been on the part of Senator Smith and myself to work with \nthe Senator from Arizona, to work with all of our colleagues on this \nissue. We have tried again and again. The distinguished Senator----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield on that point? Has the Senator \never said a word directly to me about his amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. If I might finish? The fact is, we have come to the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona and discussed this several times. In \nfact, we discussed it at some length the night the Senator was \nunwilling to support another bipartisan effort to reach out to the \ndistinguished Senator. I want to make it clear, I think he knows----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield on that point? Will the Senator \nyield on that point?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I will be glad to yield as soon as I finish.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I didn't think he would.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I will be happy to yield to my colleague. As he knows from \nour work on the Senate Commerce Committee, I worked with the Senator \nfrom Arizona again and again because I appreciate his counsel and his \nwisdom. Yes, we have talked about this subject. We talked about it, in \nfact, the night that Senator Smith and I tried another effort to come \nup with a bipartisan approach that would satisfy the Senator from \nArizona. Today, we do feel that we have to go forward and protect our \nconstituents.\n  People in Arizona are, in fact, going to be protected. As Senator \nSmith said, the 939th is going to go to Arizona. That means the two \nSenators from Arizona, both of whom I value as good friends and worked \nwith on many subjects, are going to have protection for their \nconstituents.\n  What we have said is, now that Arizona is going to be protected, let \nus try another approach, an approach that is not injurious to the \nSenators from Arizona, so that our citizens, in an area where there are \nvast amounts of Federal land and great risks for our citizens, can also \nbe protected. So it is in that context that I seek to have this move \nforward today in conjunction with Senator Smith.\n  Finally, as I yield to my good friend from Arizona, I want to say to \nhim that I will continue to work with him on this issue and virtually \neverything else that conceivably comes before the U.S. Senate because I \nvalue his input and his counsel.\n  We have worked together on a whole host of questions. Now, if the \nSenator from Arizona desires me to yield to him, I am glad to yield to \nthe distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Oregon. The fact is I have never \nhad a direct conversation with the Senator from Oregon on this issue. \nHe knows it and I know it.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I have to reclaim my time to say that is factually wrong. \nThe night we tried to have the compromise, we in fact talked about it \non several occasions.\n  Now I am happy to yield further to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Let me say, first of all, it gives me no great pleasure to \noppose an amendment offered by two of my best friends in the Senate, \none Republican and one Democrat, good colleagues with whom we have \nworked on a lot of things.\n  This is not a matter of Arizona v. Oregon. It came to my attention on \nthe night the senior Senator from Oregon was mentioning that there was \nan objection to the inclusion of an item in the managers' amendment to \nthe supplemental appropriations bill which a number of Senators--\nSenator Gramm of Texas, our colleague Senator McCain, and I believe \nsome others in this part of the Chamber were going through the \nmanagers' amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill. We \nobjected to a whole variety of amendments which attempted to either \nspend money or micromanage money in ways inappropriate in our view at \nthat time.\n  That is when this matter first came to my attention because a Member \nof the other side mentioned to me there was a managers' relating to the \nState of Arizona. Naturally, I was curious when I saw that the Air \nForce's 939th unit was going to be moved from Oregon to Arizona and \nthat the amendment of the Senator from Oregon would have stopped that. \nI didn't know about it at the time. We objected to that and a variety \nof other things because we believed it was inappropriate to be on the \nsupplemental appropriations bill.\n  Now our colleagues from Oregon have determined that they should not \ninterfere with the movement of that unit to Arizona. But they want to \nmake up for its loss through the amendment they are presenting here--I \nthink that is a fair way to present it--as a result of which they want \nto take $3 million from the Army's active-duty operations and \nmaintenance account for upgrades of helicopters; $3 million will be \nspent for procurement of helicopters and $1.8 million for the 26 Oregon \nNational Guard personnel.\n  If I am incorrect, correct me. I believe those numbers are correct.\n  The fact that I don't view this as Arizona v. Oregon is illustrated \nby the fact that the unit will move to Arizona, and Arizona is no worse \noff.\n  I speak on this matter having nothing in terms of a parochial \ninterest involved but, rather, because I have taken President Bush and \nSecretary Rumsfeld at their word. And Senator McCain and I have worked \nfor many months--in fact, a number of years, even before President Bush \ncame into office--trying to preserve as much in the way of funding for \nour military as possible to be spent in an efficient way and not be \nwasted.\n  It is one reason we both support and are cosponsors of the base \nclosing amendment, notwithstanding the fact that it jeopardizes at \nleast one or maybe two Air Force bases. In at least one round, we had a \nmajor base closed. We are willing to take that risk for the State of \nArizona because we believe we are United States Senators and we have an \ninterest first to protect the United States of America and to protect \nour constituents to the extent we can. But when it comes to national \nsecurity and national defense, we don't play around with it. I don't \nput parochial interests ahead of the interests of America in its \ndefense.\n  When the President says, I don't have enough money for defense and I \nhave to spend every nickel we get in the wisest possible way, and when \nthe Secretary of Defense says, I am going to husband these resources \nand allocate them in the following way, then I don't think it is a good \nidea for Congress to say, because we want something for our home State, \nwe are going to take money out of the Army's active-duty operations and \nmaintenance account--almost $5\n\n[[Page S6206]]\n\nmillion--and put it into our State because we want a search and \nrescue mission for people who get into trouble in our beautiful \nmountains.\n\n  That is not right. I have no doubt that the local communities around \nMount Hood and some of these other areas may not have the tax base to \npay for this themselves. But the State of Oregon is on television--I \nhave seen the ads, and they look great because they happen in the \nprettiest country in the world. You see the ads: ``Come to Oregon''--I \nbelieve it is. I won't give the exact quotation of the ad. But they are \nvery effective ads.\n  There is a great deal to come to Oregon for. Their beautiful \nmountains are part of that. If the State of Oregon, I think, with its \nmultimillion-dollar budget--over a billion-dollar State budget--has \nenough money to urge people to come to the State of Oregon to enjoy its \nbeauties, then I think they also have the ability to provide for their \nsafety when they are there if $4.8 million is the difference; in other \nwords, to provide some mechanism for the State to be sure people \nneeding rescue on the side of a mountain could be rescued.\n  I have no idea what this unit is going to be doing in Arizona. We \ndon't have big, beautiful snowcaps. We have a couple of them, but not \nthe same kind of tourist attractions as the mountains in Oregon. The \ntraining, I believe, could be for the number of illegal aliens who come \nacross the border to be rescued. About 50 or 60 have died already this \nyear. Maybe that is what they intend to do. But I don't know. That is \nreally, in a way, beside the point.\n  Neither State, nor any other State, should be seeking to take active-\nduty account money from the Defense Department and using it for what is \na parochial need. I don't say parochial in a negative sense, but a \nlocal need, a need that could be satisfied by the people of the State.\n  That is reason for our opposition. It is not an Arizona v. Oregon \nissue, as the Senator from Oregon was himself being very clear. We \ndon't believe we should be micromanaging the military, let alone taking \nmoney from the active-duty accounts.\n  I regret we are not able to offer the second-degree amendment because \nthat would have prevented this, in effect. But it would require people \nfrom Oregon to make some choices about the $9 million we just added \nlast night in this bill for Oregon. They will be able to move that \nmoney around and make the choices themselves as to where they want to \nget the funding. But it wouldn't have to come from active-duty \naccounts.\n  I hope if this amendment is adopted--I urge my colleagues not to \nallow it to be adopted--that there will be some discussion along the \nlines the Senator from Oregon was alluding to earlier. I don't think at \nthe end of the day, as it is going right now, this is going to result \nin a conclusion that will be desirable from the standpoint of our \ncolleagues from Oregon.\n  I appreciate what they are trying to do. Again, it gives me no \npleasure to oppose them. But I think, if we have any concern at all \nabout our active-duty troops, if we have any concern about spending \nmoney wisely, and keeping U.S. Federal military missions focused on our \nmilitary and not the parochial needs of individual States to rescue \npeople who may get into trouble, we should keep our eye on that ball, \nvote against this amendment, and allow the Defense Department to spend \nthe money the way it wants to and help the State of Oregon get its \nfunding in some other way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I would like to tell the Senator \nexactly what the 939th will do in Arizona. They will train. They will \nlook for opportunities to help in a civic way to be relevant to the \npeople of Arizona and to rescue them because they want to be ready for \ncombat situations. So they are going to look for opportunities to save \nthe lives of Arizonians. God bless them in that effort.\n  What is the Defense budget? Probably $300 billion which we are going \nto vote for, and we are talking about $4.8 million.\n  I think what is really lost in my friends' comments is the role of \nthe National Guard and the national defense. It is growing. It is not \ndeclining. National Guard people are looking all the time to do the \nsame thing as the Air Force's 939th unit.\n  To suggest that somehow the Oregon National Guard is irrelevant to \nthe national defense is just demonstrably false. As we speak, there are \nmany Oregon National Guard units in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Afghanistan. \nThey are deployed. I think the National Guard's role is growing. It is \nnot diminishing.\n  To have these kinds of capacities, which many other States have, in \nOregon is entirely reasonable, and it is entirely fair. I don't \nbegrudge the Air Force moving the 939 to Arizona.\n  I am not sure I am very comfortable hearing that out of $300 billion, \nthe Air Force can't allow $4.8 million for the State of Oregon when \nOregonians are taxpayers too. We contribute to the national defense, \nand we get less in defense dollars than probably any State in America. \nIs that right? I say it is wrong. I say we ought to get some help here \ntoday on the floor of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to pick up on a remark of the \nSenator from Arizona. Again, he knows how much I enjoy working with \nhim. We have worked together on the forest fires and a whole host of \nissues that are important.\n  I wish to address my friend's comments with respect to the \ncontribution Oregon makes to our national security and why Senator \nSmith and I see this as being important to our military and why it is a \nvery constructive expenditure as it relates to the military.\n  For example, my colleague from Arizona said our State does not have \nhigh mountains. Well, the State of Oregon does. The State of Oregon--\nand we are very proud of them--have many high mountains. Those high \nmountains are part of a very good training ground for our military.\n  The Department of Defense has consistently said--as both of the \nSenators from Arizona know because they are very knowledgeable in \nmilitary policy--that we ought to, as a nation, be strengthening our \nsearch and rescue capability.\n  I think my good friend, Senator Kyl, has pointed out one of the \naspects that Arizona lacks and with which Oregon can assist, and that \nis training as it relates to dealing with rescues from high mountains. \nThe fact is, the people in the Northwest have been trained to rescue \nmen and women wounded in combat. The value to our Nation of having this \nnational training ground and this capability is a central reason why we \nare in support of this effort.\n  I am very hopeful that our colleagues will approve our bipartisan \namendment.\n  I want to wrap up by way of saying I certainly do not consider this \nan Oregon against Arizona kind of battle. I am going to continue to \nwork with both of my colleagues on this issue, but it seems to me that \nwhen we have tried to be considerate of the State of Arizona throughout \nthis process, we would just hope that our colleagues would be willing \nto address these concerns that our constituents have, especially when \nwe are showing that the contribution that Oregonians make is a \ncontribution that advances our national security, advances our military \nwell-being, and particularly makes a contribution that Senator Kyl has \nsaid cannot be made in terms of training people in Arizona.\n  Mr. President, I yield at this time and reserve the right to respond \nto comments that might be made further.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Pentagon says: The Pacific Northwest \nwill continue to have a ``very robust rescue capability.'' There are \n109 rescue-capable helicopters in the Pacific Northwest and units on \nalert in Salem and Astoria. Assets include CH-47s on alert for high-\naltitude rescue, recovered mishap HH-60. Long-range, over-water \nmissions are covered by the California Air National Guard.\n  In summary:\n\n       The Pacific Northwest will continue to have a very robust \n     search and rescue force even after the assets from the 939th \n     wing are moved to active duty units.\n\n  I have to tell the Senator from Oregon, the 939th is moving to active \nduty units in Arizona. It will not be practicing on civilians. There \nare two major bases in Arizona: Luke Air Force Base and Davis Monthan \nAir Force\n\n[[Page S6207]]\n\nBase. They will be there ready to conduct search and rescue missions in \ncase those many training flights that take place from both those bases \nsuffer a mishap. That is what they will be doing.\n  They will also be patrolling our border from time to time because, as \nJon said, people have died crossing the desert. But their primary \nmission will be to support the flight operations out of two major Air \nForce bases.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Sure.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I say to my friend--and I really mean that--you \nmade my point. They will be focused on military missions. They will \nvolunteer for these real-life rescue missions. They will save people in \nthe desert.\n  Mr. McCAIN. They won't volunteer.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. They do volunteer. That is what they do in \nOregon.\n  Mr. McCAIN. They are an active duty unit now when they move.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. All the helicopters you just named--all those \nhelicopters--we are just asking them to get the upgrade. Other States \nhave received them. We have not.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleague.\n  We have probably wasted way too much of the Senate's time on this \nissue.\n  One, the administration opposes it. And the Army opposes it. The Army \nsays, you are taking the money out of the U.S. Army's operating funds, \nwhich they badly need. According to them, insufficient infrastructure \nfunding decreases readiness. They do not have enough money. And now you \nare going to take the money out of operations and maintenance for our \nactive duty men and women--active duty men and women--in the military, \nand you are going to move it to the Guard.\n  All we are saying is--if you and your colleague would have allowed \nus--take the money out of the Guard units; shift it around to your own \npriorities in the National Guard. That seems eminently fair to me.\n  The Guard is very well funded. You are talking about the overall \nfunding. The Guard is very well funded as well. I am not going to take \ntoo much more time on this.\n  The administration opposes it. The Army opposes it. We oppose it. It \nis something, frankly, that is unnecessary. To have this kind of \ntransfer of funds, when our active duty military is already very short \nof funds, I think is a mistake.\n  Again, I think we could have solved this very easily with a second-\ndegree amendment, if it had been allowed, that the money would have \nbeen taken out of existing Guard funds. Then you could upgrade it or do \nwhatever you wanted to with Guard funds instead of taking it away from \nthe men and women in the military.\n  I will tell the Senator from Oregon, there are too many people living \nin barracks that were built during the Korean war. There are too many \npeople who are on active duty who have insufficient housing, \nlifestyles, quarters, and other basic amenities of life. And we are an \nall-volunteer force.\n  You are taking the money from the active duty personnel in order to \nsatisfy what your perceived needs are of the Guard in the State of \nOregon. I do not think that is fair to the active duty men and women in \nthe military.\n  I yield the floor. And I don't think we have any further debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, just to be very brief, with regard to the \namount of time the Guard has spent overseas, they might as well be \nactive duty people. These are people who have served our country with \nextraordinary valor all over the world. They could just as well be \ncalled active duty military.\n  I hope our colleagues support this bipartisan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n4060.\n  The amendment (No. 4060) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have one amendment which has been \ncleared.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, do we have that amendment reconsidered and \ntabled?\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4077, As Modified\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4077, on behalf of \nSenators Miller and Cleland, and send a modification of the amendment \nto the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the amendment being \nmodified?\n  Mr. WARNER. There is no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for Mr. Miller, for \n     himself and Mr. Cleland, proposes an amendment numbered 4077, \n     as modified.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To authorize $1,900,000 for procurement for the Marine Corps \n  for upgrading live fire range target movers and to bring live fire \n   range radio controls into compliance with Federal Communications \n                  Commission narrow band requirements)\n\n       In subtitle C of title I, strike ``(reserved)'' and insert \n     the following:\n\n     SEC. 121. MARINE CORPS LIVE FIRE RANGE IMPROVEMENTS.\n\n       (a) Increase in Authorization of Appropriations.--The \n     amount authorized to be appropriated by section 102(b) for \n     procurement for the Marine Corps is hereby increased by \n     $1,900,000, with the amount of the increase to be allocated \n     to Training Devices.\n       (b) Availability.--(1) Of the amount authorized to be \n     appropriated by section 102(b) for procurement for the Marine \n     Corps, as increased by subsection (a), $1,900,000 shall be \n     available as follows:\n       (A) For upgrading live fire range target movers.\n       (B) To bring live fire range radio controls into compliance \n     with Federal Communications Commission narrow band \n     requirements.\n       (2) Amounts available under paragraph (1) for the purposes \n     set forth in that paragraph are in addition to any other \n     amounts available in this Act for such purposes.\n       (c) Offsetting Reduction.--The amount authorized to be \n     appropriated by section 103(1) for the C-17 interim \n     contractor support is reduced by $1,900,000.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment, as modified, would add, \nwith an offset, $1.9 million for buying upgrades for Marine Corps \ntraining devices to support live-fire training and live-fire range \ncontrol systems.\n  I believe the amendment has been cleared.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the chairman is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment, as modified, \nis agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4077), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I renew my previous unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Our Republican leader has reviewed this and approves it.\n  Mr. REID. It is two pages long. I did not want to read it again. It \nis spread on the Record. I send a copy of it to the desk in case there \nis any misunderstanding.\n  I ask approval of the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing none, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are going to have the vote on final \npassage at 3:15. As most know, Secretary Rumsfeld is going to be here \nat 2:45 for a short period of time. But that will give everyone time to \nvisit with him. Then we would start a vote at 3:15.\n\n\n                        nunn-lugar expansion act\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to engage in a colloquy with \nthe chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Levin, and the \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Biden, to discuss \nthe legislative intent of the Nunn-Lugar Expansion Act.\n  I appreciate Chairman Levin's strong support for my bill. Under his \nleadership the Armed Services Committee adopted the bill and included \nit as section 1203 of the fiscal year 2003 Authorization bill. \nFurthermore, Chairman\n\n[[Page S6208]]\n\nBiden is a cosponsor of the bill and his support is critical to the \nsuccessful implementation of the nonproliferation authorities provided \nto the Secretary of Defense.\n  Section 1203 seeks to capitalize on the unique nonproliferation asset \nthe Nunn-Lugar Program has created at the Department of Defense. An \nimpressive cadre of talented scientists, technicians, negotiators, and \nmanagers has been assembled by the Defense Department to implement non-\nproliferation programs and to respond to proliferation emergencies. \nEqually impressive credentials are held by other agencies such as the \nDepartment of Energy, State Department, and Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission. Section 1203 acknowledges the unique skills held by various \nagencies and seeks to broaden the President's menu of response options. \nOur legislation rejects a ``one size fits all'' response and provides \nanother department with the authorization to respond to a proliferation \nthreat.\n  As the United States and our allies have sought to address the \nthreats posed by terrorism and weapons of mass destruction in the \naftermath of September 11, we have come to the realization that, in \nmany cases, we lack an appropriate assortment of tools to address these \nthreats. Beyond Russia and other states of the former Soviet Union, \nNunn-Lugar-style cooperative threat reduction programs aimed at weapons \ndismantlement and counter-proliferation do not exist. The ability to \napply the Nunn-Lugar model to states outside the former Soviet Union \nwould provide our President with another tool to confront the threats \nassociated with weapons of mass destruction.\n  If the President determines that we must move more quickly than \ntraditional consultation procedures allow, the legislation provides \nthat authority to launch emergency operations. We must not allow a \nproliferation or WMD threat to ``go critical'' because we lacked the \nforesight to empower the President to respond with a variety of \noptions.\n  In the former Soviet Union the value of being able to respond to \nproliferation emergencies has been clearly demonstrated. Under Nunn-\nLugar the U.S. has undertaken time-sensitive missions like Project \nSapphire in Kazabstan and Operation Auburn Endeavor in Georgia that \nhave kept highly vulnerable weapons and materials of mass destruction \nfrom being proliferated. But these endeavors have also illustrated the \ninherent problems of the inter-agency process in addressing time \nsensitive threats. We have seen on more than one occasion that teams of \nlawyers haggling over agency prerogatives and turf have delayed \nresponses to critical threats. We must not allow this to continue. We \ncannot permit the intersection of terrorism and weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  This type of scenario does not mean Congress will abandon its \noversight responsibilities or the Administration should be continue and \ncoordinate its actions to ensure the most seamless and effective \nresponse. Section 1203 requires extensive reporting requirements if \naction is taken under emergency circumstances. Furthermore, this \nlegislation is not a blank check. We expect this legislation to be \nimplemented with close consultation between relevant agencies. But at \nthe same time, the legislative authority provided therein enables the \nPresident to avoid inter-agency logjams that would retard urgent \nAmerican action.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am delighted to join with my dear friend and colleague, \nSenator Lugar, in supporting section 1203 of this bill. The Nunn-Lugar \nprogram and the several nonproliferation programs that have developed \nover the last decade were born in the need to secure excess weapons and \ndangerous materials and technology in the former Soviet Union. They \nhave not yet fully achieved that objective, but they have accomplished \nfar more than anybody other than Senators Nunn and Lugar foresaw a \ndecade ago, The record of former Soviet weapons and materials secured \nand destroyed, and of former weapons scientists given useful and \nhonorable work, is a testament to the importance of positive incentives \nin foreign and strategic policy.\n  Proliferation is a worldwide threat, and there are sensitive \nmaterials and technology in many countries. Section 1203 is rightly \ndesigned to permit Nunn-Lugar activities the former Soviet Union, when \nthere are opportunities to ensure that sensitive materials will never \nbe acquired by rogue status of terrorists.\n  I am pleased that Senator Lugar spoke of the need to give the \nPresident the authority to act in such cases. The current language of \nsection 1203 could be construed to permit the Secretary of Defense to \npursue such opportunities on his own, absent specific direction from \nthe President. In my view, that might invite the Secretary of Defense \nto initiate sensitive foreign activities without the knowledge or \nsupport of the Secretary of State. I understand that this was not the \nintent of the managers, Senator Lugar, or cosponsors of this bill. \nBecause this was clearly not the intent, I understand the managers will \nwork to clarify the language of section 1203 in conference so as to \nmake clear that the authority to order these operations resides in the \nPresident, not in the Secretary of Defense. That will be a very useful \ncontribution, and I commend them for it. I understand also that the \nconferees will make clear that the authority to draw funds from other \nprograms will extend only to other Department of Defense programs, and \nI appreciate that clarification.\n  I would hope that the managers of the bill would also see fit to \nbroaden the list of receipts of the reports required by section 1203. \nThe Foreign Relations Committees of Congress have a legitimate interest \nin knowing when sensitive non-proliferation programs are to be \ninstituted overseas. I understand that this concern will be kept in \nmind in conference, and I thank the managers for that courtesy.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I want to thank the sponsors of the legislation that was \nincluded as section 1203 in the fiscal year 2003 National Defense \nAuthorization bill for bringing this matter to my attention. Of course \nthe responsibility to initiate and expand the type of activities \nprovided for in section 1203 of the bill rests ultimately with the \nPresident. As you are the original sponsors of this provision, I will \nhonor your request and will urge the conferees to make the needed \nchanges during the conference process.\n\n\n                         The Price-Anderson Act\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, in March of this year, \nwhen we passed the energy bill, Senator Voinovich offered an amendment \nto reauthorize the Price-Anderson Act that passed overwhelmingly 78-21. \nThe Price-Anderson Act expires on August 1, 2002. This act sets up a \nsystem of insurance and indemnification to protect the public against \nlosses stemming from nuclear accidents. It has served the nation well \nsince the 1950s and has been reauthorized three times. Price-Anderson \nhas been amended over the years so that the utility industry that \noperates nuclear reactors is charged premiums for this insurance. The \nprivate Department of Energy (DOE) contractors that are involved in \nstrategic weapons production, clean up of national security sites, \nnuclear research and technology, as well as other related national \npriorities are indemnified by the government. In keeping with the \ndirections in the current law both the DOE and the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission (NRC) have issued reports urging renewal. The provisions of \nthe Voinovich amendment to the energy bill to reauthorize this \nlegislation were crafted in consonance with these reports. In the \nDefense authorization bill we are now considering, there is a provision \nto only renew the authority for the private DOE contractors. There is \nstrong justification for doing so, since a lapse in the authority will \naffect important cleanup and defense programs as I mentioned before. \nPrivate industry must be indemnified properly before undertaking these \nimportant national projects. Reauthorization is vital to national \ndefense and must be considered on ``must do'' legislation such as the \ndefense bill. However, the NRC provision of Price-Anderson, one that \nfalls under the jurisdiction of the Environment & Public Works \nCommittee, is not included in this bill. Historically, in the \nreauthorization of Price-Anderson, we have never separated the DOE \ncontractor provision from the NRC licensee provision. The three \nprevious renewals of Price-Anderson have extended both the DOE and NRC \nportions of the Act at\n\n[[Page S6209]]\n\nthe same time for identical time periods. As the ranking member of the \nEnvironment & Public Works Committee and as a senior member of the \nArmed Services Committee, it was my hope that we could ensure that \nthese two provisions of Price-Anderson be moved through the legislative \nprocess as one package, and not be separated. Due to the need of \nkeeping non-military provisions off of the Defense Authorization bill \nwhile the bill is under consideration by the Senate, adding the NRC \nprovision of Price-Anderson will not be possible at this time. However, \nit is certainly the hope of this Senator that the DOE and the NRC \nprovisions of Price-Anderson remain on as close of a parallel \nlegislative tracks as is possible, however that can be accomplished.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I am in complete agreement with my colleague. Should we \nlet this authority lapse, it will jeopardize national security \nprograms. Therefore, we must act in this bill with the provisions that \ncover the private DOE contracts. However, we must try to get the entire \nact renewed as recommended by the administration and the agencies that \nhave help to develop, modify and oversee its activities over the past \nnearly half century that have served us so well. I strongly believe \nthat it vital to pass full and comprehensive reauthorization of the \nPrice-Anderson Act. The law has worked well and has been considered a \nmodel in other countries. It insures against terrorism against the \nplants and has been studied in an attempt to help fashion the terrorism \ninsurance recently passed in this body. I would urge that we do what we \ncan in this body to get Price-Anderson renewed in the most expeditious \nfashion. I want to thank my colleagues on both the Armed Services \nCommittee and the Environment and Public Works Committee, of which I am \nthe ranking member of the Nuclear Subcommittee, and I look forward to \nworking with them so that we may pass comprehensive Price-Anderson \nreauthorization during the 107th Congress.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I Thank my colleagues for their commitment to this \nissue that is of the utmost national importance. I add my support to \nthe idea that we should keep the pieces of this legislation together. I \ncertainly agree that we should make certain that our private DOE \ncontractors do not experience a protracted lapse in authority that will \nsurely delay the implementation of important programs. But I want to \npoint out that energy security and national security are very much \nrelated, and both are integral parts of our overall economic security. \nNuclear power, science and technology are vital to this country. \nNuclear generation provides 20 percent of our electricity and is the \nlargest contributor to avoiding emissions. If we are to meet the future \ndemands for electricity we will have to build more nuclear plants to \naugment the present fleet. All over the world, nations are considering \nbuilding new nuclear facilities. The current administration wants to \nmove forward with new plants that use new, more efficient nuclear \ntechnologies that reduce the volume of spent fuel and have even more \nsafety features than the current plants which have unparalleled safety \nrecords. The original law was put together to support both aspects of \nnuclear operations. They have worked very well together. I would agree \nwith my fellow Senators who have just spoken on this matter. I was \nproud to have introduced the original Price-Anderson reauthorization \nbill and was very pleased when the Senate voted overwhelming to include \nmy Price-Anderson amendment on the energy bill. It is important that we \nreauthorize the entirety of this statute and I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with my fellow Senators to ensure that the Price-\nAnderson Act is reauthorized this Congress.\n  Mr. WARNER. I agree with my colleagues that reauthorization of Price-\nAnderson, both for DOE contractors and for NRC licensees is a priority \nfor the Nation. I am hopeful that these two provisions to extend Price-\nAnderson will soon be enacted into law.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, we just passed an amendment which will \nrequire the Missile Defense Agency to provide yet another report. While \nwe accepted this amendment, I believe it is redundant and wasteful.\n  The criticism of MDA for classifying information on targets and \ncountermeasures for future missile defense tests has been surprising, \nat best. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) informed us some time ago \nthat such information would be classified as testing becomes more \nsophisticated.\n  From the last three successful long-range intercept test successes, \nMDA has begun a progressive and more rigorous testing program to \nevaluate emerging and evolving technologies. These technologies include \ncountermeasure to missile defenses that our adversaries might use and \nthe means MDA devises to overcome those countermeasures. MDA has laid \nin a structure and process to identify likely or possible \ncountermeasures and to assess their potential effectiveness; and to \nidentify and assess possible counter-countermeasures.\n  I can't resist noting that the majority has cut about half the \nfunding for this function in its missile defense proposals in this \nbill. I think if they were that concerned about countermeasures, \nperhaps they wouldn't have made this cut.\n  After MDA has identified these countermeasures, it designs and builds \nthem. That's the only way MDA can test against them. Detailed knowledge \nof ballistic missile defense countermeasures techniques--techniques \nthat we may be developing ourselves to test the strengths and weakness \nof our missile defense systems--could lead our adversaries to develop \ncapabilities that can defeat our systems.\n  I don't believe anyone wants to reveal information that might \ncompromise our security. We should not share information on targets and \ncountermeasures with the likes of Iran, Iraq, and North Korea.\n  I fully concur with those who believe that Congress should have \naccess to all relevant information related to missile dense tests. MDA \nhas assured me that it will provide us with this information. All \nmembers, and staff with appropriate clearances, will have access to \nthis information. Indeed, staff received classified information related \nto targets and countermeasures prior to the last long-range missile \ndefense test.\n  To those who suggest that this move is designed to disguise or hide \nmissile defense test failures, I would note that test successes or \nfailures really can't be hidden.\n  Congress will have access to all the information, classified or \notherwise. Not all information will be classified. it will be clear to \nthe public whether the interceptor hit the target or not. \nClassification may actually make it harder for MDA to demonstrate \nsuccess to the public because it can't make details of the test public. \nDetails of almost all military tests are classified. Have we ever \nexplained to our adversaries how to defeat stealth technologies? Why \nwould we do so with missile defense technology?\n  The decision to classify this information meets the criteria of \nExecutive order 12958 that guides all DOD agencies in decisions on \nthese matters. This executive order notes that information can be \nclassified if it relates to ``military plans, weapons systems, or \noperations'' and ``vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems. . . . \nrelating to the national security''; or if release of the information \ncould reasonably be expected to ``reveal information that would assist \nin the development or use of weapons of mass destruction.''\n  I believe MDA countermeasures and targets information qualifies in \nall three categories.\n  Is classification premature? I don't think so. We hope to have early \nmissile defense capabilities in the field in the not too distant \nfuture. These capabilities will be based on test assets. Publicly \nrevealing the weaknesses of our test systems to our adversaries simply \ndoesn't make any sense.\n  At this time, I would also like to make a few more points regarding \nthe original cuts made by the Majority to the missile defense programs.\n  While I am very happy that the $814 million cut was restored by the \nWarner/Allard amendment, I am concerned that there is confusion that \nthe second degree amendment in some way reflects that this Senate \nbelieves that the President does not have the flexibility to spend the \nmoney as he fits between missile defense and counter-terrorism. As a \nmatter of fact, according to the Office of Management and Budget, as \nwell as the chairman, the second\n\n[[Page S6210]]\n\ndegree amendment does not preclude the President from deciding where to \nspend the money--missile defense or counter-terrorism. And that is \ncertainly my understanding, as well as the ranking member of the Armed \nService Committee.\n  One of the major criticisms stated by the majority is the expenditure \nrates for Ballistic Missile Defense projects, particularly the rate of \nexpenditure in the BMD System program element.\n  The Missile Defense Agency is attempting to develop a single \nintegrated ballistic missile defense system capable of attacking \nmissiles of varying ranges in all phases of flight and defeating \nmissiles of all ranges.\n  Thus MDA has shifted from an element-centric approach with a focus on \nTHAAD, PAC-3, NTW, NMD etc., to a system-centric approach that knits \neach of the elements into an integrated whole. The goal is to develop a \nseamless took-kit of sensors, shooters, platforms battle management, \nand command and control assets that function as a single integrated BMD \nsystem.\n  Critical to this refocusing are integration efforts to tie disparate \nBMD projects into a coordinated whole. The BMD System program element \nis key to success in the endeavor.\n  But the chairman seems to argue that some funding will be left over \nat the end of fiscal year 2002 and thus not all the funding requested \nfor fiscal year 2003 will be needed.\n  I strongly disagree and several points need to be made.\n  The 2002 budget was approved late. The FY 2002 defense authorization \nact wasn't signed until January of this year, at the end of the first \nquarter of the fiscal year. MDA projects--and all other DOD projects--\nwere late in getting FY 2002 funds.\n  The expenditures that the chairman cited are already out of date. The \nfigures he used were the expenditure figures from March 31, less than \nthree months after MDA started receiving 2002 funds. The figure updated \nfor the end of April is already about $100 million.\n  The end of year expenditure projection for this program element is \nabout half the funds appropriated. More than 90 percent will be \nobligated. These figures are well within expected ranges.\n  I have the Missile Defense Agency projections for all their major \nproject activities. All appear to be within expected ranges.\n  It is also very important to remember that the funding request in the \nBMD System program element is all R money. R funding is available \nfor obligation for two years and available for expenditure until \ndisbursed or rescinded. Congress provides extended availability for R \nfunding specifically to help assure funding stability and planning and \ncontractual flexibility.\n  If we accept the argument that we can cut funding in this program \nelement because MDA will have Fiscal Year 02 funds left over, we have \nto accept the argument that the whole rationale for providing extended \navailability for R funding is flawed. We may as well go ahead and cut \nall R programs that have any funding left over from the previous \nyear.\n  I don't think any one believes we should do that.\n  Citing an outdated expenditure figure for this program element so \nearly in the fiscal year is simply misleading and I believe misguided.\n  Another concern I had with the Majority's cuts was the $147 million \nreduction in program operations. This reduction may sound mundane but \nis critical to the success of the programs.\n  The majority has justified the cuts on grounds that the funding is \nredundant and excessive. The committee report notes that program \noperations are adequately funded in each Missile Defense Agency project \nand the program operations funds justified in separate lines in each \nprogram element simply aren't needed. So the Armed Services Committee \nbill cuts each and every one of these funding lines.\n  But this justification is simply wrong. It is simply mistaken to \nstate that the funding for program operation is redundant to funding \nelsewhere in the MDA budget. Not only is it mistaken, this funding \nreduction is extraordinarily damaging to the Missile Defense Agency.\n  What are ``program operations?'' Program operations are people. They \nprovide the basic support for any program. They provide information \ntechnology support--the computer support people. They provide \ncommunications support. They provide security. They provide contract \nsupport. They support basic infrastructure and facilities.\n  It is true that this work is done at the project level. The THAAD \nproject funds program operations unique to the THAAD project. Each MDA \nprojects fund program operations unique to that project.\n  But the simple fact is that the program operations funds in each \nproject are not used for same purposes as the funds that have been cut \nin Armed Services Committee bill. The funds cut by the Committee bill \nare not for activities unique to any particular project. They are for \ncommon program support.\n  The funds identified in the MDA budget for program operations will be \nused to support government and contractors for common program support \nat Missile Defense Agency Headquarters and for the service executive \nagents for missile defense programs. The Missile Defense Agency is \nrequired by law--Section 251 (d) of the Fiscal Year 1996 National \nDefense Authorization Act to request these funds in separate program \nelements.\n  This bill cuts almost all of this funding--$147 million of $185 \nmillion requested, or nearly 80 percent.\n  What does this cut do?\n  This reduction cuts nearly 1,000 people who provide basic support for \nMissile Defense Agency projects and activities. Army Space and Missile \nDefense Command will lose almost 400 people. The Army Program Executive \nOffice for Air and Missile Defense will lose another 60. Missile \nDefense Agency Headquarters will lose around 400. The Navy and Air \nForce will lose about 75.\n  Heres how MDA describes the impact:\n\n       The majority of Army SMDC and Army PEO-AMD staffs would be \n     eliminated.\n       Air Force and Navy organizations responsible for \n     centralized management and/or sharing of common program \n     management costs would be eliminated.\n       All contract support at MDA for program operations would be \n     eliminated; computer center and thus computers shut down; no \n     security (technical or physical), no staffing for supply/mail \n     room, cleaning, and facility maintenance; no contractor \n     support for common acquisition management functions performed \n     by MDA, e.g. contracting, financial management, cost \n     estimating, human resources.\n\n  That is an incredible hit on any organization.\n  Could MDA recover by redirecting funds to cover these functions? If \nthese cuts survive the process, MDA would have to move money into \nactivities in direct contravention of Congressional intent which is \nusually a pretty bad idea.\n  But even if MDA were to try use project funds to perform these \nprogram-wide activities, the agency would be in the position of trying \nto use new people to do many of these jobs. The Missile Defense Agency \nsimply could not do this in anything approaching a timely manner. \nConsider contracting support. The whole thrust of the missile defense \nprogram has changed, moving toward a single integrated missile defense \nsystem and away from autonomous ``stove-piped'' systems. This will \ninevitably mean contract changes as the architecture evolves. Yet MDA's \ninstitutional memory would have been surgically excised by this \nreduction at precisely the time it is needed most. So MDA would take a \ndouble hit--a cut to project funds to pay for program operations, and \ninefficient and ineffective program operations because all the people \nwho did that job will have been fired.\n  The 80 percent reduction to program operation is just one example of \nhow damaging the missile defense reductions in this bill. It is \ninconsistent with good management, current law, and common sense. I \ncannot say if the majority simply erred in this reduction, or if the \nintent was to cripple the organization.\n  Another program that was it hard by the majority's missile defense \ncuts deals with countermeasures--which for me makes these cuts even \nmore surprising.\n  Many critics on the majority side have argued that simply \ncountermeasures can render missile defenses ineffective. They have \ncriticized missile defense technology and testing as too simple, and \nnot sensitive enough to the measures our enemies might take\n\n[[Page S6211]]\n\nto defeat our defenses. The former Director of Operational Test and \nEvaluation Phil Coyle used to make this argument in his official \ncapacity and had many recommendations about how to improve what he saw \nas deficiencies. The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee \njust recently repeated the view that simply countermeasures may be able \nto defeat missile defenses.\n  The Missile Defense Agency agreed that countermeasures represent a \nsignificant challenge, and has structured a significant part of its \nprogram to meet this challenge. Here's what they have done:\n  MDA moved from an architecture that relied very heavily on \nintercepting enemy missiles and warheads in their terminal phase, the \nfinal phase of flight as these weapons approach their target, to an \narchitecture that seeks to intercept missiles and warheads in all \nphases flight-boost phase right after launch, and midcourse as the \nmissiles and warheads fly ballistically toward their target as well as \nterminal phase. Countermeasures to defenses in any one phase of flight \nare greatly complicated by attacking missiles in all phases of flight.\n\n  MDA initiated technology efforts in the midcourse defense segment to \ndevelop counter-countermeasures and advanced kill vehicles to defeat \ncountermeasures that our adversaries may develop or deploy.\n  MDA initiated a ``Red, White, and Blue'' team and a process to \nobjectively assess the types of countermeasures that might be developed \nand deployed and the countermeasures that could be developed to counter \nthem. The Red team assesses the likelihood and technical feasibility \nand effectiveness of various countermeasures; the Blue team assesses \nways to defeat the countermeasures and does basic technical work to \nproduce the counter-countermeasures; and the White team is the referee \nto make sure that proposals and assessments from the Red and Blue teams \nare fair.\n  Given the concerns expressed by our majority about the ability of \nadversaries to produce countermeasures that defeat our defenses, you \nwould thank that these efforts would among those receiving the \nstrongest support in this bill. If you thought that, you would be \nwrong. This bill decimates each of these approaches.\n  The bill makes extraordinarily deep reductions in boost phase \nintercept projects. The Airborne Laser program--cut by about a \nquarter--there is almost no funding for anything beyond the first \nprototype aircraft. Funding for space-based kinetic boost phase \ninterceptors is eliminated. Funding for sea-based boost phase \ninterceptors is eliminated. Space-based laser? That was killed last \nyear. And the bill makes a $52 million reduction to Navy mid-course \nmissile defense, and concept development and risk reduction effort to \nproduce Navy missile defenses against medium, intermediate, and long-\nrange missiles.\n  The bill cuts all the funding--100 percent of the funding--for the \nnext generation kill vehicle and midcourse counter-countermeasures. \nThis leaves the midcourse segment with no follow-on technology to \ndefeat any advanced countermeasures our adversaries might develop or \nobtain and then deploy.\n  The bill cuts almost half of the funding for the Red, White and Blue \nteam. This reduction is part of the 2/3 reduction to Ballistic Missile \nDefense System program element. A key project in that program element \nis system engineering and analysis. That's where the Red, White and \nBlue team is funded. This bill decimates this key effort.\n  These reductions severely damage the effort to defeat BMD \ncountermeasures--an effort that everyone-Republicans, Democrats, MDA, \nand missile defense critics--believes is critical. The rationale for \nthese reductions, to be charitable, is unclear.\n  Let me end my statement by summarizing some of the majority's \narguments which we have heard during the course of this debate.\n  First, funding is not adequately justified or unclear what product \nwill be provided.\n  Not true.\n  The committee has received hundreds of pages of justification which \ndescribes in tremendous detail activities and products in each program \nelement. I admit that not all of the detail was available at the \nbeginning of the budget cycle because the National Team--which plans \nthe activities--was just standing up. It is all available now.\n  Many of these important activities and products included in System \nEngineering & Integration are: concept development and system \narchitecture; trade studies and analysis; functional allocation; BMD \nelement (e.g. PAC-3, ABL, THAAD) specifications; verification of text \nobjectives; engineering process controls; configuration management; \ninterface specification; architecture definition; threat databases; \nmodeling and simulation; test infrastructure and target requirement \ndefinition; schedule baseline; specialty engineering; and data \nmanagement.\n  For Battle Management/Command and Control these activities include: \ndefinition of intelligence and sensor inputs; specifications; \ndefinition of interfaces; mission planning across BMD elements BM/C2 \ntest planning, assessments BM/C2 system performance BM/C20T plans; \nBM/D2 transition plans; order of battle definition communications \narchitecture message definition and formats network management \ninformation assurance wargaming support; and BM/C2 verification and \ntest.\n  Here is an example of some of these activities:\n  System and element capability specification: $17.8 million.\n  Description: The system capability specifications provide design \nrequirements for system integrators and element contractors to use in \ndevelopment and testing. It enables contractors to understand the \ncontext in which they are designing elements and to be more innovative \nin ensuring that their element meets its requirements and milestones in \nthe BMD system. The system capability specification document describes \nthe BMD system in terms of functions and performance based \ncapabilities, shows the allocation of those capabilities the elements \nin the BMD system, and identifies methods to verify those capabilities \nat the system level. Element and component capability specifications \ndocuments describe the functions and capabilities of BMD system \nelements and components as they are allocated in the systems \ncapabilities specifications. For new elements these documents may \nprovide a very complete description of functions and capabilities and \nallocations to major subsystems. For existing elements, the documents \nmay be higher level and might serve as the basis for engineering change \nproposals to bring the element into compliance with BMD system \nallocations and specifications. These documents are reviewed quarterly \nand updated annually.\n  The committee got over 100 pages of similar material describing these \nactivities in a minute detail.\n  The second argument is that the funding is redundant.\n  Again, not true.\n  There is a semantic problem in considering ``system engineering.'' \nSystem engineering takes place at the system level and the at the \nelement level. The system level effort integrates all the disparate \nelements into a seamless whole. At the element level--or perhaps we \nwould better call this ``element engineering''--provides for \nintegration between the parts of an element. For example, the THAAD \nprogram spends about 10 percent of its funding on ``system \nengineering'' to assure that the THAAD components-radar, missile, \nlauncher, BMC2--work together seamlessly.\n  This is not the same work that is being done at the BMD system level. \nThe system engineering and integration across elements of the BMD \nsystem is being done at a much more detailed level and more \nsystemtically than in the past. This is new or expanded work. On reason \nthis work hasn't been done so much is the past is because of the former \nABM Treaty constraints.\n  A third argument is that the funding is premature.\n  Once again, not true.\n  Much of this work has not been done before. It is needed to implement \nthe new concept of missile defense as a single integrated system. If \nthis work isn't started and can't continue now--the effectiveness of \nall missile defense systems will be degraded; deployment of effective \nmissile defense will be delayed; costs will increase, since each \nelement will have to ``carry more of the load'' and element-centric \nwork\n\n[[Page S6212]]\n\nwill have to be redone later to make it compatible with a single \nintegrated system. The start or expansion of this work coincides with \nestablishment and stand-up of the National Team.\n  As I mentioned earlier but I believe is important to reiterate, it \nhas also been argued that some funding will be left over at the end of \nfiscal year 2002 and thus not all the funding requested for fiscal year \n2003 will be needed. Although the 2002 budget was approved late, the \nobligation and expenditure rate in System Engineerring and Integration \nis well within expected ranges.\n  The funding request is all R money. R funding is available for \nobligation for two years and available for expenditure until disbursed \nor rescinded. Congress provides extended availability for R funding \nto help asure funding stabililty and planning and contractual \nflexibility.\n  If we accept the argument that we can cut funding in this program \nelement because MDA will FY 02 funds left over, we have to accept the \nargument that the whole rationale for providing extended availability \nfor R funding is flawed. We may as well go ahead and cut all R \nprograms that have any funding left over from the previous year.\n  Fourth, that the funding is excessive.\n  Once again, not true.\n  MDA's BMD system level engineering and integration funding request, \nat 2 percent of the MDA budget of the budget, is modest.\n  Standard text (Essentials of Project and Systems Engineering \nManagement) estimates requested resources for systems engineering to be \n4-8 percent of total project cost. Costs tend to be higher for \ncomplicated projects.\n  MDA's system and element level engineering and integration funding is \nlow compared to other programs.\n  What other programs spend on system engineering:\n  V-22--7.2 percent.\n  B-1b--14.3 percent.\n  V-22 (Marine)--11.5 percent.\n  F-22--5.5 percent.\n  E-3A AWACS--13 percent.\n  Safeguard--16 percent.\n  Patriot--19 percent.\n  E-4 Airborne Command post--12 percent.\n  Pershing II--21 percent.\n  JTIDS--12 percent.\n  Here's what Ballistic Missile Defense spends on system engineering:\n  Ground-based Midcourse--6.9 percent.\n  THAAD (03)--10 percent.\n  BMDS SE percent.\n  These figures are not at all out of line with other complex DOD \nprograms. The BMDS systems engineering funding is low by comarison-\nparticularly given that we haven't done this mission before. This \nmission is almost uniquely complex.\n  In conclusion--the BMDS funding reductions aim at the heart of what \nMDA is trying to do and how MDA is trying to do it. I believe the \nfunding reductions are completely unjustified and I am glad we made \nsome progress in getting these very important missile defense programs \nback on track.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to thank the managers of \nthe bill, Senators Levin and Warner, for not including proposals that \nthe Administration has put forward that would undermine many of our \nenvironmental laws, in either the legislation that was reported by the \nArmed Services Committee and the final legislation that we are voting \non today. I would also like to make clear my continuing concern with \nthese proposals and my opposition to any efforts to include them in \nconference on the DoD authorization bill.\n  Title XII of the administration's National Defense Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 2003 contains several provisions that not only fall \nwithin the jurisdiction of the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks, which I chair, but proposes changes to our environmental laws \nthat are unnecessary, broad, and--judging from the volume of mail I \nalready have received--very controversial. The administration contends \nthat these changes are needed for military readiness and training. \nHowever, it has not been demonstrated that is the case.\n  One provision could permanently extend the timeline for DoD's \nconformity analysis, required under the Clean Air Act, by 3 years for \nall activities broadly referred to as military readiness activities, \nwithout regard to whether there is a national security emergency or \nother need for such an extension.\n  Another provision attempts to permanently exempt the DoD from broad \naspects of Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, RCRA, regulation and \ncleanup. The proposal significantly changes the definition of ``solid \nwaste,'' the crux of the RCRA statute. The proposal would exempt \nmunitions that were deposited, incident to their normal and expected \nuse on an operational range. The proposal also may exempt munitions \nwastes that remain after the range becomes ``non-operational'' a term \nnot found in environmental law--prohibiting EPA and preempting the \nstates from regulating the cleanup of the vast majority of unexploded \nordnance, explosives and related materials that contaminate closed, \ntransferring and transferred training ranges.\n  By exempting munitions-related materials from RCRA, the proposal \ncould prohibit EPA and states from acting to address munitions-related \nenvironmental contamination that is not on a range at all, but has \nmigrated from the range entirely off-site. The exemption also extends \nto any facility--not just training ranges--with munitions-type waste, \nwhich may include plants that manufacture explosives and other \nmanufacturing facilities run by defense contractors. It is possible \nthat the exemption also would extend to waste streams from the \nmanufacture of explosives since the exemption covers ``constituents.''\n  The proposal also provides exemptions from the Comprehensive \nEnvironmental Response Compensation and Liability Act or Superfund. \n``Explosives unexploded ordnance, munitions, munition fragments or \nconstituents thereof'' would be permanently exempted from the \ndefinition of ``release'' under Superfund. In addition, because the \ndefinition of ``solid waste'' under RCRA triggers coverage as a \n``hazardous waste'' under Superfund, the broad RCRA exemption would \nexempt munitions waste from regulation, ie., cleanup, under Superfund. \nThis could similarly tie the hands of the states to compel cleanup.\n  By affecting the definition of ``hazardous substance,'' the proposal \nmay preclude states and natural resources trustees from pursuing \nrestoration of areas contaminated by munitions waste--this affects the \n``natural resource damages'' section of the Superfund law. The proposal \nalso may eliminate authority under section 104 of the Superfund law to \nclean up a release or respond to substantial threat of a release of \nhazardous substances on training ranges--and, as discussed above, \npossibly off-site and at manufacturing facilities as well.\n\n  The proposal would exempt the Department of Defense from the \nrequirement of the Endangered Species Act of designating critical \nhabitat on all ``lands, or other geographical areas, owned or \ncontrolled by the Department, or designated for its use'' if an \nIntegrated Natural Resources Management Plan--INRMP--has been developed \npursuant to the Sikes Act. The Sikes Act requires military \ninstallations to prepare plans that integrate the protection of natural \nresources on military lands with the use of military lands for military \ntraining. If the Fish and Wildlife Service determines that the plan \n``addresses special management consideration or protection,'' they can \ndecide not to designate critical habitat. Although the Service in the \npast has excluded some bases from critical habitat designation based on \nan INRMP, in numerous other decisions, the Service has expressly found \nthat an INRMP would not provide adequate protection in lieu of critical \nhabitat designation.\n  Under the Endangered Species Act, the Service is required to consider \n``the impact on national security'' when designating critical habitat. \nThis proposal would preclude the Service from designating critical \nhabitat if an INRMP has been completed.\n  The proposal would authorize military readiness activities under the \nMigratory Bird Treaty Act--MBTA--without further action by the \nSecretary of the Interior. It would exempt the DOD from the \nrequirement, applicable to everyone else and founded on treaties \nbetween the United States and Canada, Mexico, Russia, and Japan, that \nthey obtain a permit from the Fish and Wildlife Service before killing \nmigratory birds or destroying their\n\n[[Page S6213]]\n\neggs. Such action could be carried out without any assessment of \nbiological impact, effort to mitigate or seek alternatives, oversight \nor accountability.\n  In March of 2002, a court ruled that the MBTA applied to training \nactivities at the Farallon de Medinilla range in the Western Pacific \nand enjoined the Navy from continuing the bombing activities there. The \nNavy has applied for a special purpose permit under the MBTA allowing \nfor incidental take and are completing the biological justification. \nWhile the MBTA does not have an exemption for national security, it \ndoes provide for permits to be issued if the urgency of the training is \ndetermined by the Secretary of the Interior to be compelling \njustification and there can be compensation for the biological benefits \nof birds that may be taken.\n  It is my hope that during the conference with the House on this \nlegislation, the provisions in the House bill amending the Endangered \nSpecies Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act be deleted. The Committee \non Environment and Public Works is the appropriate committee to examine \nthe need for any such environmental legislation and to act upon any \nsuch legislation.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have serious concerns about the amendments \nthat have just been adopted to add $814 million to either missile \ndefense funding or combating terrorism. We have heard a day and a half \nof debate on these amendments, which relate to one of the great issues \nof our national defense policy. I am stunned that these important \namendments were accepted without a rollcall vote.\n  My concern with these amendments are numerous. The supposed offset \nfor these additional funds is, at the moment, nothing more than a work \nof fiction. Supposedly, the Office of Management and Budget, in its \nmid-session review of the budget, will revise downward its estimate of \nthe inflation rate. Not only is this report yet to be released, but \nalso we are making budget decisions based upon projections that may or \nmay not pan out.\n  In addition, the amendments backtrack on cuts in the missile defense \nprogram made by the Armed Services Committee. As a member of that \ncommittee, I think that we made the right choices on trimming a missile \ndefense budget request that was far too large to support a program that \nremains in an elementary phrase. By pouring so much money so quickly \ninto missile defense programs, we are only encouraging a rush to \nfailure. I am especially alarmed that these amendments allow for more \nmissile defense funding at a time when the programs are becoming \nincreasingly shrouded in secrecy, as if the Pentagon wishes to stifle \npublic debate about the utility and effectiveness of anti-missile \nsystems.\n  The amendments leave the decision about whether to use $814 million \nfor missile defense or for combating terrorism entirely to the \nPresident. There is an alarming trend in Congress to simply delegate \nthe decisions on many important issues to the Chief Executive. The \nPresident is the Commander-in-Chief of the military, but the \nConstitution charges Congress with the authority to ``raise and support \narmies'' and to ``provide and maintain a navy.'' The Founding Fathers \nof this country clearly intended to have Congress determine how the \nfunds intended for our national defense would be allocated.\n  The amendments adopted today delegate, from the Congress to the \nPresident, the decision of how to use $814 million. It is an advoidance \nof our constitutional responsibilities. The amendment offered by the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee establishes the top priority \nfor these funds to be used for combating terrorism at home and abroad, \nbut I have no idea for what purposes these funds could be used. I do \nnot know whether I would have supported this amendment, but it is \nprofoundly disappointing that Senators did not have the opportunity to \ncast their vote on this proposal.\n  I had even greater concerns about the underlying amendment, offered \nby the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee. As I said \nbefore, I question the source of the $814 million, the potential for \nthe funds to restore the well-justified cuts in missile defense \nprograms, and its delegation to the President of an important decision \non the funding of our military. But again, I did not have the \nopportunity to register my vote.\n  I hope that my colleagues would take a more careful look at what \npowers we invest in the President. We should also take a look at how we \ndispose of such important business as increasing the missile defense \nbudget by $814 million. We must never allow ourselves to be absolved of \nour constitutional responsibilities to decide and vote on matters of \nsuch great importance.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman and \nranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee for their \nassistance and support in authorizing funding for a military \nconstruction project of critical importance to the State of Tennessee \nand the United States. I also thank the skilled staff members on the \nSenate Armed Services Committee who assisted this action: George \nLauffer and Michael McCord.\n  The amendment in question was advanced by Fred Thompson and I to \nauthorize $8.4 million in funding for the construction of a Composite \nAircraft Maintenance Complex at Berry Field Guard Base in Nashville, \nTN. This important project is vital to the combat readiness for the \n118th Air Wing of the Tennessee Air National Guard. Currently, the \n118th is housed in a variety of substandard buildings, some of which \nare more than 40 years old. This collection of buildings encroaches \nupon the aircraft clear zone making it difficult for personnel to work \nand drill, impeding combat readiness and jeopardizing aircraft safety. \nAircraft cannot be moved into hangars properly or left on jacks due to \nwind conditions. All of these problems combine to create significant \nsafety problems and increase the amount of time it takes to repair \ndamaged aircraft. In addition, the 118th needs nine airfield waivers to \noperate and continue its mission. By constructing this new complex, \nseveral of those waivers will be eliminated and the base will be a \nsafer and more efficient place to accomplish its vital mission.\n  I would like my colleagues to know that the 118th played a vital role \nin the immediate response to the 9-11 tragedy and continues to \ncontribute importantly to the ongoing national security needs of the \ncountry. One item of human interest occurred within an hour after the \nWorld Trade Center was attacked by terrorists and all of the Nation's \naircraft were grounded by the President. The 118th was called and given \napproval to fly a donated liver from Nashville to a little girl in \nHouston, TX. At that time, only three non-fighter aircraft were in the \nair over the United States--Air Force One, its supporting tanker, and a \nlone C-130 from the 118th. In the shadow of thousands of people killed \nin New York City that day, the 118th had the privilege of helping to \nsave a life.\n  In the weeks after September 11, the 118th was given numerous alert \nmissions requiring Tennessee Air Guardsmen to be on call 24 hours a \nday, 7 days a week. The aircraft and maintenance personnel were \nsleeping in an old converted aircraft hangar at night and prepared to \nfly anywhere at any time.\n  Early in the month of October 2001, the 118th was again called for an \nextremely vital mission of National Security and Homeland Security \nSupport. The 118th was one of only five C-130 units deployed for \nOperation Noble Eagle-QRF (Quick Reaction Force). Their mission was to \ndeploy as soon as possible to a forward base, and be ready for 24/7 \noperations with a 1-hour alert call out. The 118th proudly performed \nthis mission faster and better than any other Air National Guard, Air \nForce Reserve, or Active Duty unit. Within 22 hours of notification, \nthe 118th had aircraft in the air moving forward, and was the sole C-\n130 unit operationally ready at the 48-hour mark.\n  Over the next 4 months--between October 2001 and February 2002--the \n118th became the standard to which other units trained in relation to \nthe QRF. The 118th maintained operational readiness with one-third of \nthe unit deployed, and still preserved exceptionally high training \nstandards at home station.\n  To date, the 118th has activated more than 340 individuals to support \nthe worldwide mission. The unit is currently supporting Air Mobility \nCommand with 33 percent of its aircraft on a daily basis flying active \nduty missions. Back at home station, Command and Control has been \noperating 24/7\n\n[[Page S6214]]\n\never since September 11. The 118th Command Post and Crisis Action Team \nhave played a critical role in the direction and guidance of the unit's \nresponse to every assignment and emergency that has arisen. The base \nmedical department, normally two full-time people, has increased to 13 \nin order to support the increasing number of wing personnel now on \nactive duty.\n  In conclusion, on behalf of the men and women of the 118th Airlift \nWing, Senator Thompson and myself, I would like to thank the chairman, \nranking member, and our Senate colleagues for authorizing this \nimportant funding.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the Senate returned yesterday to an issue \nwhich, in recent years, has polarized our debate on national security \nand foreign policy. An amendment proposed by Senator Warner allowed the \nPresident to add $814 million to the research and development budget \nfor missile defense, money that was not recommended by the Armed \nServices Committee.\n  It also provided the President the authority to allocate these funds \nto ``antiterrorism'' projects, but I have no reason to believe the \nPresident would choose this latter option.\n  Senator Warner's amendment was passed with a second-degree amendment \nby Senator Levin that emphasized that combating terrorism should be the \ntop priority for the use of these funds, although the President could \nstill allocate the entire $814 million to missile defense activities.\n  It has been my hope that the formal U.S. withdrawal from the Anti-\nBallistic Missile Treaty, an event which took place less than 2 weeks \nago, would emerge as a real turning point in the debate over national \nmissile defense. From this point forward, I fervently wish that \nofficials of all stripes--executive and legislative, Democratic and \nRepublican--will be freed to evaluate missile defense as we would any \nother major defense initiative.\n  The touchstone for evaluating any missile defense must be the test \nthat the American people sent us here to propound: Will this program \nmake the United States more secure, or less so? Will national missile \ndefense be operationally effective under real-world conditions, or will \nit remain a system that no commander can rely on?\n  Yesterday's passage of the Warner amendment was not a final decision \non the future of national missile defense, nor was it a referendum on \nthe President's decision to withdraw from the ABM Treaty. Even if the \namendment had fallen, the Senate would still have authorized $6.8 \nbillion in fiscal year 2003 on missile defense activities, a \nsignificant sum of money of any measure.\n  The proponents of the Warner amendment contended that an $814 million \nreduction in an administration request totaling $7.6 billion would \nseriously hamper our Nation's efforts to move forward on missile \ndefense. Let's take a closer look at a couple of these reductions \nproposed by the Armed Services Committee:\n  A cut of $200 million for a number of overhead activities, variously \ndescribed as ``Program Operations'' or ``Systems Engineering and \nIntegration,'' which are repeated multiple times in the \nadministration's budget request. The administration cited this \nparticular cut as an attempt by missile defense opponents to block the \neffective integration of missile defense components.\n  Despite repeated requests by the Armed Services Committee, however, \nthe Missile Defense Agency never justified these duplicative requests \nor explained how they would fit together to enhance system integration.\n  A reduction of $30 million, requested by the administration for the \npurchase of a second Airborne Laser prototype aircraft. However, the \nPentagon does not plan to test the first Airborne laser aircraft until \nfiscal year 2005. Doesn't it make sense to delay the purchase of a \nsecond model until you get some feedback from the testing of the \ninitial model? After all, there are real questions regarding payload \nand beam stability in bad weither, which relate as much to the aircraft \nas to the laser.\n  Contrary to what missile defense advocates contended, the Armed \nServices Committee did not set out to destroy our national missile \ndefense effort. If that has been their intention the committee would \nhave cut far more than $814 million in a $7.6 billion budget.\n  This debate was also over priorities. How should the United States \nspend an extra national defense dollar: On missile defense or on other \nmore pressing needs? In my view, when we consider underfunded \nantiterrorism missions, one stands out above the beyond the others.\n  Our first line of defense in today's world should be to ensure that \nrogue states and terrorists never obtain weapons of mass destruction or \nthe materials needed to make them. We spend between $1 and $2 billion a \nyear toward this goal. We are nowhere close to the levels recommended \nby numerous outside experts, including the bipartisan task force headed \nby Howard Baker and Lloyd Cutler a year ago, which advocated spending \napproximately $3 billion per year.\n  The committee's original reduction would still have provided funding \nfor our missile defense efforts that was four to six times what we \nspend on threat reduction programs. Putting aside the overall merits of \nnational missile defense, I ask one simple question: Why can't we show \nthe same sense of urgency and offer the same level of resources in \ncombating the more immediate risk to a more anonymous nuclear weapon \ndelivered without a ballistic missile, but hidden in the hull of a ship \nor smuggled in the trunk of a compact car?\n  Were this any other weapons system but national missile defense, I \ndoubt the Senate would have amended such a modest and sensible \ncommittee-recommended funding reduction. Major weapons programs often \nencounter problems. My friends on the Armed Services Committee are all \ntoo familiar with unpredictable testing schedules, skyrocketing \nbudgets, and the need to maintain effective oversight with respect to \nall weapons programs. And so it is with national missile defense.\n  The Armed Services Committee recommended some judicious cuts in \nmissile defense funding on account of a lack of clarity and a lack of \njustification by administration officials. I believe the Senate should \nhave rejected the Warner amendment.\n  Neither could I support the Levin second-degree amendment. I \nunderstood the chairman's intentions--to send a clear message that this \nbody views antiterrorism missions as the greatest priority for our \nNation.\n  He was absolutely right--that is our No. 1 priority. But the second-\ndegree amendment still enabled the President to dedicate some, or even \nall, of the additional $814 million towards missile defense.\n  The administration did not prove the case for additional funding for \nmissile defense beyond the $6.8 billion recommended by the Armed \nServices Committee. Our Nation faces too many threats for which we are \nnot adequately prepared, to justify spending this additional funding on \nmissile defense.\n  Regardless of what each of us may think or believe on national \nmissile defense, it does not deserve an exemption from the basic \nprinciples of rational budgeting and honest oversight which govern \nevery other Pentagon acquisition program.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concerns about \nthe serious wilderness and public lands management problems created by \ntitle XIV of the House version of the Defense Authorization Act. This \nprovision was added in the chairman's mark at the behest of \nRepresentative Jim Hansen. Title XIV would profoundly impact land \nmanagement of nearly 11 million acres of non-military public lands \nfalling underneath the Utah Test and Training Range airspace in western \nUtah.\n  No hearings were held in either the House or Senate to consider the \npossible consequences of the sweeping and controversial provisions in \ntitle XIV. While the House Resource and Senate Energy Committees would \nbe appropriate venues for such hearings, hearings were not held in \nthese committees, and they were not held in the House or Senate Armed \nServices Committees. No General Accounting Office or Department of \nDefense report has ever demonstrated the need for the provisions \ncontained in title XIV. The Department of Defense has never requested \nthe kind of control over nonmilitary public land mandated by the \nprovisions in title XIV.\n\n[[Page S6215]]\n\n  In truth, title XIV is an attack without justification on the \ntraditional management of wilderness and other nonmilitary public \nlands.\n  I wish to add my voice to the voices of Representative Ike Skelton \nand 19 other House Democrats serving on the Armed Services Committee \nwho noted in the committee report that:\n  ``The military use language of title XIV is unprecedented and not \nfound in any other law. Ironically, these provisions set a standard for \nwilderness management that would provide less protection to the \nwilderness areas designated by title XIV than the protections available \nto non-designated public lands. Millions of acres of designated \nwilderness and millions more acres of public land underlie military \nairspace across the United States. None of these lands have or need the \nrestrictive language that title XIV would apply to wilderness and \npublic lands in Utah.\n  ``Language in title XIV would strip the authority of the Secretary of \nthe Interior to determine where and whether facilities and equipment \nare placed on public lands within wilderness areas. Another provision \nallows the Secretary of the Air Force to unilaterally close or restrict \naccess to wilderness and WSAs outside the boundaries of the UTTR and \nthe Dugway Proving Grounds. These provisions are unprecedented, and no \nclear rationale has been given to warrant this change from existing \nlaw. Moreover, title XIV creates a different standard for access and \nmilitary use for land in Utah than is applicable to all other public \nland areas of the United States.\n  ``Furthermore, title XIV requires the Secretary of the Interior to \ngain the prior concurrence of the Secretary of the Air Force and the \ncommander-in-chief of the military forces of the State of Utah before \ndeveloping, maintaining, or revising land use plans required by Federal \nlaw for millions of acres of public lands in Utah. Is it unwise policy, \nto say the least, for a Cabinet secretary's role to be subordinate to a \nservice secretary and a state military commanders.''\n  Taken together, the provisions in title XIV go far beyond any \nlanguage ever included in enacted wilderness legislation, they put in \nplace unprecedented high levels of Department of Defense control for \nall nonmilitary public lands falling underneath the airspace of the \nUtah test and Training Range, and they designate as wilderness, albeit \nwilderness in name only, merely a small portion of lands included in \nAmerica's Redrock Wilderness Act, S. 786, of which I am the lead \nsponsor.\n  I urge those Senators who will serve conferees on the Defense \nAuthorization Act to work for the removal of title XIV in conference.\n  I also would like to speak for a moment on two additional provisions \nwithin the Department of Defense authorization bill that passed out of \nthe House, HR 4546. These measures weaken protections for endangered \nspecies and migratory birds.\n  I would like to state for the record that there are existing \nprovisions that allow for case-by-case exemptions to address national \nsecurity interests. For example, section 7(j) of the Endangered Species \nAct, ESA, gives the Secretary of Defense the authority to secure an \nexemption from the ESA's provisions whenever the Secretary finds it \nnecessary for reasons of national security. Moreover, title 10 U.S.C. \n2014 specifically empowers the President to resolve any conflicts \nbetween the DOD and other executive agencies that affect training or \nreadiness. These waivers should be invoked on a case-by-case basis, \nrather than giving the DOD a blanket exemption to ignore laws that \nprotect the air and water in and around our military facilities, the \nhealth of the people who live on and nearby bases, and America's \nwildlife and public lands.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues who will serve on the conference for this \nbill to reject any permanent weakening of or permanent waivers enabling \nthe circumvention of our Nation's environment and public health laws.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I was proud to support the recent passage \nof S. 2514, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year \n2003. This bill continues to strengthen our military and is vital to \nthe war on terrorism.\n  This is the most important bill we have debated in the Senate all \nyear. The threats against us are real and I am pleased the Senate acted \nswiftly in passing this strong defense package. This bill authorizes \n$393.4 billion for national defense. That is $43 billion above the 2002 \nlevel, and the largest defense spending increase in over 20 years.\n  We are in this war against terrorism for the long haul and our \nincreased military funding is justified. We now have troops on the \nground in Afghanistan, the Philippines, and many other places we could \nnot have foreseen before September 11. Depending on what happens as we \nfight this war, we may have to deploy our troops elsewhere to contain \nand battle threats against our Nation and freedoms.\n  This bill focuses on five objectives for our national defense.\n  First, it improves the compensation and quality of life for our \nsoldiers, retirees and their families. For the fourth year in a row \nthis bill includes a 4.1 percent across the board pay raise for all \nmilitary personnel, with a targeted pay raise between 5.5 and 6.5 \npercent for mid-career personnel. A new assignment incentive pay of up \nto $1,500 per month is authorized to encourage personnel to volunteer \nfor hard-to-fill positions and assignments.\n  The bill rewards our retirees and disabled veterans. The bill \nauthorizes concurrent receipt of retired military pay and veterans' \ndisability compensation for all disabled military retirees eligible for \nnon-disability retirement.\n  For our troops with families, this bill increases the housing \nallowance, with the goal of eliminating average out-of-pocket housing \nexpenses by 2005. And on our installations, $640 million is being added \nabove the budget request to improve and replace facilities. This will \nhelp improve the housing, dining and recreation facilities for our \ntrainees and troops.\n  These quality of life issues boost the morale of our troops, and send \na strong signal that we in congress and across the Nation appreciate \ntheir defense of America and her freedoms.\n  Secondly, this bill also contains those necessary readiness funds to \nallow the services to conduct the full range of their assigned \nmissions. We have added $126 million for firing range enhancements so \nthat we can properly and effectively train our troops to fight and win.\n  And to show that defense is a top priority for our Nation, this bill \nauthorizes the administration's $10 billion request to cover the \noperating costs of the ongoing war on terrorism for next year. After \nspeaking with various military leaders and hearing their testimony \nbefore the Senate Armed Services Committee, we heard how important the \nissue of readiness is for every branch of the military today. This bill \naddresses this important issue by funding the most pressing shortfalls.\n  Third, in this bill we also address the goal of improving efficiency \nand increasing savings with DOD programs and operations. These savings \nwill allow us to redirect and focus on high-priority programs within \nthe DOD.\n  Some of these provisions include $400 million in anticipated savings \nby deferring spending on financial systems that would not be consistent \nwith those financial management systems available and used by non-\ngovernment entities. Soon we will have a system to better keep track of \nvaluable DOD and service funds. This brings not only savings, but \naccountability to the DOD and the services. Although the DOD's mission \nis more unique than any other Federal department, it is not immune to \nwasteful and duplicative spending which we often see in other Federal \ndepartments.\n  Furthermore, this bill holds a provision requiring the DOD to \nestablish new internal controls to address repeat problems with the \nabuse of credit cards we have seen for the purchase of non-essential \nand questionable travel spending by military and civilian personnel. \nAnd with the $393.4 billion we are authorizing in this bill, it is \nimperative now more than ever that we have a real sense of \naccountability for oversight reasons and for the sake of making sure we \nare giving the taxpayers the biggest bang for the buck. After all, this \nbill spends more than $1 billion a day on national defense activities. \nFor that price, the taxpayers should get their money's worth.\n  Fourth, this bill also helps our military meet more non-traditional\n\n[[Page S6216]]\n\nthreats. We increased funding for fighting these threats to help secure \nour nuclear weapons and materials at Department of Energy facilities, \nand defend against chemical and biological weapons and other weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  Finally, our Senate Armed Services Committee wanted to be sure that \nour military always stay on the cutting edge of new technologies and \nstrategies to meet the threats of the 21st century. Promoting and \nembracing transformation of our forces is not easy. But it is \nessential. This bill helps us to promote a new mind set for the future. \nI know it is tough to wean ourselves off of some of the legacy systems \nand structures in place in our armed forces. And I know that some in \nour armed forces are skeptical about change. But we have to begin to \nthink differently. The world is changing, and not necessarily for the \nbetter. Our military has to keep up with that change.\n  While I did vote for this bill in the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, I did not agree with the fact that it originally slashed \nmissile defense spending by just over $800 million. This drastically \naltered President Bush's national security strategy and made our Nation \nand allies more vulnerable to a possible missile attack.\n  But thankfully we found a way on the Senate floor during the bill's \nconsideration to move just over $800 million back to President Bush's \nmissile defense priorities to protect America. I was proud to cosponsor \nan amendment which fulfilled this obligation by using expected DOD \ninflationary savings and adjustments. This offset was responsible \nbecause it did not cut any other valuable DOD programs needed to \nstrengthen our military. And I was pleased that this was a bipartisan \neffort by the Senate with the amendment's unanimous acceptance.\n  But, thankfully this amendment was accepted. Without it, this vital \nbill was jeopardized. After all, Secretary Rumsfeld, in a letter to the \nSenate Armed Services Committee wrote, ``if the missile defense \nprovisions in the Senate Armed Services Committee's version of the bill \nwere to be adopted by Congress, I would recommend to the President that \nhe veto the Fiscal Year 2003 National Defense Authorization Act.'' So, \nits inclusion helped pave the way to an optimistic path to President \nBush's desk.\n  Finally, we have had a very intense debate about the Crusader \nArtillery System. I would like to note that while I supported the \ncompromise Levin amendment last week over the Crusader program, I \nremain concerned about our ability to effectively support our troops \nwith adequate fire support. Right now we are vastly under-gunned in \nartillery by some nations. Our own artillery systems could not even \nmeet our needs during the Gulf war more than a decade ago. And those \nsystems have not significantly changed since then.\n  The possibility of shifting funds from Crusader to other indirect \nfire weapons concerns me in that we are again delaying when we will \nactually deploy sufficient fire support to protect our armed forces. \nThe DOD hopes to speed up the deployment of these new technologies so \nthey would be available around the same time Crusader will be. I am \nconcerned about our ability to meet this time line.\n  Throwing money at a program does not necessarily mean you can \nmagically speed up its development. Some things just take time, and \nCrusader is a lot farther along in the development process than many of \nthese other technologies. I will be watching this process closely to \nensure that effective indirect fire support capability reaches our \ntroops quickly.\n  Overall, this is a solid bill. The sooner we get this bill to \nPresident Bush, then the better chance we have at providing our \nmilitary with the essential training and strength resources to fight \nterrorism or anything else that seeks to destroy America, our people \nand our freedoms.\n  Mr. ROBERTS, Mr. President, I wish to clarify my comments concerning \nmy amendment to authorize, with an offset, $1,000,000 for research, \ndevelopment, test, and evaluation, defense-wide, for analysis and \nassessment of efforts to counter possible agroterrorist attacks. The \namendment was adopted June 26 by voice vote. I stated then that the \n$1,000,000 was destined for the In-House Laboratory Independent \nResearch (PE 0601103D8Z) account. In fact, the funds will be applied to \nthe Chemical and Biological Defense Program (PE 0601384BP) account. The \nintent of the amendment, however, remains the same. It is still my hope \nthat universities with established expertise in the agricultural \nsciences can conduct studies and exercises that lead to better \ncoordination between Federal, State, and local authorities as they \nattempt to detect, deter, and respond to large scale coordinated \nattacks on U.S. agriculture. I envision universities assisting the \nDepartment of Defense in determining what role--if any--our military or \ndefense agencies play in countering agroterrorism. I thank my \ncolleagues for supporting amendment No. 4138.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the leadership \non both sides of the aisle for clearing an amendment I introduced with \nmy colleague from Alaska, Senator Stevens, to prohibit the use of \nnuclear armed interceptors as part of a Ballistic Missile Defense \nSystem (BMDS).\n  Senators Levin and Warner have shown tremendous leadership by working \nhard to address this important issue, and I want to personally thank \nthem for their efforts.\n  I want to comment briefly on the details of the amendment because I \nfeel so strongly, as do my colleagues in the Senate, that both Chambers \nof Congress move to prohibit nuclear armed interceptors.\n  A nuclear armed interceptor is a defensive missile that uses a \nnuclear, rather than conventional, explosive tip to destroy its target. \nIt is based on the premise that a large blast will overwhelm all of the \ncomponents of an enemy missile.\n  The Washington Post reported in April of this year that the Pentagon \nwas pursuing plans to resume research and testing of nuclear armed \ninterceptors as part of a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).\n  I think this would be a great mistake and would endanger the health \nand safety of all Americans.\n  The Post reported on April 11 that the Defense Science Board, a \nresearch body within the Department of Defense, received encouragement \nfrom Secretary Rumsfeld to consider using nuclear tipped warheads for a \nmissile defense system.\n  On April 17, Senator Stevens and I, at an Appropriations Defense \nSubcommittee hearing, asked General Kadish of the Missile Defense \nAgency to refute the Washington Post story. He responded that his \nagency would not conduct research into nuclear warheads.\n  To further clarify the point, we also asked Secretary Rumsfeld to \naddress the allegation in writing. He also assured us the Pentagon \nwould no longer encourage such testing.\n  Inexplicably, in this year's House Armed Services Committee report on \nthe House passed Defense authorization bill, there is language \nsanctioning nuclear interceptor research. The report states:\n\n       The Department may investigate other options for ballistic \n     missile defense nuclear armed interceptors, blast fragment \n     war-\n     heads . . . as alternatives to current approaches . . .\n\n  This troubling development led Senator Stevens and me to introduce \ntoday's amendment, which prohibits any funds from being used for \nnuclear armed interceptors.\n  Our amendment simply states:\n\n       None of the funds authorized to be appropriated by this or \n     any other Act may be used for research, development, test, \n     evaluation, procurement or deployment of nuclear armed \n     interceptors of a missile defense system.\n\n  The use of nuclear armed interceptors represents a deeply troubling \ndeparture from the missile defense testing that has occurred up to this \npoint.\n  For the past year, the Pentagon has been pursuing a technically \nproblematic approach to missile defense.\n  They have attempted to ``hit a bullet with a bullet.''\n  This means that the missile defense system has to individually hit \neach incoming warhead in order to eliminate the total threat.\n  But under this system, the Missile Defense Agency still fails to \naddress the decoy warheads and other countermeasures that force our \nsystems to rapidly determine which is the actual warhead to be targeted \nand which is simply a decoy.\n\n[[Page S6217]]\n\n  This core dilemma led the Pentagon to explore the concept of using a \nnuclear armed interceptor to destroy all of the incoming warheads, real \nand decoy alike.\n  Instead of targeting a particular missile, a nuclear tipped \ninterceptor would be exploded in the vicinity of the missile, ensuring \nthe destruction of the missile and any others objects around it.\n  This approach raises serious questions about the confidence the \nMissile Defense Agency appears to have in its current ``Hit a Bullet \nwith a Bullet'' plan.\n  But perhaps more importantly, this approach overlooks a laundry list \nof catastrophic side-effects that would accompany a nuclear blast in \nthe atmosphere.\n  Even a low-yield nuclear blast in the atmosphere would have grave \nconsequences on public health and on the global economy.\n  Atmospheric winds could potentially spread fall-out over American or \nallied sovereign territory, the very territory we are trying to protect \nfrom nuclear attack.\n  Add the possibility of intercepting a chemical or biological warhead, \nand we exponentially increase the risk of spreading spores or chemical \nagents over a wide area.\n  The Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) from an overhead nuclear blast would \nseverely disrupt and most likely permanently damage U.S. and foreign \nsatellites.\n  These are the very satellite systems we rely on to provide us with \nearly warning and key intelligence for national security operations.\n  I think we all can see the serious ramifications of pursuing such an \nill-advised policy, and I believe that this amendment is needed to \nprevent us from going down this path.\n  As Senators from two States that could feel the brunt of \nradiological, chemical or biological fall-out in the event of a missile \ndefense activation, we are compelled to act.\n  But make no mistake about it, every State in the Union faces the \nspecter of contamination.\n  Given the language included in the House bill promoting nuclear \nintercept research, it is critical the Senate take a leadership role by \npreventing such research and testing.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and inject some common \nsense into the debate over the future of missile defense.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Senate version of \nthe FY2003 National Defense authorization bill.\n  As a former member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and former \nchair of the Seapower Subcommittee, I fully appreciate the hard work \nand long hours my colleagues in the Senate and their counterparts in \nthe House have dedicated to the completion of the bill.\n  There are many important provisions in this bill. However, there are \nalso some critical defense requirements which were overlooked. And I \nwould like to take a moment to address those concerns.\n  First and foremost, with the enormous increase in the defense budget \noverall, I am deeply troubled that we would fail to sustain the size of \nour naval fleet, which has played such a critical role in the war on \nterror.\n  Admiral Robert J. Natter, Commander in Chief of the U.S. Atlantic \nFleet, captured it best when he said ``We fight them here, or we can \nfight them there--it's America's choice.'' And he continued ``I'd \nprefer to fight them there, because I know we can beat them.''\n  Well, we can't fight them there without a Navy. In the opening days \nof Operation Enduring Freedom, our Navy fired over 90 Tomahawk cruise \nmissiles aimed at crippling Taliban air defenses. The Navy executed the \nmajority of the air strikes in the land war. Aircraft-carrier based \nfighter and strike aircraft launched 60 to 80 missions a day dropping \nthousands of bombs on terrorists and Taliban targets. More than 50 Navy \nships participated in the action. I am proud of our Navy, but the fact \nof the matter is, if we do not increase the ship procurement rate, the \nsize and strength of our fleet is going to be diminished.\n  If we allow this to happen, we are doing future generations a great \ndisservice. Because the reality is that, when the United States us \nunable, for whatever reason, to launch military strikes from ground \nbases in a region where U.S. interests are at stake, there are times \nwhen our Navy may be the only option.\n  Yet, the fleet was stretched too thin even before Operation Enduring \nFreedom. When I was chair of the Senate Seapower Subcommittee, I heard \nthis time and again from senior Navy officials. As the war on terror \ncontinues, I believe it is more important than ever that we maintain a \nfleet large enough and strong enough to project the power we need in \norder to safeguard U.S. interests.\n  These are the facts, The Administration proposed in its budget to \nprocure five new Navy ships in Fiscal Year 2003 and a total of 34 new \nNavy ships through Fiscal Year 2007. This is an average of 6.8 new \nships per year. But we need 8.9 ships per year just to maintain a 310-\nship fleet.\n  The size of the fleet could fall to 263 ships by 2015 to 2025 if we \ndo not reverse this trend. Last year, Secretary Rumsfield painted an \neven more dire picture, estimating that the Navy could end up with a \n230 ship Navy in the 2025 time frame without substantial increases in \nthe build rate. Contrast this with the size of our fleet in 1987 when \nwe had 568 ships.\n  I know that the administration recognizes the problem, and I credit \nthem with understanding the need to build more ships in the future. The \nDOD and the Navy have acknowledged the need to build more ships. Last \nyear, a study conducted by the Office of the Secretary of Defense \nconcluded that the Navy should have 340 ships. Navy officials put the \nnumber at 370-380. And they should know. They are the men and women who \nare responsible for our forward deployed forces. But we need to help \nthem by taking action. Whatever the ultimate number, we need to reverse \nthe current trend and begin to build a bigger fleet. But we need to \nbegin to produce more ships now, because there is not doubt that the \nsize of our naval fleet is a vital matter of national security. We \ncan't afford to wait any longer.\n  We can't afford to risk this essential component of our world-wide \ndefense force. After all, 80 percent of the planet's population lives \nalong the coastal plains of the world, and it is the Navy that has the \ncapability that is imperative if we are to maintain military \nsuperiority and defend America's national interests in the 21st \ncentury. For even with today's rapidly changing and diverse security \nthreats, there is no foreseeable future that would have our security \ninterests best served by a diminished naval fleet.\n\n  Despite the fact that Secretary England has endorsed funding for a \nthird destroyer, for example, this bill fails to fund an additional \nship. To maintain readiness and to sustain the industrial base, we \ndesperately need a third destroyer authorized and funded in fiscal year \n2003.\n  Even to maintain a 116-ship surface combatant force, given the \nprojected service life of 35 years for DDG-51 Class ships, requires a \nsustained replacement rate of over three ships per year. If you assume \na 30-year service life, which is more realistic historically, \nsustaining even the 116-ship surface combatant force would require \nannual procurement of almost four DDGs each year.\n  And at a rate of only two destroyers a year, it may be difficult to \nsustain the yards that have historically built these critical \nplatforms. That is why I was pleased to team with Senator Collins to \nextend the multi-year procurement rate for DDG destroyers through \nfiscal year 2007. As chair of the Seapower Subcommittee, I secured \nprocurement authorization for three DDGs annually through fiscal year \n2005, and this bill extends that authorization for an additional two \nyears. It is still imperative to add a third destroyer to the fiscal \nyear 2003 budget, but this multi-year procurement is a step in the \nright direction.\n  While I am very concerned about the failure to fully fund the \nshipbuilding accounts, I do believe credit is due in some other \nimportant areas. For example, the bill does make some invaluable \npersonnel contributions. The measure includes a 4.1 percent across-the-\nboard pay raise for all military personnel, with an additional targeted \npay raise for the mid-career force. It includes a\n\n[[Page S6218]]\n\nprovision authorizing the concurrent receipt of military retirement pay \nand veterans disability compensation for military retirees with \ndisabilities, an effort which I have long supported.\n  The bill also reaffirms Congress's commitment to the war on terror by \nfunding requirements needed to support our Soldiers, Marines, Sailors, \nand Airmen who are on the front lines with the planes, vehicles, ships \nand armaments they need to carry out their critical missions.\n  The bill would set aside $10 billion, as requested by the \nadministration, to fund ongoing operations in the war against \ninternational terrorism during fiscal year 2003. And it includes \nsubstantial funding to meet asymmetrical terrorist threats including \nchemical, biological, and nuclear weapons and develop the agility, \nmobility, and survivability necessary to meet the challenges of the \nfuture.\n  It would increase by $199.7 million funding to enhance the security \nof nuclear materials and nuclear weapons at Department of Energy \nfacilities. It would increase funding for U.S. Special Operations \nCommand by $42.7 million. Defenses against chemical and biological \nweapons and other efforts to combat weapons of mass destruction would \nsee an increase of $30.5 million. And the bill would find the request \nof over $2 billion for force protection improvements to DOD \ninstallations around the world.\n  Finally, the bill would also make possible continued improvements in \nthe Navy's human resources services with the authorization of $1.5 \nmillion for operation of a pilot human resources call center in \nMachias, Maine under an amendment I worked to include in the bill.\n  This call center went on-line in January of this year. I worked hard \nwith the Navy to locate this facility in Washington County, ME to help \ncompensate for the loss of military personnel at the Cutler Naval \nComputer and Telecommunications station in Cutler, a communication \ncenter used to provide contact with U.S. submarines in the North \nAtlantic, Mediterranean and Arctic seas. At its peak there were 220 \npeople working at the base--110 civilians and 110 Navy personnel.\n  The call center establishes a single national employee benefits \ncenter for the Department of the Navy to standardize the ``call in \ncapability'' of services currently performed in eight separate Human \nResources Service Centers. This center integrates developed computer \nand internet technologies to provide updated information immediately to \nNavy civilians and beneficiaries who make inquiries.\n  In closing, let me say that I hope during the House-Senate conference \non the defense authorization that we will be able to build on the \nfoundation that has been set in this bill and make it an even stronger \nbill.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote against the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 2003. I regret that the Senate has \nmissed another opportunity to reorient the thinking--and spending--of \nthe Pentagon.\n  I strongly support our men and women in uniform in the ongoing fight \nagainst global terrorism and in their other missions, both at home and \nabroad. I commend the members of the National Guard and Reserves and \ntheir families for the sacrifices they have made to protect our \nsecurity and freedom. More than 85,000 National Guard and Reserve \nforces have been called to active duty since September 11, including \npersonnel from a number of units in Wisconsin. All members of our \nmilitary and their families--active duty, National Guard, and \nReserves--deserve our sincere thanks for their commitment to protect \nthis country and to undertake the fight against terrorism in the wake \nof the horrific attacks of September 11.\n  Each year that I have been a Member of this body, I have expressed my \nconcern about the priorities of the Pentagon and about the process by \nwhich we consider the Department of Defense authorization and \nappropriations bills. I am troubled that the Department of Defense does \nnot receive the same scrutiny as other parts of our Federal budget. \nThis time of unprecedented national crisis underscores the need for the \nCongress and the administration to take a hard look at the Pentagon's \nbudget to ensure that scarce taxpayer dollars are targeted to those \nprograms that are necessary to defend our country in the post-cold war \nworld and to ensure that our Armed Forces have the resources they need \nfor the battles ahead.\n  There can be no doubt that Congress should provide the resources \nnecessary to fight and win the battle against terrorism. There should \nalso be no doubt that this ongoing campaign should not be used as an \nexcuse to continue to drastically increase an already bloated defense \nbudget.\n  When adjusted for inflation, the spending authorized by this bill, as \nit was reported to the Senate by the Armed Services Committee, \nrepresents the largest increase in defense spending since 1966. Just \nhow big is this increase? The whopping $393.4 billion authorized by \nthis bill is $152.2 billion more than combined defense budgets of the \nUnited Kingdom, Japan, Russia, France, Germany, Saudi Arabia, India, \nChina, South Korea, Taiwan, Iran, Pakistan, Syria, Iraq, North Korea, \nYugoslavia, Libya, Sudan, and Cuba.\n  The $46 billion increase over fiscal year 2002 alone is more than the \nDefense budgets of any one of these 19 countries. The country with the \nsecond-largest defense budget, the United Kingdom, spent just $34.8 \nbillion in 2001. This bill authorizes a defense budget that is more \nthan 11 times greater than that of our closest ally.\n  A strong national defense is crucial to the peace and stability of \nour Nation. But a strong economy is also essential to national \nsecurity. We must not focus on one to the detriment of the other. Many \nof the expensive weapons systems that are authorized in this bill have \nlittle or nothing to do with the fight against terrorism, which is \noften cited as the reason for the $46 billion increase in defense \nspending contained in this bill. I am concerned that if we continue \ndown this path, defense spending will spiral further out of control, \nperhaps putting other areas of our economy at risk.\n  I am pleased that the Senate adopted an amendment to cut funding for \nthe Army's Crusader mobile artillery program. I support the Secretary \nof Defense's decision to cancel this outdated program. Last month, I \nintroduced legislation that would terminate the Crusader program, \nsaving taxpayers an estimated $10 billion over the life of the program. \nI commend the Secretary of Defense for his efforts to transform our \nmilitary to meet the challenges of the 21st Century and beyond, and \nagree that cold war-era dinosaurs such as the Crusader should be \nterminated.\n  I regret that so little progress has been made to transform the \nmilitary for these new challenges. The hard-fought battle to terminate \nthe Crusader program--a program that was canceled by the Secretary of \nDefense--stands as an example of how difficult it is to change the \nmind-set of the Pentagon and the Congress. The beleaguered Crusader is \nthe poster child for an obsolete, cold war-era program, yet there are \nthose in the Congress and at the Pentagon who are digging in their \nheels and trying desperately to save it. The termination of a weapon \nsystem such as the Crusader is an example of the hard decisions that \nthis body will have to make as we face the realities of the federal \nbudget and as we seek to provide our Armed Forces with the equipment \nthey will need to fight the battles of the future.\n  I am pleased that this bill authorizes an increase in full-time \nmanning for the Army National Guard. As we continue to call upon the \nGuard and Reserves for active-duty missions that are longer in \nduration, the role of the full-time Army National Guard personnel who \nsupport these missions becomes increasingly important. The Army \nNational Guard relies heavily on Active Guard/Reserves and Military \nTechnicians to perform a wide variety of essential day-to-day \noperations, ranging from equipment maintenance to leadership and staff \nroles.\n  According to Lieutenant General Roger C. Schultz, Director of the \nArmy National Guard, ``Increased full time support is an absolute \nnecessity for Army National Guard units as the Army places greater \nreliance on the Army National Guard to provide trained and ready \nsoldiers in support of Homeland Security efforts, as well as forces for \ntheater Commander in Chiefs in support of the National Military \nStrategy. These full time personnel are the vital link for the \ntraditional part\n\n[[Page S6219]]\n\ntime Army National Guard commanders working to achieve expected \nreadiness goals. Units that are under-strength in full time support \npersonnel have difficulty maintaining pace with current elevated \nOperational Tempo. Consequently, many units fail to attain and maintain \nreadiness levels.''\n  This bill authorizes 724 additional Active Guard/Reserve positions \nand 487 additional military technicians, which, according to the \nNational Guard Bureau, are the minimum essential requirements for full-\ntime manning for the Army National Guard. These increases match those \ncontained in an amendment that I offered to the fiscal year 2003 budget \nresolution that was adopted unanimously during the Budget Committee's \nmark-up earlier this year.\n  I am troubled that the Senate added to the bill the $814.3 million \nthat the Armed Services Committee cut from the President's request for \nnational missile defense by the unfortunate adoption of an amendment \noffered by the ranking member of the committee, Mr. Warner. The \namendment would allow the President to spend this money on missile \ndefense or on defense activities to combat terrorism at home and \nabroad. This bill, as reported to the Senate, includes $6.8 billion for \nthe still unproven missile defense system. While I did not originally \noppose legislation authorizing development of a missile defense system, \nI remain skeptical about the need for such a system. Congress should \nmaintain tight cost controls over this system, as the Armed Services \nCommittee attempted to do by cutting $814.3 million for a number of \nquestionable aspects of the Administration's request. I am still \nconcerned that the $6.8 billion in the bill is far too much for this \nprogram, but these cuts were a step in the right direction.\n  I am also concerned that the proposed offset for the additional \nfunding in the Warner amendment comes from ``amounts that the Secretary \ndetermines unnecessary by reason of a revision of assumptions regarding \ninflation that are applied as a result of the midsession review of the \nbudget conducted by the Office of Management and Budget during the \nspring and early summer of 2002.'' This flimsy accounting gimmick \nshould not be cited as an offset. In reality, there is no offset for \nthis spending increase.\n  I am pleased that the Senate adopted a language offered by the \nchairman of the committee, Mr. Levin, that directs that priority for \nallocating any funds made available to the Department by a lower rate \nof inflation be given to ``activities for protecting the American \npeople at home and abroad by combating terrorism at home and abroad.'' \nClearly, the proposed missile defense system does not fit this \ndefinition. But I am troubled by the underlying Warner amendment \nbecause I oppose giving the President the option to spend additional \nfunding on missile defense.\n  I am pleased that the committee included in the bill language that \nwill help to improve congressional oversight of the missile defense \nprogram by, one, requiring that the Director of Operational Test and \nEvaluation conduct an annual operational assessment of the program and \nthat the Joint Requirements Oversight Council review the cost schedule \nand performance criteria for the program, and, two, requiring that the \nSecretary conduct a review of the major elements of the missile defense \nprogram and report to Congress cost and schedule information similar to \nthat required for other major defense programs.\n  Turning to another issue, I continue to be concerned about the Marine \nCorps' troubled V-22 Osprey program. I met recently with Colonel Dan \nSchultz, the Marines' V-22 Program Manager, and others to discuss the \nstatus of this program and to express my concerns about the Osprey. I \nappreciate Colonel Schultz' commitment to ensuring that the Osprey is a \nsafe and effective aircraft and his thoughtful approach to the new \nflight testing program, which began on May 29.\n  The safety of our men and women in uniform should continue to be top \npriority as we consider the Osprey's future.\n  I am troubled that the Osprey nearly made it to a Milestone III \nproduction decision in late 2000 with extensive problems in its \nhydraulics system and flight control software. While I appreciate the \nhard work that the Marines and the contractors have done to correct \nthese problems, I remain concerned that there is no clear answer for \nwhy these deadly problems, which combined to cause the December 2000 \ncrash that killed four Marines, weren't discovered much earlier.\n  I am also troubled by the lack of concrete information about how to \navoid the dangerous vortex ring state, which occurs when the Osprey \ndescends too rapidly. I remain concerned about the effect that the \nvortex ring state could have on the ability of the Osprey to perform in \ncombat, especially if a pilot has to make a fast exit from a hostile \nsituation. I will monitor closely planned extensive testing that the \nMarine Corps has planned to study this phenomenon and ways to help \npilots avoid it.\n  The ongoing flight tests should provide a definitive assessment of \nthe aircraft's capabilities. If the Osprey is not up to the job, then \nthe Defense Department should be prepared to consider other \nalternatives that will meet the needs of the Marine Corps in a safe and \ncost-effective manner. I will work to ensure that Congress maintains \nstrict oversight of the testing program.\n  In addition, I will oppose any attempt to increase procurement of the \nOsprey beyond the minimum sustaining rate until the Marine Corps has \ndemonstrated that the Osprey is safe and effective and meets or exceeds \nall of its performance criteria. I am still not convinced that the \nOsprey will work, and whether it can be made to work in a cost-\neffective manner.\n  In sum, as I have said time and time again, there are millions upon \nmillions of dollars in this bill that are being spent on outdated or \nquestionable or unwanted programs. This money would be better spent on \nprograms that truly improve our readiness and modernize our Armed \nForces. This money also would be better spent on efforts to improve the \nmorale of our forces, such as ensuring that all of our men and women in \nuniform have a decent standard of living or providing better housing \nfor our Armed Forces and their families. For those reasons, I will \noppose this bill.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to thank the chairman, the \nranking member, and the staff of the Senate Armed Services Committee \nfor their efforts to address my concerns with the current funding \nsituation for the National Guard Competitive Sports Program. I hope \nthis issue can be resolved in conference.\n  Mr. President, our world as we know it changed dramatically after the \nevents of September 11, 2001. I believe we must support the President \nof the United States in a time of war and I think the Fiscal Year 2003 \nNational Defense Authorization Act does exactly that. However, I think \nwe must not lose sight of the fact that we still rely on an all-\nvolunteer force to man the ranks of our military. This means we must, \neven in a time of war, continue to have a robust retention and \nrecruiting program, especially if the war on terrorism becomes a \nlengthy one. The best recruiting and retention programs are those that \nenable the services to get out and interact with the public, which \nbrings me to an issue I would like to see rectified in conference.\n  We need a minor change in current law, which would allow National \nGuard units to use a small amount of appropriated funds to sponsor \nsports competitions and send Guard members to those competitions. As \nthe law reads now, only non-appropriated funds may be used to cover \nexpenses such as health, pay, and personal expenses for participating \nNational Guard members. Unlike our active forces, the National Guard \ndoes not have access to non-appropriated funds as they do not own or \noperate non-appropriated fund generating functions, such as military \nexchanges, commissaries, and the like.\n  Unlike Active Duty military personnel who have all health, pay, and \npersonal expenses covered while participating in competitive sports, \nNational Guard members are not on duty while competing in sporting \nevents, and thus are not covered. For example, if a National Guard \nmember suffers an injury while competing at the marksmanship \ncompetition, the service member must pay for the incurred health costs \nalthough the individual was competing with his or her Guard unit. And, \nunfortunately, placing National Guard\n\n[[Page S6220]]\n\nmembers on orders, as occur when military reservists participate in \nthese competitions, is not a solution to the coverage issue.\n  The senior Senator from Vermont and I had hoped to offer an amendment \nto allow the National Guard to spend a limited amount of appropriated \nfunds, capped at $2.5 million per year, on its sports program. It \nshould be emphasized that we only seek to allow the National Guard to \nparticipate in the same manner as Active Duty military. The House \noverwhelmingly passed a National Guard Sports amendment offered by \nRepresentative Bereuter to their Fiscal Year 2003 National Defense Act, \nwhich is identical to the change I seek. I urge the chairman and \nranking member to adopt the Bereuter provision in the House bill when \nthe Fiscal Year 2003 National Defense Authorization Act goes to \nconference.\n  On 17 June 2002, Colonel Willie Davenport, Chief of the National \nGuard Bureau's Office of Sports Management passed away while on travel \nbetween duty stations. I did not know Colonel Davenport, but my staff \ninforms me that he was by all appearances a gentle, modest, and \ngracious man. My staff worked extensively with Colonel Davenport in \npreparing an amendment concerning National Guard Sports. I read the \nGuard's recent press release concerning Colonel Davenport, and I was \nquite impressed by his accomplishments as a teacher, mentor, coach, and \nsoldier. What many may not know is that Colonel Davenport while serving \nas a soldier was also a five-time Olympian. He won Gold in the 110-\nmeter high hurdles while representing the United States in the 1968 \nsummer Olympics in Mexico City, and that was only the beginning. \nColonel Davenport went on from there to represent the Army and the \nUnited States in a variety of capacities in the competitive sports \nworld. He coached the All-Army Track and Field Team from 1993-1996, \nwhich was undefeated all 4 years. Colonel Davenport in his capacity as \na teacher, mentor, coach, soldier and Olympian made a very positive, \nand lasting impression on a good number of young men and women who came \nto know, work, and enjoy his company. A man of his character and \naccomplishment will be missed. We know that he has prepared a good \nnumber of others to continue to light the path ahead. Colonel Davenport \nhad a dream. His dream was to develop a program that would train and \nsponsor premier Army and Air National Guard athletes for international \ncompetition.\n\n  Colonel Davenport's National Guard Competitive Events Sports Program \nprovides National Guard members with an opportunity to hone their \ntraining-related skills, such as running, swimming, and marksmanship, \nin a competitive atmosphere. As the National Guard actively recruits \nnew members, this can be another feature in recruitment and retention \nprograms for certain members of the National Guard. Through these \ncompetitions, National Guard members can qualify for higher-level \nnational and international competitions, including the Pan American \nGames and the Olympics.\n  National Guard members who compete in athletic and small arms \ncompetitions could then do so with members of the Active Duty military. \nBringing Active, Reserve, and National Guard components together at \nthese competitive sports events will help build greater service \ncomponent cohesiveness.\n  While recruiting, retention, esprit de corps, and community support \nhave always been important to maintaining a strong National Guard \nstructure, they have become even more critical as we wage the war on \nterrorism during which our men and women in the National Guard are more \nfrequently called into duty overseas and to provide security on the \nhomeland.\n  The National Guard needs a change in the law if Colonel Davenport's \nNational Guard Competitive Events Sports Program is going to survive. \nThe National Guard must be able to sponsor competitions and send its \nmembers to those competitions, as they are an important tool and \nincentive to recruit and retain some of America's best and brightest.\n  This issue is important to the Vermont Guard and the National Guard \nas a whole. I hope we can provide the National Guard with the authority \nthey need to have a robust sports program.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \namendment offered by my friend and colleague, Senator Hutchison, \nregarding base closures.\n  Last year, with the passage of the fiscal year 2002 National Defense \nAuthorization Act, Congress authorized a round of base closures in \nfiscal year 2005. So we are now on a path to a base closure round in 3 \nyears.\n  Even before the horrific attacks of September 11, 2001, there were \nserious questions about both the integrity of the base closing process \nitself as well as the actual benefits. Now, with the U.S. in the midst \nof a war on terror, with no end in sight, I do not believe base closure \nis a wise path. Instead, Congress was pressed to authorize a base \nclosure round in the dark.\n  Proponents of base closure claim that efforts to reduce \ninfrastructure have not kept pace with our post cold war military force \nreductions, and that bases must be downsized proportionate to the \nreduction in total force strength. However, there is no straight line \ncorollary between the size of our forces and the infrastructure \nrequired to support them.\n  Since the end of the cold war, through fiscal year 01, we reduced the \nmilitary force structure by about 36 percent and reduced the defense \nbudget by about 40 percent. But while the size of the armed services \nhas decreased, the number of contingencies that our service members \nhave been called upon to respond to in the last decade has dramatically \nincreased. And, keep in mind, once property is relinquished and \nremediated, it is permanently lost as a military asset for all \npractical purposes.\n  In addition, advocates of base closure allege that billions of \ndollars will be saved. And yet, the Department of Defense has admitted \nthat savings will not be immediate--that approximately $10 billion \nwould be needed for up-front environmental and other costs; and that \nsavings would not materialize for years.\n  This is why I was pleased to team with Senator Hutchison in her \neffort to establish some basic criteria designed to guide the process, \nand I deeply regret that the Senate will not have the opportunity to \nadopt these provisions.\n  Senator Hutchison's provision, of which I am an original cosponsor, \nwould set criteria for the base closure process--to make the process \nless political, less subjective, and more objective.\n  The Hutchison amendment would have made sure that the process \naccounts for force structure and mission requirements, force \nprotection, homeland security requirements, proximity to mobilization \npoints, costs of relocating infrastructure including military \nconstruction costs, compliance with environmental laws, contract \ntermination costs, unique characteristics of existing facilities, and \nState and local support for a continued presence by the military.\n  I want to protect the military's critical readiness and operational \nassets. I want to protect the home port berthing for our ships and \nsubmarines, the airspace that our aircraft fly in and the training \nareas and ranges that our armed forces require to support and defend \nour nation and its interests. I want to protect the economic viability \nof communities in every State. And I want to make absolutely sure that \nthis Nation maintains the military infrastructure it will need in the \nyears to come to support the war on terror.\n  In short, we must not degrade the readiness of our armed forces by \nclosing more bases. I thank Senator Hutchison for her leadership on \nthis important issue, and I remain hopeful that if we press ahead with \nthis ill-conceived base closure round in just 3 years time we will have \nan opportunity to at least establish sound, basic ground rules.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to address the subject of our \nNation's security needs in the context of the Defense authorization \nbill presently before the Senate.\n  I believe we must provide the best possible training, equipment, and \npreparation for our military forces, so they can effectively carry out \nwhatever peacekeeping, humanitarian, war-fighting, or other missions \nthey are given. They deserve the targeted pay\n\n[[Page S6221]]\n\nraises of 4-6 percent, the incentive pay for difficult-to-fill \nassignments, and the upgrades to currently substandard housing \ncontained in this bill. Under an amendment adopted by the Senate, the \nwomen who serve our country overseas in the Armed Forces will be able \nto obtain safe, privately funded abortions in overseas military \nhospitals. For many years running, those in our armed forces have been \nsuffering from a declining quality of life, despite rising military \nPentagon budgets. The pressing needs of our dedicated men and women in \nuniform, and those of their families, must be addressed as they \ncontinue to be mobilized in the war against terrorism in response to \nthe attacks of September 11. This bill goes far in addressing those \nneeds, and I will vote for it today.\n  This bill also addresses a fundamental unfairness in the treatment of \nAmerica's veterans by allowing concurrent receipt of military retiree \nbenefits and VA disability benefits. Under current law, if you are \ncareer military and you earned a military pension, and you also have \nservice-connected disability as a veteran, your military pension will \nbe reduced by the amount you receive in VA disability payments. As a \nresult, hundreds of thousands of American veterans, men and women who \nhave served their country, are being cheated out of retirement benefits \nby this bizarre rule and it is time to make a change. Our disabled \nveterans have earned their retirement and deserve to receive fair \ntreatment.\n  Last year we passed this same legislation in the Senate, but it was \ngutted in the House. The Defense Department says it will recommend a \nveto of this bill if we restore these benefits. But I do not believe \nthat the President will veto legislation to restore the benefits earned \nby disabled veterans, while career military men and women are overseas \nfighting for their country, at great risk to their lives. Instead of \nmaking threats, let's sit down and get this done for America's vets.\n  I also believe the bill addresses some of the serious flaws in the \nprocess by which the Defense Department summarily terminated the \nCrusader Artillery system. I strongly believe in fair, transparent, and \ninformed government-decision making processes, which did not occur in \nthe case of the Crusader. Three Defense secretaries, three Army \nsecretaries, and three Army chiefs of staff, as well as numerous \nadministration officials, testified in support of the Crusader. Yet \nwithin a few weeks of this testimony, the Secretary of Defense abruptly \nterminated the Crusader. The decision was made without consultation \nwith the Joint Chiefs of Staff, without consultation with the Army, and \nwithout consultation with members of Congress. The Senate adopted an \namendment which would require the Army Chief of Staff and Secretary of \nDefense to conduct a serious study of the best way to provide for the \nArmy's need for indirect fire support. At the same time, it provides \nthe Secretary of Defense, following the study, a full range of options. \nThese include termination to continued funding of Crusader, to funding \nalternative systems to meet battlefield requirements.\n  Another issue I consider to be extremely important in relation to \nthis bill has to do with our own military presence in the Republic of \nColombia. As you know, under Plan Colombia, restrictions were placed on \nthe number of U.S. troops and contract personnel in Colombia at any \ngiven time. Initially, a 500 troop, 300 contractor limitation was in \nplace. Over time, however, the Senate has acted to address the needs of \nthe Departments of Defense and State by shifting the ration of troop \nand contractors to 1:1. As a result of recent Foreign Operations \nAppropriations legislation, the troop cap dropped from 500 to 400, \nwhile the contractor cap was lifted from 300 to 400 personnel.\n  Frankly, I am concerned that attempts may be made to raise the troop \nand contractor caps in Colombia. I have long argued that the United \nStates should be careful and targeted in how it approaches the conflict \nin Colombia. I'm sure that most Senators would agree that it is \nimportant to retain the present limitations on U.S. troops and \ncontractors in Colombia at 800 thru 400 troops, 400 contractors. \nMoreover, it is my understanding that the Department of Defense has not \nasked for the troop cap to be raised in Colombia, nor has the \nadministration sought to have the troop cap waived. For this reason, I \nwould like to be on record in support of present troop and contractor \nlimitations in Colombia.\n  Although I expect future debate on the contentious issues surrounding \nU.S. policy in the Andes, I think it is important for the Senate to be \nclear on this component of our aid to Colombia. I am concerned that we \nare getting deeper and deeper into a devastating civil conflict with \nmyriad violent actors of ill repute. That said, I continue to hold out \nhope that the Congress can work with the administration to craft a \npolicy for Colombia that reflects the best of American values, and \nacknowledges the economic and social needs of Colombia's beleaguered \npopulation. The administration should retain the troop and contractor \ncaps in Colombia, and Congress should be adequately consulted should \nthey decide to seek any such change.\n  I also have concerns about the bill, especially about its missile \ndefense provisions. The initial committee language would have cut total \nfunding for missile defense from $7.6 billion to $6.8 billion. The \nSenate adopted an amendment to restore the entire $814.3 million that \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee cut from missile defense, with the \nPresident being given the option of spending the funds on either \nmissile defense programs or on combating terrorism. It was not my \npreference that the cut be restored, but I agree with the Senate's \nunanimous sentiment that these funds be used for the urgent priority of \ncombating terrorism, and my strong hope is that the President will not \ndisregard the will of the Senate and use these funds for missile \ndefense instead.\n  I have long been a critic of Ballistic Missile Defense, BMD, and I \nstill have strong reservations about the feasibility, cost, and \nrationale for such a system. The last time I addressed missile defense \non the Senate floor was on September 25, exactly two weeks after \nterrorists destroyed the World Trade Center. I argued then that \npressing ahead on BMD would make the U.S. less rather than more secure. \nInstead, I suggested the Senate give homeland defense the high \npriority it deserves by transferring funds to it from missile defense \nprograms.\n\n  Given the justifiable concerns of Americans about possible terrorist \nattacks on U.S. nuclear facilities, it makes more sense to use the \nfunds to protect our citizens against a priority threat rather than to \ncounter a low priority threat with a very costly system that a number \nof informed scientists believe may never work.\n  Under Chairman Levin's leadership, the committee eased the effects of \nthe administration's April decision to provide emergency funding for \nonly 7 percent of Energy Secretary Abraham's request for $398 million \nto improve security of nuclear weapons and waste. In a letter sent by \nSecretary Abraham to OMB Director Mitchell Daniels obtained by the New \nYork Times, the Secretary stressed that the $398 million he was \nrequesting was ``a critical down payment to the safety and security of \nour nation and its people.'' I couldn't agree more. But the \nadministration obviously didn't agree and approved only $26 million.\n  The April 23rd New York Times article on the matter made clear that \nthe programs covered by the DOE request are vital to the protection of \nthe United States from terrorist attack. Unbelievably, funding was \nturned down for several programs designed to safeguard nuclear weapons \nand weapons material in storage, including: $41 million to reduce the \nnumber of places where weapons-grade plutonium and uranium were stored; \n$12 million to detect explosives in packages and vehicles at DOE sites; \n$13 million to improve perimeter barriers and fences; $30 million to \nimprove DOE computers, including the ability to communicate critical \ncyber-threat and incident information; and $34 million for increasing \nsecurity at DOE laboratories.\n  Who can argue that BMD funding for programs that can't be justified \nby DOD or are duplicative should take priority over programs designed \nto deter terrorist actions against U.S. nuclear weapons, weapons \nmaterials, and weapons laboratories? Just a few days ago, reports of \npossible terrorist use of a dirty bomb against the United States caused \nwidespread public alarm. I am sure the American people would be\n\n[[Page S6222]]\n\neven more alarmed by a threatened terrorist attack against DOE nuclear \nfacilities.\n  An attack by ballistic missiles is one of the least likely threats we \nface. Much more probable threats which a missile defense won't address \nare nuclear, biological or chemical attacks using planes, boats, trucks \nor suitcases. And as we are all aware even an impenetrable missile \ndefense would have been useless against the assault on the World Trade \nCenter. In short, I remain convinced that a national missile defense \nwould be ineffective in preventing attacks by rogue states or \nterrorists.\n  While the intelligence community continues to devote considerable \nresources to estimating both the threat of an ICBM and unconventional \nattack on the United States, it still finds that unconventional attacks \nare the more likely of the two. For example, recent testimony by the \nNational Intelligence Officer, NIO, for Strategic and Nuclear Programs, \nbefore a subcommittee of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee \nrepeated previous intelligence community judgments that U.S. territory \nis more likely to be struck by non-missile means of delivering weapons \nof mass destruction, WMD, than by ICBM's. His remarks were based on an \nunclassified version of a National Intelligence Estimate, NIE, that was \nreleased in January entitled: ``Foreign Missile Developments and the \nBallistic Missile Threat Through 2015.'' NIE's represent the collective \njudgment of the U.S. intelligence community.\n  In testifying on why using non-missile means of delivering WMD's are \nthe more likely option, the NIO adduced reasons similar to those cited \nbefore by other intelligence sources. Compared to ICBM'S, he said, non-\nmissile means are ``less costly, easier to acquire, and more reliable \nand adequate . . . and also can be used with attribution.''\n  The NIO meant by this that non-missile means have the advantage of \nbeing used without imperiling those responsible, while ICBM's have \n``signatures'' enabling the U.S. to quickly identify the attackers. \nConsequently, countries like North Korea, Iran, and Iraq which he said \ncould be capable of launching missiles at the U.S. by 2015, would be \nrisking a devastating counterattack by the United States. The key \nquestion of why these countries would risk destruction by firing an \nICBM at us, when non-missiles can be used without a return address has \nyet to be revealed by intelligence or defense sources. North Korean, \nIraqi, and Iranian leaders are evil, but they aren't suicidal.\n  The NIO noted some states armed with missiles have shown ``a \nwillingness to use chemical weapons with other delivery means,'' adding \nthat U.S. territory is more likely to be attacked with non-missile WMD \nby terrorists. He concluded the intelligence community believes that \nthe U.S. will face a growing missile threat because missiles have \nbecome important regional weapons for numerous countries and provide a \nlevel of prestige, coercive diplomacy and deterrence unmatched by non-\nmissile means.\n  But this thesis has been ably refuted by Joseph Cirincione, head of \nthe Carnegie Endowment's Nuclear Proliferation Program. In a February \nspeech before the American Association for the Advancement of Science \nhe argued that the U.S. is facing a declining ballistic missile threat \nrather than the increasing threat the intelligence community sees.\n  Cirincione focuses on the 1998 Rumsfeld Commission study which \nassessed the ballistic missile threat to the United States and took a \nmuch more alarmist view than intelligence assessments that had examined \nthe same issue. The Rumsfeld Commission found that North Korea and Iran \nwere devoting ``extraordinary resources'' to developing ballistic \nmissiles capabilities that pose ``a substantial and immediate danger to \nthe U.S., its vital interests and its allies.''\n  The Rumsfeld Commission report was an outgrowth of harsh attacks by \nseveral leading members of Congress on 1993 and 1995 NIE's. The 1993 \nNIE concluded that only China and several states of the former Soviet \nUnion had the capability to attack the continental U.S. with land-based \nballistic missiles, adding that ``. . . the probability is low that any \nother country will acquire this capability during the next 15 years.'' \nIn a similar vein, the 1995 NIE, said: ``The Intelligence Community \njudges that in the next 15 years no country other than the major \ndeclared nuclear powers [i.e. Russia and China] will develop a \nballistic missile that could threaten the contiguous 48 states or \nCanada.''\n  In the aftermath of harsh congressional criticism of the estimates, a \ncongressionally mandated panel in December 1996 led by former Bush \nAdministration CIA Director Robert Gates reviewed the 1995 NIE. The \npanel concurred with the NIE, finding that it was unlikely the \ncontinental U.S. would face an ICBM threat from a third world country \nbefore 2010 ``even taking into account the acquisition of foreign \nhardware and technical assistance, and that case is even stronger than \nwas presented in the estimate.''\n  Apparently displeased by the Gates panel report as much as they were \nby the 1995 NIE, Congress mandated the Rumsfeld Commission panel which \nfinally provided a different answer. The 1998 Commission report \nconcluded that a new nation could plausibly field an ICBM ``with little \nor no warning.'' In the aftermath, the intelligence community adopted \nthe ``could standard'' which became apparent in the 1999 NIE. That \nconsensus report contained the following dissent from one of the \nintelligence agencies involved in producing the NIE: Some analysts \nbelieve that the prominence given to missiles countries ``could'' \ndevelop gives more credence than is warranted to developments that may \nprove implausible.\n  The ``could'' standard was one of three major changes made to \nassessment methodology. The other shifts were to substantially reduce \nthe range of missiles considered serious threats by shifting from \nthreats to 48 continental States to threats to any of the land mass of \nthe 50 States and changing the time line from when a country would \nfirst deploy a long-range missile to when a country could first test a \nlong-range missile. The geographic criterion change had the effect of \nshortening missile range by some 3,000 miles, the distance from Seattle \nto the western-most tip of Alaska's Aleutian Islands. In effect, this \nmeans the North Korea's medium-range ballistic missile the Taepodong-1 \ncould be considered the same threat as an ICBM. The time line shift \nrepresents a decrease of five years, which previous estimates said was \nthe difference between first test and likely deployment. Moreover, the \nnew NIE's don't require a successful test.\n  The net effect of these three changes was to shift the goal posts in \nthe direction indicated by the Rumsfeld Commission. These shifts \naccount for almost all of the differences between the 1999 and 2001 \nNIE's and earlier estimates. Rather than representing some new, \ndramatic increase in the ballistic missile threat, they represent \nlowered standards for judging the threat.\n  Despite administration optimism about developing BMD and the \nprospects for quick deployment, prominent scientists and missile \nexperts remain skeptical. Here are a few examples. Richard Garwin of \nthe Council on Foreign Relations, a member of the Rumsfeld Commission, \nand a leading expert in military applications of science, is dubious \nabout the administration's approach to BMD and its rationale for \npursuing it.\n  A report in the Dallas Morning News quotes Garwin as questioning the \nemphasis on destroying missiles in mid-course, warning ``it's not a \nsensible thing to do.'' He says the major flaw is that an enemy can \ndefeat the system by such means as concealing the payload bomb in a \nballoon the size of a house so that hitting the balloon would have \nlittle chance of disabling the weapon. Deploying numerous, \nsophisticated decoys would also be an effective counter-measure.\n  Garwin suspects DOD money is going to the mid-course approach because \nits proponents aren't really hoping to use BMD against rogue states as \nthey claim, but are aiming at ``China first, then Russia.'' He reasons \nthat while ships or land-based launch sites would be suitable for \nshooting down Iraqi or North Korean missiles in boost-phase, they would \nbe useless against Russia and China. A mid-course strategy, however, \ncould counter a limited missile attack from those nations. The \nimplications are chilling. I hope and pray that Garwin is wrong about \nBMD's true mission, because if Russia and China reach the same \nconclusion, we may be in for a renewed nuclear arms race.\n\n[[Page S6223]]\n\n  Dr. Garwin now questions the rationale for BMD, despite his \nparticipation in the Rumsfeld Commission which assessed the ballistic \nmissile threat to the United States. He was quoted in a June 12 news \nwire report as stating: ``Fifteen million . . . cargo containers enter \nthe United States every year with a minute chance of being inspected. \nWhy should a nation with a few ICBM's risk their being destroyed pre-\nemptively when other means are available for delivery?''\n  Steven Weinberg, a Nobel Laureate in physics, is one of the most \nprominent and trenchant scientific critics of BMD. He strongly believes \nthat it would be smarter to put the billions pouring into missile \ndefense into other homeland security efforts. Weinberg points out that \nif the U.S. deploys BMD, intelligence analysts estimate China will \nsharply expand its arsenal from about 20 ICBM's to 200 or so. Should \nthis occur both India and Pakistan would probably also expand their \nnuclear arsenals. As we all know, the last thing the world needs is a \nspiraling nuclear arms race in South Asia.\n  Weinberg believes a BMD system would be fatally flawed. He contends \nthat missile defenses are easy to defeat. The attacker surrounding his \nwarheads with decoys, he says always has the last move. He makes a \npersuasive case that a ballistic missile attack on the United States is \nan unlikely threat. The real danger we face, he says, is the spread of \nnuclear material that can be set off without missiles. He concludes \nthat President Bush is pursuing ``a missile defense undertaken for its \nown sake, rather than any application it may have in defending our own \ncountry.'' While I doubt this is an accurate characterization of the \nPresident's motives, I agree with Weinberg's conclusion that the spread \nof nuclear materials is now a much more serious threat to our country \nthan a ballistic missile attack.\n  Both distinguished missile experts and the media have opposed the \nAdministration's new secrecy policy which will classify previously \nunclassified materials regarding targets and countermeasures to be used \nin flight intercept test of the Ground-Based Mid-course Defense system.\n  Such secrecy is both undesirable and unnecessary. BMD development has \nbenefitted much from public scrutiny by physicists and other \nscientists, weapons experts, watchdog groups, and the press. Cutting \noff access would be clearly counterproductive. Philip Coyle, who served \nas Assistant Secretary of Defense and DOD's Director of Operational \nTest and Evaluation from 1994-2001 is one of the nation's foremost \nexperts on missile defense. He argues that it will take some 20 \ndevelopmental tests costing $100 million a piece and may take years \nbefore testing with realistic decoys can start. Coyle believes secrecy \nis premature since there's ``no danger'' the test program will be in a \nposition to ``give away any secrets'' for years to come.\n  Coyle also is dismayed that MDA is withholding information from the \nPentagon's own independent review offices, such as the Director of \nOperational Test and Evaluation. Current laws give the Director rights \nto unfettered access to all major DOD acquisition programs. Who can \nargue with Coyle when he says that if independent review of testing is \nstifled DOD itself won't be able ``to make reasonable judgements about \nthe program's viability.''\n  The final issue I want to raise is the matter of the adequacy of \ncurrent testing. Two years ago I joined Senator Durbin in introducing \nan amendment to require more realistic testing of the national missile \ndefense system. At the time I stated on the floor that missile defense \ntesting used at that time proved little or nothing: ``Current testing \ndetermines whether or not the system works against cooperative targets \non a test range. This methodology is insufficient to determine the \ntechnological feasibility of the system against likely threats. At \npresent, even if the tests had been hailed as total successes, they \nwould have proved nothing more than the system is unproven against real \nthreats. . . . Current testing does not take countermeasures into \naccount.''\n  Unfortunately, what I said was true 2 years ago is still true today. \nPhilip Coyle has recently said that the missile defense program ``is \nnot at the point where the types of decoys being used have even begun \nto be representative of the likely enemy countermeasures against \nmissile defense.'' He noted that so far the decoys used have been \n``round balloons which don't look at all like a target re-entry \nvehicle.'' Coyle who may know more about BMD testing than anyone, \nconcluded ``it may be the end of this decade before . . . testing with \n`real world decoys' can begin.''\n  The administration plans to rush a rudimentary missile defense system \ninto the field beginning in 2004. Few scientists believe that it will \nbe an effective system. Dr. David Wright, Senior Scientist, Union of \nConcerned Scientists and an MIT research physicist recently charged \nthat ``rather than waiting until the technical issues are addressed, it \nis rushing [to deploy] immature defense systems. . . . These systems \nwill not provide `emergency capability' against real-world threats, \nonly the illusion of capability.'' I couldn't agree more with Dr. \nWright.\n  I still agree with the U.S. intelligence community, noted scientists \nand missile experts that ballistic missiles are one of the least likely \nthreats we face. Much more probably threats are WMD attacks using \nplanes, boats, trucks, or suitcases. Eminent scientists are skeptical \nof Administration optimism about prospects for developing and quickly \ndeploying BMD. I fully share their skepticism.\n  The new DOD secrecy policy which will classify previously \nunclassified material regarding targets and countermeasure used in BMD \nis undesirable and indefensible. I strongly oppose MDA withholding \ninformation from the Pentagon's own independent review offices and \napplaud the Committee bill for requiring these offices to provide \nCongress and DOD with annual assessments of the military utility and \npotential operational effectiveness of major missile defense programs.\n  In conclusion, I believe in maintaining a strong national defense. We \nface a number of credible threats in the world today, including \nterrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We must \nmake sure we carefully identify the threats we face and tailor our \ndefense spending to meet them. We could do a better job of that than \nthis bill does, and I hope that as we move to conference, the committee \nwill make every effort to transfer funds from relatively low-priority \nprograms to those designed to meet the urgent and immediate anti-\nterrorism and defense of our forces.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate has \nagreed to accept an amendment to the Defense Department authorization \nbill which will protect small businesses that contract with our armed \nforces. I thank Senator Kerry for his leadership on this issue. I am \nproud to have worked with him on this amendment, on behalf of the men \nand women who are living the American dream by starting and growing \ntheir own businesses.\n  The amendment that I cosponsored with Senator Kerry is very simple. \nIt seeks to preserve opportunities for small businesses across the \ncountry to contract with the United States Army to provide goods and \nservices for our soldiers. The Secretary of the Army recently developed \na plan to consolidate procurement contracts. Our amendment requires the \nSecretary to report to Congress on the effect that this consolidation \nplan has on the participation of small businesses in Army procurement.\n  I share the Secretary's goal of getting the most for taxpayers' \nmoney. And I want to ensure that our procurement policies are \nefficient. But I believe that the best procurement policies enable all \nbusinesses, large and small, to compete for contracts. After all, any \neconomist will tell you that competition will drive prices down and \nquality up. When the Government consolidates many contracts into one \nenormous, unwieldy contract, it is nearly impossible for small or local \nbusinesses to compete.\n  I have met with many small business owners from Missouri who have \ntold me that they are anxious to provide quality goods and services to \nour military; but too often their businesses have been unable to \ncompete because we have bundled together so many diverse procurement \nneeds into one contract that only very large corporations have the \ncapacity to fill the entire contract. Such a system does not benefit \nour military or our taxpayers.\n\n[[Page S6224]]\n\n  I am a cosponsor of the Small Business Federal Contractor Safeguard \nAct, S. 2466. This legislation addresses the problem of consolidated or \nbundled contracts. Of course, the Government should do all it can to \ntake advantage of economies of scale in production or other benefits \nthat can result from a large contract with a single supplier. Nothing \nin our legislation would prevent large contracts that serve a genuine \neconomic purpose. However, I am concerned that too often contracts are \nbundled together simply for the sake of bureaucratic efficiency. This \nis a disservice to us all, and I am hopeful that the Senate will soon \nact on S. 2466.\n  I am concerned that the Army's decision to proactively consolidate \ncontracts is a step in the wrong direction. The Army has assured me \nthat they have considered the interests of small businesses. Our \namendment simply asks the Army to report back to Congress on their \nprogress as they reform their procurement policies. I hope that the \nreport will be filled with good news. I hope that we will learn of the \nArmy exceeding small business participation goals. I look forward to \nreading such a report. But I believe that it is imperative that we \nfollow this issue closely. We must ensure that our military is prepared \nto take full advantage of the tremendous opportunities available from \ncontracting with small businesses across the country.\n  I thank my colleagues for joining me in asking that the Secretary of \nthe Army provide us with this important report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken to the two managers, staffs on \nboth sides. It appears it would be better to vote now on final passage \nof this most important bill. I should alert all Members that later this \nafternoon, when Secretary Rumsfeld's briefing is completed, we will \nhave another vote on a resolution dealing with the Pledge of \nAllegiance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona?\n  Mr. KYL. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Would it be possible to lock in the vote at 3:15? I am \nsorry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to express my profound \nappreciation to the distinguished Senator from Michigan for his able \nassistance. We have worked together, this is our 24th year on bills of \nthis matter.\n  Again, I think we have achieved a bill which is in the best interest \nof the country. I thank you, sir. I thank all members of the Armed \nServices Committee. I thank all staff persons on the Armed Services \nCommittee, particularly my able assistant, the chief of staff on the \nRepublican side, Ms. Ansley, and her counterpart--maybe the word \n``counterpart'' is a little soft--her partner, David Lyles.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me thank my ranking member. I can't \nimagine having someone to work with who is better than Senator Warner. \nThis has been a long relationship and a trusting relationship. It makes \nall the difference in getting legislation addressed, much less passed \nin this body.\n  I thank my staff, David Lyles, and crew, Judy Ansley and her staff, \nwho, again, worked in a bipartisan way to make this bill happen, to \nmake it possible for us to pass it. I think this is almost record time. \nThis is only the second time in the last 10 years, I believe, where we \nhave been able to pass the Defense authorization bill prior to July 1.\n  We have resolved our differences in a way which has contributed to \nthe security of the Nation. We have had our disagreements. We are here \nto have disagreements, to try to resolve them, and where we can't \nresolve them by compromise, to have votes. That is what we have done. \nWe again succeeded.\n  I also thank our majority leader, Senator Daschle. I thank Senator \nLott, Senator Nickles, and particularly, I single out, to his \nembarrassment, again, Senator Reid of Nevada. He makes the wheels run \non this floor. He provides the oil and the grease which makes it \npossible for the wheels of this little buggy of ours to keep going. \nWithout him, I can't imagine how we would be able to function as \nefficiently as we do with all of the inefficiencies to which we all \nknow the Senate is subjected.\n  Mr. WARNER. I join my colleague in thanking our distinguished \nmajority leader and Republican leader, who worked hand in hand with us, \nand, indeed, the majority whip. I would only revise one thing about the \nmajority whip: He does use, as he drives the buggy, the whip. But he \nuses it judiciously and fairly. I received a little crack this morning \nmyself, as did one other colleague from the other side. It was equal.\n  At any rate, he succeeded, and I thank my dear friend. I have the \nutmost admiration for him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The deputy majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, working with these two experienced veterans, \ncompetent legislators has been a pleasure.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Agreement--S. 2690\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that \nimmediately, following the vote on passage of the DOD bill, the Senate \nproceed to consideration of S. 2690, introduced earlier today by \nSenator Hutchinson and others, which reaffirms the reference to one \nnation under God in the Pledge of Allegiance; further, I ask the bill \nthen be immediately read the third time, and the Senate proceed to a \nvote on passage of the bill with no intervening action or debate at \n3:20 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays on passage of S. 2690.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that rule XII, \nparagraph 4, be waived in relation to the Defense authorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays on final passage of S. 2514.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that S. 2514 be read the third time, \nand the Senate then vote on passage of S. 2514 without any intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for the third reading and was \nread the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill, as amended, pass?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) is necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 97, nays 2, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 165 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--97\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n\n[[Page S6225]]\n\n\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--2\n\n     Byrd\n     Feingold\n       \n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Helms\n       \n  The bill (S. 2514), as amended, was passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Yesterday's decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals in Newdow v. U.S. Congress was, in a word, outrageous. It is \ninexplicable that this man so seriously objected to his daughter having \nto listen and watch others recite the pledge at their school. Keep in \nmind, in this country no one can be forced to recite the Pledge of \nAllegiance. It is simply a matter of respect.\n  It is appalling that this court took the time and judicial resources \nto resuscitate this case which the district court had already dismissed \nfor failing to state a claim. This complaint was a mess. The plaintiff, \nDr. Newdow, who represented himself, asked a Federal court to order the \nPresident to change a law. The court took great pains to find a claim \nin Mr. Newdow's complaint and then to rule in his favor.\n  He did this at a time when Federal judicial resources are very \nstrained. The Nation is trying to function in the speedy manner \nrequired by the sixth amendment, with 89 judicial vacancies, a \nstaggering number, representing 10 percent of the Federal judiciary.\n  According to the Judicial Conference, in the past three decades, a \nU.S. Courts of Appeals judges' average caseload increased by nearly 200 \npercent. In light of these strained resources, it is appalling to me \nthat the court took time to resuscitate this very flawed case.\n\n[[Page S6226]]\n\n  The Pledge of Allegiance plays a very important part in the \ncitizenship experience of every American. It is part of the patriotic \nthread that weaves us all together in times of crisis and times of \ncelebration.\n  If the ninth circuit's interpretation of the establishment clause \nstands, many national ceremonies and celebrations will be negatively \nimpacted. Singing of songs with references to God on government \nproperty will be prohibited. For example, songs such as ``Star Spangled \nBanner,'' ``God Bless America,'' and ``America the Beautiful,'' which \nAmericans sing every Fourth of July on the steps of this building. But \nsuch references are not just important in ties of celebration. On \nSeptember 11 we stood on the steps of the Capitol and sang ``God Bless \nAmerica.'' Countless Americans uttered the phrase ``God Bless America'' \nand prayed together in public spaces. This ruling could prohibit that.\n  Judge Ferdinand Fernandez wisely dissented from this decision. His \nwords have been quoted before. He said it beautifully. Such phrases as \n``In God we trust'' or ``under God'' have no tendency to establish a \nreligion in this country or to suppress anyone's exercise or \nnonexercise of religion. He went on, in eloquent terms, and defends his \ndissent.\n\n  I believe this ruling will be soundly rejected. I was so pleased that \nyesterday the majority leader and the minority leader moved the Senate \nvery quickly in expressing its disapproval immediately following the \nruling yesterday. The Ninth Circuit is not unfamiliar with going out on \na limb, and the Supreme Court is not unfamiliar with striking it down. \nThis circuit is the most overturned circuit in the country.\n  There is certainly nothing wrong with pushing the envelope and using \nan original interpretation on novel issues of law, but this court \nrepeatedly makes rulings which countervail standing precedent. Instead \nof administering justice, it seems some judges in the ninth circuit are \nfar more interested in making social policy statements. It is not what \nthe Constitution asks them to do and it is not what the American people \npay them for.\n  The first amendment prohibits Congress from passing any law \nestablishing a religion. Coming as they did from a land with an \nestablished religion where those of other faiths were not well \ntolerated, they set the highest value on freedom of religion. But they \nwere not advocating freedom from religion.\n  By passing this legislation today the Senate will make clear that we \nunderstand the Founders' intention. We will reiterate our support for \nthe Pledge of Allegiance as codified and our national motto, ``In God \nwe trust.''\n  Finally, I commend the Judiciary Committee today in voting out the \nnomination of Lavenski Smith to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. \nLavenski Smith, who is from the State of Arkansas will make an \noutstanding jurist on the Federal bench. He is supremely well qualified \nas a former member of the Arkansas Supreme Court. He understands the \nproper role of the judiciary.\n  I applaud the committee's unanimous vote today. I believe if we did \nnot have the vacancies on the Federal bench to the extent that we now \nhave them, the decision from the Ninth Circuit would not have occurred. \nIn Judge Smith's confirmation hearings last month, he expressed his \nunshakable respect for an adherence to precedent. He said even when it \ngoes against his personal beliefs, he would follow precedence. Clearly, \nwe need people like Lavenski Smith on the bench.\n  I am pleased that the Judiciary Committee has taken this step. I am \nalso pleased that the Senate will, today, make clear to the Federal \njudiciary, our reaffirmation of our Pledge of Allegiance and our \nnational motto ``In God we trust.''\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nZell Miller be added as an original cosponsor on the bill on which we \nare about to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I would like to speak in support of \nthe legislation proposed by Senator Hutchinson from Arkansas. I am a \ncosponsor and helped draft this legislation. I would say this: This is \nnot an itty-bitty issue. This is a big issue. The Congress and States \nand cities have been expressing a desire to have, and be allowed to \nhave, an expression of faith in the public life of America. The courts \nhave been on a trend for decades now to constrict that.\n  The opinion out of the Ninth Circuit is not as aberrational as some \nwould think. The Supreme Court, in my view, has been inconsistent and \nunclear. It has cracked down on some very small instances of public \nexpression of faith. Our courts have made decisions such as \nconstraining a valedictorian's address at a high school. Certainly our \nprayer in schools has been rigorously constricted or eliminated in any \nkind of normal classroom setting, as has the prayer at football games.\n  I will just say we hope the courts will reconsider some of their \ninterpretations of the establishment clause and the free exercise \nclause of the first amendment and help heal the hurt in this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 3:20 has arrived.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I wish to announce this will be a final \nrollcall vote of the day and the week.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) On November 11, 1620, prior to embarking for the shores \n     of America, the Pilgrims signed the Mayflower Compact that \n     declared: ``Having undertaken, for the Glory of God and the \n     advancement of the Christian Faith and honor of our King and \n     country, a voyage to plant the first colony in the northern \n     parts of Virginia,''.\n       (2) On July 4, 1776, America's Founding Fathers, after \n     appealing to the ``Laws of Nature, and of Nature's God'' to \n     justify their separation from Great Britain, then declared: \n     ``We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, \n     Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness''.\n       (3) In 1781, Thomas Jefferson, the author of the \n     Declaration of Independence and later the Nation's third \n     President, in his work titled ``Notes on the State of \n     Virginia'' wrote: ``God who gave us life gave us liberty. And \n     can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have \n     removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of \n     the people that these liberties are of the Gift of God. That \n     they are not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed, I \n     tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just; that \n     his justice cannot sleep forever.''.\n       (4) On May 14, 1787, George Washington, as President of the \n     Constitutional Convention, rose to admonish and exhort the \n     delegates and declared: ``If to please the people we offer \n     what we ourselves disapprove, how can we afterward defend our \n     work? Let us raise a standard to which the wise and the \n     honest can repair; the event is in the hand of God!''.\n       (5) On July 21, 1789, on the same day that it approved the \n     Establishment Clause concerning religion, the First Congress \n     of the United States also passed the Northwest Ordinance, \n     providing for a territorial government for lands northwest of \n     the Ohio River, which declared: ``Religion, morality, and \n     knowledge, being necessary to good government and the \n     happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education \n     shall forever be encouraged.''.\n       (6) On September 25, 1789, the First Congress unanimously \n     approved a resolution calling on President George Washington \n     to proclaim a National Day of Thanksgiving for the people of \n     the United States by declaring, ``a day of public \n     thanksgiving and prayer, to be observed by acknowledging, \n     with grateful hearts, the many signal favors of Almighty God, \n     especially by affording them an opportunity peaceably to \n     establish a constitution of government for their safety and \n     happiness.''.\n       (7) On November 19, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln \n     delivered his Gettysburg Address on the site of the battle \n     and declared: ``It is rather for us to be here dedicated to \n     the great task remaining before us--that from these honored \n     dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they \n     gave the last full measure of devotion--that we here highly \n     resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain--that \n     this Nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom--\n     and that Government of the people, by the people, for the \n     people, shall not perish from the earth.''.\n       (8) On April 28, 1952, in the decision of the Supreme Court \n     of the United States in Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306 \n     (1952), in which school children were allowed to be excused \n     from public schools for religious observances and education, \n     Justice William O. Douglas, in writing for the Court stated: \n     ``The First Amendment, however, does not say that in every \n     and all respects there shall be a separation of Church and \n     State. Rather, it studiously defines the manner, the specific \n     ways, in which there shall be no concern or union or \n     dependency one on the other. That is the common sense of the \n     matter. Otherwise the State and religion would be aliens to \n     each other--hostile, suspicious, and even unfriendly. \n     Churches could not be required to pay even property taxes. \n     Municipalities would not be permitted to render police or \n     fire protection to religious groups. Policemen who helped \n     parishioners into their places of worship would violate the \n     Constitution. Prayers in our legislative halls; the appeals \n     to the Almighty in the messages of the Chief Executive; the \n     proclamations making Thanksgiving Day a holiday; `so help me \n     God' in our courtroom oaths--these and all other references \n     to the Almighty that run through our laws, our public \n     rituals, our ceremonies would be flouting the First \n     Amendment. A fastidious atheist or agnostic could even object \n     to the supplication with which the Court opens each session: \n     `God save the United States and this Honorable Court.' ''.\n       (9) On June 15, 1954, Congress passed and President \n     Eisenhower signed into law a statute amending the Pledge of \n     Allegiance to read: ``I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the \n     United States of America and to the Republic for which it \n     stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and \n     justice for all.''.\n       (10) On July 20, 1956, Congress proclaimed that the \n     national motto of the United States is ``In God We Trust'', \n     and that motto is inscribed above the main door of the \n     Senate, behind the Chair of the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, and on the currency of the United States.\n       (11) On June 17, 1963, in the decision of the Supreme Court \n     of the United States in Abington School District v. Schempp, \n     374 U.S. 203 (1963), in which compulsory school prayer was \n     held unconstitutional, Justices Goldberg and Harlan, \n     concurring in the decision, stated: ``But untutored devotion \n     to the concept of neutrality can lead to invocation or \n     approval of results which partake not simply of that \n     noninterference and noninvolvement with the religious which \n     the Constitution commands, but of a brooding and pervasive \n     devotion to the secular and a passive, or even active, \n     hostility to the religious. Such results are not only not \n     compelled by the Constitution, but, it seems to me, are \n     prohibited by it. Neither government nor this Court can or \n     should ignore the significance of the fact that a vast \n     portion of our people believe in and worship God and that \n     many of our legal, political, and personal values derive \n     historically from religious teachings. Government must \n     inevitably take cognizance of the existence of religion and, \n     indeed, under certain circumstances the First Amendment may \n     require that it do so.''.\n       (12) On March 5, 1984, in the decision of the Supreme Court \n     of the United States in Lynch v. Donelly, 465 U.S. 668 \n     (1984), in which a city government's display of a nativity \n     scene was held to be constitutional, Chief Justice Burger, \n     writing for the Court, stated: ``There is an unbroken history \n     of official acknowledgment by all three branches of \n     government of the role of religion in American life from at \n     least 1789. . . [E]xamples of reference to our religious \n     heritage are found in the statutorily prescribed national \n     motto `In God We Trust' (36 U.S.C. 186), which Congress and \n     the President mandated for our currency, see (31 U.S.C. \n     5112(d)(1) (1982 ed.)), and in the language `One Nation under \n     God', as part of the Pledge of Allegiance to the American \n     flag. That pledge is recited by many thousands of public \n     school children--and adults--every year... Art galleries \n     supported by public revenues display religious paintings of \n     the 15th and 16th centuries, predominantly inspired by one \n     religious faith. The National Gallery in Washington, \n     maintained with Government support, for example, has long \n     exhibited masterpieces with religious messages, notably the \n     Last Supper, and paintings depicting the Birth of Christ, the \n     Crucifixion, and the Resurrection, among many others with \n     explicit Christian themes and messages. The very chamber in \n     which oral arguments on this case were heard is decorated \n     with a notable and permanent--not seasonal--symbol of \n     religion: Moses with the Ten Commandments. Congress has long \n     provided chapels in the Capitol for religious worship and \n     meditation.''.\n       (13) On June 4, 1985, in the decision of the Supreme Court \n     of the United States in Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38 \n     (1985), in which a mandatory moment of silence to be used for \n     meditation or voluntary prayer was held unconstitutional, \n     Justice O'Connor, concurring in the judgment and addressing \n     the contention that the Court's holding would render the \n     Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional because Congress \n     amended it in 1954 to add the words ``under God,'' stated \n     ``In my view, the words `under God' in the Pledge, as \n     codified at (36 U.S.C. 172), serve as an acknowledgment of \n     religion with `the legitimate secular purposes of solemnizing \n     public occasions, [and] expressing confidence in the future.' \n     ''.\n       (14) On November 20, 1992, the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the 7th Circuit, in Sherman v. Community \n     Consolidated School District 21, 980 F.2d 437 (7th Cir. \n     1992), held that a school district's policy for voluntary \n     recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance including the words \n     ``under God'' was constitutional.\n       (15) The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals erroneously held, in \n     Newdow v. U.S. Congress, (9th Cir. June 26, 2002) that the \n     Pledge of Allegiance's use of the express religious reference \n     ``under God'' violates the First Amendment to the \n     Constitution, and that, therefore, a school district's policy \n     and practice of teacher-led voluntary recitations of the \n     Pledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional.\n       (16) The erroneous rationale of the 9th Circuit Court of \n     Appeals in Newdow would lead to the absurd result that the \n     Constitution's use of the express religious reference ``Year \n     of our Lord'' in Article VII violates the First Amendment to \n     the Constitution, and that, therefore, a school district's \n     policy and practice of teacher-led voluntary recitations of \n     the Constitution itself would be unconstitutional.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Madam President, I rise today to talk about forest \nmanagement, although I am certainly sad it has taken the current \ncatastrophic wildfires out West to get some attention on this issue.\n  On May 18, before most of the fires had started and were underway, I \nheld a field hearing for the Energy Committee in Golden, CO, to review \ncoordination of firefighting efforts. The four intergovernmental \nwitnesses all expressed serious concern that Colorado's unnaturally \ndense forests pose serious risk of unnaturally hot burning and \nunmanageable fires, increasing the danger to both people and property. \nUnfortunately, that worry became a very real, unimaginable reality for \nmuch of the West.\n  In our State alone just this year, we have had over 350,000 acres \nburn. As of yesterday, the Hayman fire east of I-25 between Denver and \nColorado Springs had burned in excess of 137,000 acres, much of it in \nthe all-important South Platte watershed of the City of Denver.\n  While the fire is now 70 percent contained, over 1,200 residents are \nat risk and many lost their homes. In fact, 618 homes and structures \nburned, and it has cost over $26 million so far in fighting this fire. \nThe Forest Service tells us much of this fire is in an area of diseased \nand stressed timber, some of which they have been attempting to clean \nup, but opponents are delaying this needed management through courtroom \nappeals and litigation.\n  It is important to note that large parts of the area that has burned \nare in the areas that were designated as roadless during the Clinton \nadministration, under the Clinton management plan.\n  We have the Million Fire near the little town of South Fork, CO, near \nWolf Creek Pass. That fire is not big by the standards of this summer, \nbut it has already consumed over 8,500 acres, and it is right on the \noutskirts of the town of South Fork. We have lost 13 homes and \nbuildings in that fire. The resource managers tell us it is burning in \nan area of spruce and ponderosa pine already killed by insects.\n  History shows many of proposed salvage sales on the Rio Grande \nNational Forest have also been opposed by opponents of cleaning the \nforests, and they have had difficulty getting proactive thinning and \nsanitation harvesting through the NEPA process. The agency tells us \nthat nearly 100 additional homes and commercial buildings are currently \nthreatened and that the town's watershed is also in the line of fire.\n  Finally, just near where I live in Durango, CO, what is called the \nMissionary Ridge fire, which I am sure you have seen on CNN and a \nnumber of other networks, is 15 miles from the town of Durango, CO--in \nfact, I can see it from my front porch--and it is burning that way. Ten \nsubdivisions are endangered, over 1,150 residences are being evacuated, \nand we have lost 71 homes and outbuildings. The municipal watersheds of \nthe towns of Durango and Bayfield are threatened, as well as numerous \nbusinesses, radio towers, and homes.\n  The interesting part of that fire is it is burning mostly in RARE II \nroadless areas. Last week, when I was home, the fire was only about 2 \nmiles from the city limits of the town of Durango with zero containment \nand certainly has had a devastating impact on the morale of the \ncommunity, on the structures, and on tourism, which is the backbone and \nmainstay of our economy.\n  All of those fires I have mentioned have really been eclipsed and \novershadowed by the huge fire in Arizona in the Coconino National \nForest, not far from the White River National Forest.\n  I am reminded of 1996, when there was an effort by the Forest Service \nto do some fuels reduction in the Coconino Forest. They were prevented \nfrom doing so by an environmental lawsuit under the Endangered Species \nAct which contended that the fuels reduction would disturb the goshawk, \na small hawk. Later that same year, there was a fire that did start in \nthat forest, and it destroyed everything in its path, including the \ngoshawk nests. Now we have almost the same catastrophic fire in the \nWhite River National Forest.\n  Time and again, we hear from Colorado firefighters who are frustrated \nthey can't seem to get ahead of the fires. I submit we cannot seem to \nget ahead of some of the lawsuits that block our responsible management \nof the forests, and we won't be able to get any place under control \nuntil we do. This year so far, we have had over 300 fires nationwide, \nand the fire season is just starting.\n  The science is certain: Thinning forests at natural levels \nsignificantly reduces the threat of wildfires. Yet the constant threat \nof environmental lawsuits has resulted in what has been described by \nthe Forest Service as ``analysis paralysis.'' The Forest Service is now \nforced to study and assess proposed actions, not for the right reasons, \nbut because of any potential action in the courts, in anticipation of a \nflurry of lawsuits and appeals by some extreme groups. Dale Bosworth, \nChief of the Forest Service, testified before our committee that they \nare now using over 40 percent of their agency work and a good deal of \ntheir resources, about $250 million a year, that could have gone to \nsave lives and property. Instead, they are using it to prepare for \ncourt actions against opponents of cleaning the forest.\n\n  Environmental groups are proud of that obstruction-through-litigation \nstrategy because every dollar we spend in litigating is one less dollar \nwe spend on managing the forest. They do acknowledge, however, that \nforests are unnaturally dense.\n  In Colorado, normally we have 50 trees per acre. But now we see \nstands of 200, 500, and 800 trees per acre, representing unmanageable \nfuel loads. Many of these trees are dying from insect infestation, \nwhich increases the fire risk. Yet environmentalists still oppose any \nthinning or removal of dead timber except if it is near homes or around \nhomes. They argue that thinning other parts of the forest grants \nunnecessary footholds for the ``big, bad'' timber industry that will \nravage the landscape. It is interesting that what they completely \nignore is that industry thinning on national forests is done under very \nclose scrutiny of the National Environmental Policy Act.\n  What about lawsuits in the name of animals? On the one hand, \nenvironmentalists sue land managers to keep them from thinning because \nthe action might disturb all manner of species. On the other hand, they \nignore the complete devastation that catastrophic\n\n[[Page S6229]]\n\nfires such as the ones we are experiencing do to the same species.\n  I spoke to one firefighter last week. He told me that the 150-foot \nflames in the Mission Ridge fire were traveling so fast and were so \nintense that birds in flight were actually being burned out of the air. \nCertainly, most small animals that are land animals have no chance at \nall. That includes the spotted owl, the red squirrel, Preble's meadow \njumping mouse, and hundreds of animals on the endangered species list.\n  In arguing against thinning, environmentalists also ignore the very \nreal long-term damage that large and intense fires have on soil and \nwatersheds. Over 70 percent of our Nation's water comes from \nwaterbodies in our forests. Yet, these environmental groups would \nprohibit thinning around watersheds, such as the South Platte project. \nI would have thought that they would support such efforts, especially \nafter the Buffalo Creek fire of 1996, which cost the city of Denver \nmillions of dollars to restore water quality.\n  Environmentalists oppose improving the safety of our watersheds \nbecause they fear losing the Clinton-era ``roadless rule,'' which \nprovides that no new roads can be built where none exist. Their prized \n``roadless rule'' effectively acts as a wilderness designation \nrequiring an act of Congress.\n  It is ironic that the ``roadless rule'' that environmentalists hold \nso dear was recently ruled illegal by a Federal judge in Idaho because \nthe public comment period was grossly inadequate, stating, ``Justice \nhurried on a proposal of this magnitude is Justice denied.''\n  I am a big supporter of grass roots initiatives--local communities \nshould be involved in land management decisions. Opportunities for \npublic comment and participation are important aspects of environmental \nlaw. However, these opportunities are being poisoned by radical groups \ntoo interested in legitimizing their own worth to contributors than in \ncollaboratively working for the betterment of our Nation's resources.\n  Some of these organizations have effectively paralyzed responsible \nforest management practices, thus contributing to poor forest health. \nIn fact, 73 million acres of national forest are at risk from severe \nwildland fires. In the West, more than half of the rangeland riparian \narea on the National Forest System do not meet standards for healthy \nwatersheds, and one in six acres in the Rocky Mountain and Plains \nstates is making no progress toward improvement. All this in the name \nof environmentalism.\n  Forest Service Chief Dale Bosworth recently acknowledged that the \nHayman Fire near Denver would not have been nearly as severe had forest \nthinning projects gone forward.\n  I am unwilling to allow our forest's health and environmental quality \nto continue deteriorating simply because a minority of environmental \norganizations have thrown science and good sense out of the window in \nthe name of their own political agenda while completely avoiding the \ntradgey of the 14 deaths of firefighters from the Storm King Fire of \n1994 or the recent loss of five firefighters in a bus wreck while on \ntheir way to fight fire in Colorado.\n  I have seen the negative effect that some environmental organizations \nhave had in the West for a long time. But enough is enough--something \nhas to change. It is unfortunate that it has taken tragic fires like \nthe ones raging out West to get the Nation and the media to acknowledge \nthe same.\n  I hope, as we move from this Congress to the next, we will look for \nmore positive ways to achieve responsible forest management.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the attention of a lot of people in the \nNorthwest and in the Midwest and in California has been drawn to the \npotential shutdown not just of the Amtrak passenger rail service, but \ncommuter rail service in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Wilmington, \nDelaware, Chicago, Los Angeles, and a lot of places in between.\n  Amtrak has sought to negotiate a loan from a consortium of private \nlenders. Literally in the middle of the negotiation, the administration \nput on the table its restructuring plan for Amtrak. That plan was, in \nmy view, a ``dismantling'' plan for Amtrak. That was the end of the \nnegotiations with the private lenders, for the most part.\n  Now Amtrak faces a difficult decision as to when to begin curtailing \nand shutting down its operations. When they do that, it will have a \ncascading effect on the operations of many commuter railroads in \nAmerica as well.\n  The Secretary of the Department of Transportation, Norman Mineta, was \nbefore one of our committees today testifying. Knowing him as an old \ncolleague and somebody who I respect, I think he is in a tough spot. I \nhave not been inside his heart to see what he would want to do in his \nheart. Given that independence, I think he would favor going ahead with \nthe loan guarantee, or support the Congress in going through and \nincluding a $200 million emergency supplemental for Amtrak. The \nadministration, which created this crisis before us, is now still in a \nvery good position to end the crisis, the threat. They can do that by \nsaying, yes, we will provide the full loan guarantee, or we will \nsupport the appropriation from the Congress.\n  Our thanks to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator \nByrd, and Senator Stevens, the ranking Republican, for their \nwillingness to support $200 million in the emergency supplemental to \nhelp us get through this difficult time, and later this fall we will \nresolve more fully the passenger rail service in this country.\n  I have said for a long time--and I will say it again today--the \nproblem with passenger rail service in this country is we have never \nprovided adequate capital support for passenger rail service. We need \nto do that, to find an earmark source of revenue. I hope in the months \nto come we will debate that and come to a consensus on that point.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/27/senate-section/article/S6229-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6229-S6230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 3009\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, we have had a number of discussions with \nrespect to how many conferees the Senate would want to have involved in \nthis very important conference that will deal with trade issues on \nwhich we spent a great deal of time in the Senate, including the Andean \ntrade authority, as well as the overall large trade assistance bill and \nthe Trade Promotion Act--three very important pieces included in this \none bill.\n  As we look at this, I think this is going to be one of the most \nimportant conferences we are going to deal with this year.\n  The House has a small number of conferees to the underlying bill, but \nthey have a number of conferees to different sections to the bill. I \nsuspect there is a total number of House conferees involved that would \nprobably run in the 18 range.\n  We have members of the Finance Committee who worked very hard on this \nimportant legislation, and I had\n\n[[Page S6230]]\n\nhoped that we could get an 8-to-7 or 7-to-6 ratio, or at minimum 6 to 5 \nto accommodate members of the Finance Committee who are on the \nsubcommittee of jurisdiction and who have put a lot of work into this. \nI have even tried to say: OK, maybe we can make it work at 5 to 4, but \nwe have not been able to get that worked out.\n  I think for the Senate to be limited to only five conferees on a bill \nof this magnitude and as complicated as this is, and as many people who \nworked so hard on it, that it would not be an acceptable arrangement at \nthis time.

It needs to be \nconsidered in the full light of day with amendments in order. We did \nhave a full consideration of the bill in the Commerce Committee with \namendments offered. Some were adopted and some were rejected. I voted \nfor the legislation.\n  We need to move forward on the reform of Amtrak. We are in the \nprocess of putting additional money in Amtrak right now, and I support \nboth the loan the administration is working out and perhaps additional \nmoney in the supplemental.\n  Having said that, I do note also that we have to make tough choices. \nDo we want a national rail passenger system or not? If we do, we have \nto figure out what kind of reforms we can put in place that will save \nmoney or provide additional money; what lines are we going to keep open \nand keep running or not; if and how much we are going to have to pay \nfor it.\n  If the American people, through their Representatives and Senators, \ndo not want to vote for additional funds, then that is one choice. I \nspoke passionately on the floor in 1997 when we passed Amtrak reform \nlegislation. I made a commitment on this floor and to the American \npeople that I supported this because I thought it could become self-\nsupporting. I was wrong. I have to admit that. Now the question is, Do \nwe want to continue to have Amtrak or not? I think we should. I still \nthink it is an important mode of transportation we should not \nsacrifice.

These are nominations that are pending in the \nSenate, not in the Judiciary Committee. They are ready for \nconsideration by the entire Senate with only one exception; I know of \nno objections.\n\n[[Page S6231]]\n\n  I will be giving a statement with regard to this matter later, but in \nconsideration of Senator Reid's and others' time, I thought I would \nmake this unanimous consent request first and make my statement on this \nmatter later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as we speak, there are negotiations going on \nat the White House dealing with a wide range of appointments and \nnominations. I hope this can be worked out. I was confident a day or \ntwo ago that the majority leader and the Republican leader, together \nwith the White House, had worked something out on nominations on which \nwe could move forward, but that did not come to be. We also know there \nis someone on the other side of the aisle who has asked that we on his \nbehalf object, and I am doing that now. I object.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection has been heard.\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I understand there may be another unanimous \nconsent request in a moment, but it could lead to some discussion back \nand forth, so at this time I yield myself leader time so I can address \nthe issue that was just objected to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate, the American people, and the \nHouse of Representatives have all expressed their outrage at the \ndecision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals yesterday which ruled \nthat the Pledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional because it contains \nthe phrase ``under God.'' People are understandably stunned and find it \nnot only unbelievable, but indefensible.\n  Senators and the American people are shocked that two Federal circuit \njudges were capable of making such an absurd decision. The fact that \nthey did points up, once again, how vitally important these Federal \njudicial appointments are in guiding not only the country's present, \nbut its future as well. Judges are important at every level, but \nparticularly at the appellate court, the circuit court level.\n  This preposterous decision about the Pledge of Allegiance, which \nSenators have been outraged about, was handed down by three circuit \ncourt judges who voted 2-1 that reciting the Pledge violated the \nConstitution's Establishment Clause protections.\n  I should note that the vigorous dissent in the case was filed by \nJudge Ferdinand Fernandez, who was appointed by the first President \nBush, and who went into great detail since echoed by many members of \nthis chamber--as to why the other two judges views and reading of the \nlaw are both unfounded and inappropriate.\n  An interesting fact about these three judges is that two of the three \nare actually on senior status which means they are not considered \nactive judges and are semi-retired. The fact that semi-retired judges \nwere deciding is an indication in and of itself that there are problems \nin this circuit court and there are clearly major problems in the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals.\n  Mr. President, we have been arguing for years about how the Ninth \nCircuit should be changed. It is a huge circuit which includes not only \nHawaii and California, but Nevada, Arizona, Idaho, Oregon, Washington, \nand Montana as well. It is not surprising that the states in the \ncircuit also have very different cultural views of the world. \nTherefore, geographically and ideologically, many Senators encompassed \nby the Ninth Circuit want it split into at least two, if not three, \ncircuits.\n  The Ninth Circuit is also by far the court that has been reversed the \nmost by the United States Supreme Court. Indeed, the 9th Circuit \ndecisions that have been reviewed by the Supreme Court have been \nreversed over 80% of the time over the last 6 years. And these have not \nbeen close cases in the Supreme Court either. On average, the Ninth \nCircuit's decisions have received just two votes from the Supreme \nCourt's nine justices.\n  Mr. President, I should also point that one of the judges who did \ndecide to hold that the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag is \nunconstitutional was Stephen Reinhardt. This active judge, who was \nappointed in the last year of Jimmy Carter's Presidency, holds the \nrecord for the most unanimous reversals by the Supreme Court in a \nsingle court term--five. He has been reversed a total of 11 times since \nthe court's 1996-1997 term. He has been involved in such infamous, \nridiculous decisions as striking down California's ``three strikes and \nyou're out'' criminal law this spring. He has a long record of other \nextremely unpopular and, in my opinion, inaccurate and unfounded \ninterpretations of the law and/or the Constitution. So, this judge has \nengaged in a pattern of using his position on the court to become an \nactivist for social change instead of interpreting the law as passed \nand voted on by Congress or as written by the Nation's Framers.\n\n  Twenty-eight active judges are authorized for the Ninth Circuit and \nfive of those seats are vacant. Due to the heavy caseload in the \nCircuit, all five of those vacancies have been declared judicial \nemergencies by the Administrative Office of the Courts. President Bush \nhas nominated individuals to fill three of those five vacancies, one \nfrom Hawaii who is supported by both of the Democrat Senators from his \nstate has pending on the Executive Calendar since May 16, another from \nCalifornia has been held up in the Committee since June 22nd of last \nyear without even a hearing, and the third from Nevada has been in the \nCommittee for two months.\n  As we can see from this case that has everyone up in arms, these \ncircuit judges do make a difference, and that is why President Bush's \nCircuit Court nominees are being held up. He and I agree that we should \nnot be putting judges on the appellate courts who will render decisions \nsuch as this. The judgment of such judges really has to be questioned \nby the vast majority of Americans.\n  Despite the vacancies and the judicial emergencies on the Ninth \nCircuit and all the federal circuits, the Senate continues to have a \nproblem confirming judges without undue and unjustifiable delay. There \nare some 45 judicial nominees pending before the Senate at one level or \nanother. Yet, we have not confirmed one judge since before the Memorial \nDay Recess.\n  As I have already noted, as of this morning, there were 15 judges on \nthe Executive Calendar who are ready to go if a few Senators would only \nlet them. Three of the 15 are Circuit Court judges. And there are \nseveral circuits around the country that are having real problems \nhandling their caseloads because they do not have enough judges to fill \nall of their seats--indeed one circuit, the Sixth, has half of its 16 \njudgeships vacant.\n  Around the country there are 89 judicial vacancies. Thirty-one are \nCircuit Court vacancies, 17 of which have been declared judicial \nemergencies by the Administrative Office of the Courts and the \nJudiciary Committee is holding 11 nominees President Bush has named to \nfill those 17 emergencies. There are currently 57 vacancies at the \nDistrict Court level, 18 of which have been declared judicial \nemergencies.\n  I expect we are going to hear arguments back and forth about the \nnumbers, well, it is because you guys did not confirm enough judges \nduring the President Clinton's last 2 years. But whatever the history \nmay have been, we have a problem now with our circuits that must and \ncan be fixed.\n  Mr. President, another example of how important these judicial \nappointments can be and what the effect on the nation can be is the \ndecision handed down by the Supreme Court today by a 5-4 vote upholding \nCleveland's school voucher program. Frankly, I was amazed it was that \nclose. Again, it points up the importance of even a single judge on the \nSupreme Court or on a circuit court.\n  I think that says a lot about the real reasons behind what is going \non in the Committee with the President's judicial nominees. There are a \nnumber of people in the Senate who say that if the President tries to \nput a conservative, strict constructionist judge on the Supreme Court \nwho will follow the law and not write it from the bench as the judges \ndid in the Pledge of Allegiance case they are going to oppose him no \nmatter how temperamentally, professionally, intellectually, or \nethically qualified he or she is.\n\n  However, as I have said before, many of us on this side of the aisle, \nvoted for\n\n[[Page S6232]]\n\nJustice Ginsburg when she went through the Senate when President \nClinton was in office. We knew we would not agree with most if not all \nof her future decisions but we felt we had to admit that she was \ncompetent, ethical, and qualified for the job despite our \nphilosophically differences with her.\n  There are several other Clinton judges, particularly one or two out \nin the California circuit, that I voted whose future decisions I will \nprobably live to regret for as long as I live. But there is something \nworse than bad judges, I guess, and that is no judges, which then \nexpands the power of the bad judges like Judge Goodwin and Judge \nReinhardt that are on the Circuit Courts of Appeal now.\n  I will take a moment to note that the Supreme Courts 5-to-4 decision \non school vouchers will prove immensely important to thousands of low-\nincome parents whose children are trapped in failing schools. Low-\nincome children need an education even more than other children since \nit is often their only means of escaping poverty for the rest of their \nlives. So, when public schools are not succeeding, they and their \nparents shouldn't be sentenced to failure year after year. They deserve \na system and a process that offers them a hand up, and if need be a \nhand out of a failing school, to find another avenue to succeed. The \nSupreme Court upheld a process where the money that is being expended \non their child in a failing school, or in a school that is drug \ninfested or riddled with crime, can be used instead to lift the child \nout of the failure and into a setting where they can get an real \nacademically sound education. Is that such an awful result for the \nthousands of low-income children trapped in dysfunctional and failing \nschools?\n  In Philadelphia, PA, I understand the State has taken over the \nrunning of the public schools. What a tragedy.\n  When Cleveland's system was failing, the city seized the initiative \nto try and improve things, and so have other areas. In this Cleveland's \ncase, they put in place a voucher program that is working. It is \nhelping children get an education that will last the rest of their \nlives.\n  Mr. President, getting back to the absurd decision in San Francisco, \nit is easy for us all to say the Pledge of Allegiance with gusto and \nmean it, but we need to look behind this decision--how in the world it \nhappened. It is that America's voters understand that these Federal \njudgeships, and who fills them, do make a difference in the kind of \nsociety that not only will we live in, but our children's children will \nlive in. That is why I have tried to find a way to get an agreement to \nmove the President's eminently qualified nominees.\n  Senator Daschle and I have been talking about it for about 3 weeks. I \nthought we had it all worked out. I think, frankly, we did have it \nworked out, but now our friend Senator McCain says he is going to \nobject to any and all nominations until he gets some sort of guarantee \nwith regard to a nominee for the Federal Election Commission (FEC). Her \nnomination was not agreed to for 5 months, and now that the President \nhas started the routine vetting process in order to formally send her \nnomination to the Senate, Senator McCain is saying that if the \nnomination is not moved on immediately, he is going to hold up every \nsingle nomination pending in the Senate.\n\n  The investigation and FBI clearance process, for all nominees--and \nthis is a Democrat nominee--usually takes about 2 months now and she \nwill have to go through that process the same as everyone else. So, the \nPresident could not appoint her right now if he wanted to. She has not \nhad the clearance check. So, evidently every nominee is going to be \nheld up today, this week, and all of July over a single nominee to the \nFEC. That means that lifetime appointments of Federal judges on the \ncircuit and district courts, both Democrat and Republican, some who \nhave been waiting for a year or more, will have to wait for months on \nthis single nominee who could not be confirmed today even if everyone \nwas in agreement about her.\n  I do not get it, Mr. President. I think this is a real sad commentary \nand not becoming, quite frankly, of the Senate, if she should allow \nthis unjustifiable obstruction of all nominees to occur.\n  I have made an effort, as has Senator Daschle. I thought we had made \nreal progress and were ready to go forward with an agreement that would \nmove nonjudicial nominations, judicial nominees, marshals, U.S. \nattorneys, and a lot of folks who have been waiting a long time. Then \nwe hit a stone wall yet again.\n  I had hoped that one way to do overcome this obstacle would be to \nmove these nominees en bloc. As everyone knows, I do not usually move \nto Executive Calendar nominations on my own because that is normally \nthe majority leader's prerogative, but if all else fails, you have to \ntake advantage of whatever avenue is available to you.\n  I hope the American people, and the Senate, will take another look at \nthese judicial nominations--and how we can move them and get them \nconfirmed. If it is a continuation of tit for tat when will it ever \nend? Maybe it will fall to my lot--no pun intended--to some day say \nthat we are going to end this, and we are going to move these \nnominations unless there is a big ethical problem or they are obviously \nnot qualified.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Before the Republican leader leaves, I am not going to give \na long statement regarding judicial appointments because I have done \nthat on a number of occasions. Suffice it to say, the majority leader \nwent through this. As has been said by the majority leader, and I have \nsaid it on a number of occasions, this is not tit for tat, this is not \npayback time.\n\n  I served and practiced law for many years and argued cases before the \nNinth Circuit. I have two sons in the Ninth Circuit--Leif Reid is the \nadministrative assistant for the circuit judge; the other was a law \nclerk to the chief judge--and I am familiar with the circuit. There are \nvery fine men and women serving in that court. I am not here today to \ndefend in any way President Nixon's appointment to the court or \nPresident Carter's appointment to the court the two people who wrote \nthat decision. We would all acknowledge it is wrong. I am confident \nthat the Ninth Circuit, when they meet en banc, will stay that decision \nmade by the two judges.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that upon completion of the county \nreform bill, the Senate proceed to immediate consideration of Calendar \nNo. 414, S. 2039, the National Aviation Capacity Expansion Act for \n2002.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. It is unfortunate we cannot get consent to move forward \nwith this bill. It is a bill that enjoys strong bipartisan support.\n  In April, the Commerce Committee voted 19 to 4 in favor of this very \nimportant legislation. More than 60 Senators indicated their support by \nsending a letter to the two leaders asking for this bill to come before \nthe Senate immediately. I simply believe this is a national priority. I \nhave flown into O'Hare many times and understand how busy and important \nthat airport is for the country, not just for the people of Illinois. I \nbelieve we have the votes to pass this bill and to do so very quickly.\n  I say to my friend, the junior Senator from Illinois, to object to \nthis point only delays the inevitable and stands in the way of \naddressing a national aviation capacity problem in the Chicago region \nwhich affects the whole country. It jeopardizes jobs and stalls \neconomic development. I am very disappointed.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the majority whip for the unanimous consent \nrequest and would like to ask him a question as to whether he has any \nplans or discussion with the majority leader in reference to proceeding \non this matter.\n\n  Mr. REID. I have spoken to the majority leader on several occasions. \nThis legislation enjoys strong support and is a priority for the \nmajority leader. It is fair to say the majority leader will use all \nappropriate avenues to bring this legislation to final passage.\n  When an impressive coalition and supermajority of the Senate, labor,\n\n[[Page S6233]]\n\nbusiness, aircraft controllers, pilots, airlines, general aviation, and \nfive former Secretaries of Transportation write, call, or in some way \nvisit with the majority leader in support of this legislation, it is \nhard for the majority leader to ignore this, I respond to my friend.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the majority whip will continue to yield, the purpose \nof this unanimous consent request was to make it clear on the record \nwhat I personally believed would occur when my colleague from the State \nof Illinois objected. There were some who said that would not happen, \nthat once this bill had been reported from the committee, had gone \nthrough the regular order, with two hearings before the Senate Commerce \nCommittee, on which my colleague from Illinois serves, a hearing both \nin Chicago as well as in Washington, when ample opportunity had been \ngiven both sides to present their point of view, when amendments were \nconsidered and offered by my colleague from Illinois, when the final \nvote on the committee was a substantial bipartisan vote of 19 to 4, it \nwas the belief--and I am sorry to say the mistaken belief--of some of \nmy colleagues in the Senate that my colleague from Illinois would \naccept a debate on this issue and would accept the consequences, up or \ndown.\n  Apparently that is not to be the case. It leads us in a position, \ntoday, where those colleagues on the floor who have any doubt in their \nmind should have it dispelled. The objection by the Senator from \nIllinois makes it clear that he is prepared to delay this as long as \npossible.\n  The Senator from Nevada has put his finger on the issue. What is at \nstake is the safety of O'Hare, the world's busiest airport. What is at \nstake is the efficiency of that airport. What is at stake are hundreds \nof thousands of jobs in Illinois and literally the future of our \neconomy. That may sound like hyperbole from a Senator, but what I have \nsaid is supported by the Chamber of Commerce on a national and State \nbasis, the national AFL-CIO and the State AFL-CIO, all of the major \nbusiness organizations, economic development organizations which \nsupport this bill and oppose the position taken by the junior Senator \nfrom Illinois.\n  This is not a bill just being offered by me but, rather, with the \ncooperation and the active participation of my colleague, Senator \nGrassley of Iowa, Senator Harkin as well, and a bipartisan coalition. \nAs the majority whip has noted, 61 Senators have signed on in support \nof this bill and sent a letter to the majority leader and Republican \nleader to indicate that support. My junior colleague from the State of \nIllinois certainly does not have that kind of support. He has said he \nis going to try to delay this and try to avoid it for as long as \npossible.\n  In making this unanimous consent and making this statement, I hope it \nis clear on the record that at this point in time we will use any \nappropriate means to bring this issue forward. We will not be enslaved \nby the threat of filibuster. I say to my colleague from the State of \nIllinois, if he will accept a debate on this issue for a reasonable \nperiod of time, offer the amendments, and bring it up for a vote, I \nwill accept the consequences. Let the Senate make its decision, yes or \nno. If the merits of his argument are compelling, he will succeed. If \nthey are not compelling, he will lose. The same is true for my \nposition. That is the nature of the legislative body. It is the nature \nof fair play. I hope my colleague from the State of Illinois will \nreconsider his dedication to these delays.\n\n\n                         Ninth Circuit Opinion\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while I still have the floor, I will respond \nmore specifically to my friend, but I want to go off subject a little \nbit with some good news.\n  As I just stated, I had a couple of sons who worked the Ninth \nCircuit. My son Leif Reid is administrative assistant to the Ninth \nCircuit. He just called the cloakroom and indicated the Ninth Circuit \nstayed the order that was issued yesterday. The pledge is intact. He is \nfaxing me the opinion of the court.\n  I am, frankly, amazed they did it as quickly as they did, but I am \nhappy they did this.\n  Back to O'Hare, again I am speaking--and I rarely do this, but on \nthis occasion I am speaking for the majority leader of the Senate, Tom \nDaschle. Senator Daschle has authorized me to say to Senator Durbin \nthat he will use all his options, all the options of the Senate, to \npass this legislation this year.\n  On behalf of the many people who support this legislation, I say to \nmy friend, Senator Durbin, he has done great work on this issue. I \nappreciate the support of Senator Grassley and Senator Harkin but \nespecially the Senator from Illinois for his hard work on behalf of \nfrustrated fliers everywhere. We have frustrated fliers at McCarran in \nLas Vegas, the sixth busiest airport in America. This is unfortunate to \nfrustrated fliers. When fliers at O'Hare are less frustrated, we have \nmore people coming to Las Vegas. It affects not only the Chicago area, \nthe State of Illinois, but the entire country. That is a massive \nairport and is a feeder to the rest of the world.\n  I salute Senator Durbin for such patience. The Senate is going to act \non this legislation in some way. There are ways to do this. We are \ngoing to do it in some way, shape, or form, and we will do it as \nquickly as we can. The Senator has the full support of the majority \nleader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized for 10 minutes \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I again thank my colleague from the State \nof Nevada. Let me explain for a moment what the issue is before us so \nthose who are not familiar with it can come to understand it. O'Hare is \npretty well known across America. It is our busiest airport. In the \nyear 2001, despite September 11, it turned out to have more flights and \npassengers than virtually any airport in America.\n  But O'Hare is an airport that was designed and built in 1959, 43 \nyears ago, with an anticipated annual volume of 20 million passengers. \nIt now has some 67 million passengers annually. The runways that were \ndesigned in 1959 were designed to standards and expectations of that \nera--standards and expectations that have changed dramatically.\n  What we have seen in 43 years is larger planes, more frequent \nflights, changes in air traffic control. All of these have challenged \nO'Hare and every airport in the country to modernize. But O'Hare has \nbeen stuck with the same runway configuration now for over 40 years.\n  Part of it has to do with politics because in my State of Illinois \nthe Governor has the final word when it comes to the construction of \nairports. Politically, it meant that a Democratic mayor of Chicago and \na Republican mayor from some other part of our State would rarely find \ncommon ground or agreement on the future of O'Hare. But last year, \nthere was finally a breakthrough. Gov. George Ryan, a Republican, and \nMayor Richard Daley of Chicago, a Democrat, came to an agreement about \nhow to change O'Hare, modernize it, improve it, and make it safer. Many \npeople thought it could not occur, but it did happen, and because of \nthat decision and because of that agreement we now have a chance to \nmake that airport modern and safe by 21st century standards.\n  Some say that seems to be obvious. Who would object to it? It turns \nout that a handful of communities around O'Hare naturally are concerned \nabout the prospects of changing flight patterns or expanding service to \nthat airport. They would object, as one might expect.\n  The elected officials in that area created a coalition to oppose \nthese changes at O'Hare. My colleague in the Senate, the junior Senator \nfrom Illinois, has announced his opposition to any plans to change \nO'Hare. I understand that. But there comes a moment in time when you \nhave to say: What is in the best interests of our entire State? What is \nin the best interests of the region? What is in the best interests of \nthe Nation?\n  I think what the people of Illinois have said in overwhelming numbers \nis they believe this historic agreement is in our best interests. We \nhave the support, as I mentioned earlier, of the National Chamber of \nCommerce, the Illinois State Chamber of Commerce, the National AFL-CIO, \nthe Illinois State AFL-CIO, the Airline Pilots Association, the air \ntraffic controllers, general\n\n[[Page S6234]]\n\naviation, virtually all major airlines. They have all signed onto this.\n  So as some might suggest, this is a unanimous opinion of the experts \nin aviation that this plan moving forward makes sense.\n  Of course, every item in the planned agreement between the Governor \nand the mayor would be subject to the same types of scrutiny and \nrestriction as any other airport design. What I have here is the report \nof the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, which \npresents this bill, S. 2039, to the Senate. They make it clear here in \nprecise language:\n       Nothing in the bill guarantees any funding for the O'Hare \n     or Peotone project, or mandates that a specific set of runway \n     configurations be approved, as the FAA retains all its \n     existing discretion to analyze, review, and, if all relevant \n     tests are met, approve the O'Hare project.\n\n  They go on to to say:\n\n       The FAA has discretion to modify the plan, if necessary, \n     for efficiency, safety, or other concerns.\n\n  It says of the bill that it:\n\n       Requires any redesign plan to conform with the Clean Air \n     Act and to conform with all other environmental mandates to \n     the maximum extent possible, while requiring the State use \n     its customarily practices to analyze any Clean Air Act \n     requirements.\n\n  And it goes on to say this bill:\n\n       Provides no Federal priority for federal funding of any \n     O'Hare projects, including the runway design plan.\n\n  My colleague will stand up here and tell you what I said is a lie; it \nis not true. But what I put before you is the report of his committee, \nwhich says in black and white that the FAA has the last word. The FAA \ncan reject it. The FAA can say this runway plan will not work. He can \nstand here, as he has repeatedly, and say those words are not true. I \nstand behind the committee, his committee, and the report they have \ngiven to the Senate.\n  I think what they have said is true because I wrote the bill and I \nknow what is in it. When the Senator from Illinois offered an amendment \nin committee and said: I want to make sure the FAA has the last word, \nwe said we will take the amendment. We accept it. Still, it is not \nenough.\n  It has really come down to the point where it will never be enough \nwhen it comes down to what my colleague is asking for in this bill.\n  We have a situation where we have 61 Senators here who have signed \nonto a letter to the leadership, saying they are prepared to move \nforward on this bill. I can tell you an additional two Senators this \nweek have told me they are prepared to support this as well. Another 10 \nSenators on the Republican side of the aisle have said they will \nsupport it when it comes to a vote. So the vote will be substantial.\n  The question before us, though, is when and where this will take \nplace. The Senator from Illinois, my colleague, has made it clear by \nhis objection that he is prepared to filibuster this bill. He has said \nas much--in Illinois and here in Washington. It is no great surprise.\n  But some of my colleagues in the Senate have said: Oh, no, he won't \ndo that; when it is all over, he is going to bring it up and offer his \namendments and take a vote and then it will all be over.\n  I said: No, I don't think so. Let's go ahead and make this unanimous \nconsent request so it is clear on the record his intention and design \nto lead this to a filibuster, and I think we have done that today. In \nthe course of doing that, I think what we have established is that we \nhave to find whatever appropriate means are available, working to bring \nthis issue for a vote in the Senate.\n  I am prepared to accept the decision of the Senate on this issue. I \nthink that is why we are elected to this body, to bring our best ideas \nforward and say to the assembled Senators: We hope you will support us. \nIf you do not, then it is understood we have lost our day, our \nopportunity. But I think now, in the best interests of safety at \nO'Hare, hundreds of thousands of jobs in our State, and the best \ninterests of business in the region, that we should pass this bill as \nquickly as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I come to the floor just to compliment \nthe distinguished Senator from Illinois for his determination and the \neffort that he continues to make to ensure success. I will guarantee \nthat before the end of this session, one way or the other, we are going \nto resolve this successfully. We will do whatever it takes to ensure \nthat the people of Illinois, the business community at and around \nO'Hare and the tremendous service it provides are protected and that \nthe priority it deserves is given on the Senate floor.\n  The Senator from Illinois has been relentless in his determination \nand in his advocacy. He has spoken in the caucus on countless \noccasions, in leadership, and on the Senate floor. I just wanted to \nassure him publicly, as I have privately, that we will continue to work \non this until we get it done. It will happen.\n  I am convinced that 95, maybe 98 Senators support what the Senator \nfrom Illinois is attempting to do. I have every confidence that once we \nget to the vote, it is going to be overwhelming. So I will assure the \nSenator that we will continue to work with him and find a way to do it \nand make sure that it gets done in a time that will send the right \nmessage to the people of Illinois, the people of Chicago, the people \nwho are concerned about safety, concerned about jobs, concerned about \neconomic development--that the Senate understands that and, thanks to \nthe leadership of the Senator from Illinois, we are going to deliver.\n  I simply wanted to add my voice to the many who support the Senator's \nefforts. I appreciate very much his coming to the floor this afternoon, \nagain, to reiterate the extraordinary importance that this issue and \nthis project has for the people of his State. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I express my appreciation for this \nexpression of personal support from the majority leader. I thank him. \nHe has been cooperative from the start. He understands, as we all do, \nthis is not a Chicago issue. This is a national issue. It is an issue \nthat Senators across the Nation understand as we sit, hour after weary \nhour, in airports, wondering: What is wrong at O'Hare now?\n  What is wrong is a 40-year-old runway design that needs to be \nmodernized; it needs to be safer; it needs to be improved. We cannot \nallow this issue to die. For the good of that airport, for national \naviation, for jobs in Illinois, stopping this bill is a job killer in a \nState that needs jobs desperately. Stopping this bill is a business \nkiller in a State that desperately needs businesses to expand. Stopping \nthis bill is putting a dagger in the heart of the single most important \npublic works project in the history of our State. I am not going to let \nthat happen without a fight. I am happy to have the majority leader in \nmy corner.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I would like to respond to what my colleague from \nIllinois just said. I think there are a number of points that were \nglossed over.\n  I do oppose Senator Durbin's bill with respect to O'Hare. Mr. Durbin \nsaid it is necessary to pass this bill in order to expand O'Hare \nAirport. But I would point out that never in the history of our \ncountry, that I am aware of, has any airport in this country had a \nspecial bill mandating that the FAA approve its particular expansion \nplans.\n  The fact is, if Mayor Daley of Chicago wants to expand O'Hare \nAirport, he can simply file an application with the FAA to expand \nO'Hare Airport. The trouble is, if that were the case--if Mayor Daley \nwere simply to file an application similar to all the other airports in \nthe country--his application would have to be judged on the mere \nmerits.\n  So Senator Durbin and Mayor Daley came up with the idea of drafting a \nstatute. They put that into bill form and are now asking Congress to \npass it.\n  The purpose of that bill is twofold:\n  No. 1, the bill would straightjacket the FAA so that they would have \nno choice but to approve Mayor Daley's specific runway design at O'Hare \nAirport.\n\n  I could go on for a very long time. But maybe I will save that for a \nlater date to tell you why it is in fact a bad runway design that Mayor \nDaley is trying to mandate in Federal law.\n\n[[Page S6235]]\n\n  The bill of Senator Durbin--I don't care what the committee report \nsays--says that the FAA shall implement a Federal policy in favor of \napproving six parallel runways running in the east-west direction at \nO'Hare Airport. It says east-west. It is very specific.\n  I take issue with my colleague's comments or suggestions that the FAA \ncould change it. In fact, it would be illegal for the FAA to reposition \nthose runways in a northwest-southeast direction. Mayor Daley's and \nSenator Durbin's exact runway design will be locked into Federal \nstatutory law if my colleague's bill passes.\n  That is one of the objectives my colleague has. He wants to \nstraightjacket the FAA, put a gun to the FAA's head, and force them to \napprove a bad runway design that has never been reviewed by any Federal \naviation expert. It has never been tested in any modeling. In fact, it \nappears to be the back-of-a-napkin design.\n  Mayor Daley was before the Senate Commerce Committee, and he admitted \nthat the city of Chicago had never itself done any studies to back up \nthat design.\n  There is another goal my colleague is trying to accomplish with S. \n2039. Right now, the city of Chicago has the power to condemn lands \naround O'Hare Airport and communities around O'Hare Airport, provided \nMayor Daley gets a permit from the State of Illinois to do that. \nSenator Durbin's bill would remove the requirement that Mayor Daley get \na permit from the State before he condemns the communities around \nO'Hare. They cannot pass legislation in the State senate that would get \nrid of the permit requirement. So they have decided to come to Congress \nin Washington and to strip away the State's law and permit requirement \nat the Federal level.\n  If my colleague's bill passes, that will mean Mayor Daley could \ncondemn all the communities around O'Hare without getting a permit from \nanybody. He would have an unfettered ability to condemn properties in \ncommunities that are outside the city of Chicago.\n  Imagine if the mayor of Minneapolis could go willy-nilly and condemn \ncommunities all around Minneapolis. Imagine what the communities around \nMinneapolis would think.\n  I think the State legislature was wise in imposing a requirement that \nthe mayor of Chicago, before he goes out and condemns communities \naround his city, get a permit from the State of Illinois. I think the \nFederal Government would unbalance that wise State law if we were to \nremove that permit requirement.\n  If one person had the ability to willy-nilly condemn all parts of the \nChicago area around O'Hare Airport, that would literally give the mayor \nof Chicago unfettered license to run over anybody he wanted at any time \nhe wanted. I don't think this body should be part of conferring that \nkind of unfettered ability to run over people on the mayor of Chicago.\n  There are delays at O'Hare Airport right now. That is no doubt true. \nI stood right here 2 years ago and warned Congress not to lift the \ndelay controls at O'Hare Airport. From 1969 to 1999--for 30 years--the \nFAA had delay controls at O'Hare Airport so that the airlines didn't \nschedule more flights than the airport had the capacity to handle.\n  In 1999, Congress took off the delay controls, allowing the airlines \nto schedule more flights than O'Hare had the capacity to handle. I \nwarned that we would have horrible delays if we lifted those delay \ncontrols. That happened. There were interim studies by the FAA which \nshowed that if the delay controls at O'Hare were lifted, delays would \ngo up exponentially, and they have.\n  In my judgment, that was a deliberate attempt by United Airlines and \nAmerican Airlines to cause delays at O'Hare and to build pressure to \nfurther expand O'Hare in an attempt to block a third airport which has \nbeen needed in Chicago for nearly 30 years. That is what we now see.\n  I also note that while Senator Durbin's legislation would require the \nFAA, or force, or command the FAA to approve a runway expansion plan at \nO'Hare that would increase the capacity of the runways by 78 percent, \nat the same time the plan is to build new terminals which would only \nadd 12 new gates.\n  This is a very bizarre plan that Congress is entering into. We are \ngoing to expand runway capacity by 78 percent, but we are only going to \nadd 12 new gates. That really means that once runway capacity is \nexpanded at O'Hare, it will be possible under this plan to land a plane \nbut you will have nowhere to park it. It doesn't make any sense. It is \nnot appropriate for Congress to be wresting control of airport design \nfrom the FAA and curtailing the FAA's discretion. We should leave the \nFAA's discretion intact.\n  If Senator Durbin believes his runway design for O'Hare Airport has \nmerit, then he should file an application with the FAA and see if the \nFAA approves it. He should not seek an end-run around the rules that \nall the other airports in the country abide by, nor should this body be \npart of stripping away the State of Illinois' requirement that the \nmayor of the city of Chicago get a permit before he condemns properties \nand communities that are outside the city of Chicago.\n  It is not right to give the mayor of Chicago unfettered ability to \nrun over anyone he wants at any time he wants.\n  S. 2039 is an unfortunate piece of legislation. I will do everything \nI can to prevent its passage.\n  I note one good development. The House of Representatives took this \nbill up in just the last couple of days--I believe on Wednesday--a \nHouse companion bill to S. 2039. The House committee stripped out the \nlanguage that had the effect of putting a straightjacket around the FAA \nand commanding the FAA to approve a specific runway design at O'Hare \nAirport. Even the House committee recognizes the impropriety of \nCongress putting a gun to the head of the FAA and forcing them to \napprove a specific runway design.\n  The House legislation simply allows Chicago to file a plan with the \nFAA and to be considered the same way any other airport expansion \nprogram or proposal is considered anywhere else in the country. \nUnfortunately, however, the House legislation does have the language \ngiving the mayor of the city of Chicago unfettered condemnation \nauthority, which I think is, as I pointed out earlier, a big mistake.\n  So with that, I do look forward to the debate. I am sure the debate \nwill be coming. And if I cannot defeat this legislation, I ultimately \nwant to change or modify it to make it less egregious than it now is. \nIn its current form, it is such an egregious piece of legislation that \nI think it would be inappropriate for our Senate to devote time to it \nwhen we have Medicare prescription drug issues, homeland security, and \n13 appropriations bills we still have not addressed.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank this body for affording me this \ntime to speak. I yield the floor and wish all my colleagues a good \nFourth of July recess.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate passed a bill \nwhich I introduced, the Patent and Trademark Authorization Act of 2002, \nwhich was reported out of the Judiciary Committee last week without \nobjection. I appreciate that Senators Hatch, Cantwell, Reid, Bennett \nand\n\n[[Page S6236]]\n\nCarper joined with me in co-sponsoring this bill\n  This bill, the Patent and Trademark Authorization Act of 2002, will \nsend a strong message to America's innovators and inventors that the \nCongress intends to protect and enhance our patent system. The PTO \nserves a critical role in the promotion and development of commercial \nactivity in the United States by granting patents and trademark \nregistrations to our Nation's innovators and businesses.\n  The costs of running the PTO are entirely paid for by fees collected \nby the PTO from users, individuals and companies that seek to benefit \nfrom patent and trademark protections. However, since 1992 Congress has \ndiverted over $800 million of those fees for other government programs \nunrelated to the PTO.\n  This bill sends a strong message that Congress should appropriate to \nthe PTO a funding level equal to these fees. The reason for this is \nsimple: the creation of intellectual property by Americans, individuals \nand businesses, is a massive positive driving force for our economy and \nis a huge plus for our trade balance with the rest of the world. In \nrecent years, the number of patent applications has risen dramatically, \nand that trend is expected to continue. Our patent examiners are very \noverworked, and emerging areas such as biotechnology and business \nmethod patents may overwhelm the system.\n  If fully implemented as intended, this bill can greatly assist the \nPTO in issuing quality patents more quickly, which means more \ninvestment, more jobs and greater productivity for American businesses.\n  The House of Representatives has passed a bill, H.R. 2047, which \ncontains some similar provisions but just for fiscal year 2002 \nregarding the authorization of appropriations. That bill, H.R. 2047, \nwas also passed by the Senate but amended to include the text of S. \n1754, as reported out of the Judiciary Committee. This will provide the \nCongress the greatest opportunity to get this reform on the President's \ndesk for signature.\n  Note that the Judiciary Committee reported out a substitute bill, \nwith the assistance of Senator Hatch, which simply moved back some \ndates in S. 1754, as originally introduced. I am including a short \nexplanation of S. 1754, as reported. This explanation also applies to \nthe version of H.R. 2047 as passed by the Senate.\n  Section 1 of the bill sets forth the title, ``The Patent and \nTrademark Office Authorization Act of 2002.''\n  Section 2 authorizes Congress to appropriate to the PTO, in each of \nfiscal years 2003 through 2008, an amount equal to the fees estimated \nby the Secretary of Commerce to be collected in each of the next 5 \nfiscal years. The Secretary shall make this report to the Congress by \nFebruary 15 of each such fiscal year.\n  This bill thus sets forth the goal, strongly supported by users of \nthe patent system, that the PTO should have a budget equal to the fees \ncollected for each year. In recent years, the appropriations' \ncommittees have not provided annual appropriations equal to the fees \ncollected. This bill sets forth the wishes of the committee, and now \nthe Senate as a whole, that the PTO be funded at levels determined by \nthe anticipated fee collections.\n  Section 3 of the bill directs the PTO to develop, in the next three \nyears, an electronic system for the filing and processing of all patent \nand trademark applications that is user friendly and that will allow \nthe Office to process and maintain electronically the contents and \nhistory of all applications. Of the amount appropriated under section \n2, section 3 authorizes Congress to appropriate not more than $50 \nmillion in fiscal years 2003 and 2004 for the electronic filing system. \nThe PTO is working on this electronic system.\n\n  In section 4, the bill requires the Secretary of Commerce to annually \nreport to the Judiciary Committees of the House of Representatives and \nthe Senate on the progress made in implementing its strategic plan. The \nPTO issued a short version of its ``21st Century Strategic Plan'' on \nJune 3, 2002, which is available on their website.\n  The bill also contains two sections which will clarify two provisions \nof current law and thus provide certainty and guidance to the PTO as \nwell as inventors and businesses.\n  Section 5 of S. 1754 expands the scope of matters that may be raised \nduring the reexamination process to a level which had been the case for \nmany years. In background, Congress established the patent \nreexamination system in 1980 for three purposes: to attempt to settle \npatent validity questions quickly and less expensively than litigation; \nto allow courts to rely on PTO expertise; and, third, to reinforce \ninvestor confidence in the certainty of patent rights by affording an \nopportunity to review patents of doubtful validity.\n  This system of encouraging third parties to pursue reexamination as \nan efficient method of settling patent disputes is still a good idea. \nHowever, by clarifying current law this bill increases the discretion \nof the PTO and enhances the effectiveness of the reexamination process. \nIt does this by permitting the use of relevant evidence that was \nconsidered by the PTO, but not necessarily cited. Thus, adding this new \nlanguage to current law will help prevent the misuse of defective \npatents, especially those concerning business method patents.\n  It permits a reexamination based on prior art cited by an applicant \nthat the examiner failed to adequately consider. Thus, this change \nallows the PTO to correct some examiner errors that it would not \notherwise be able to correct. In a sense it deals with In re Portola \nPackaging, 110 F.3rd 786, Fed. Cir. 1997, in a manner which should \nreduce the number of cases which will be handled in Federal court in a \nmanner that fully protects the rights of interested parties, and the \npublic interest. Thus, section 5 does not change the basic approach of \ncurrent law but rather eliminates a presumption which could be wrong, \nallowing for mistakes to be fixed without expensive litigation.\n  Section 6 of the bill modestly improves the usefulness of inter \npartes reexamination procedures by enhancing the ability of third-party \nrequesters to participate in that process by allowing such a third \nparty to appeal an adverse reexamine decision in Federal court or to \nparticipate in the appeal brought by the patentee. This may make inter \npartes reexamination a somewhat more attractive option for challenging \na patent in that a third party should feel more comfortable that the \ncourts can be accessed to rectify a mistaken reexamination decision. \nThis section should increase the use of the reexamine system and thus \ndecrease the number of patent matters adjudicated in Federal court.\n  I look forward to working with the other body to assure that this \nbill becomes law as soon as possible. I appreciate the work of Herb \nWamsley of the Intellectual Property Owners Association on this bill, \nand of Marla Grossman who worked with us in this effort. Also, I want \nto thank Mike Kirk of the American Intellectual Property Law \nAssociation for his help on these patent fee matters over the years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/27/senate-section/article/S6236-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in August \n2001 in Monmouth County, NJ. Seven people assaulted a 23-year-old \nlearning disabled man with hearing and speech impediments. The victim \nwas lured to a party, bound, and physically and verbally assaulted for \nthree hours. Later, he was taken to a wooded area where the torture \ncontinued until he was able to escape.

I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/27/senate-section/article/S6237-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S6237]]\n                            GETTING ANSWERS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, during England's darkest hour in 1940, \nWinston Churchill spoke of an unwavering sense of purpose. ``You ask, \nwhat is our aim? I can answer in one word: it is victory, victory at \nall costs, victory in spite of all terror,'' he told members of \nParliament.\n  Sixty years later, we here in the United States are fighting a \ndifferent kind of terror, terrorists who hide in caves and plan the \nmurder of thousands of innocent Americans, but our resolve to defeat it \nmatches that of Churchill. Some have expressed concerns that the \ninvestigations of how our intelligence and law enforcement authorities \nhandled information prior to 9-11 will weaken our efforts to defeat \nterrorists.\n  Frankly, I think the questions that are being raised will strengthen \nour efforts to defeat terrorism. We have a lot of good men and women \nworking in the CIA, the FBI and other agencies. But evidence, we have \nlearned in recent months, suggests that there is a layer of bureaucracy \nand resistance in the management of some of these critical agencies \nthat stifles the efforts of good law enforcement and good intelligence \nwhen tracking terrorists.\n  We have to fix that. Our job is to prevent the next act of terror and \nif the bureaucracy is clogging the arteries of our intelligence and law \nenforcement agencies, then we have to get rid of it.\n  Consider this: six months after Mohammed Atta and MarwanAl-Shehhi \nflew huge jets into the World Trade Center, the U.S. Immigration and \nNaturalization Service inexplicably sent notice their visa status had \nbeen changed from travel to student. In recent weeks, reports indicate \na Phoenix FBI agent alerted headquarters of his suspicions about Middle \nEastern men taking flight lessons. Minneapolis agent Coleen Rowley has \ncomplained bitterly that her office's efforts to obtain a search \nwarrant about a suspected highjacker were ignored. Now the CIA says \nthat it was tracking two of those who committed terrorist's acts on 9-\n11, but there is controversy over whether the FBI was actually \nnotified. As a result the terrorists moved in and out of our country \nwith ease. These and other reports, in recent months, raise real \nconcerns about how these federal intelligence and law enforcement \nagencies are working to prevent future acts of terrorism.\n  When people begin to raise questions about these issues, some claim \nthat the intent is to criticize President Bush.\n  President Bush, indeed any President, would have moved heaven and \nearth to prevent the catastrophe of 9-11 if he had received any advance \nwarning. These inquiries are not about the President or the White \nHouse. They are about the effectiveness of our Federal agencies in the \nwar against terrorism here at home.\n  The information disclosed in recent months about some of the failures \nof these agencies has come from people working inside the agencies. \nThese are employees of the FBI and other agencies who are blowing the \nwhistle on agency managers who fail to see the gravity of this \nsituation and refuse to take appropriate actions.\n  For example, Minneapolis FBI agents were admonished by their \nsuperiors for sharing information with the CIA in the case of suspected \nterrorist, Zacarias Moussaoui, who had links to Osama bin Laden. That \nis unacceptable. These agencies need to work together. Preventing the \nnext terrorist act is a tough job, and we will succeed only if we have \nall of the resources working full time and cooperating fully.\n  In recent months and weeks, the head of Homeland Security has warned \nour country the terrorist attacks against the Untied States could \nhappen at any time. That's why these agencies and their officials have \nto be fighting the battle against terrorists, not turf battles between \ntheir agencies.\n  Big, bureaucratic and slow doesn't get it anymore. We deserve better \nfrom these agencies. What if there is critical information right now in \nthe possession of one agency that is not sharing it with another? Are \nthose who dropped the ball last year in these agencies. The same ones \nwe now rely on to prevent another terrorist nightmare?\n  The answer to these questions is why this is such an urgent matter. \nWe, the President, the Congress and the American people, deserve the \nunvarnished facts so that we can move ahead and protect our country, so \nI say let's do these investigations. Let's make sure that they don't \nturn into a circus. As Sergeant Joe Friday used to say, ``Just the \nfacts, ma'am.'' Let's use those facts to make the changes these \nagencies so that the men and women of the FBI, the CIA and other \nagencies who are very capable and serve America well, are able to do \ntheir jobs successfully.\n  Only then, as Winston Churchill did, can we finally win the war \nagainst terrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/27/senate-section/article/S6237-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6237-S6238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to speak on the ridiculous \nruling of the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Literally \nridiculous; it deserves to be ridiculed. It was a 2-1 decision, so \nthere is, at least, one judge on the Court who can rule based on the \nsame legal and civic theory that the rest of the country has been \noperating under for the last 226 years.\n  I cannot accept removing ``under God'' from the Pledge of Allegiance. \nThis ruling is appalling. I never thought I would see the day when \nsaying the Pledge of Allegiance would be declared unconstitutional by a \ncourt. I certainly did not think I would see it on the day I placed my \nhand on a Holy Bible and made an Oath at my swearing in.\n  The Magna Carta of 1215, considered the initial codification of \nWestern democratic theory, clearly shows that power is granted from \n``above.'' Not ``above'' from a judge's bench, but higher--from an \nAlmighty Power. Every major assertion of our fundamental political \nthought references God, and not in passing, but as a cornerstone of \nhuman life.\n  Sometimes it is again literally a cornerstone. The Jefferson Memorial \nhas quotes from that great man, which contain references to God carved \ninto the stone. The Lincoln Memorial also has a testament to that \nPresident's commitment to God cut into the very marble. Anyone reading \nhis Second Inaugural must know his view of a daily presence of God in \nthe affairs of man and in the political life of this nation. The \nHolocaust Memorial facade quotes scriptures. So does our Library of \nCongress, Union Station, Constitution Hall, and many others.\n  Even William Shakespeare's Puck is quoted referring to God over \noutside the Folger Shakespeare Theater--in a quote that I think rings \nespecially true regarding certain court rulings--``Lord, What fools \nthese mortals be.'' Lord, what foolish rulings these judges make. There \nhas already been discussions on this floor regarding our coins, our \nmoney, and this very Chamber. I don't bring these up just to worry \naloud as to whether they are soon to be ruled against as well, but to \nshow that our nation was incorporated under God, and an attempt to \nexcise God from this Republic is wrong and lacking in historical and \nlegal insight.\n  Our citizens are free from an official state religion--not forced to \nbe free from religious thought.\n  When President Eisenhower signed the law adding ``under God'' to the \npledge, he was not doing so in attempt to lead this Nation down a Godly \npath. It was not using the bully pulpit to attempt to steer a course. \nHe was affirming that this nation has already consistently and \nthoroughly incorporated belief in and submission to God.\n  We separated ourselves from the United Kingdom under the laws of \nNature's God, claiming the unalienable rights we were endowed with by \nour Creator and appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for \nrecititude of our intentions. We have continued this way ever since--no \nmatter what the Ninth might say.\n  Finally, I want to make it clear that I am not merely upset about the \nfact that the Pledge of Allegiance was ruled against. I want to also \nspeak against the ongoing assault on our basic religious beliefs. As my \nfriend Senator Sessions voiced earlier, this is just another result of \na dangerous and radical viewpoint that is held by an irresponsible few. \nFew as they are compared to our citizens as a whole, there are far too \nmany in this body and elsewhere who express beliefs and support for \nradical judges that cannot help but lead us to these types of \ndecisions. We do not jump from a nation that believes itself endowed by \nits Creator with\n\n[[Page S6238]]\n\nunalienable rights to a nation where the Pledge of Allegiance can be \nruled unconstitutional without many intervening steps along the way. \nThose of us who oppose the many small steps taken down this path \nwelcome those who finally stand aghast at where we end up. I hope this \nbody and the Nation will move to correct the error.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/27/senate-section/article/S6238-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6238-S6241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON TRIP TO BULGARIA, MACEDONIA, KOSOVO, SLOVAKIA, SLOVENIA AND \n                                BRUSSELS\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, over the Memorial Day recess, I joined \nseven members of the House of Representatives to participate in the \nspring meeting of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. Twice a year, \nlegislators from NATO member countries and seventeen countries that \nhave been given ``associate'' status--including NATO aspirants and \nmembers of the Partnership for Peace program--gather to discuss \nsignificant issues facing the Alliance.\n  At the forefront of the agenda this year were issues related to the \nwar on terrorism, and questions that will be raised when NATO heads of \nstate meet in Prague this November, including: the future direction of \nthe Alliance; the growing gap in military capabilities between the \nUnited States and our European allies; and the selection of new \nmembers.\n  This was the third year that I have participated in the NATO \nParliamentary Assembly's spring gathering. The meeting took on a new \nurgency as the Alliance continues to confront a changed international \nsecurity environment in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on \nSeptember 11th. As parliamentarians discussed the military campaign in \nAfghanistan and the role of NATO in the war on terror, I reminded my \nEuropean counterparts of the need to invest in the defense budgets of \ntheir respective countries. Without fundamental military capabilities \nsuch as strategic airlift and command and control systems, the European \ncontribution to the global war on terrorism will continue to be \nlimited.\n  It was clear throughout the meeting that the events of 9-11 have \nimpacted discussions in many areas, including expansion of the \nAlliance. During consideration of a Declaration on NATO Enlargement, I \nintroduced an amendment calling attention to the significant threats \nthat terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \npose to NATO countries, and recognizing that as NATO considers \nenlargement, the Alliance remains open to tolerant, democratic \nsocieties, which embrace values that terrorism seeks to destroy.\n  As the meeting progressed, I also expressed my strong support for a \nrobust round of enlargement during the Summit of the Alliance in Prague \nlater this year. I share the President's vision of enlargement, \narticulated in Warsaw, Poland last June, when he said that as we \napproach Prague: ``We should not calculate how little we can get away \nwith, but how much we can do to advance the cause of freedom.''\n  Yet while the Alliance should extend invitations to a number of \ncountries in Prague, I believe it is premature to single out countries \nfor membership at this point. Instead, we should continue to encourage \naspirants to make progress on their membership action plans and move \nforward with democratic, economic and judicial reforms.\n  As such, during consideration of the Declaration on NATO Enlargement, \nI joined Congressman Doug Bereuter, the chairman of the U.S. \ndelegation, and other members of the United States Congress at the \nmeeting in abstaining from a vote on an amendment that identified seven \ncountries as ready for membership in the Alliance. Despite U.S. \nconcerns, the amendment was adopted.\n  While I do not disagree that the countries listed in the amendment--\nBulgaria, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania--\nhave made some strides in their preparations to join NATO, there are \nserious discussions that must take place between now and November \nregarding the selection of new members.\n  This spring's NATO Parliamentary meeting was especially important to \nits host country, Bulgaria, which hopes to receive an invitation to \njoin the Alliance in Prague. I remain very interested in discussion \nabout NATO enlargement, and while in Sofia, I was glad to have \nopportunity to visit with Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gothe and \nPresident Georgi Parvanov to discuss Bulgaria's work to join the \nAlliance. I also met with Defense Minister Nikolay Svinarov and Foreign \nMinister Solomon Passy, who I have met with previously in my office in \nWashington, DC.\n  My first official visit outside of the NATO session was with \nBulgaria's Defense Minister, Nikolay Svinarov. Just minutes before our \nmeeting, Mr. Svinarov spoke to the NATO PA's Committee on Defense and \nSecurity, outlining Bulgaria's plans to move forward with defense \nreforms. His presentation was clear, and I congratulated him on his \neffort to describe Bulgaria's progress on the defense portion of the \nmembership action plan (MAP). While noting the progress that has been \nmade, I encouraged him to follow through on the vision that he \narticulated to the NATO parliamentarians. I was impressed with \nBulgaria's plan; however, it is evident that there is still a lot of \nwork to be done to implement their ambitious agenda for military \nreform.\n  My impressions were reaffirmed several days later when I visited Graf \nIgnatievo air base, near the city of Plovdiv. The enthusiasm of the \nofficers and pilots at the base was evident. Since 2001, the Bulgarian \ngovernment has invested in modernization of base infrastructure, \nupgrading the runway and the flight line and renovating buildings and \ntraining facilities. While this is certainly a positive development, I \nwas concerned with the equipment at the base, including Soviet-era MiG-\n29 and MiG-21 aircraft. While the MiG-21s will be retired, the \nBulgarians hope to upgrade their MiG-29s by 2004, with the goal of full \nNATO interoperability. There are serious questions not only about \nwhether or not this can actually be done, but also whether this is \nmoney wisely spent. As NATO considers questions about military \ncapabilities, it will be important to consider how NATO members and \naspirant countries can best invest limited defense dollars to \ncontribute to the overall mission of the Alliance. As Bulgaria \ncontinues with defense reforms, this will be one factor to consider.\n  Bulgaria must also confront challenges in other areas, including the \nneed to move forward with judicial reforms. The government must take \naction to combat corruption and organized crime. I discussed this issue \nwith Prime Minister Saxe-Coburg-Gothe and President Purvanov, as well \nas Foreign Minister Passy.\n  Perhaps one of the most eye-opening conversation I had during my trip \nto Bulgaria was with FBI Special Agent Victor Moore, who is working \nwith the Bulgarian government and local NGOs to combat human \ntrafficking. As a member of the Helsinki Commission and an active \nparticipant in the annual meetings of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, \nI have worked on this issue with Congressman Chris Smith--who has a \nlong record of work to combat the trafficking of men, women and \nchildren. I also follow the efforts of the Southeast European \nCooperative Initiative (SECI), which aims to combat trans-border crime \nin the region.\n  SECI has spearheaded an initiative to combat human trafficking in \nsoutheast Europe, and Vic Moore's efforts are tied directly to their \nobjectives. Of his eleven years in the FBI, he spent nine of them \nworking on drug enforcement in New York City. In Bulgaria, he is \nworking to give law enforcement personnel the skills they need to \ninvestigate and prosecute human trafficking cases. The Bulgarian \ngovernment has formed a multi-agency task force, which has liberated \nmore than 160 women, issued 60 arrest warrants and captured \napproximately 60 traffickers. This important work should continue. I \nbelieve it is important that the government take continued steps to \nstrengthen the rule of law and reform the judicial systems. This will \nbe important as NATO evaluates the progress of aspirant countries later \nthis year.\n  In all of my conversations in Sofia, one thing was clear: the people \nof Bulgaria, and the members of government who represent them, want to \njoin NATO. Over a breakfast meeting with members of the U.S. delegation \nat the home of our Ambassador to Bulgaria Jim Pardew, President \nParvanov said that there is complete public and political consensus on \nNATO in Bulgaria.\n\n[[Page S6239]]\n\n  I am hopeful Bulgaria's enthusiasm for NATO membership remains high, \nand the government stays committed to critical reform efforts.\n  After participating in the NATO Parliamentary Assembly meeting in \nSofia, I traveled to Macedonia, Kosovo, Slovakia, Slovenia and Brussels \nto evaluate the situation in southeast Europe, and to examine progress \nin Macedonia, Slovakia and Slovenia as they work to join NATO.\n  Following my arrival in Skopje on Tuesday, May 28, 2002, I had the \nopportunity to visit with our Ambassador to Macedonia, Larry Butler, \nand his team at the U.S. Embassy. This was my third trip to Macedonia \nas a member of the U.S. Senate. I first traveled to Macedonia during \nthe war and visited Stankovic refugee camp; my second trip was in \nFebruary 2000, and I met with President Trajkovski, Prime Minister \nGoergievski, and ethnic Albanian leader Arben Xhaferi. At that time, \nour focus was on Kosovo. Since the spring of 2001, all eyes have been \nin Macedonia.\n\n  In August 2001, following the outbreak of violence in the spring by \nethnic Albanian rebels from Macedonia and Kosovo, the government's \npolitical parties came together to sign a peace agreement. The plan--\ncalled the Ohrid Framework Agreement--called for the passage of laws \nand constitutional reforms to address concerns of Macedonia's ethnic \nAlbanian minority, which makes up approximately one-third of the \ncountry's population.\n  At the time of my visit last month, the government was expected to \npass a final package of laws to implement the Ohrid Framework \nAgreement. This was a primary topic of discussion in my conversations \nwith our Ambassador and staff at the U.S. embassy, as well as President \nTrajkovski and Mr. Xhaferi. While the parliament did not act in the \ndays immediately following my visit, as hoped, I was pleased to learn \nthat fifteen of the seventeen outstanding laws were passed last \nThursday, June 20, 2002. I am hopeful that action on the remaining \nissues will be taken soon.\n  During my meeting with Arben Xhaferi, he stressed the importance of \nthe international community's involvement in Macedonia. He said the \nUnited States should continue to play a role in Macedonia--both with \nits military presence and financial assistance. While I agree with Mr. \nXhaferi that U.S. involvement in the region is important, I stressed to \nhim that the people of Macedonia--regardless of ethnicity--must take \naction to improve the situation in their country. While the \ninternational community can play a helpful role, ultimately, things are \nin the hands of the people and their elected leaders. As such, I \nencouraged Mr. Xhaferi to move forward with efforts to implement \ndemocratic and economic reforms, and to promote respect for the rule of \nlaw. I also shared with him my strong concern with organized crime, \ncorruption and human trafficking in the region, and urged him to take \naction in this area.\n  During my meetings, it was also clear that demarcation of the border \nbetween Macedonia and Kosovo has become a significant political issue \nin both Macedonia and Kosovo. Some in Macedonia would like to move \nforward with the demarcation of border, recognized by the U.N. Security \nCouncil, which was formally agreed upon by Macedonia and the Federal \nRepublic of Yugoslavia in March 2001.\n  Judging from my conversations in Kosovo, however, it was evident that \nthere is not yet a consensus regarding the right time to put down \nmarkers along the border. This issue must be approached with caution.\n  I am also hopeful that free and fair parliamentary elections will \ntake place in Macedonia on September 15, 2002, as planned. The United \nStates and members of the international community, including the \nEuropean Union, should do everything in their power to stress to \nleaders in Macedonia the importance of permitting people to go to the \npolls without incidence this fall.\n  On Wednesday, May 29, 2002, I spent the day in Kosovo. It was my \nthird trip to Kosovo since February 2000, and the fourth full day that \nI have spent there. During my time in the Senate, I have been very \nactive on issues affecting southeast Europe, and I have been \nparticularly concerned with the situation of ethnic minorities and \nrespect for minority rights throughout the region--in Bosnia-\nHerzegovina, Croatia, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, as well \nas Kosovo. As such, I was glad to have the opportunity to examine this \nissue in Kosovo last month.\n  I spent time with the Head of UNMIK Michael Steiner, as well as \nCommander of KFOR General Valentin. I also met with President Rugova \nand Prime Minister Rexhepi, and Serb leaders Rada Trajkovic and \nLjubomir Stanojkovic. I met with Ambassador John Menzies and his team \nat the U.S. Office in Pristina, and I was glad to visit with General \nLute at KFOR Main and some of our troops at Camp Bondsteel, as well as \nAmbassador Pascal Fieschi, who heads the OSCE Mission in Kosovo.\n  Around the time of my visit, the Organization for Security and \nCooperation and Europe (OSCE) and the U.N. High Commission on Refugees \n(UNHCR) released the Ninth Assessment of the Situation of Ethnic \nMinorities in Kosovo, which describes the quality of life experienced \nby Kosovo's minority groups.\n  My impressions after spending time in Kosovo last month reaffirm many \nof the conclusions reached in the OSCE-UNHCR report: while there has \nbeen some improvement for ethnic minorities, there is still a long way \nto go.\n  My first reaction was that things seem somewhat better now than they \nwere when I visited nearly 3 years ago. I attribute this to several \nfactors, including work done by the international community, including \nUNMIK, KFOR, the OSCE and others, as well as the interest that the \npeople of Kosovo have shown in creating their own government following \nparliamentary elections last November and the election of new \nleadership in March. I believe the participation of the Serbian \nminority in the parliamentary elections last November was very \nimportant, as was the cooperation of the FRY government, which \nencourage Kosovar Serbs to vote.\n  Additionally, I was impressed with the ``benchmark'' goals that have \nbeen outlined by UNMIK, which call for progress in key areas, including \nrespect for the rule of law, strengthening democratic institutions, and \nbuilding a civil society.\n  The benchmarks paper also emphasizes respect for minority rights and \nrefugee returns, which deserve attention both from the international \ncommunity and from the newly elected leadership in Kosovo.\n  This document is very important, as it lays out a plan for Kosovo. It \nwill be critical for the international community to refer to this \ndocument from time to time to assess progress and, as necessary, to \nredouble efforts in certain areas. In the past, I have been concerned \nthat the international community has not been focused in its vision of \nKosovo, and this document offers a positive step in the right \ndirection.\n\n  To make real progress, however, we must encourage Michael Steiner and \nUNMIK to develop a strategic plan and a critical path for the \nimplementation of the benchmark goals. When I attend the OSCE \nParliamentary Assembly meeting in Berlin this July, I will encourage \nthe Head of the OSCE Mission in Kosovo, Pascal Fieschi, to do so. This \nwill allow UNMIK to monitor progress on the benchmark goals.\n  While in Kosovo, I also met with the Commander of KFOR, General \nValentin, and discussed with him the security situation in the region. \nHe is optimistic, and believes that there is progress every day. He \nsaid things are much better than they were three years ago. Ambassador \nFieschi was also encouraged that things have gotten better for Kosovo's \nminorities, though he indicated that change has been slow.\n  While I agree that things are somewhat better, the findings in the \nOSCE-UNHCR report are less upbeat. With regard to security and freedom \nof movement, the report reads: ``Despite the decrease in serious \nincidents of violence, harassment, intimidation and humiliation of \nmembers of minority communities in Kosovo continued to prevail as a \nfeature of daily life.'' This affects all of Kosovo's minorities, \nincluding Serbs, Roma, Egyptians, Bosniaks, Croats, Albanians, Turks \nand others.\n  Serb leaders Rada Trajkovic and Ljubomir Stanojkovic discussed the \nsituation for the Serbian minority with\n\n[[Page S6240]]\n\nme over lunch in Gracanica, which was my third visit to the city. \nThough there are still many concerns which must be addressed, I got the \ngeneral impression that things are somewhat better for the Serbs than \nthey were two years ago. I am encouraged that Dr. Trajkovic and Mr. \nStanojkovic are active and participating with the new government, and I \nbelieve it is important that they continue to call on others to do the \nsame. I believe it is essential that Serbs participate in the municipal \nelections this October and take advantage of the opportunity to \nparticipate and have a voice at the table of government.\n  During my visit, I met with Ibrahim Rugova, who was elected President \nin March. This was my second meeting with Mr. Rugova--we visited when I \nwas in Kosovo in February 2000. At that time, I also met with ethnic \nAlbanian leaders Hashim Thaci and Rexhep Oosja. Two years ago, as Mr. \nRugova and others continued to call for independence, I expressed my \nbelief that there could be little serious discussion on independence \nuntil the rights of all people in Kosovo--including minorities--were \nprotected. During our meeting in May, I again stressed this point.\n  In addition to President Rugova, I also met with the new Prime \nMinister of Kosovo, Bajram Rexhepi, and discussed with him the \nsituation in Kosovo. I was impressed with him during our meeting. He \nseems to clearly understand work that needs to be done, focusing on the \nneed for refugee returns and respect for minority rights, as well as \nthe need to stimulate economic development. He reminded me that U.S. \nleadership in Kosovo, and the region at large, is still very important.\n  While I was pleased that everyone I spoke with during my meetings in \nKosovo last month, including President Rugova, Prime Minister Rexhepi, \nand Michael Steiner, was committed to refugee returns, I am concerned \nbecause there are still more minorities leaving Kosovo than returning. \nWith regard to returns, the OSCE-UNHCR report notes that if more people \nare to actually return, it will ``require much more meaningful and \nbroad progress on the main issues,'' such as security, freedom of \nmovement, essential services and employment.\n  I also believe it is critical that Mr. Steiner and UNMIK articulate a \nclear action plan for returns. Additionally, following my visit to \nKosovo, I remain very concerned with the situation in Mitrovica, which \nremains divided between north and south. I believe the only way to \nachieve any progress will be if the international community works with \nthe elected leadership in Kosovo to find a solution. While there are \ndifferent schools of though as to what should happen in Mitrovica, it \nis imperative that discussion continues and the parties act to \nnormalize life for all the city's residents. This should happen \nquickly, and any plan on decentralization to give local communities \nmore a stronger voice should be finalized before the municipal \nelections in the fall.\n  I also believe we must watch the situation along the border with \nMacedonia carefully. This issue has become controversial in both Kosovo \nand Macedonia. While some in Macedonia would like to move forward with \nthe demarcation of the border, this is a sensitive issue which must be \napproached calmly and rationally. The people of Kosovo do not support \nthis border agreement, and at the end of May, the Kosovo Assembly \npassed a resolution denouncing the border agreement--which Michael \nSteiner immediately annulled. I believe there should be discussion on \nthis matter, with all involved parties together at one table.\n  Following my time in Kosovo, I traveled to the Slovak Republic to \ndiscuss the country's aspirations to join the NATO Alliance, and to \nassess their progress as they continue to participate in the membership \naction plan process. Though my time was limited, I was pleased to \nfinally have the chance to travel to Slovakia--which was the only \ncountry aspiring to join the NATO Alliance that I had yet to visit.\n  While in Bratislava, I spent time with our Ambassador to Slovakia, \nRon Weiser, who is working hard to promote the merits of democracy, the \nrule of law and a free market economy as the country looks toward \nmembership in NATO. I believe his work is important in the months \nleading to parliamentary elections this September, which could be a \ndetermining factor in Slovakia's candidacy for NATO membership.\n  During my visit, I had the opportunity to meet with Prime Minister \nMikulas Dzurinda, who has pushed forward with critical economic and \ndemocratic reforms in Slovakia since becoming prime minister in 1998. \nHis government has placed a top priority on joining NATO and the \nEuropean Union. Prime Minister Dzurinda and I discussed ongoing efforts \nto liberalize the economy, strengthen democratic institutions and \nmodernize the country's armed forces. We also talked about the \nimportance of respecting minority rights including the rights of the \ncountry's ethnic Hungarian community. Additional, I expressed my strong \nconcern with the problems of organized crime, corruption and human \ntrafficking in central and eastern Europe, and encouraged the Prime \nMinister and his government to move forward with efforts to address \nthese problems.\n\n  I also met with Robert Fico, leader of the Smer (Direction) political \nparty, who hopes to be the country's next prime minister. Young and \ncharismatic, Fico's animate campaign signs were all around town as we \ndrove from one meeting to the next. Fico and his colleague also \nexpressed their strong support for Slovakia's membership in NATO and \nthe European Union. As the polls are close, it is possible that he \ncould play a role in the formation of the next government.\n  Following my arrival at the Bratislava airport. I met with Defense \nState Secretary Ratislav Kacer. We discussed ongoing defense reforms, \nand the country's efforts to increase defense spending. During my time \nin public service, I have often said it is important to ``work harder \nand smarter,'' and do more with lees.'' Mr. Kacer knew of my \nphilosophy, and said this could be helpful to Slovakia as the country \nworks to modernize with limited resources. He reiterated the country's \nstrong support of NATO, and said the government has aligned its own \nnational defense priorities with issues important to the Alliance.\n  Additionally, I have the oportunity to visit with ethnic. Hungarian \nLeader Mr. Laszlo Dobos, who was a member of Slovakia's parliament \nduring the 1990s. Dr. Dobos is founder and chairman of Madach Posonium, \nas a Hungarian non-governmental organization that operates Hungarian \nbookstores in Slovakia and publishes Hungarian periodicals. We \ndiscussed a numb4er of tissues of concern to Slovakias Hungarian \ncommunity, including higher education and greater autonomy for local \ngovernments.\n  During at all meetings in Slovakia, I noted that the upcoming \nelections will be very important to the future of the country. Voters \nwill decide the direction of he Slovakis Republic--and whether it moves \ntoward membership in NATO and the DU, or whether it is left behind as \nothers joint he broader European Community of democracies. Values are \nthe hallmark of the NATO allcance, and I believe it is critical that \nSlovakia embraces the ideals of democracy, the rule of low and respect \nfor human rights, consistnt with the current government, and break with \nthe leadership of Vladimir Mecior that has been of strong concern to \nthe United States, the Europe Union and other members international \ncommunity in the past.\n  I was also glad to have the opportunity to visit Slovakia to talk \nabout the country's work to join the NATO Alliance. I have long \nfollowed developments in Slovenia, and I believe the country is in a \nvery good position as we approach the NATO summit in Prague.\n  Slovenia has made considerable progress on democratic, economic and \ndefense reforms, and there is continued discussion on the merits of \nNATO membership in the public. At the same time, it is important that \nthe government act to bolster public support for NATO, which has \ncontinued to hover around 50 percent. It is also imperative that the \ncountry work to increase its defense budget to the 2 percent mark. \nCurrently, Solvenia allocates approximately 1.5 percent of GDP for its \narmed forces.\n  During my time in Slovenia I had the opportunity to visit with \nPresident Milan Kucan, who I have known for\n\n[[Page S6241]]\n\nmany years. We discussed the country's work to join NATO, as well as \nits progress in efforts to prepare for membership in the European \nUnion. With regard to public opinion, President Kucan indicated that \npublic support for NATO is not a problem. He said people want to \ndiscuss the implications of membership in the Alliance and debate the \nmerits of joining NATO. We also discussed Solvenia's progress on \nmilitary reforms, as well as the country's interest in working to \npromote security and stability in southeast Europe.\n  I again discussed these issues and found the same enthusiasm for \nSlovenia's membership in NATO and the European Union with members of \nthe Slovenian parliament, including the President of Parliament Borut \nPahor, President of the Foreign Affairs Committee Jelko Kacin and \nPresident of the Defense Committee Doran Marsic. Even the opposition \nexpressed a solid commitment to moving forward with efforts to join the \nNATO Alliance. During consideration of a resolution on whether or not \nto have a national referendum on Slovenia's membership in NATO before \nthe Prague summit, there was a very strong consensus that this should \nnot happen until after the November meeting--with 63 agreeing that this \nshould not happen immediately, with 9 opposing.\n  I also discussed these issues with Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek, who \nhas recently announced his intention to run for President of Slovenia, \nas well as Minister of Defense Anton Grizold. Additionally, I visited \nwith our ambassador, John Young, and discussed the country's strong \ncandidacy for membership in both NATO and the European Union. I am \nhopeful that public support for NATO membership will continue to grow, \nand I am glad that this will be an enlightened decision in Slovenia \ngiven the high level of discussion on the issue.\n  Following meetings in Slovenia on Friday, May 31, 2002, I traveled to \nBrussels to visit with our Ambassador to NATO, Nick Burns, and the \ndirector of Javier Solana's Balkans Task Force, Mr. Stefan Lehne.\n  During my meeting with Stefan Lehne, I discussed my long interest in \nsoutheast Europe and impressions from my recent visits to Macedonia and \nKosovo. I spoke with him about my strong concern with political \nsituation in Macedonia, and urged the European Union to remain involved \nin efforts to bring all parties to the table to discuss disagreements \nover the order between Macedonia and Kosovo. I also told him I believe \nit is essential that the international community do everything in its \npower to encourage the Macedonian government to remain committed to \nfree and fair parliamentary elections scheduled for this September.\n\n  We also discussed my interest in the Stability Pact--in particular, \nthe Stability Pact's Quick Start Infrastructure Projects. I believe it \nis critical that the Pact make its intentions clear on the Quick Start \nprojects.\n  Finally, we discussed my concern with organized crime, corruption and \ntrafficking in human beings, drugs and weapons that plague many \ncountries in central and eastern Europe. I encouraged Mr. Lehne to make \nthese problems a top priority, as they undermine efforts on behalf of \nthe international community to promote democratic reforms and respect \nfor the rule of law in many of Europe's new democracies.\n  With Ambassador Nick Burns, I discussed my interest in NATO \nenlargement and observations from my visits to Bulgaria, Macedonia, \nSlovakida and Slovenia. While I share the vision of President Bush for \na large round of enlargement in Prague, I expressed to Ambassador Burns \nmy strong concern with the need for continued action in candidate \ncountries.\n  As we approach Prague, we must decide whether each candidate country \nhas gone for enough to take the necessary steps to join the Alliance. \nAnd as we answer that question, we will also ask whether or not action \nis still needed, and whether reforms are best encouraged if that \ncountry is extended an invitation at Prague, or if that country is \ninstead asked to continue reforms while looking toward the next round \nof enlargement. These will be difficult questions, and we must be \nprepared to answer them.\n  I look forward to continued discussion with the administration and my \ncolleagues in the Senate on NATO enlargement in the months ahead, and I \nencourage NATO aspirant countries to take as many steps as they can \nbetween now and November to address issues outlined in their respective \nMembership Action Plans.\n  Additionally, I will continue to be active and involved in the Senate \non issues affecting southeast Europe. We had a very productive Helsinki \nCommission hearing to examine the situation for ethnic minorities in \nKosovo earlier this month, and I will continue to discuss this issue \nwhen I participate in the annual meeting of the OSCE Parliamentary \nAssembly next week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/27/senate-section/article/S6241-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   CHILDREN'S AID SOCIETY OF SOUTHEASTERN MICHIGAN CELEBRATES 14OTH \n                              ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the \nChildren's Aid Society of Southeastern Michigan (CAS) on its 140th \nanniversary. In that time CAS has been an organization dedicated in \nservice to children, youth, and families. For nearly a century and a \nhalf, CAS has been a dynamic and compassionate presence in the Michigan \ncommunity.\n  CAS, the oldest child welfare agency in Michigan, is a non-profit, \nnon-sectarian private organization dedicated to the preservation and \nquality of family life in Southeastern Michigan based in Detroit. Begun \nin 1862 by members of the Presbyterian Church to help Civil War \norphans, CAS has expanded in the years since to help hundreds of \nthousands of troubled children and families. CAS aims to build strength \nwithin the family unit by providing a variety of comprehensive child \nand family-focused services, seeking to create the foundation for a \nbetter and healthier society.\n  The services that CAS provides are innovative and humanistic, viewing \neach individual and problem as unique. For example, the Work Works \nprogram gives high-risk youth between the ages of 13 and 17 training in \nemployment skills and helps them in finding a job. Alumni of the \nprogram help other staff teach the skills of positive self-esteem, work \nethics, and job readiness. Another program, Moving Families in the \nRight Direction, aims to prevent delinquency and school dropout by \nstrengthening family functioning and relationships. Staff go into \nhomes, schools, and the community to conduct counseling sessions and \ngroup work with youth between the ages of 10 and 17 who have been \nreferred to them by the Police Department or Juvenile Court. By giving \nat-risk children and families early attention, CAS tries to help \nprevent the family break-up and juvenile delinquency that plagues so \nmuch of our country today. CAS also provides day care and has programs \nfor early childhood education, mental health, child abuse, teen \nfamilies, and parents.\n  Southeastern Michigan and the larger Detroit metropolitan area are \ndeeply indebted to the work CAS has done for families and children over \nthe last 140 years. Year in and year out CAS has fought to hold \nfamilies together and ensure the welfare of children. The vital support \nservices that CAS provides help children and parents deal with the \ndifficult personal and societal issues they face in the 21st century. \nHaving performed these important social services for over 140 years is \nindeed a tremendous accomplishment and deserves hearty commendation.\n  I know my Senate colleagues will join me in congratulating the \nChildren's Aid Society of Southeastern Michigan for 140 years of \nsuccess and in wishing it a fruitful future that only adds to its rich \nlegacy of compassion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/27/senate-section/article/S6241-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6241-S6242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         EDS' 40TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President. I extend my congratulations to \nEDS and to its employees on the company's 40th anniversary. On June 27, \n1962, Electronic Data Systems was incorporated in Texas, and EDS is \nstill headquartered in Plano, TX. The company's initial goal was simply \nto help companies use their computers more effectively. Since then, EDS \nhas been a leader in the information-technology services industry.\n  EDS has flourished by adapting to its clients' needs and by providing \ninformation-technology and business-consulting services to every sector \nof the\n\n[[Page S6242]]\n\nglobal economy. Evolving from a staff of fewer than 30 to a team of \nmore than 140,000 employees in 50 States and more than 60 countries, \nEDS helps companies to excel in the digital economy.\n  In the 1960s, when the business world's use of computers was still \nnovel, EDS recognized an opportunity to help companies use their \ncomputers effectively. In the 1970s, EDS expanded into new \ninternational markets, which today include some of its fastest-growing \nopportunities. Over the last two decades, personal computers and Web-\nbased business models have changed the way people and businesses \ninteract and access information. EDS has worked to ensure the strategic \ntechnological alignment of its clients in light of these developments.\n  EDS prides itself on consistently demonstrating resourcefulness and \ninnovation, such as in aiding disaster recovery and providing \ninformation security in business continuity efforts. Responding quickly \nto unmet needs is a hallmark of successful businesses, such as EDS.\n  I commend EDS for its vitality and innovation, and send the people of \nEDS best wishes for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/27/senate-section/article/S6242-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6242-S6243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   THE VANNEVAR BUSH AWARD FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY TO ERICH BLOCH\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to bring to my \ncolleagues' attention the fact that the National Science Board, NSB, \nhas honored Erich Bloch as the 24th recipient of the Vannevar Bush \nAward for Science and Technology, its highest award for scientific \nachievement and statesmanship. Mr. Bloch's record of innovation and \nleadership in the advanced technology sector and the immense impact \nthat his career has had on the field make him especially deserving of \nlofty praise. He received the award on May 7 in Washington, DC.\n  Mr. Bloch is a member of the President's Council of Advisors on \nScience and Technology, a distinguished fellow at the Council on \nCompetitiveness, a former director of the National Science Foundation, \nand an outspoken supporter of fundamental research in leading \ninnovation. He occupies a senior statesman status in science and \nengineering and has been a longtime supporter of science and \nmathematics education programs funded by the Federal government.\n\n       Erich Bloch is a visionary innovator of enormous stature--\n     in both high technology for the private sector--and in the \n     organization and objectives of science and engineering \n     research,'' Eamon Kelly, National Science Board chair, stated \n     in announcing the honor. ``He has been an exceptionally \n     effective communicator of the benefits of public funding for \n     science and technology, and a leader in establishing widely \n     emulated mechanisms for productive partnerships in research \n     and education across public, academic, and private sectors.\n\n  Before moving to Washington to become the National Science \nFoundation's only director from industry, Mr. Bloch was a famed \nelectrical engineer at IBM and was one of the key figures responsible \nfor IBM's STRETCH Computer Systems Engineering Project and in the \ngroundbreaking developments of the IBM Systems 360. Until the 1960s, \nevery computer model was generally designed independently, and at times \nindividual machines were custom modified for a particular customer. The \nadvent of the IBM-360 family of computers changed this forever. All \nthese machines had the same user instruction set, taking advantage of \nIBM's engineering leadership in powerful disk drive systems. On the \nsmaller machines, many of the more complex instructions were done in \nmicrocode rather than in hardware. Mr. Bloch headed IBM's development \nof the solid logic technology program, which provided IBM with the \nmicroelectronics technology for the System/360. Mr. Bloch's leadership \nability was one of the key reasons for the success of the System/360. \nHis strategy was to work around organizational structures and, as \ntechnical problems were identified, to assign groups or individuals who \noffered the best proposals. Mr. Bloch was the first to develop an IBM \nproduct with a ferrite core memory--a significant achievement in the \nsearch for memory technology. Mr. Bloch's accomplishments on the \nsystem, and the developments that occurred as part of his management \nstyle, helped revolutionize the computer industry and led to his \nreceiving the 1985 National Medal of Technology with his IBM \ncolleagues, Frederick P. Brooks, Jr. and Bob O. Evans.\n  In his 6-year term as NSF director, Erich Bloch built national \nsupport for advances in high-performance computing and networking. Mr. \nBloch's important leadership in transitioning NSFNET to a \ncommercialized Internet helped create an immense economic and societal \nimpact from the 1990s to today. Mr. Bloch supported NSF's take over of \nthe Defense Department's ARPANET, creating the government-owned and \nmanaged NSFNET connected to five university-based supercomputer centers \nvia a 56-Kbps backbone. NSFNET replaced ARPANET in 1990 and expanded to \ninclude a variety of regional networks that linked universities into \nthe backbone network. The only other wide-area networks in existence, \nall government owned, supported only limited numbers of specialized \ncontractors and researchers. Mr. Bloch supported key colleagues at NSF, \nlike Steve Wolff, and they had the vision to see the power of \nnetworking in the academic and research communities, and in the process \ncreated a powerful user base, the first real customer base, that would \nnot let the networking revolution stop. Just 10 years later, the \nInternet was ``owned'' by no one and managed by a wide variety of \ncommercial and nonprofit organizations on a decentralized basis. \nNSFNET's backbone operated at 45 Mbps, which was raised to 155 Mbps \nafter NSFNET was decommissioned. NSFNET was decommissioned in 1995 when \nthere was enough commercial Internet service providers, web browsers, \nand search engines to sustain the networks, operations, and \nmanagement--nearly 60,000 networks were connected to the backbone. Now, \n61.4 percent of the U.S. population has online access according to the \nlatest Nielsen Net Ratings.\n  According to a report published by the policy division of non-profit \ncorporation SRI International entitled ``The Role of NSF's Support of \nengineering in Enabling Technological Innovation,'' Erich Bloch played \nan important leadership role in three key decisions that spurred \ntoday's Internet. First, he influenced the NSF decision to make NSFNET \nan ``open'' network rather than one that served supercomputer \nresearchers exclusively. NSF decided to make NSFNET a three-tiered, \ndistributed network consisting of backbone, regional or mid-level \nnetworks, and local, initially campus-based, networks. Finally, NSF \ndecided to make the Internet self-supporting, and a series of decisions \nMr. Bloch backed concerning the implementation of the self-supporting \nInternet led to its burgeoning. DARPA in the '70's developed the \nprototype for the Internet, ARPANET. Assisted by Erich Bloch's \nleadership, NSF played a crucial role in transitioning NSFNET in the \n1980s into the remarkable Internet system so important to us today.\n  Internet innovation was not Mr. Bloch's only role at NSF. Before his \narrival at NSF, the agency largely saw computing as a research tool for \nexisting science disciplines. As detailed in the book, ``Funding the \nRevolution'' by the National Research Council, Mr. Bloch treated \ncomputing as a new scientific field in its own right, both a new \nscience and an interdisciplinary science connector. Mr. Bloch created a \nnew science directorate at NSF entirely for computing, consolidating \nall of NSF's computing initiatives in one place, and recruited another \nfamed computer pioneer, Gordon Bell of DEC, to head it up. Computer \nscience was now on a par with the established physical and biological \nsciences and budgeting at NSF grew from $23 million in 1984 to $100 \nmillion in 1986 and has continued to rise since then. While NSF had \nfollowed distantly behind DARPA's leadership in computing, under Erich \nBloch it came into its own and began sponsoring important scientific \ncomputing advances.\n\n  Erich Bloch has always realized government's significant role in \ntechnology development, in coordination with the academic and \ncommercial sectors. In receiving this award, he acknowledged that, ``we \nhave learned that in these days of rapid development and keen \ncompetition much is to be gained from cooperative activities.'' He \ncontinued that, ``the global market is a reality'' due to the \ndevelopment of\n\n[[Page S6243]]\n\ncomputers, communication networks and IT. ``This paradigm change has \npushed science and technology to the forefront of policy issues and \npolicy considerations, here and across the globe.''\n  Along with Erich Bloch's key contributions to computing and the \nInternet and his foresightedness in matters of public policy, he \ndeserves acclaim for the role that he has played in education. His \ncreation of the NSF engineering research centers and science and \ntechnology centers reflect his belief in knowledge transfer. He brought \ntogether university scientists and industry researchers to provide \neducational benefits and help transform engineering education as well \nas to extend fundamental research benefits to industry. In education, \nMr. Bloch also oversaw NSF's support of system wide reform for K-12 \nmath and science education, including emphasis on participation by \nwomen and minorities in science and engineering. During his tenure, the \nbudget for education and human resources more than tripled and NSF's \noverall budget increased to $2 billion.\n  As a distinguished fellow with the Council on Competitiveness, a \nprivate, non-profit organization dedicated to furthering U.S. economic \nleadership, Mr. Bloch continues to advocate policies that promote the \neffective use of innovation in the development of the U.S. economy. He \nis also a member of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and \nTechnology, has been a distinguished visiting professor at George Mason \nUniversity, has been awarded 13 honorary degrees from major \nuniversities and ten major awards and medals, and serves as a member of \nnumerous boards in both the public and private sectors.\n  For his remarkable vision, innovation, and continued contributions to \nthe advanced technology sector and to the national interest in the \neconomy and education, Erich Bloch is most deserving of the venerable \nVannevar Bush Award. Very few can boast of having made similar \ncontributions to society. I am delighted to bring this honor to the \nattention of my colleagues, awarded to a computer and Internet pioneer, \na visionary research administrator and science educator, to the \nattention of my colleagues and to express my sincere congratulations to \nMr. Bloch.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/27/senate-section/article/S6243-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ANTI-SEMITISM IN EUROPE\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to call \nattention to an editorial in today's Washington Post. Anti-Defamation \nLeague Director Abe Forman has written an excellent piece on the recent \nwave of anti-Semitism in Europe. The Anti-Defamation League today \nreleased a telling survey on anti-Semitic attitudes in America and \nabroad and the results are nothing less than chilling. I would call on \nall my colleagues to take a look at this important survey and recommit \nourselves to stopping all prejudice--particularly anti-Semitism both \nhere and in Europe.\n  I ask to have today's editorial by Abe Foxman printed in the Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n                      Europe's Anti-Israel Excuse\n\n            (By Abraham H. Foxman--Thursday, June 27, 2002)\n\n       Throughout history a constant barometer for judging the \n     level of hate and exclusion vs. the level of freedom and \n     democracy in any society has been anti-Semitism--how a \n     country treats its Jewish citizens. Jews have been persecuted \n     and delegitimized throughout history because of their \n     perceived differences. Any society that can understand and \n     accept Jews is typically more democratic, more open and \n     accepting of ``the other.'' The predictor has held true \n     throughout the ages.\n       During the Holocaust, Jews and other minorities of Europe \n     were dispatched to the camps and, ultimately, their deaths in \n     an environment rife with anti-Semitism. Nearly 60 years later \n     in a modern, democratic Europe that presumably had shed \n     itself of the legacy of that era, Jews have again come under \n     attack. During the past year and a half a troubling epidemic \n     of anti-Jewish hatred, not isolated to any one country or \n     community, has produced a climate of intimidation and fear in \n     the Jewish communities of Europe. Never, as a Holocaust \n     survivor, did I believe we would witness another eruption of \n     anti-Semitism of such magnitude, in Europe of all places. But \n     the resiliency of anti-Semitism is unparalleled. It rears its \n     ugly head in far-flung places, like Malaysia and Japan, where \n     there are no Jews.\n       The Anti-Defamation League has been taking the pulse of \n     anti-Semitism in America for more than 40 years. Never did I \n     expect that we would have to do the same in Europe, given the \n     history and our expectation that European anti-Semitism, \n     while not eradicated, would be so marginal and so rejected \n     that it would not be a major concern.\n       What we found in the countries we surveyed--Britain, \n     France, Germany, Belgium, and Denmark--was shocking and \n     disturbing. Classical anti-Semitism, coupled with a new form \n     fueled by anti-Israel sentiment, has become a potent and \n     dangerous mix in countries with enormous Muslim and Arab \n     populations.\n       More than 1 million Jews live in these five nations, and \n     their communities are under siege. Who would have believed \n     that we would see the burning of synagogues and attacks on \n     Jewish students, rabbis, Jewish institutions and Jewish-owned \n     property?\n       While European leaders have attempted to explain away these \n     attacks as a fleeting response to events in the Middle East \n     and not the harbinger of a more insidious and deeply \n     ingrained hatred, the attitudes of average Europeans paint a \n     far different picture. Among the 2,500 people polled in late \n     May and early June as part of our survey, 45 percent admitted \n     to their perception that Jews are more loyal to Israel than \n     their own country, while 30 percent agreed with the statement \n     that Jews have too much power in the business world. Perhaps \n     most telling, 62 percent said they believe the outbreak of \n     anti-Semitic violence in Europe is the result of anti-Israel \n     sentiment, not anti-Jewish feeling. The contrariness of their \n     own attitudes suggest that Europeans are loath to admit that \n     hatred of Jews is making a comeback.\n       This view may make Europeans more comfortable in the face \n     of what is happening in their countries, by suggesting that \n     this time around, Jews are not the innocent victims but are \n     themselves the victimizers in the Middle East. But the \n     incredibly biased reaction against Israel seen in the poll--\n     despite the fact that Israel under former prime minister Ehud \n     Barak offered the Palestinians an independent state, and \n     despite the fact that Palestinians have carried out a \n     sustained campaign of terrorism against Israeli \n     civilians--speaks to a repressed hostility to Jews that \n     may not be socially acceptable in post-Holocaust Europe. \n     Still, even with such constraints, some 30 percent of \n     Europeans are not averse to expressing their anti-Semitic \n     beliefs openly and directly.\n       Meanwhile, the Europeans have been tepid in their support \n     for the U.S. war on terrorism and especially the Bush \n     administration's efforts to broker an end to Israeli-\n     Palestinian bloodshed. The Europeans seek to appease Saddam \n     Hussein and other threats to the Western world while blaming \n     Israel, not the Palestinian Authority, for the crisis. All \n     while they minimize the extent of anti-Semitism in Europe and \n     fail to immediately condemn horrific acts of harassment and \n     vandalism. The message to Europe's burgeoning immigrant \n     population is that there is a certain level of acceptance for \n     intolerance.\n       It is time for Europe to assume responsibility for a \n     situation of its own making. The combination of significant, \n     openly expressed anti-Jewish bias together with irrational \n     anti-Israel opinions creates a climate of great concern for \n     the Jews of Europe. It is not surprising that in such an \n     atmosphere Muslim residents feel free to attack Jewish \n     students and religious institutions not because they are \n     Israelis but because they are Jews. And it is not surprising \n     that some European officials have begun telling Jewish \n     leaders to advise their numbers to avoid public displays of \n     Jewishness, instead of promising to protect their Jewish \n     communities.\n       European leaders and officials must see what is going on \n     for what it is--outright anti-Semitism--and condemn the \n     revival of this ancient hatred that had its greatest \n     manifestations on the same continent.\n       They must acknowledge that the anti-Israel vilification \n     across Western Europe is unacceptable. The recent comparisons \n     of Israelis to Nazis, to Jews as the executors of \n     ``massacres'' and even as the killers of Christ--these do not \n     fall into the category of legitimate criticism of a sovereign \n     state. They create the very climate that questions the future \n     of Jewish life in Europe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/27/senate-section/article/S6243-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6243-S6244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PASSING OF JUSTIN W. DART, JR.\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise today to give tribute to \nthe memory of Justin W. Dart, Jr., the greatest warrior in the fight \nfor the rights of disabled persons. After nearly half a century of \ntireless advocacy for the civil rights of oppressed people in America \nand around the world, my friend Justin Dart passed away on Saturday \nwith his wife and partner Yoshiko Dart at his side.\n  He was often called the Martin Luther King of the disability rights \nmovement even though he called himself ``just a foot soldier for the \ncause of freedom.'' Justin received five Presidential appointments, and \nwas awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, our Nation's highest \ncivilian honor. And without Justin, the Americans with Disabilities Act \nwould never have become the law of the land. Justin's dedication to his \nvision of a ``revolution of\n\n[[Page S6244]]\n\nempowerment'' brought together a fragmented community to march for \nfreedom for Americans with disabilities. He taught us that disabled \ndoes not mean unable.\n  When President Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act into \nlaw and gave the first pen to Justin, he protested the fact that only \nthree disability activists were on the podium, because he believed that \nthe ADA would never have been accomplished without the power of \nhundreds of people with disabilities who made the difference. When he \nfinally received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Justin sent out \nreplicas of this award to hundreds of disability rights activists \nacross the country, writing that ``this award belongs to you.''\n  Even in his final words to us he talks of the power and importance of \nequal rights for all people. Disabled people across the country and \naround the world owe a great debt to Justin Dart for his love and his \ncommitment to Justice. He is a hero not just to those with \ndisabilities, but to all of us who learned from him and served with him \nin the great causes he inspired.\n  As President Kennedy once said, ``As the dust of centuries has passed \nover our cities, we too will be remembered, not for our victories or \ndefeats in battle or in politics, but for our contribution to the human \nspirit.'' Justin Dart brought the human spirit of the disability \nmovement to life, and his spirit will live on through the lives of \nthose he touched.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/27/senate-section/article/S6244-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6244-S6245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HEROES OF OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to insert in the \nRecord the heroic accounts of the 354th Wing and 18th Fighter Squadron \nat Eielson Air Force Base in Anchorage, AK, for the vital role they \nplayed in Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  The accounts that follow describe the daring mission of three pilots \nwho were involved in a difficult rescue operation. Both Alaska, and the \nNation, appreciate and honor their heroism that helped to save lives. \nI, along with my fellow colleagues, am extremely proud of our men and \nwomen who are at this very moment, much like the 354th Wing and 18th \nFighter Squadron were doing, defending freedom and democracy around the \nworld.\n  Today we are a nation at war. A war against the evil of terrorism. \nMake no mistake, there are evil people in this world. There are people \nwhose sole purpose on this earth is to harm and kill innocent people. \nLet us not forget what happened in our country just a short time ago. \nAmerica's freedom, our freedom, the freedom of this Chamber and of \nmillions of people all over the world, are protected by the men and \nwomen who serve in the armed forces.\n  It is with utmost respect and appreciation that I share the heroic \nevents that took place during Operation Enduring Freedom. But before I \ndo, let me personally comment on why lives were saved based upon the \nacts of three fine soldiers. It all comes down to training. Our \nmilitary has an extraordinary ability to prepare our soldiers for \nbattle. Our soldiers are the best in the world. I commend the armed \nforces for preparing our soldiers for battle and for bringing them home \nsafely. It is no coincidence that our soldiers, who face grave and dire \nsituations, prevail.\n  Thirty nine lives were saved because of the actions of Lieutenant \nColonel Burt A. Bartley, Captain James R. Sears, Jr. and Captain Andrew \nJ. Lipina. The tale of this mission surely seems unreal. A MH-47 \nhelicopter was shot out of the sky. The enemy was fast closing on the \ndowned helicopter where 10 injured soldiers were in need of immediate \nmedical attention. Time was of the essence. Instantly, a rescue \noperation was put into motion. And this was no simple rescue.\n  When the enemy is armed and looking to kill, it is imperative that \nall available resources are put to their maximum utilization. After all \navailable artillery were depleted, a 500 pound bomb was dropped within \n100 meters of the crash site, creating a barrier between the wounded \nsoldiers and the advancing enemy. 100 meters, the length of a football \nfield. This allowed the rescue operation to be successfully carried \nout. As you will read, this was America at its best. I applaud the \nheroism and bravery of all those involved in this daring rescue.\n  I ask that the summary of the heroic actions of the 354th Wing and \n18th Fighter Squadron at Eielson Air Force Base, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The material follows:\n\n Citation to Accompany the Award of the Silver Star to Burt A. Bartley\n\n       Lieutenant Colonel Burt A. Bartley distinguished himself by \n     heroism and courageous action as F-16CG flight lead, 18 \n     Fighter Squadron, in support of Operation ENDURING FREEDOM. \n     Upon learning of a downed MH-47 helicopter, Lieutenant \n     Colonel Bartley departed assigned airspace to immediately \n     support the recovery of thirty-nine personnel on board. \n     Enroute to the site, Lieutenant Colonel Bartley established \n     deconfliction with two Unnammed Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and two \n     F-15Es near the crash site to provide maximum support to the \n     rescue effort. With the F-15Es out of ammunition, Lieutenant \n     Colonel Bartley immediately employed 20mm cannon fire to \n     neutralize the enemy troops that were directly firing upon \n     the survivors. He made two strafing runs with little regard \n     for his own safety into rapidly rising mountaineous terrain, \n     and directly in the face of the same small arms fire that \n     downed the helicopter. He then provided a rapid talk-on to \n     his wingman, who was experiencing radio problems, to suppress \n     the advancing enemy troops. His skill and determination \n     forced the enemy troops to stop the attack on the downed \n     helicopter crew and friendly forces and concentrate on \n     digging in for cover approximately 50 meters from the crashed \n     MH-47. After expending all 500 rounds of 20mm ammunition he \n     stayed with the Ground Forward Air Controller (GFAC) on the \n     radio while his wingman passed all critical information to \n     command and control assets and located the tanker. His \n     actions resulted in the flight's ability to maintain \n     continuous contact with the GFAC and continue to threaten the \n     advancing enemy forces for over two and a half hours. Upon \n     returning to the crash site, the GFAC reported that the \n     previously pinned down enemy had begun to close in on their \n     position again. After his wingman had verified from command \n     and control that no other airborne assets had 20mm or light \n     ordnance, Lieutenant Colonel Bartley informed the GFAC of the \n     impending danger and at the GFAC's request dropped 500 pound \n     bombs within 100 meters of the crash site in order to keep \n     the enemy forces at bay. Meanwhile, a second GFAC reported \n     two more critically wounded soldiers requiring immediate \n     evacuation. Lieutenant Colonel Bartley pinned down the enemy, \n     and directed his wingman to coordinate for the air \n     evacuation. He offered to escort the helicopters through the \n     area with numerous small arms threats and Rocket Propelled \n     Grenards. His quick thinking and superior coordination \n     allowed friendly forces to maintain a secure location in \n     extremely close proxmity to the impact points and undoubtedly \n     saved the lives of 21 uninjured survivors and 10 wounded in \n     the crash site, and enabled the safe recovery of all 39 \n     Americans. The undaunted leadership, extreme heroism and \n     courageous actions of Lieutenant Colonel Bartley are \n     consistent with the highest traditions of the United States \n     Air Force.\n                                  ____\n\n\n         Andrew J. Lipina: Distinguished Flying Cross Narrative\n\n       Captain Andrew J. Lipina distinguished himself by \n     extraordinary heroism and gallantry in action as F-16CG \n     fighter pilot, 18th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron, in \n     support of Operation ENDURING FREEDOM. During the third day \n     of Operation ANACONDA, Captain Lipina learned of a downed MH-\n     47 helicopter with the survivors actively taking fire, and \n     departed assigned airspace to immediately support the \n     recovery effort. Thirty-nine personnel were on board when a \n     Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) attack disabled their \n     aircraft. Enroute to the site Captain Lipina quickly took \n     control of external communication and coordinated with \n     command and control assets to relocate air refueling tanker \n     assets to support the rescue effort. He further deconflicted \n     with two Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and two F-15Es near \n     the crash site. His formation quickly coordinated with the \n     Ground Forward Air Controller (GFAC) to establish situational \n     awareness. With the F-15E out of ammunition, Captain Lipina \n     immediately employed 20mm cannon fire to neutralize the enemy \n     troops that were directly firing upon the survivors from \n     within 100 meters. He made two strafing runs, each closer to \n     the crash site than the previous, with little regard for his \n     own safety in order to help protect them from being overrun. \n     These strafing passes were not only into rapidly rising \n     mountainous terrain, but also directly in the face of the \n     same small arms that downed the helicopter. His skill and \n     determination forced the enemy troops to stop the attack on \n     the downed helicopter crew and friendly forces and \n     concentrate on digging in under the cover of a tree located \n     approximately 50 meters from the crashed MH-47. After \n     expending all 500 rounds of 20mm ammunition he coordinated \n     with command and control assets to inform them of the \n     disposition of friendly casualties and the location of their \n     tanker. With their assigned tanker experiencing a air-\n     refueling malfunction, Captain Lipina rapidly pointed the \n     formation to the next closest tanker and masterfully \n     coordinated to move it toward the crash site. Upon returning \n     to the crash site from air refueling, the GFAC reported that \n     the previously\n\n[[Page S6245]]\n\n     pinned down enemy had begun to close in on their position \n     again. His actions resulted in the flight's ability to \n     maintain continuous contact with the GFAC and continue to \n     threaten the advancing enemy forces for over two and a half \n     hours. After he had verified from command and control that no \n     other airborne assets had 20mm or light ordnance, Captain \n     Lipina's flight lead dropped 500 pound bombs within 100 \n     meters of the crash site in order to keep the enemy forces at \n     bay. Captain Lipina expertly sanitized the area for MANPADS \n     and anti-aircraft artillery in the hostile and hazardous \n     region of the downed helicopter. This was extremely important \n     since a previous flight has been engaged by MANPADS. \n     Meanwhile a second GFAC reported two critically wounded \n     soldiers requiring immediate air evacuation. While his lead \n     continued to work on pinning down the enemy, Captain Lipina \n     began to coordinate for the air evacuation and offered his \n     remaining bombs to escort the rescue helicopters through an \n     area with numerous small arms and RPG threats. Additionally, \n     he coordinated for other assets to move into position to \n     support the survivors on the ground. The undaunted courage \n     and heroism of Captain Lipina undoubtely saved the lives of \n     21 uninjured survivors and 10 wounded in the crash site and \n     enabled the safe recovery of all 39 Americans.\n\n        James R. Sears Jr.: Distinguished Flying Cross Narrative\n\n       Captain James R. Sears Jr. distinguished himself by heroism \n     and extraordinary achievement while participating in aerial \n     flight as F-16CG flight lead, 18th Expeditionary Fighter \n     Squadron on 20 January 2002. Captain Sears distinguished \n     himself as On Scene Commander for a downed CH-53 in a heavily \n     defended area of Taliban control in Northern Afghanistan \n     during Operation ENDURING FREEDOM. During the Combat Search \n     and Rescue he organized, directed, and controlled a total of \n     13 aircraft including three Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, five \n     helicopters, one C-130, two F-16s, and two F-18s. He rapidly \n     developed a deconfliction plan that ensured the safety of all \n     assets and allowed them to operate within a five nautical \n     mile radius of the downed helicopter.\n       After receiving the initial coordinates of the crash site \n     he realized they were over one nautical mile off the actual \n     location in heavily mountainous terrain. After a diligent, \n     methodical search of the area, Captain Sears was able to get \n     his eyes on the site, provide a perfect talk-on for his \n     wingman, and direct the other support assets to the crash \n     site. Using on-board sensors, Captain Sears was quickly able \n     to pass updated coordinates to the thousandth of a degree to \n     command and control agencies without compromising the safety \n     of the entire rescue operation. He expertly sanitized the 60 \n     nautical mile ingress and egress route through enemy \n     territory.\n       Captain Sears then executed the demanding task of rescue \n     escort for two helicopters. This involved maintaining visual \n     contact and constant coverage while flying over 300 knots \n     faster and being 15,000 feet higher than the helicopters. \n     Captain Sears, in conjunction with command and control \n     assets, coordinated a plan to move three separate tankers \n     close enough to the crash site to ensure constant command for \n     the entire time on scene. Captain Sears' flawless flight \n     leadership allowed him to intercept and visually identify a \n     Red Cross aircraft flying in the vicinity of the downed \n     helicopter, not identifiable by electronic means or talking \n     to command and control assets, ensuring the safety of the \n     entire rescue effort. Captain Sears passed off On Scene \n     Commander duties to two United States Navy F-18s after 4.5 \n     hours on scene. Captain Sears' tireless efforts and \n     tremendous focus was unprecedented considering in his single-\n     seat F-16 he flew more than 3500 miles, logged 11.1 hours, \n     and ten air refuelings requiring more than 120,000 pounds of \n     fuel to be onloaded through hostile territory. Captain Sears' \n     courage, superior airmanship, and unwavering devotion to duty \n     in the face of personal danger were instrumental in \n     accomplishing this hazardous mission and were in keeping with \n     the highest traditions of the U.S. Air Force.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/27/senate-section/article/S6245-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TO JAN OMUNDSON AND PAM ELJ\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, on many occasions in the past year \nand a half, I have come to the floor on behalf of steelworkers and \ntheir families who live on Minnesota's Iron Range in northeastern \nMinnesota. Like other steel-producing regions, the Iron Range has been \nhard hit by unfair foreign imports, devastating the United States steel \nand iron ore industries. And last year, Minnesota's Iron Range economy \nwas rocked by the bankruptcy and closure of the LTV Steel Mining \nCompany in Hoyt Lakes.\n  When the LTV Steel Mining Company closed, 1,400 employees were thrown \nout of work. Many of these men and women had dedicated their entire \nworking lives to LTV. They are hardworking people with families and \nbills to pay. In addition to the layoffs, 1,700 retirees lost portions \nof their pensions and all of their health insurance and life insurance.\n  But if you know anything about Minnesota, you understand that in hard \ntimes we pull together and we persevere. This is especially true about \nthe hardworking people of the Iron Range.\n  Today, I'd like to recognize two very unselfish Minnesotans, Jan \nOmundson and Pam Elj, who have gone above and beyond the call of normal \nduty to help the people hurt by the LTV closing.\n  For the past 3 months, Jan and Pam traveled more than 160 round-trip \nmiles each day, from the Cities of Duluth and Virginia respectively, to \nhelp hundreds of displaced LTV employees and retirees understand their \nhealth care options. When an economic tragedy like this strikes a \ncommunity, it's often a very painful, stressful, and confusing time for \nthe families affected. Thanks to Jan and Pam, people affected now have \na much better understanding of their benefits and their rights.\n  In her role as coordinator of the Arrowhead Area Agency on Aging's \nState Health Insurance Assistance Program, Jan Omundson led this team \neffort by organizing dozens of informational meetings to educate \ndisplaced LTV workers and retirees regarding their options. She was \nassisted by Pam Elj, who is a counselor with the Arrowhead Economic \nOpportunity Agency's Senior Insurance Advocacy Program. Together, they \nmet with hundreds of retirees, displaced workers, and their families \nand outlined detailed and valuable information about options for health \ncare coverage.\n  Jan and Pam were key to the success of this effort and it would not \nhave been possible without the support and resources of the Arrowhead \nRegional Development Commission, the Arrowhead Economic Opportunity \nAgency, the Hoyt Lakes Community Credit Union, the City of Biwabik, and \nBlue Cross/Blue Shield of Minnesota.\n  I thank them all for their dedication and assistance during this very \ndifficult time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/27/senate-section/article/S6245-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6245-S6246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             COMMUNITY HERO\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today I salute a community \nleader in my home State of Oregon. I want to recognize the efforts of \nSusan Abravanel, Education Coordinator at SOLV, a nonprofit \norganization in Oregon, in advocating for service-learning, one of the \nmost exciting educational initiatives taking hold in our Nation today.\n  Service-learning gives students the opportunity to learn through \ncommunity service, but it is important to note that it is much more \nthan just community service. It is a method of classroom instruction \nthat engages a student's intellect through hands-on work outside the \nclassroom that benefits the community at large. Research shows that \nstudents participating in service-learning make gains on achievement \ntests, complete their homework more often, and increase their grade \npoint averages.\n  In addition to producing academic gains, service-learning is also \nassociated with both increased attendance and reduced dropout rates. It \nis clear to educators across the country that service-learning helps \nstudents feel more connected to their own education while strengthening \ntheir connection to their community as well. It is for all of these \nreasons that Susan Abravanel is working so hard to advocate for \nservice-learning in classrooms in Oregon and across the nation.\n  Ms. Abravanel is working closely with my office and with education \nleaders in Oregon to ensure that my home state remains a national \nleader in service-learning. Just 2 months ago, I introduced a bill with \nmy colleague, Senator Edwards, to strengthen our Nation's commitment to \nservice-learning. I feel confident that this bill will soon become law \nand that with Ms. Abravanel's continued efforts both here in \nWashington, DC and at home in Oregon, students will continue to benefit \nfrom an education tied to civic engagement.\n  Ms. Abravanel exemplifies the type of engaged citizen our schools \nmust endeavor to produce, and her persistence will ensure that future \ngenerations of Americans will give back to their communities just as \nshe has. I would also like to note that Susan isn't just concerned \nabout education, her interests and efforts in Portland's Jewish \ncommunity are well known and highly appreciated, she is the new \nPresident of\n\n[[Page S6246]]\n\nthe Oregon chapter of the American Jewish Committee. I look forward to \nworking with Susan in her new role at the AJC and thank her for her \ncontinuing devotion to service-learning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/27/senate-section/article/S6246-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/27/senate-section/article/S6246-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/27/senate-section/article/S6246-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:29 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3180.

A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to facilitate \nan increase in programming and content on radio that is locally and \nindependently produced, to facilitate competition in radio programming, \nradio advertising, and concerts, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will promote competition in the radio and concert industries.\n  This legislation will begin to address many of the concerns that I \nhave heard from my constituents regarding the concentration of \nownership in the radio and concert industry and its effect on \nconsumers, artists, local businesses, and ticket prices.\n  A few weeks ago, I began discussing with my colleagues a number of \nconcerns that I have been hearing from Wisconsinites. Anti-competitive \npractices are hurting local radio station owners, local businesses, \nconsumers, and artists.\n  During the debate of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, I joined a \nnumber of my colleagues in opposing the deregulation of radio ownership \nrules because of concerns about its effect on consumers, artists, and \nlocal radio stations.\n  Passage of this act was an unfortunate example of the influence of \nsoft money in the political process. As my colleagues will recall, I \nhave consistently said that this act was bought and paid for by soft \nmoney. Everyone was at the table, except for the consumers.\n  We have enacted legislation to rid the system of this loophole in \ncampaign finance law, but we must also repair the damage that it \nallowed.\n  In just five years since its passage, the effects of the \nTelecommunications Act have been far worse than we imagined. While I \nopposed this act because of its anti-consumer bias, I did not predict \nthat the elimination of the national radio ownership caps and \nrelaxation of local ownership caps would have triggered such a \ntremendous wave of consolidation and harmed such as diverse range of \ninterests.\n\n  This legislation did not simply raise the national ownership limits \non radio stations, it eliminated them all together. It also \ndramatically altered the local radio station ownership limits through \nthe implementation of a tiered ownership system that allowed a company \nto own more radio stations in the larger markets.\n  When the 1996 Telecommunications Act became law there were \napproximately 5,100 owners of radio stations. Today, there are only \nabout 3,800 owners, a decrease of about 25 percent.\n  Concentration at the local levels are unprecedented.\n  At the same time that ownership of radio stations has become \nincreasingly concentrated, some large radio station ownership groups \nhave also bought promotion services and advertising.\n  I have been hearing from people at home in Wisconsin, from Radio \nstation owners, artists, broadcasters, and concert promoters who are \nbeing pushed out by anti-competitive practices, practices that result \nfrom an increasingly concentrated market.\n  I am very concerned that these levels of concentration are pushing \nindependent radio station owners and concert promoters out of business. \nAnd I am concerned that a few companies are leveraging their cross-\nownership of radio, concert promotion, and venues in an anti-\ncompetitive manner.\n  My legislation addresses these concerns by prohibiting any entity \nthat owns radio stations, concert promotion services, or venues from \nleveraging their cross-ownership in anti-competitive manner. Under this \nproposal, the FCC would revoke the license of any radio station that \nuses its cross owner\n\n[[Page S6253]]\n\nship of promotion services or venues to prevent access to the airwaves, \nvenues, or in other anti-competitive ways.\n  For example, if an owner of a radio station and promotion service \nhindered access to the airwaves of a rival promoter, then the owner \nwould be subject to penalties.\n  My legislation will also ensure that any future consolidation does \nnot result in these anti-competitive practices. It will strengthen the \nFCC merger review process by requiring the FCC to scrutinize the \nmergers of large radio station ownership groups to consider the effect \nof national and local concentration on independent radio stations, \nconcert promoters and consumers.\n  At the same time, it will also curb future local consolidation by \npreventing any upward revision of the limitation of multiple ownership \nof radio stations in local markets.\n  It will also close a loophole that currently allows large radio \nownership companies to exceed the cap by ``warehousing stations'' \nthrough a third party. In these arrangements, large radio owners \ncontrol a station through a third party, but the stations are not \naccounted for in their local ownership cap.\n  Finally, my legislation will also address many of the problems \ncreated by the consolidation in the radio industry, such as the new \nforms of payola. This legislation will require the FCC to modernize the \nFederal payola prohibition to prevent these large radio station \nownership groups from leveraging their power to extract money or other \nconsideration from artists, such as forcing them to play concerts for \nfree.\n  Radio is a public medium and we must ensure that it serves the public \ngood. The concentration of ownership, in the radio and concert \nindustry, has caused great harm to people and businesses that have been \ninvolved in and concerned about the industry for generations.\n  It also harms the flow of creativity and ideas that artists seek to \ncontribute to our society. This concentration does a disservice to our \nsociety at every level of the industry, and it must be addressed.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me to cosponsor this legislation to help \nto restore competition to the radio and concert industry by putting \nindependent radio stations and concert promoters on a level playing \nfield in the marketplace. This will help promote competition, local \ninput, and diversity, and promote consumer choices.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself, Mr Torricelli, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. \n        Nelson of Florida):\n  S. 2692. A bill to provide additional funding for the second round of \nempowerment zones and enterprise communities; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, ``The \nRound II Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community, EZ/EC, Flexibility Act \nof 2002,'' to provide funding for the Round II Enterprise Zone/\nEnterprise Community program. I want to thank and acknowledge Senators \nTorricelli, Durbin and Nelson of Florida for their cosponsorship of \nthis bill.\n  This legislation would encourage economic development throughout the \nEZ/EC program, particularly to the 15 Round II urban and 5 rural \nempowerment zones that were designated in 1999. Each of those \ncommunities has put together strong strategic initiatives to promote \neconomic growth.\n  The legislation would help ensure that these Round II communities \nwill be provided with the funding they have been promised. The bill \nalso would authorize the use of EZ/EC grants as a match for other \nrelevant Federal programs. This would provide the EZ/EC program with \nmaximum flexibility to implement initiatives at the local level.\n  The Enterprise Zone/Enterprise Community program was created to \nprovide Federal assistance over ten years in designated urban and rural \ncommunities that would fuel economic revitalization and job growth. The \nprogram does so primarily by providing federal grants to communities \nand tax and regulatory relief to help communities attract and retain \nbusinesses.\n  Unfortunately, an inequity now exists between the way Round I and \nRound II EZs and ECs have been funded. Those communities that won EZ \ndesignations in the initial round, in 1994, received full funding from \nthe Congress, which made all grant awards available for use within the \nfirst two years of designation. However, EZs and ECs designated in \nRound II did not receive this same funding authority.\n  Federal benefits promised to the Round IIs included funding grants of \n$100 million for each urban zone, $40 million for each rural zone and \nabout $3 million for each Enterprise Community over a ten-year period \nbeginning in 1999. In reliance on those ``promised'' funds, Round II \nzones prepared strategic plans for economic revitalization based on the \navailability of that funding. However, unlike Round I designees, who \nreceived a full funding up front, Round II zones have received a mere \nfraction of the funding promise.\n  The lack of a certain, predictable funding stream will ultimately \nundermine the ability of Round II EZs/ECs to effectively implement \ntheir economic growth strategies in their designated communities. And \nthat's a shame, because the EZ/EC initiative has produced real results.\n  In fact, I'm proud to say that one of the best Round II EZs is \nlocated in Cumberland County, NJ. The Cumberland County Empowerment \nZone, a collaborative effort of the communities of Bridgeton, \nMillville, Vineland and Port Norris, has been a model EZ, and committed \nall the funds made available to it by HUD.\n  Since the creation of the EZ, Cumberland County has witnessed more \nthan 100 housing units rehabbed, renovated or newly built. A $4 million \nloan pool has been created to fund community and small business \nreinvestment. The EZ also has led to the funding for over 60 economic \ndevelopment initiatives, utilizing more than $11 million in funding to \nleverage $120 million in private, public and tax exempt bond financing.\n  These, are real results. And if the Federal commitment to the EZ \ncontinues, over 1,100 new jobs will be created in the County over the \nnext year and a half alone.\n  Cumberland County is just one example of how the EZ/EC initiative has \nbrought hope and promise to communities throughout America. We need to \ndo more to support and build on these initiatives. Now is the time for \nCongress to fulfill the promise made to Round II EZs and ECs.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation, and hope the \nSenate will expedite its consideration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself and Mr. Corzine):\n  S. 2693: A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nencourage retirement savings for individuals by providing a refundable \ncredit for individuals to deposit in a Social Security Plus account, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Board of Trustees for the Social \nSecurity Trust Fund issued its annual report in March describing the \nfinancial health of the Trust Fund and its outlook for the future. The \nreport shows that the financial condition of the Trust Fund over the \nnext few decades has improved somewhat since last year, that is, the \nSocial Security program is now expected to remain solvent for three \nadditional years through 2041. This is welcome news for the tens of \nmillions of baby boomers who will depend on this program in the coming \ndecades.\n  However, this latest Trustees' report also makes clear that the \nSocial Security program still faces significant long-term financial \nchallenges. This finding was not unexpected. In fact, there is already \nbipartisan agreement in Congress that we will need to make some careful \nchanges to the Social Security system in order to guarantee the \nsolvency of the Social Security Trust Fund beyond 2041. Today, Senator \nCorzine of New Jersey and I are introducing legislation that we think \nshould be part of those reform discussions.\n  Our legislation, called the Social Security Plus Account Act, builds \nupon two fundamental principles: One, the underlying guaranteed defined \nbenefit approach of the current Social Security program should not be \nscrapped or weakened. Social Security has become the foundation of the \nNation's retirement system, something that people\n\n[[Page S6254]]\n\ncan always count on. At a time when private employers are shifting more \nretirement saving risks onto the shoulders of their employees through \nthe use of defined contribution plans like 401(k) plans rather than \ntraditional defined benefit pension plans, the need to retain Social \nSecurity's basic guaranteed payment is paramount.\n  Second, this legislation recognizes that Congress must do more to \nencourage families and individuals, especially those of modest means, \nto increase their savings and to build a retirement nest egg. \nSpecifically, our legislation provides for the creation of new tax-\nfavored retirement savings accounts that individuals and families could \naccess to supplement, but not replace, their expected future Social \nSecurity benefits.\n  Unlike many reform proposals, this legislation leaves the Social \nSecurity program intact. Many privatization plans force you to choose \nbetween individual accounts and the loss of Social Security's \nguaranteed benefit at current levels. Our proposal calls for personal \naccounts as an ``add-on'' to Social Security. This is an important \ndistinction from the ``carve-out'' accounts featured in privatization \nplans. Privatization plans will inevitably reduce traditional \nguaranteed benefits. Our approach would not.\n  Under this legislation, eligible individuals can set up and make tax-\nfavored contributions of up to $2,000 to a new Social Security Plus \nAccount, SSPA. To provide an extra savings boost for low- and moderate-\nincome families, our legislation would require the Federal Government \nto provide matching contributions between 25 and 100 percent for \nmarried couples with adjusted gross income below $100,000, $50,000 for \nsingles. The $2,000 limit applies to the total of the individual's own \ncontribution and the Federal match. This will make it much more \naffordable for low and moderate earners to fully fund their accounts.\n  Like traditional individual retirement accounts, SSPAs can grow tax-\nfree. For example, if an individual aged 30 who files a joint return \nand has annual earnings of about $25,000 contributes $500 to a SSPA, \nthe Federal Government would match that contribution with a $500 \ncontribution to the account. If that individual contributes $500 in \ncash each year to the account for 32 years, earning 5-percent interest \nper year, until retirement at age 62, he or she would have some $80,000 \navailable for distribution from the account. This amount grows to \n$160,000 if the individual is able to contribute the maximum in each \nyear.\n  Let's take another example. Assume that an individual who is forty \nyears old, files a joint return and has annual adjusted gross income of \n$80,000. If he or she could make the maximum permissible contribution \neach year until reaching age 62, along with an annual government match \nof $400, he or she might expect to have at least $160,128 available at \nretirement.\n  Under our legislation, the accrued amounts that are paid out or \ndistributed when the holder of a SSPA retires, dies or becomes disabled \nare treated like Social Security benefits and a portion of the \ndistributions would be taxed only above certain threshold amounts.\n  Now I fully understand that we may not be able to enact this \nlegislation this year or next. Regrettably, last year's highly-touted \nprojected budget surpluses have vanished for at least the next several \nyears and resources are now scarce. The massive tax cuts put in place \nin the summer of 2001, and scheduled to take full effect over a period \nof years, will make finding adequate funds for many of the Nation's \ncritical spending priorities even more difficult.\n  However, many of the privatization proposals would require massive \ninfusions from the Treasury general revenue fund to offset the \ntransition and other costs for even partial privatization initiatives. \nIf such resources are available, it seems to me that we would better \nserve our citizens by using these scarce resources to enact Social \nSecurity Plus Accounts that will help them save for retirement but not \nput the underlying Social Security program at risk.\n  The current Social Security system has served us well for many years \nand will continue to do so if we make some adjustments. Still we all \nknow that Social Security reform is needed. I remain committed to \nworking on a bipartisan basis to address the long-term solvency issues \nfacing Social Security and to improve retirement savings. And we do \nneed to implement appropriate Social Security reforms as soon as our \nresources will allow us. Needlessly delaying efforts to shore up Social \nSecurity for the long term would likely require more severe action.\n\n  We certainly can't afford to make matters worse in the interim. A \nnumber of us in the Senate are concerned by the proposals offered by \nPresident Bush and some in Congress to eliminate the guaranteed basis \nof Social Security and replace it, in part with private accounts. The \nsuggestion to ``privatize'' Social Security, or to invest a portion or \nall of the trust funds in the stock market, has been supported by the \nlarge investment banking houses and many others who believe that doing \nso would produce higher returns and improve the solvency of the system.\n  Several of the President's Commission on Social Security \nprivatization plans would divert some of the payroll taxes that are \ncurrently being collected. Some of the proposals would use well over $1 \ntrillion from the Social Security Trust Fund. This would immediately \nand adversely impact the financial well-being of the Social Security \nTrust Fund, putting in jeopardy both current and future Social Security \nbenefits\n  I do not believe that investing the proceeds of the Social Security \nsystem in the stock market through individual accounts provides the \nkind of stability and certainty we need for the management of the \nSocial Security program. Social Security is intended to provide what \nits name suggests, security. Stock market investments do not provide \nthis secure foundation. They increase, on average, over certain time \nperiods. But people don't retire at average times. They retire at \nparticular times.\n  This point is mostly glossed over by the President's Commission to \nStrengthen Social Security. The Commission issued its final report last \nDecember that included several reform options that would allow workers \nto invest in personal retirement accounts, but reduce their traditional \nguaranteed Social Security benefit. In my judgment, no one, including \nthe President's Commission, has provided a satisfactory answer to the \nquestion of what happens to people who retire when the market is down \nif we change Social Security, even partly, from a social insurance \nprogram to a stock market investment program. This is not mere \npolemics. The Enron debacle, the boom and bust of the dot com companies \nof the late 1990s, and the declining stock prices of recent weeks all \nserve as stark reminders to all of us about the perils of investing in \nthe stock market.\n  Again, I will be working for appropriate reforms to extend the life \nof the Social Security Trust Fund so future generations can rely on \nSocial Security. Social Security Plus Accounts can provide a much-\nneeded supplement to the basic program, but would do so without \nundermining it. They do not reform the program by themselves, but are \ndesigned to be part of a responsible reform package.\n  For many of our nation's seniors, Social Security is the difference \nbetween poverty and a dignified retirement. When President Franklin D. \nRoosevelt signed the Social Security program into law in 1935 he said \n``We can never insure one-hundred percent of the population against \none-hundred percent of the hazards and vicissitudes of life. But we \nhave tried to frame a law which will give some measure of protection to \nthe average citizen and his family against poverty ridden old age.'' \nThe importance of his words and his new social insurance plan are \nreflected in Social Security's overwhelming success today. Let's make \nsure that the promise and security of Social Security is kept for many \ngenerations to come.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider supporting this proposal in the \ncontext of comprehensive Social Security reforms considered by the \nSenate. Below I've provided a detailed summary of the Social Security \nPlus Account Act to more fully explain how the new savings accounts \nwould work.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S6255]]\n\n                Social Security Plus Account Act of 2002\n\n     In general\n       This legislation creates new tax-favored Social Security \n     Plus Accounts (SSPA). Generally, an eligible individual with \n     at least $5,000 of annual earnings and who is not a dependent \n     of another taxpayer or a full-time college student may \n     contribute up to $2,000 to a SSPA for each year until he or \n     she reaches the age of 70 & \\1/2\\. An individual whose \n     modified adjusted gross income exceeds $150,000 ($300,000 for \n     a married individual) is ineligible to make a contribution to \n     a SSPA.\n       A 20-percent refundable tax credit is allowed for eligible \n     contributions to a SSPA. In addition, the federal government \n     will match a percentage of a SSPA contribution for taxpayers \n     with modified adjusted gross income (AGI) below a certain \n     level (See below).\n       Amounts in SSPAs that are distributed for permissible \n     purposes are subject to favorable income tax treatment and \n     are not subject to penalty.\n       An eligible individual shall file a designation of the SSPA \n     to which the match is made, along with his or her tax return \n     for the year (or if no return is filed, on a form prescribed \n     by the Secretary of the Treasury) not later than the due date \n     for filing such return (including extensions) or the 15th day \n     of April, whichever is later.\n     Matching contributions\n       In the case of an eligible individual, the federal \n     government makes a matching contribution to the SSPA. This is \n     accomplished as refundable tax credit for the tax year in an \n     amount equal to the matching contribution. The allowable \n     credit is treated as an overpayment of tax which may only be \n     transferred to a SSPA.\n       The Secretary of the Treasury will make matching \n     contributions to the SSPAs of taxpayers with modified AGI \n     below a certain level. The applicable percentage shall be \n     according to the following:\n       In the case of an individual filing a joint return:\n                                          The applicable percentage is:\nIf modified adjusted gross income is:\n  $30,000 or less...................................................100\n  Over $30,000 but not over $60,000..................................50\n  Over $60,000 but not over $100,000.................................25\n  Over $100,000....................................................zero\nIn the case of a head of household:\n  $22,500 or less...................................................100\n  Over $22,500 but not over $45,000..................................50\n  Over $45,000 but not over $75,000..................................25\n  Over $75,000.....................................................zero\nIn the case of any other individual:\n  $15,000 or less...................................................100\n  Over $15,000 but not over $30,000..................................50\n  Over $30,000 but not over $50,000..................................25\n  Over $50,000.....................................................zero\n     Maximum contributions\n       The maximum annual contribution to a SSPA each year in \n     $2,000--including both the individual and matching \n     contributions. As such, the maximum annual contribution would \n     be $1,000 for those in the lowest bracket (with a $1,000 \n     maximum match), $1,333.33 for the middle bracket (with a $667 \n     maximum match) and $1,600 for the next bracket (with a $400 \n     maximum match). Those in the highest bracket with earnings \n     over $100,000 could contribute $2,000 (with no match).\n     Minimum contributions\n       The minimum annual contribution must be sufficient to \n     ensure that the total deposit is $200 (i.e. the lowest \n     bracket would have to contribute at least $100, the middle \n     bracket would have to contribute at least $133, the next \n     bracket at least $160, and the highest bracket at least \n     $200).\n     Tax treatment of SSPAs\n       Similar to traditional individual retirement accounts \n     (IRAs), amounts contributed to a SSPA would be tax-favored \n     and accounts would grow tax-free. However, amounts paid or \n     distributed out of a SSPA would be taxable like Social \n     Security benefits. That is, up to 50% of SSPA benefits are \n     taxable for taxpayers whose income plus 50% of their benefits \n     exceed $25,000 for individuals and $32,000 for couples. Up to \n     85% of SSPA benefits are taxable for taxpayers whose income \n     plus benefits exceeds $34,000 for individuals and $44,000 for \n     couples.\n     10-percent penalty for disqualified distributions\n       Distributions that are not made from a SSPA after \n     retirement, death, disability or not used for catastrophic \n     medical expenses exceeding 7.5% of AGI are includible in \n     gross income and are subject to regular tax rates and a 10-\n     percent penalty. Matching contributions from the federal \n     government may be distributed from an SSPA only after \n     retirement, at death or in the event of disability.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with Senator \nDorgan in introducing legislation, the Social Security Plus Account Act \nof 2002, that would create new tax-favored Social Security Plus \nAccounts to supplement the existing Social Security program.\n  Although the Social Security Trust Fund is now projected to remain \nsolvent for almost 40 years, I share the interest of a broad range of \nleaders in exploring ways to extend solvency further into the future. \nAt this point, it remains unclear when Social Security reform will be \ndebated. However, Senator Dorgan and I are introducing this legislation \nin the hope that it will be considered when that debate moves forward.\n  As most of my colleagues know, last year President Bush appointed a \ncommission to recommend ways to move toward privatization of Social \nSecurity. Last December, that commission issued a report that included \nproposals to establish privatized accounts into which a portion of \nSocial Security contributions would be diverted. The Bush Commission's \nproposals included deep cuts in guaranteed benefits, cut that for some \ncurrent workers would exceed 25 percent, and for future retirees would \nexceed 45 percent.\n  I strongly oppose these cuts. In my view, they would take the \nsecurity out of Social Security. That would undermine the central goal \nof the program.\n  At the same time, I recognize that, by itself, Social Security will \nnot provide sufficient funds for many retirees in the future. That is \nwhy it is important that Americans save on their own to prepare for \nretirement. I therefore support other government initiatives to promote \nprivate savings, such as individual retirement accounts and 401(k) \nplans.\n  The proposal for Social Security Plus Accounts in this legislation \ntakes the concept of an IRA or 401(k) account, and builds on it. These \nnew accounts would provide an additional and more powerful savings \nincentive for many Americans, especially middle class workers and those \nwith more modest incomes. Under our legislation, the government would \nmatch contributions by taxpayers with incomes below certain levels. In \naddition, all contributions would provide immediate tax relief: a tax \ncut equal to 20 percent of the contribution. Moreover, when a person \ntakes money out of an account at retirement, the proceeds would be \ntreated in the same manner as Social Security benefits, meaning that \nsome or all proceeds could be withdrawn tax free.\n  A Social Security Plus Account would provide a useful supplement to \nour Social Security system, without weakening that system in any way. \nUnlike the proposals of the Bush Social Security Commission, these new \naccounts would not force a reduction in traditional Social Security \nbenefits. This difference is critical.\n  Senator Dorgan and I recognize that the establishment of Social \nSecurity Plus Accounts would require resources that are not presently \navailable. We therefore appreciate that action on our legislation will \nhave to wait until later, when we have more financing. However, we \nbelieve it important to put our proposal on the table today, to help \nensure that when the appropriate time comes, our colleagues understand \nthat there is more than one way to establish personal accounts. The \nright way, as proposed in this legislation, is to establish accounts \nthat supplement Social Security, without draining the Social Security \nTrust Fund, without cutting benefits, and without undermining Social \nSecurity's promise to Americans who have paid into the system in good \nfaith.\n\n  I want to thank Senator Dorgan for his leadership in this effort. I \nlook forward to working with him to ensure that we find new and better \nways to promote savings, without undermining the basic guarantees \nprovided through Social Security.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLEN (for himself and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 2694. A bill to extend Federal recognition to the Chickahominy \nTribe, the Chickahominy Indian Tribe--Eastern Division, the Upper \nMattaponi Tribe, the Rappahannock Tribe, Inc., the Monacan Tribe, and \nthe Nansemond Tribe; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of Virginia's Indian \nTribes and to introduce a bill to extend Federal recognition to six of \nVirginia's Indian Tribes.\n  These Tribes have a rich tradition and history, not only for \nVirginia, but also for the Nation as a whole. My bill will recognize \nthe Chickahominy Tribe; the Chickahominy Tribe Eastern Division; the \nUpper Mattaponi Tribe; the Rappahannock Tribe; the Monacan Tribe; and \nthe Nansemond Tribe.\n  The title of the bill is the ``Thomasina E. Jordan Indian Tribes of \nVirginia Federal Recognition Act''. For me, this legislation also has a \nvery personal aspect to it. Thomasina Jordan\n\n[[Page S6256]]\n\nwas a dear friend of mine. As Governor of Virginia, I appointed \nThomasina as Chair of the Virginia Council on Indians, and she served \nas an advisor to me in many ways over the years. Thomasina was a great \nleader and civil rights activist in Virginia, paving the way for this \nlegislation. Regrettably, she passed away in 1999 after a long and \ncourageous battle with cancer. I offer this legislation in her memory \nas her last battle on earth was for Federal recognition of Virginia's \ntribes. Thomasina's efforts to ensure equal rights and recognition to \nall American Indians continue today in spirit because she was able to \nhave an effect on the lives of so many individuals and encourage many \nto join her quest for fairness, honor and justice.\n  The American Indians in Virginia contribute to the diverse, exciting \nnature and heritage of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Virginians are \nunited in their desire to honor these first residents and I am pleased \nthat Senator Warner and I are able to join Virginia's House Delegation \nin offering this legislation.\n  There are more than 550 federally recognized Tribes in the United \nStates. While no Tribes have been federally recognized in Virginia, the \nCommonwealth of Virginia has recognized the eight main tribes. \nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, there are over 21,000 American \nIndians living in Virginia.\n  ``Federally recognized'' means these tribes and groups can enjoy a \nspecial legal relationship with the U.S. government where no decisions \nabout their lands and people are made without Indian consent. It is \nimportant that we give Federal recognition to these proud Virginia \ntribes so that they cannot only be honored in the manner they deserve \nbut also for the many benefits that federal recognition would provide.\n  Members of federally recognized tribes, most importantly, can qualify \nfor grants for higher education opportunities.\n  There is absolutely no reason why American Indian Tribes in Virginia \nshould not share in the same benefits that so many Indian tribes around \nthe country enjoy.\n  The Indian Tribes in Virginia have one of the longest histories of \nany Indian tribe in America, which is a remarkable point considering \nnone of the tribes in Virginia are federally recognized. As Virginia \napproaches the 400th anniversary of the 1607 founding of Jamestown, the \nfirst permanent English settlement in North America, it is crucial that \nthe role of Indian tribes in Virginia in the development of our \nCommonwealth and our country are properly recognized and appreciated.\n  There are three routes that an Indian Tribe can pursue in order to \nreceive Federal recognition. One, the tribe can apply for \nadministrative recognition through the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which \nall these Virginia Tribes have done. Two, a tribe can gain Federal \nrecognition through an act of Congress. And three, the tribe can obtain \nFederal recognition through legal proceedings in the court system.\n  There has been a sharp increase in recent years of the number of \ntribes seeking Federal recognition via an application to the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs. However, the General Accounting Office recently \nreported that, while the workload at the Bureau of Indian Affairs has \nincreased dramatically, the resources to handle the large volume of \napplications has actually decreased. Since 1978, the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs has processed only 32 of the 150 applications it received, \ndeciding favorably on only 12 of them. In fact, BIA averages only 1.3 \ncompleted applications a year. The route of Federal recognition through \nthe Bureau of Indian Affairs and Bureau of Acknowledgement and \nRecognition is a cumbersome and lengthy process, which has taken \nsometimes over 20 years for an application to be decided upon.\n  In 1999, the Virginia General Assembly passed a resolution calling on \nthe U.S. Congress to grant Federal recognition to the tribes in \nVirginia. Identical legislation to what I introduce today has already \nbeen introduced in the House. I join my House colleagues, Mr. Moran of \nVirginia, Mrs. Jo Ann Davis of Virginia, Mr. Tom Davis of Virginia, Mr. \nScott, Mr. Schrock, Mr. Boucher, and Mr. Forbes in this important \nendeavor.\n  The precedent has already been set for the second route for \nattainment of Federal recognition, through an act of Congress. Since \nthe 93rd Congress (1973-1974), Congress has restored Federal \nrecognition to eighteen tribes and has granted seven new Federal \nrecognitions to tribes. In 2000, Congress passed a law to grant new \nFederal recognition to the Shawnee Indians as a separate tribe from the \nCherokee Nation of Oklahoma and another law to restore Federal \nrecognition to the tribe of Graton Rancheria of California. It is time \nthat Virginia's tribes receive the same recognition.\n  The main goal of this legislation is to establish a more equitable \nrelationship between the tribes and the State and Federal Government.\n  While I understand that some may have a concern that Federal \nrecognition of Indian tribes may lead to the establishment of gaming \noperations within a State, this is not the case. As a result of the \n1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, federally recognized Indian Tribes \ncan conduct only the gaming operations that are authorized by State \nlaw. Tribes are unable to operate casinos, slot machines or card games \nunless approved by a specific State/Tribe Compact. My bill includes \nlanguage restating this point to make it clear that nothing in the Act \nprovides an exception to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. Ultimately, \nit gives proper coverage under Virginia law so as not to provide \nspecial gaming privileges.\n  This legislation not only lays out the path for granting Federal \nrecognition to six American Indian Tribes in Virginia, but it also \nhonors and details the proud history of each of the six Tribes.\n  The Virginia tribes have fought hard to retain their heritage and \ncultural identity, and it is my hope that this legislation be seen as a \nway to recognize this identity.\n  As Americans, we need to appreciate the many contributions American \nIndians have made to our Nation in order to make it the great country \nit is today. Thomasina Jordan once wrote: ``We belong to this land. For \n10,000 years we have been here. We were never a conquered people. The \ndominant society needed us to survive in 1607, and it needs American \nIndians and our spiritual values to survive in the next millennium.'' \nThe Commonwealth of Virginia has realized that it needs its proud \nIndian tribes. This bill is another step toward recognizing and \nappreciating this special relationship.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 2695. A bill to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to extend \nthe authority for debt reduction, debt-for-nature swaps, and debt \nbuybacks to nonconsessional loans and credits made to developing \ncountries with tropical forests; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce, with Senator \nFeingold and Senator Lugar, a bill that could have a far-reaching \nimpact in preserving some of the most pristine tropical forest in the \nworld.\n  We seek to amend the Tropical Forest Conservation Act, TFCA, a law \npassed in 1998. The TFCA has led to the preservation of thousands of \nacres of tropical forest, particularly in the Americas, by allowing low \nand middle income countries to engage in debt-for-nature ``swaps.'' The \nTFCA allows eligible governments to divert resources currently needed \nfor debt service toward the conservation and management of disappearing \nrain forests.\n  Our amendment to TFCA would expand the use of this successful \nprogram. Our change would allow more tropical forests to be preserved. \nUnder TFCA, countries are limited to using concessional debt for making \nswaps. Concessional debt is special low-interest loans reserved for the \npoorest countries to exchange non-concessional debt, e.g. Export-Import \nbank loans, etc. for preserved forest land. This change will not only \nincrease the potential for swaps in countries with concessional debt, \nbut also make some countries newly eligible for the program.\n  One example of a country that is not currently eligible for TFCA, but \nthat has great potential for using the expanded program, is the African \nnation of Gabon. Gabon has some extraordinary, pristine forest land \nthat deserves to be preserved.\n\n[[Page S6257]]\n\n  In the fall of 2000, the National Geographic Society sponsored a \n2000-mile, 15-month expedition through Central Africa by Dr. Mike Fay, \na well known conservationist. Dr. Fay traveled through some of the last \nunexplored regions on earth, including the Langoue forest in Gabon. His \nexpedition encountered a remarkable variety of species and habitat that \nare in danger of disappearing unless we help Gabon's government \npreserve it. Dr. Fay's observations of the Langoue Forest are \ncompelling. Here are some excerpts from his report:\n\n       ``[T]here's a river in almost the dead center of Gabon \n     called the Ivindo which has an amazing set of waterfalls. \n     It's a big river, probably a hundred or so meters wide, of \n     slow, black water, and it drains almost all of northeastern \n     Gabon. These chutes, these waterfalls--two in particular \n     called Mingouli and Kongou--make this place an attraction.\n       An Italian named Giuseppe Vassallo, who died about a year \n     and a half ago . . . promoted this place as a national park \n     because he said it was the best forest in Gabon. He talked \n     about it and lobbied for it and cajoled people, but it just \n     never quite happened. We walked across this block that he'd \n     always talked about, and I actually flew over it with him in \n     '98 . . .\n       And we discovered the highest concentration of giant \n     elephants that we'd seen on the entire walk. It's probably \n     the only place left in the central African forest with \n     elephants that are abundant and with a large percentage of \n     very large males, tusks that no one has seen in a very \n     long time, one hundred pounds on a side. Giant elephants, \n     it's something you just don't see because they've been \n     pouched out of the population. [And] naive gorillas, \n     something that we hadn't seen on the entire trip. You can \n     tell they're naive because when they see you they don't \n     run away, they don't look alarmed, they don't act alarmed, \n     they don't vocalize. The males don't charge at all and \n     they get very curious. They come to see you and they \n     approach well within the danger zone. They sit there for \n     hours and they just stare as if it's something they've \n     never seen before, and it's pretty obvious that they \n     haven't.\n       You travel a little bit farther along and there's this \n     mountain that we'd been navigating toward for a few weeks, \n     and it's again full of elephants, and it's got all kinds of \n     beautiful topography and rocky cliffs. It's a real sort \n     hidden forest, and it really gives you a feeling of great \n     isolation being up on this mountain plateau. So we started \n     walking south of the mountain and pretty soon we came upon an \n     elephant trail that lead us a little bit astray. It lead us \n     to the east of where we wanted to go but we kept on following \n     it and it just got bigger and bigger and bigger. I looked a \n     the map and it was obvious that it was navigating us right \n     toward a clearing. Long before you get to an elephant \n     clearing you can tell where you're going, because the \n     elephant trail opens up to like two meters wide, it's covered \n     with dung, and there's a huge amount that are on these \n     ``highways.'' It's a lot like how major highway arteries in \n     the States get bigger as they go into the city, that's \n     basically what it is for elephants, it's an ``elephant \n     city.'' So, we get there, and there it is, this clearing that \n     no one has ever seen before, no conservationist even could \n     have imagined existed in Gabon. This place is just abounding \n     with wildlife and you think ``This place really is what old \n     Giuseppe said it was.'' Even though he had never walked in \n     it, it was as if he just knew this place was the best. The \n     place is called Langoue and it still exists.\n\n  There are about 1.2 million acres in the Langoue Forest that are \ncompletely untouched. Experts familiar with the region estimate that \nmore than 700,000 acres at the heart of the forest could be preserved \nfor about $3.5 million. This part of the forest includes the naive \ngorillas, the giant elephants, and the waterfalls.\n  At the very modest cost, our amendment will give nations like Gabon a \nnew tool for preserving their remaining tropical forest, for the \nbenefit of the people of Gabon, and for the benefit of mankind.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the interview with Dr. \nFay and the text of a letter from Conservation International appear at \nthis point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From National Geographic News, Aug. 9, 2001]\n\n      Interview: Mike Fay Is on a Trek to Preserve Forest in Gabon\n\n                           (By Andrew Jones)\n\n       Last year, conservationist J. Michael Fay completed a \n     2,000-mile (3,218-kilometer), fifteen-month walk through \n     central Africa in some of the world's most pristine forests. \n     Now, the expedition leader for the National Geographic \n     Society and an ecologist for the Wildlife Conservation \n     Society has undertaken another challenge: a personal campaign \n     to preserve nearly 250,000 hectares (618,000 acres) of forest \n     in Gabon as a national park.\n       National Geographic News: You were in the African bush for \n     fifteen months. How has that changed your perspective on \n     conservation?\n       Dr. J. Michael Fay: As a conservationist, I would say it's \n     a double-edged sword. Because when you're out there, you \n     realize how much is left. There's such abundance--it's so \n     huge, it goes on forever. You can walk for fifteen months and \n     basically be in the woods the whole time and not have to \n     traverse areas that are inhabited by humans. And you think, \n     ``Wow, that's cool. This place is at the ends of the Earth; \n     it will never be touched.'' Then you look at the map and the \n     logging activity and you look at the human expansion and you \n     think, ``This place is all going to disappear in the next \n     seven to ten years.''\n       It makes you wake up to the fact that human beings, even in \n     the 21st century, still don't regard natural resources as \n     something precious. Because if they did, there would be a \n     worldwide effort to preserve these places rather than extract \n     wood out of them as quickly as possible with zero regard for \n     ecosystems, while wasting most of that wood before you get it \n     to the market. So from my perspective, it was pretty \n     depressing.\n       NG News: do you think there's anyone in particular to \n     blame? Or is there no one person or group we can point to as \n     the source of the problem?\n       Fay: I think the human species is what it is. It evolved to \n     extract as many resources as it possibly could from the \n     environment to survive better and better. That's kind of what \n     humans are programmed to do. And to do the opposite of that, \n     to conserve, I think is a very difficult thing for people to \n     even comprehend, let alone enact. It's kind of counter-\n     evolutionary, and I think it takes a lot of education and a \n     lot of foresight. If humans want to survive on this planet \n     without having some kind of catastrophic event take out large \n     percentages of the population someday in the future, then \n     they're going to have to make that shift. A lot of people \n     talk about it, a lot of people understand it, but it's really \n     hard to make that last jump and actually say, ``Okay, I'm \n     going to make a switch.''\n       NG News: You're now trying to have nearly 250,000 hectares \n     of forest land in Gabon designated as a national park. Why \n     did you choose that particular area?\n       Fay: Well, there's a river in almost the dead center of \n     Gabon called the Ivindo which has an amazing set of \n     waterfalls. It's a big river, probably a hundred or so meters \n     wide, of slow, black water, and it drains almost all of \n     northeastern Gabon. These chutes, these waterfalls--two in \n     particular called Mingouli and Kongou--make this place an \n     attraction.\n       An Italian named Giuseppe Vassallo, who died about a year \n     and a half ago . . . promoted this place as a national park \n     because he said it was the best forest in Gabon. He talked \n     about it and lobbied for it and cajoled people,but it just \n     never quite happened. We walked across this block that he'd \n     always talked about, and I actually flew over it with him in \n     '98. We looked at the logging companies coming in from the \n     west at a very rapid rate, and so we tried to design a walk \n     in this place that didn't go through any logging. And we \n     discovered the highest concentration of giant elephants that \n     we'd seen on the entire walk. It's probably the only place \n     left in the central African forest with elephants that are \n     abundant and with a large percentage of every large males--\n     tusks that no one has seen in a very long time, one hundred \n     pounds on a side. Giant elephants--it's something you just \n     don't see because they've been poached out of the population. \n     [And] naive gorillas--something that we hadn't seen on the \n     entire trip. You can tell they're naive because when they see \n     you they don't run away, they don't look alarmed, they don't \n     act alarmed, they don't vocalize. The males don't charge at \n     all and they get very curious. They come to see you and they \n     approach well within the danger zone. They sit there for \n     hours and they just stare as if it's something they've never \n     seen before, and it's pretty obvious that they haven't.\n       You travel a little bit farther along and there's this \n     mountain that we'd been navigating toward for a few weeks, \n     and it's again full of elephants, and it's got all kinds of \n     beautiful topography and rocky cliffs. It's a real sort of \n     hidden forest, and it really gives you a feeling of great \n     isolation being up on this mountain plateau.\n       So we started walking south of the mountain and pretty soon \n     we came upon an elephant trail that lead us a little bit \n     astray. It lead us to the east of where we wanted to go but \n     we kept on following it and it just got bigger and bigger and \n     bigger. I looked at the map and it was obvious that it was \n     navigating us right toward a clearing. Long before you get to \n     an elephant clearing you can tell where you're going, because \n     the elephant trail opens up to like two meters wide, it's \n     covered with dung, and there's a huge amount of track that \n     are on these ``highways.'' It's a lot like how major \n     highway arteries in the States get bigger as they go into \n     the city--that's basically what it is for elephants--it's \n     an ``elephant city.'' So, we get there, and there it is--\n     this clearing that no one has ever seen before, no \n     conservationist even could have imagined existed in Gabon. \n     This place is just abounding with wildlife and you think \n     ``This place really is what old Giuseppe said it was.'' \n     Even though he had never walked in it, it was as if he \n     just knew this place was the best. The place is called \n     Langoue and it still exists.\n       If you look at the map from a land-use perspective though, \n     you realize that the entire block has been given away to many \n     different\n\n[[Page S6258]]\n\n     logging companies, and they're working their way into Langoue \n     as fast as we can talk. They're going to log that entire \n     area, and there's still about 500,000 hectares [1,235,500 \n     acres] that are completely virgin, untouched forest. But \n     because of the sheer number of logging companies in there, \n     the potential to log that block completely very quickly is \n     very high. So we're launching a campaign with the government \n     and the logging companies and the conservation community and \n     with the general public to try and create a national park in \n     this place. That means pushing back time. That means going \n     back in time essentially four or five years [ago], when there \n     were no logging concessions in this place. And that's \n     difficult to do. And it's expensive.\n       NG News: How much money are you looking to raise?\n       Fay: Well, if we had three and a half million dollars \n     today, right now, we can go into Gabon tomorrow and negotiate \n     the logging rights for those concessions and maybe preserve \n     300,000 hectares [741,000 acres] of that forest, which \n     includes those native gorillas, the giant elephants, the \n     clearing on the mountain and the waterfalls. We could start \n     that process quite easily tomorrow. But surprisingly, finding \n     three and a half million dollars for conservation, in this \n     world that has too much money, is very difficult.\n       NG News: Where have you been looking for funding?\n       Fay: Everywhere. You know, we don't have a major \n     coordinated fund-raising effort that we're investing lots of \n     money into. We're trying to do it on the cheap, I guess you \n     could say. We're trying to use the media coverage that we've \n     received and use the connections that we have from a number \n     of sources. We have raised well over a million dollars \n     already, but we . . . need three and a half million dollars, \n     and without it we're not gonna get that national park. . . . \n     When you look at the exploitation of the resources in those \n     countries it's not done for the consumption of Gabonese or \n     Congolese, it's done primarily for the consumption of \n     Americans, Asians, and Europeans. And people need to be \n     responsible for that. They can't just blithely keep going \n     farther afield and exploiting the wilderness without having \n     to pay some attention to that fact, without having to pay up. \n     . . . We get all upset when the U.S. government wants to go \n     drilling in [the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]. But when \n     an oil company wants to drill in the most pristine place in \n     Gabon, we don't say ``boo.'' And that has to change. People \n     need to be responsible globally if they're going to exploit \n     globally. It has to be a two-way street.\n       NG News. How do you propose to monitor the park and protect \n     it from such threats as poaching, logging, and bushmeat \n     hunting?\n       Fay: It's that double-edged sword again. The place is very \n     isolated right now. So we're looking at a four-pronged \n     approach. The first prong was to basically get a team on the \n     ground . . . to protect that clearing and get a presence in \n     there that says to people, ``There's somebody looking after \n     this place.'' People have taken an interest in it, people \n     have recognized that it's something that needs to be \n     protected.  . . . We have money from the U.S. Fish and \n     Wildlife Service to establish a camp and a team on the \n     ground. So that's prong number one.\n       Prong number two is the buy-back. We need to negotiate with \n     logging companies and with the Gabonese government to find \n     out how much it is going to cost and which blocks we can get. \n     We're dealing with ten different blocks, each about 25,000 \n     hectares (62,000 acres) . . . and each one takes a separate \n     negotiation essentially. We have the green light from the \n     Gabonese forestry minister to start this process.\n       The third prong of the effort is to establish a trust fund \n     so that management will take place there in the long term. \n     Trust funds not only create a situation where you can get \n     funding for a place like that, but you also have a much \n     broader management base . . . because if there's an \n     international trust fund then there's an international board. \n     And if there's an international board, people are going to be \n     interested in keeping this place in a state that this fund \n     was set up to preserve. Over the years national governments \n     in Africa have shown great interest and have collaborated in \n     international conservation efforts in their countries. This \n     is seen as positive and we have had great success in the past \n     with these associations.\n       And then the fourth thing is to actually establish a long-\n     term presence on the ground, which again requires some sort \n     of international collaboration between the conservation \n     organization and the national government. It relies on \n     funding from the outside rather than inside the country. We \n     have a grant to pay for the ground action for the next three \n     years and the effort to negotiate the national park. So we're \n     making pretty good progress on our four prongs. But we've \n     only completed about 10 to 30 percent of the 100 percent that \n     we need to go on all four of those demands. So, there's still \n     a lot of work to be done.\n       There are some positive elements to build on. Along the \n     megatransect route there are already some protected areas. \n     The idea is to preserve and fully protect about one tenth of \n     the entire forest. We need to be pragmatic by setting \n     reasonable targets that we can accomplish.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Conservation International,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 26, 2002.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     U.S. Senate, 416 Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC\n       Dear Senator Frist: Conservation International applauds \n     your leadership in sponsoring legislation to strengthen the \n     Tropical Forest Conservation Act (TFCA). Through making \n     nonconcessional debt eligible for TFCA treatment, this \n     legislation paves the way for substantial conservation gains \n     by allowing additional countries to participate in debt-for-\n     nature swaps.\n       Gabon is a good example. The country contains some of the \n     world's most pristine and biologically important tropical \n     forests--forests that shelter an incredible diversity of \n     wildlife including populations of gorillas and chimpanzees so \n     wild as to never before have encountered human beings. \n     Protecting Gabon's forests is an urgent priority of the \n     conservation community. It is also important to Gabon's \n     future. These forests are essential to maintaining \n     hydrological patterns, protecting water quality and quantity, \n     and offering development opportunities in the form of a \n     potentially significant exotourism market. As you well know, \n     their exploitation poses an additional risk of exposing human \n     beings to deadly disease. In fact, the most recent Ebola \n     outbreak occurred in Gabon.\n       Gabon should be a strong candidate for debt relief under \n     the Tropical Forest Conservation Act: it has abundant, \n     critical, and threatened tropical forests; it has a stable \n     political regime; it seeks resources for conservation; and it \n     owes debts to the United States. Unfortunately, the TFCA's \n     narrow construction prohibits Gabon from seeking debt \n     treatment under the Act. Your legislation would change this.\n       Conservation International has a long history of \n     participating in debt-for-nature swaps and has significant \n     private resources to bring to the table in support of public/\n     private partnerships under the TFCA. In fact, we recently \n     worked with The Nature Coservancy and World Wildlife Fund to \n     contribute a total of $1.1 million to a TFCA deal in Peru, \n     which leveraged $5.5 million in U.S. Government funds and \n     generated $10.6 million in local currency payments for \n     conservation of Peru's forests. With passage of your \n     legislation. CI anticipates additional opportunities to work \n     with the U.S. and key tropical forest countries to \n     simultaneously achieve conservation and debt relief.\n       Thank you once again for your leadership.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Nicholas Lapham,\n                                       Senior Director for Policy.\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 2696. A bill to clear title to certain real property in New Mexico \nassociated with the Middle Rio Grande Project, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nAlbuquerque Biological Park Title Clarification Act. This bill would \nassist the City of Albuquerque, NM by clearing its title to two parcels \nof land located along the Rio Grande. More specifically, it would allow \nthe city to move forward with its plans to improve the properties as \npart of a Biological Park Project, a city funded initiative to create a \npremier environmental educational center for its citizens and the \nentire State of New Mexico.\n  The Biological Park Project has been in the works since 1987 when the \ncity began to develop an aquarium and botanic garden along the banks of \nthe Rio Grande. The facilities constitutes just a portion of the \noverall project. In pursuit of the balance of the project, the city, in \n1997, purchased two properties from the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy \nDistrict, MRGCD, for $3,875,000. The first property, Tingley Beach, had \nbeen leased by the city from MRGCD since 1931 and used for public park \npurposes. The second property, San Gabriel Park, had been leased by the \ncity sine 1963, and also used for public park purposes.\n  In the year 2000, the city's plan were interrupted when the U.S. \nBureau of Reclamation claimed that in 1953 it had acquired ownership of \nall of MRGCD's property that is associated with the Middle Rio Grande \nProject. The United States' assertion called into question the validity \nof the 1997 transaction between the city and MRGCD. Both MRGCD and the \ncity dispute the United States' claim of ownership.\n  This dispute is delaying the city's progress in developing the \nBiological Park Project. If the matter is simply left to litigation, \nthe delay will be both indefinite and unnecessary. Reclamation has \nalready determined that the two properties are surplus to the needs of \nthe Middle Rio Grande Project. Moreover, this history of this issue \nindicates that Reclamation had once considered releasing its interest \nin the properties for $1.00 each. Obviously, the Federal interest in \nthese properties is low while the local interest is very high. \nMoreover, this bill would address\n\n[[Page S6259]]\n\nonly the status of the two properties at issue. The general dispute \nconcerning title to project works is left for the courts to decide.\n  I hope my colleagues will work with me to help resolve this issue \nwhich is important to the citizens of my state. While much of what we \ndo here in the Congress is complex and time-consuming work, we should \nalso have the ability to move quickly when necessary and appropriate to \nsolve local problems caused by federal actions. I therefore urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2696\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Albuquerque Biological Park \n     Title Clarification Act''.\n\n     SEC 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that:\n       (1) In 1997, the City of Albuquerque, New Mexico paid \n     $3,875,000 to the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District to \n     acquire two parcels of land known as Tingley Beach and San \n     Gabriel Park.\n       (2) The City intends to develop and improve Tingley Beach \n     and San Gabriel Park as part of its Albuquerque Biological \n     Park Project.\n       (3) In 2000, the City's title to Tingley Beach and San \n     Gabriel Park was clouded by the Bureau of Reclamation's \n     assertion that MRGCD had earlier transferred its assets, \n     including Tingley Beach and San Gabriel Park, to the United \n     States as part of a 1953 grant of easement associated with \n     the Middle Rio Grande Project.\n       (4) The City's ability to continue developing the \n     Albuquerque Biological Park Project has been hindered by the \n     cloud on its title.\n       (5) The United States' claim of ownership is disputed by \n     the City and MRGCD in Rio Grande Silvery Minnow v. John W. \n     Keys, III, No. CV 99-1320 JP/RLP-ACE (D. N.M. filed Nov. 15 \n     1999).\n       (6) Tingley Beach and San Gabriel Park are surplus to the \n     needs of the Middle Rio Grande Project.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to disclaim on \n     behalf of the United States, any right, title, and interest \n     it may have in and to Tingley Beach and San Gabriel Park, \n     thereby removing the cloud on the City's title to these \n     lands.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Interior to implement \nthe final rule to phase out snowmobile use in Yellowstone National \nPark, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway, and Grant Teton \nNational Park, and snowplane use in Grand Teton National Park; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in Yellowstone National Park last winter, \npark rangers wore respirators. This isn't some kind of a joke, this is \nthe truth. In Yellowstone National Park, the park rangers wore \nrespirators because the air was so clouded and fogged with the \npollution from snowmobiles that they had to do that to preserve their \nhealth.\n  Ealier this week, the Bush administration decided to open Yellowstone \nand Grand Teton National Parks to snowmobile traffic. In doing so, they \nchose to ignore an avalanche of public comments that strongly supported \nthe banning of snowmobiles in these two magnificent national parks. \nThey chose pollution over protection.\n  Mr. President, this isn't the first failing grade of this \nadministration's environmental report card. I am sorry to say it \nprobably won't be the last. It is, however, particularly disappointing \nin light of the Yellowstone National Park's importance to the American \npeople.\n  Today, I join with Senators Boxer, Clinton, and Lieberman to \nintroduce the Yellowstone Protection Act to shield America's first \nnational park from a relapse of damaging snowmobile traffic.\n  Congressmen Rush Holt and Christopher Shays are introducing a similar \nbill in the House of Representatives today. I salute them for their \nbipartisan leadership on this most important issue.\n  When Congress established the National Park Service, we directed it \nto ``conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the \nwildlife'' of our parks ``unimpaired for the enjoyment of future \ngenerations.''\n  Mr. President, I have given speeches talking about Government and the \nthings we should be proud of. Near the top of the list every time is \nour national park system. We are the envy of the world with these \nmagnificent parks, as well we should be. To think that people who work \nin the parks must wear respirators because of the smog caused by \nsnowmobiles, that is hard to imagine.\n  In January of 2001, the National Park Service did the right thing. \nWisely, it adopted a rule to phase out snowmobile use in the park. \nAfter carefully studying the science, examining the law, and reviewing \nthe comments of the American people, it determined--the Park Service \ndid--that the use of snowmobiles was inconsistent with the mission of \nYellowstone National Park.\n  Yet despite that historic decision and the overwhelming evidence that \nled to it, despite the science the EPA said was among the best it had \never seen, despite the support of over 80 percent of the people \ncommenting on this issue, the National Park Service, under pressure \nfrom the administration and special interests, decided on Tuesday to \nroll back this commonsense rule.\n  The Bush administration chose to ignore science, environmental laws, \nand public opinion.\n  The Yellowstone Protection Act simply codifies the original National \nPark Service rule that would have banned snowmobiles in the park.\n  Yellowstone Park is the birthplace of our park system. Congress \ncreated the National Park Service to protect Yellowstone and other \nparks.\n  Yellowstone Park should serve as a guiding light for our protection \nof natural resources, not as a canary in a coal mine.\n  Today, we must act to protect Yellowstone just as our forefathers did \nin 1872, when they established this magnificent national park. They \nmade a\n\n[[Page S6260]]\n\nfarsighted decision to guarantee that each new generation would inherit \na healthy and vibrant Yellowstone.\n  This Congress must step forward to uphold what Congress began 130 \nyears ago.\n  This legislation requires the management of Yellowstone and Grand \nTeton National Parks to be guided by law and informed by science, not \ndictated and directed by special interests.\n  We have suffered through the work that has been done by the Bush \nadministration with the environment--whether it is arsenic in the \nwater, whether it is stopping children from having their blood tested \nfor lead, whether it is making it easier for power generators to dump \nmillions of tons of pollutants in the air, whether it is easing up on \nSuperfund legislation, refusing to fund Superfund legislation--all \nthese things you would think would be enough. But, no, it is not \nenough. Now they have to say that Smokey the Bear must wear a \nrespirator. I think that is too much.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2697\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Yellowstone Protection \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The January 22, 2001, rule phasing out snowmobile use \n     in Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton National Park, and \n     the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway was made by \n     professionals in the National Park Service who based their \n     decision on law, 10 years of scientific study, and extensive \n     public process.\n       (2) An environmental impact statement that formed the basis \n     for the rule concluded that snowmobile use is impairing or \n     adversely impacting air quality, natural soundscapes, \n     wildlife, public and employee health and safety, and visitor \n     enjoyment. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, \n     the environmental impact statement had ``among the most \n     thorough and substantial science base that we have seen \n     supporting a NEPA document''.\n       (3) The National Park Service concluded that snowmobile use \n     is violating the mission given to the agency by Congress--to \n     manage the parks ``in such manner and by such means as will \n     leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future \n     generations''. The National Park Service also found that \n     snowmobile use is ``inconsistent with the requirements of the \n     Clean Air Act, Executive Orders 11644 and 11989 [by \n     Presidents Nixon and Carter, relating to off-road vehicle use \n     on public lands], the NPS's general snowmobile regulations \n     and NPS management objectives for the parks''.\n       (4) In order to maintain winter visitor access, the Park \n     Service outlined a plan to use the already existing mode of \n     winter transportation know as snowcoaches, which are mass \n     transit, oversnow vehicles similar to vans. The final rule \n     states that a snowcoach transit system ``would reduce adverse \n     impacts on park resources and values, better provide for \n     public safety, and provide for public enjoyment of the park \n     in winter''.\n       (5) The National Park Service Air Resources Division \n     determined that despite being outnumbered by automobiles 16 \n     to 1 during the course of a year, snowmobiles produce up to \n     68 percent of Yellowstone's carbon monoxide pollution and up \n     to 90 percent of the park's annual hydrocarbon emissions.\n       (6) Noise from snowmobiles routinely disrupts natural \n     sounds and natural quiet at popular Yellowstone attractions. \n     A February 2000 ``percent time audible'' study found \n     snowmobile noise present more than 90 percent of the time at \n     8 of 13 sites.\n       (7) In Yellowstone's severe winter climate, snowmobile \n     traffic regularly disturbs and harasses wildlife. In October \n     2001, 18 eminent scientists warned the Secretary of the \n     Interior that ``ignoring this information would not be \n     consistent with the original vision intended to keep our \n     national parks unimpaired for future generations''. National \n     Park Service regulations allow snowmobile use only when that \n     use ``will not disturb wildlife . . .'' (36 CFR 2.18(c)).\n       (8) At Yellowstone's west entrance, park rangers and fee \n     collectors suffer from symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning \n     due to snowmobile exhaust. According to National Park Service \n     records, in December 2000, a dozen park employees filed \n     medical complaints citing sore throats, headaches, lethargy, \n     eye irritation, and tightness in the lungs. Their supervisor \n     requested more staff at the west entrance, not because of a \n     need for additional personnel to cover the work there, but so \n     the supervisor could begin rotating employees more frequently \n     out of the ``fume cloud'' for the sake of their health. In \n     2002, for the first time in National Park history, rangers \n     were issued respirators to wear while performing their \n     duties.\n       (9) The public opportunity to engage in the environmental \n     impact study process was extensive and comprehensive. During \n     the 3-year environmental impact study process and rulemaking, \n     there were 4 opportunities for public consideration and \n     comment. The Park Service held 22 public hearings in regional \n     communities such as West Yellowstone, Cody, Jackson, and \n     Idaho Falls, and across the Nation. The agency received over \n     70,000 individual comments. At each stage of the input \n     process, support for phasing out snowmobiles grew, \n     culminating in a 4-to-1 majority in favor of the rule in \n     early 2001. More recently, 82 percent of those commenting \n     wrote in favor of the National Park Service decision to phase \n     out snowmobile use in the parks.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINAL RULE CODIFIED.\n\n       Beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, the \n     Secretary of the Interior shall implement the final rule to \n     phase out snowmobile use in Yellowstone National Park, the \n     John D. Rockefeller Jr. Memorial Parkway, and Grand Teton \n     National Park, and snowplane use in Grand Teton National \n     Park, as published in the Federal Register on January 22, \n     2001 (66 Fed. Reg. 7260-7268). The Secretary shall not have \n     the authority to modify or supersede any provision of that \n     final rule.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 2698. A bill to establish a grant program for school renovation, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 2699. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe incentives for the construction and renovation of public schools; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am introducing two bills \naimed at addressing our national school infrastructure crisis. Schools \nacross America have been allowed to fall into ill repair, and in some \nschool districts, there is a serious need for new school construction.\n  The Department of Education has found that the average age of a \npublic school building in this country is 42 years old, an age when \nbuildings tend to deteriorate. In 1995, the GAO found that the unmet \nneed for school construction and renovation in the United States was a \nstaggering $112 billion.\n  When our schools are in poor condition, our children suffer and our \nNation suffers. Studies have shown that children in well-kept schools \nperform better than children in deteriorating buildings. Certainly our \nchildren deserve the advantages that come with studying in a safe, \nclean, modern environment. The state of our schools is unacceptable, \nand it is our responsibility to do all we can to remedy this situation.\n  These bills are the first pieces of my education agenda for 2002. In \naddition to investing in school construction, we must also invest in \nschool leadership. Within the next few weeks, I intend to promote \ninitiatives for school principals and incentives to recruit and retain \nteachers. School leadership will be essential in meeting the higher \nstandards set by our new Leave No Child Behind Act, and principals play \na pivotal role. I will be pushing legislation to ensure that we invest \nin leadership programs to help principals be bold leaders of reform. \nAlso, I intend to introduce tax incentives to reward highly qualified \nteachers as a way to recruit and retain the best and the brightest for \nour classrooms. Building leadership among principals and teachers is as \nessential to quality education as modern schools.\n  These efforts build on my ongoing education efforts on math and \nscience and technology. In 1996, I was proud to sponsor the E-Rate \nprogram with Senator Snowe to connect our classroom to the Internet \nbecause our students must be connected to modern technology to gain the \nskills needed for the 21st century. This year, I am working hard to \nenact the National Math and Science Partnership Act to authorize almost \na $1 billion a year for five years for the National Science Foundation \nto invest in promoting quality math and science education. The \ncombination of these legislative initiatives should help provide the \nessential resources and leadership necessary to achieve our education \ngoals.\n  I can see the effects of deteriorating school buildings in my State \nof West Virginia. There alone, the need for school construction, \nrenovation, and repair is rapidly approaching a staggering $2 billion \nover the next 10 years, a sum West Virginia cannot meet without \nassistance.\n\n[[Page S6261]]\n\n  West Virginia has, in the past, benefitted greatly from Federal \nprograms designed to improve the quality of school buildings, and the \nmoney we've received has been put to excellent use. Funding made \navailable by the Qualified Zone Academy Bond program, a program in \nwhich the Federal Government authorizes the states to sell school \nconstruction bonds and then pays the interest to the bond holders, has \nprovided my state with over $4 million in bond funding since 1998. This \nmoney has been used to renovate science labs, install wireless computer \nequipment, remove asbestos, and provide modular classrooms, among many \nother valuable projects. Another program, a direct funding initiative \nincluded in the FY 2001 final budget agreement, has also been a great \nsuccess in West Virginia and across the nation.\n  Many schools in my State are unable to take advantage of school \nbondings because some local communities are so needy that they cannot \nafford even the low- or no-interest loans that program makes available. \nAnd when areas which are already disadvantaged are hit with natural \ndisasters, such as the heartbreaking catastrophic flooding West \nVirginia has now suffered two years in a row, school districts cannot \nbe expected to keep up with their infrastructure needs.\n  The direct funding initiative in the 2001 budget made $1.2 billion in \ngrants available for emergency school renovation and repair and \ntechnology improvements across America. West Virginia was fortunate to \nreceive nearly $8 million in funding from the program, enabling our \nschools to replace roofs, fix faulty wiring and sewage systems, remove \nasbestos, and make themselves better prepared for fire emergencies.\n  The success stories from these programs prove that we can make a real \nimpact in the quality of schools in our nation. I am proud to introduce \ntwo bills today designed to build upon these past successes: the \nAmerica's Better Classroom Act and the Building Our Children's Future \nAct.\n  The America's Better Classroom Act is designed to expand and build \nupon the success of the Qualified Zone Academy Bond, or the QZAB \nprogram. It expands this program by $2.8 billion so even more school \ndistricts will be able to take advantage of the low-or no-interest \nschool construction loans that it provides. QZAB's are aimed at schools \nin disadvantaged areas. To qualify, a school must be located in an \nempowerment zone, enterprise community, or 35 per cent of its students \nmust be eligible for free or reduced lunch.\n  In addition to expanding the QZAB program, the America's Better \nClassroom Act creates a new $22 billion bonding program designed to \nhelp all school districts meet their renovation needs. Funding to \nstates will be allocated based on the Title I funding formula. In this \nway, many more school districts will have the opportunity to reap the \nbenefits of no- or low-interest loans for school renovation and repair. \nThis legislation is similar to a House bill sponsored by Congresswoman \nNancy Johnson and Congressman Charlie Rangel. I look forward to working \nwith the House colleagues on this crucial program.\n  The second bill I introduce today is the Building Our Children's \nFuture Act, a $5 billion initiative designed to help schools that, due \nto poverty, high growth, or unforseen disaster, are unable to meet \ntheir repair and renovation needs. Many districts that are facing these \ndifficult challenges find themselves so strapped that they cannot even \nafford to pay back the principle on an interest-free loan. These areas \nneed direct help, and this grant program provides it.\n  The Building Our Children's Future Act gives each State funding based \non Title I, with a priority to target funding to schools that have been \ndamaged or destroyed by a natural disaster or are located in a high \npoverty or high growth areas, defined by the state. This makes certain \nthat states have the flexibility to put the money where it is needed \nthe most.\n  The bill also recognizes that not all renovation needs are the same. \nIn the 21st century, providing students and teachers with access to \ntechnology will be a critical part of keeping schools up-to-date. \nLikewise, we have made a commitment to assist states in covering the \ncosts of special education, a commitment that will undoubtedly require \nrenovation and construction to accommodate special needs. For this \nreason, the Building Our Children's Future Act sets aside a portion of \nits funds for states to make technology improvements and carry out \nprograms under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.\n  Finally, the Building Our Children's Future Act also makes money \navailable to schools with high Native American populations and schools \nlocated in outlying areas, so that no group will be left behind as we \nseek to remedy our school infrastructure crisis.\n  I believe that America's Better Classroom Act and the Building Our \nChildren's Future Act are important steps toward giving our children \nthe learning environments they deserve. When our schools are in \ndisrepair, we cannot expect our educational system to be any different. \nI hope you will join me in supporting these two bills and, in doing so, \njoin me in supporting the futures of our children and our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/27/senate-section/article/S6261-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6261-S6262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 293--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF NOVEMBER 10 THROUGH \nNOVEMBER 16, 2002, AS ``NATIONAL VETERANS AWARENESS WEEK'' TO EMPHASIZE \nTHE NEED TO DEVELOP EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS REGARDING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF \n                        VETERANS TO THE COUNTRY\n\n  Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Cleland, Mrs. \nClinton, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Miller, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \nDurbin, Mr. Lugar, Ms. Collins, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Breaux, \nMr. Dodd, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Helms, Mr. Baucus, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Johnson, \nMs. Landrieu, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Levin, Mr. Reid, Mr. \nLeahy, Mr. McCain, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. \nInhofe, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Gregg, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Domenici, Mr. \nHutchinson, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Bunning, Mr. \nCraig, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Carper, Mr. \nInouye, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Warner, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. \nDayton) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary\n\n                              S.

Bush \n     issued a proclamation urging all Americans to observe \n     November 11 through November 17, 2001, as National Veterans \n     Awareness Week: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of November 10 through November 16, \n     2002, as ``National Veterans Awareness Week'' for the purpose \n     of emphasizing educational efforts directed at elementary and \n     secondary school students concerning the contributions and \n     sacrifices of veterans; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the people of the United States to observe \n     National Veterans\n\n[[Page S6262]]\n\n     Awareness Week with appropriate educational activities.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I have the honor of joining with 50 \nof my colleagues in submitting a resolution expressing the sense of the \nSenate that the week that includes Veterans' Day this year be \ndesignated as ``National Veterans Awareness Week.'' This marks the \nthird year in a row that I have introduced such a resolution, which has \nbeen adopted unanimously by the Senate on both previous occasions.\n  The purpose of National Veterans Awareness Week is to serve as a \nfocus for educational programs designed to make students in elementary \nand secondary schools aware of the contributions of veterans and their \nimportance in preserving American peace and prosperity. This goal takes \non particular importance and immediacy this year as we find ourselves \nat war in the wake of the attack against us on our own territory.\n  Why do we need such an educational effort? In a sense, this action \nhas become necessary because we are victims of our own success with \nregard to the superior performance of our armed forces. The plain fact \nis that there are just fewer people around now who have had any \nconnection with military service. For example, as a result of \ntremendous advances in military technology and the resultant \nproductivity increases, our current armed forces now operate \neffectively with a personnel roster that is one-third less in size than \njust 10 years ago. In addition, the success of the all-volunteer \ncareer-oriented force has led to much lower turnover of personnel in \ntoday's military than in previous eras when conscription was in place. \nFinally, the number of veterans who served during previous conflicts, \nsuch as World War II, when our military was many times larger than \ntoday, is inevitably declining.\n  The net result of these changes is that the percentage of the entire \npopulation that has served in the Armed Forces is dropping rapidly, a \nchange that can be seen in all segments of society. Whereas during \nWorld War II it was extremely uncommon to find a family in America that \ndid not have one of its members on active duty, now there are numerous \nfamilies that include no military veterans at all. As a consequence of \nthis lack of opportunity for contacts with veterans, many of our young \npeople have little or no connection with or knowledge about the \nimportant historical and ongoing role of men and women who have served \nin the military. This omission seems to have persisted despite ongoing \neducational efforts by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the \nveterans service organizations.\n  This lack of understanding about military veterans' important role in \nour society can have potentially serious repercussions. In our country, \ncivilian control of the armed forces is the key tenet of military \ngovernance. A citizenry that is oblivious to the capabilities and \nlimitations of the armed forces, and to its critical role throughout \nour history can make decisions that have unexpected and unwanted \nconsequences. Even more important, general recognition of the \nimportance of those individual character traits that are essential for \nmilitary success, such as patriotism, selflessness, sacrifice and \nheroism, is vital to maintaining these key aspects of citizenship in \nthe armed forces and even throughout the population at large.\n  Among today's young people, a generation that has grown up largely \nduring times of peace and extraordinary prosperity and has embraced a \n``me first'' attitude, it is perhaps even more important to make sure \nthat there is solid understanding of what it has taken to attain this \nlevel of comfort and freedom. Even in the midst of our ongoing war \nagainst terrorism, with Americans in uniform finding themselves in \nharm's way around the world, many young people seem to be totally \ndivorced from the implications of the conflict that is raging.\n  The failure of our children to understand why a military is \nimportant, why our society continues to depend on it for ultimate \nsurvival, and why a successful military requires integrity and \nsacrifice, will have predictable consequences as these youngsters \nbecome of voting age. Even though military service is a responsibility \nthat is no longer shared by a large segment of the population, as it \nhas been in the past, knowledge of the contributions of those who have \nserved in the Armed Forces is as important as it has ever been. To the \nextent that many of us will not have the opportunity to serve our \ncountry in uniform, we must still remain cognizant of our \nresponsibility as citizens to fulfill the obligations, we owe, both \ntangible and intangible, to those who do serve and who do sacrifice on \nour behalf.\n  The importance of this issue was brought home to me two years ago by \nSamuel I. Cashdollar, who was then a 13-year-old seventh grader at \nLewes Middle School in Lewes, DE. Samuel won the Delaware VFW's Youth \nEssay Contest that year with a powerful presentation titled ``How \nShould We Honor America's Veterans?'' Samuel's essay pointed out that \nwe have Nurses' Week, Secretaries' Week, and Teachers' Week, to rightly \nemphasize the importance of these occupations, but the contributions of \nthose in uniform tend to be overlooked. We don't want our children \ngrowing up to think that Veterans Day has simply become a synonym for \ndepartment store sale, and we don't want to become a Nation where more \nhigh school seniors recognize the name Britney Spears than the name \nDwight Eisenhower.\n  National Veterans Awareness Week complements Veterans Day by focusing \non education as well as commemoration, on the contributions of the many \nin addition to the heroism and service of the individual. National \nVeterans Awareness Week also presents an opportunity to remind \nourselves of the contributions and sacrifices of those who have served \nin peacetime as well as in conflict; both groups work unending hours \nand spend long periods away from their families under conditions of \ngreat discomfort so that we all can live in a land of freedom and \nplenty.\n  Last year, my resolution designating National Veterans Awareness Week \nhad 58 cosponsors and was approved in the Senate by unanimous consent. \nResponding to that resolution, President Bush issued a proclamation \nurging our citizenry to observe National Veterans Awareness Week. I ask \nmy colleagues to continue this trend of support for our veterans by \nendorsing this resolution again this year. Our children and our \nchildren's children will need to be well informed about what veterans \nhave accomplished in order to make appropriate decisions as they \nconfront the numerous worldwide challenges that they are sure to face \nin the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/27/senate-section/article/S6262-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6262-S6263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 294--TO AMEND RULE XLII OF THE STANDING RULES OF THE \n  SENATE TO PROHIBIT EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION IN THE SENATE BASED ON \n                           SEXUAL ORIENTATION\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \nTorricelli, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Dayton, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \nJeffords, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Inouye, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Wyden, \nMrs. Boxer, Mr. Reed, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Harkin, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Reid, \nMrs. Murray, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Bingaman, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Bayh, Mr. \nLevin, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Collins, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. \nLandrieu, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Biden, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \nChafee, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Kohl, Mrs. Carnahan, Mr. Carper, Mr. Nelson \nof Florida, and Mr. Cleland) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution to \nprohibit employment discrimination in the United States Senate based on \nsexual orientation.\n  The resolution would amend the Standing Rules of the Senate by adding \n``sexual orientation'' to ``race, color, religion, sex, national \norigin, age, or state of physical handicap'' in the anti-discrimination \nprovision of rule 42, which governs the Senate's employment practices.\n\n[[Page S6263]]\n\n  I am very pleased that 41 of my colleagues, Senators Specter, \nDaschle, Dodd, Torriceli, Feingold, Dayton, Stabenow, Durbin, Jeffords, \nKennedy, Inouye, Cantwell, Leahy, Wyden, Boxer, Reed, Akaka, Harkin, \nClinton, Reid, Murray, Corzine, Bingaman, Mikulski, Bayh, Levin, \nWellstone, Kerry, Collins, Lieberman, Landrieu, Edwards, Smith of \nOregon, Biden, Schumer, Chafee, Sarbanes, Kohl, Carnahan, Carper, and \nNelson of Florida, have joined me in submitting this resolution today.\n  By amending the current rule, it would forbid any Senate member, \nofficer or employee from terminating, refusing to hire, or otherwise \ndiscriminating against an individual with respect to promotion, \ncompensation, or any other privilege of employment, on the basis of \nthat individual's sexual orientation.\n  Senate employees currently have no recourse available to them should \nthey become a victim of this type of employment discrimination.\n  If the rules are amended, any Senate employee that encountered \ndiscrimination based on their sexual orientation would have the option \nof reporting it to the Senate Ethics Committee. The Ethics Committee \ncould then investigate the claim and recommend discipline for any \nSenate member, officer or employee found to have violated the rule.\n  Unfortuantely, the Senate is already well behind other establishments \nof the U.S. Government in this area of anti-discrimination.\n  By 1996, at least 13 cabinet level agencies, including the \nDepartments of Justice, Agriculture, Transportation, Health and Human \nServices, Interior, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, and Energy, \nin addition to the General Accounting Office, General Services \nAdministration, Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Reserve System, \nOffice of Personnel Management, and the White House had already issued \npolicy statements forbidding sexual orientation discrimination.\n  In 1998, Executive Order 13087 was issued to prohibit sexual \norientation discrimination in the Federal executive branch, including \ncivilian employees of the military departments and sundry other \ngovernmental entities.\n  That Executive order now covers approximately 2 million Federal \ncivilian workers, yet, four years later, there are still employees of \nthe United States Senate that are unprotected.\n  In taking this step toward addressing discrimination, the Senate \nwould join not only the Executive Branch, but also 294 Fortune 500 \ncompanies, 23 State governments and 252 local governments that have \nalready prohibited workplace discrimination based on sexual \norientation.\n  Currently, at least 68 Senators have already adopted written policies \nfor their congressional offices indicating that sexual orientation is \nnot a factor in their employment decisions.\n  Now, I urge my colleagues to join me by making this policy universal \nfor the Senate, rather than relying on a patchwork of protection that \nonly covers some of the Senate's employees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/27/senate-section/article/S6263-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6263-S6264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 295--COMMEMORATING THE 32ND ANNIVERSARY OF THE POLICY \n                      OF INDIAN SELF-DETERMINATION\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Cochran, and \nMs. Stabenow) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Nixon, in his `Special Message \n     to Congress on Indian Affairs' on July 8, 1970, recognized \n     that the Indian Tribes constitute a distinct and valuable \n     segment of the American federalist system, whose members have \n     made significant contributions to the United States and to \n     American culture;\n       Whereas President Nixon determined that Indian Tribes, as \n     local governments, are best able to discern the needs of \n     their people and are best situated to determine the direction \n     of their political and economic futures;\n       Whereas in his `Special Message' President Nixon recognized \n     that the policies of legal and political termination on the \n     one hand, and paternalism and excessive dependence on the \n     other, devastated the political, economic, and social aspects \n     of life in Indian America, and had to be radically altered;\n       Whereas in his `Special message' President Nixon set forth \n     the foundation for a new, more enlightened Federal Indian \n     policy grounded in economic self-reliance and political self-\n     determination; and\n       Whereas this Indian self-determination policy has endured \n     as the most successful policy of the United States in dealing \n     with the Indian Tribes because it rejects the failed policies \n     of termination and paternalism and recognized `the integrity \n     and right to continued existence of all Indian Tribal and \n     Alaska native governments, recognizing that cultural \n     pluralism is a source of national strength';\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the United States recognizes \n     the unique role of the Indian Tribes and their members in the \n     United States, and commemorates the vision and leadership of \n     President Nixon, and every succeeding President, in fostering \n     the policy of Indian Self-Determination\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit today a \nresolution to commemorate the anniversary of a little-noticed but \ncritical event that took place 32 years ago this summer.\n  In July 1970, President Richard M. Nixon delivered his now-famous \n``Special Message to the Congress on Indian Affairs'' that \nrevolutionized how our Nation deals with Native governments and Native \npeople from Florida to Alaska, from Maine to Hawaii.\n  With centuries of ill-conceived and misdirected Federal policies and \npractices behind us, I am happy to say that the Nixon Indian policy \ncontinues as the bedrock of America's promise to Native Americans.\n  In his Message to Congress, the President made the case for a more \nenlightened Federal Indian policy. Citing historical injustices as well \nas the practical failure of all previous Federal policies regarding \nIndian Nations, President Nixon called for the rejection of both the \n``termination'' policy of the 1950s and the ``excessive dependence'' on \nthe Federal Government by Indian tribes and people fostered by Federal \npaternalism.\n  Nixon observed that ``[t]he first Americans--the Indians--are the \nmost deprived and most isolated group in our Nation. On virtually every \nscale of measurement--employment, income, education, health--the \ncondition of the Indian people rank at the bottom.''\n  Thirty-two years later, Indians continue to suffer high rates of \nunemployment, are mired in poverty, and still rank at or near the \nbottom of nearly every social and economic indicator in the Nation. \nNonetheless, there is cause for hope that the conditions of Native \nAmericans are improving, however slowly.\n  The twin pillars of the policy change initiated in 1970 are political \nself determination and economic self reliance. Without doubt, the most \nenduring legacy of the 1970 Message is the Indian self determination \npolicy best embodied in the Indian Self Determination and Education \nAssistance Act of 1975, amended several times since then.\n  This Act, which has consistently been supported, promoted, and \nexpanded with bipartisan support, authorizes Indian tribes to assume \nresponsibility for and administer programs and services formerly \nprovided by the Federal Government.\n  As of 2001, nearly one-half of all Bureau of Indian Affairs, BIA, and \nIndian Health Service, IHS, programs and services have been assumed by \ntribes under the Indian Self Determination Act.\n  With this transfer of resources and decision making authority, tribal \ngovernments have succeeded in improving the quality of services to \ntheir citizens, developed more sophisticated tribal governing \nstructures and practices, improved their ability to govern, and \nstrengthened their economies.\n\n[[Page S6264]]\n\n  Self determination contracting and compacting has improved the \nefficiency of Federal programs and services and at the same time have \ndevolved control over these resources from Washington, DC to the local, \ntribal governments which are much more in tune with the needs of their \nown people.\n  As steps are taken to provide tribes the tools they need to develop \nvigorous economies and generate tribal revenues, our policy in Congress \nand across the Federal Government should be to encourage and assist \ntribes to expand self determination and self governance into other \nagencies and programs, and in the process help Native people to achieve \nreal and measurable success in improving their standard of living.\n  The challenge of the Nixon Message was not only to the Federal \nGovernment but to the tribes themselves: that by building strong tribal \ngovernments and more robust economies, real independence and true self \ndetermination can be achieved.\n  Our experience has shown that any cooperative efforts between the \nUnited States and the tribes must include a solemn assurance that the \nspecial relationship will endure and will not be terminated because of \nthe fits and starts of periodic economic success enjoyed by some Indian \ntribes.\n  President Nixon wisely realized that the mere threat of termination \nresults in a tendency toward an unhealthy dependence on the Federal \nGovernment which has plagued Native people for decades. As President \nNixon himself knew, Native people are not hapless bystanders in this \nprocess.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The use of computers and the Internet is rapidly \n     transforming societal interactions and the relationships \n     among citizens, private businesses, and the Government.\n       (2) The Federal Government has had uneven success in \n     applying advances in information technology to enhance \n     governmental functions and services, achieve more efficient \n     performance, increase access to Government information, and \n     increase citizen participation in Government.\n       (3) Most Internet-based services of the Federal Government \n     are developed and presented separately, according to the \n     jurisdictional boundaries of an individual department or \n     agency, rather than being integrated cooperatively according \n     to function or topic.\n       (4) Internet-based Government services involving \n     interagency cooperation are especially difficult to develop \n     and promote, in part because of a lack of sufficient funding \n     mechanisms to support such interagency cooperation.\n       (5) Electronic Government has its impact through improved \n     Government performance and outcomes within and across \n     agencies.\n       (6) Electronic Government is a critical element in the \n     management of Government, to be implemented as part of a \n     management framework that also addresses finance, \n     procurement, human capital, and other challenges to improve \n     the performance of Government.\n       (7) To take full advantage of the improved Government \n     performance that can be achieved through the use of Internet-\n     based technology requires strong leadership, better \n     organization, improved interagency collaboration, and more \n     focused oversight of agency compliance with statutes related \n     to information resource management.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:\n       (1) To provide effective leadership of Federal Government \n     efforts to develop and promote electronic Government services \n     and processes by establishing an Administrator of a new \n     Office of Electronic Government within the Office of \n     Management and Budget.\n       (2) To promote use of the Internet and other information \n     technologies to provide increased opportunities for citizen \n     participation in Government.\n       (3) To promote interagency collaboration in providing \n     electronic Government services, where this collaboration \n     would improve the service to citizens by integrating related \n     functions, and in the use of internal electronic Government \n     processes, where this collaboration would improve the \n     efficiency and effectiveness of the processes.\n       (4) To improve the ability of the Government to achieve \n     agency missions and program performance goals.\n       (5) To promote the use of the Internet and emerging \n     technologies within and across Government agencies to provide \n     citizen-centric Government information and services.\n       (6) To reduce costs and burdens for businesses and other \n     Government entities.\n       (7) To promote better informed decisionmaking by policy \n     makers.\n       (8) To promote access to high quality Government \n     information and services across multiple channels.\n       (9) To make the Federal Government more transparent and \n     accountable.\n       (10) To transform agency operations by utilizing, where \n     appropriate, best practices from public and private sector \n     organizations.\n       (11) To provide enhanced access to Government information \n     and services in a manner consistent with laws regarding \n     protection of personal privacy, national security, records \n     retention, access for persons with disabilities, and other \n     relevant laws.\n\nTITLE I--OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET ELECTRONIC GOVERNMENT SERVICES\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ncongratulate General Ralph E. Eberhart, United States Air Force, on his \nappointment to serve as the first Commander-in-Chief of Northern \nCommand as well as the commander of NORAD. General Eberhart's \nqualifications for this very important position are impeccible, and I \nhave absolutely no doubt that he will bring the same success to \nNorthern Command as he did to US Space Command.\n  Before General Eberhart departs US Space Command, I want to express \nmy most sincere appreciation to him for his steadfast advocacy of \nmilitary space capabilities over the past two years. His visionary \nleadership and dedication as the Commander-in-Chief of US Space Command \nand, until recently, Air Force Space Command, has truly brought \nmilitary space into a new era. When he took command of US Space Command \nin February 2000, our country had just completed Operation Allied Force \nin Kosovo. At that time we recognized the value that space-based \ncapabilities bring to the flight. GPS-guided weapons were the preferred \nmunition and satellite communications provided double the bandwidth \navailable in Desert Storm. Since Operation Allied Force, General \nEberhart was able to increase the effectiveness of these very same \ncapabilities by pressing for the integration of space capabilities with \nair, maritime and land assets. US Space Command's contributions are the \nhallmarks of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  When military historians look back at Operation Enduring Freedom, \nthey will note the extreme effectiveness bombs delivered with pinpoint \naccuracy within minutes of being requested by soldiers on the ground. \nThey will note persistent survellience and near-real time threat \ninformation beamed to cockpits. These capabilties would not be possible \nif it weren't for US Space Command. Space-based capabilities are an \nenabler of not just the Air Force's transformation, but also the Navy \nand Army.\n  General Eberhart's leadership of NORAD during Operation Noble Eagle \nis equally impressive. After September 11, NORAD went from having 14 \naircraft on alert to more than 100. General Eberhart faced the \nchallenges of supporting continous combat air patrols, including all \nthe supporting logistics such as tankers and integrating NATO AWACS. \nThe change in focus of NORAD since Sept 11 is not, unfortunately, \ntemporary and points our nation's need for a Unified Command to address \nthreats to the United States as well as operations in North America.\n  North Command is crucial to our national security. I am very proud to \nhost this command in Colorado and sincerely look forward to continue \nworking with General Eberhart.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/27/senate-section/article/S6276-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       [(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       [(1) The use of computers and the Internet is rapidly \n     transforming societal interactions and the relationships \n     among citizens, private businesses, and the Government.\n       [(2) The Federal Government has had uneven success in \n     applying advances in information technology to enhance \n     Governmental functions and services, achieve more efficient \n     performance, and increase access to Government information \n     and citizen participation in Government.\n       [(3) Most Internet-based services of the Federal Government \n     are developed and presented separately, according to the \n     jurisdictional boundaries of an individual department or \n     agency, rather than being integrated cooperatively according \n     to function.\n       [(4) Internet-based Government services involving \n     interagency cooperation are especially difficult to develop \n     and promote, in part because of a lack of funding mechanisms \n     to support such interagency cooperation.\n       [(5) To take full advantage of the improved Government \n     performance that can be achieved through the use of Internet-\n     based technology requires new leadership, better \n     organization, improved interagency collaboration, and more \n     focused oversight of agency compliance with statutes related \n     to information resource management.\n       [(b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:\n       [(1) To provide effective leadership of Federal Government \n     efforts to develop and promote electronic Government services \n     and processes by establishing a Federal Chief Information \n     Officer within the Office of Management and Budget.\n       [(2) To establish measures that require using Internet-\n     based information technology to enhance citizen access to \n     Government information and services, improve Government \n     efficiency and reduce Government operating costs, and \n     increase opportunities for citizen participation in \n     Government.\n       [(3) To promote interagency collaboration in providing \n     electronic Government services, where this collaboration \n     would improve the service to citizens by integrating related \n     function.\n       [(4) To promote interagency collaboration in the use of \n     internal electronic Government processes, where this \n     collaboration would improve the efficiency and effectiveness \n     of the processes.\n\n    [TITLE I--OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET ELECTRONIC GOVERNMENT \n                                SERVICES\n\n     [SEC. 101.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The use of computers and the Internet is rapidly \n     transforming societal interactions and the relationships \n     among citizens, private businesses, and the Government.\n       (2) The Federal Government has had uneven success in \n     applying advances in information technology to enhance \n     governmental functions and services, achieve more efficient \n     performance, increase access to Government information, and \n     citizen participation in Government.\n       (3) Most Internet-based services of the Federal Government \n     are developed and presented separately, according to the \n     jurisdictional boundaries of an individual department or \n     agency, rather than being integrated cooperatively according \n     to function.\n       (4) Internet-based Government services involving \n     interagency cooperation are especially difficult to develop \n     and promote, in part because of a lack of sufficient funding \n     mechanisms to support such interagency cooperation.\n       (5) Electronic Government has its impact through improved \n     Government performance and outcomes within and across \n     agencies.\n       (6) Electronic Government is a critical element in the \n     management of Government, to be implemented as part of a \n     management framework that also addresses finance, \n     procurement, human capital, and other challenges to improve \n     the performance of Government.\n       (7) To take full advantage of the improved Government \n     performance that can be achieved through the use of Internet-\n     based technology requires new leadership, better \n     organization, improved interagency collaboration, and more \n     focused oversight of agency compliance with statutes related \n     to information resource management.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:\n       (1) To provide effective leadership of Federal Government \n     efforts to develop and promote electronic Government services \n     and processes by establishing an Administrator of a new \n     Office of Electronic Government within the Office of \n     Management and Budget.\n       (2) To promote use of the Internet and other information \n     technologies to provide increased opportunities for citizen \n     participation in Government.\n       (3) To promote interagency collaboration in providing \n     electronic Government services, where this collaboration \n     would improve the service to citizens by integrating related \n     functions, and in the use of internal electronic Government \n     processes, where this collaboration would improve the \n     efficiency and effectiveness of the processes.\n       (4) To improve the ability of the Government to achieve \n     agency missions and program performance goals.\n       (5) To promote the use of the Internet and emerging \n     technologies within and across Government agencies to provide \n     citizen-centric services.\n       (6) To reduce costs and burdens for businesses and other \n     Government entities.\n       (7) To promote better informed decisionmaking by policy \n     makers.\n       (8) To promote access to high quality information and \n     services across multiple channels, available to customers \n     through the channels which are preferred by the customer.\n       (9) To make the Federal Government more transparent and \n     accountable.\n       (10) To transform agency operations by utilizing, where \n     appropriate, best practices from public and private sector \n     organizations.\n\nTITLE I--OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET ELECTRONIC GOVERNMENT SERVICES\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to pass S. 803, the \nE-Government Act of 2002. I believe that this bill will play an \nimportant role in making the Federal Government more responsive to our \ncitizens.\n  The Internet would seem to be an ideal way for our constituents, \nespecially those farthest from Washington, to get information and \ncontact the government. However, many of our constituents complain that \nit is hard to access information from the government because the \nvarious agencies are not all prepared to deal with the advancements of \nthe ``digital age.'' Meanwhile, some agencies are using the Internet in \ngroundbreaking ways to improve their processes. In addition, the public \nhas found that ``e-government'' programs have made interactions with \nthe Federal Government more friendly and time-efficient. Today, it is \neasier for American citizens to find out about a government program, \nlook up a regulation, apply for a grant, or download educational \nmaterials by using the Internet than by contacting a distant Federal \nagency.\n  This legislation has a number of provisions to promote innovative \nthinking in the field of ``e-government,'' while also assisting Federal \ndepartments and agencies in crossing into the 21st Century. The \nlegislation establishes an Office of Electronic Government, headed by a \nSenate-confirmed administrator, within the Office of Management and \nBudget. This new administrator will sponsor a dialogue between \ngovernment agencies, the public, and private and non-profit entities to \nspur creative new ideas for ``e-government.'' In addition the \nadministrator will direct ``e-government'' initiatives, and oversee an \ninteragency ``e-government'' fund to invest in cross-cutting projects \nwith government-wide application. The bill also promotes the use of the \nInternet and other technologies to provide more information and better \nservices to Americans through Internet strategies, such as the Federal \n``FirstGov'' portal. Finally, the bill includes a number of provisions \nthat should make it easier for the public to access information about \nFederal scientific research, the Federal courts, and other areas of \ninterest.\n  I would like especially to commend my friends, Senators Lieberman and \nThompson, the chairman and ranking member of the Government Affairs \nCommittee, for their hard work on this legislation. This legislation \naddresses a complex issue that effects many agencies throughout \ngovernment and its development required persistence and careful \nthought. The result of their efforts will improve Federal Government \noperations, and make the Government more responsive to the citizens we \nrepresent.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding Senators Lieberman \nand Thompson have a substitute amendment that is at the desk. I ask \nunanimous consent that the amendment be considered and agreed to; that \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that the committee \nsubstitute amendment, as amended, be agreed to; that the bill, as \namended, be read a third time and passed; that the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, without intervening action or debate; that the \ntitle amendment be agreed to; that the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table; and that any statements relating to the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4172) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The committee amendment, in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 803), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n  The title was amended so as to read: ``A bill to enhance the \nmanagement and promotion of electronic Government services and \nprocesses by establishing an Office of Electronic Government within the \nOffice of Management and Budget, and by establishing a broad framework \nof measures that require using Internet-based information technology to \nenhance citizen access to Government information and services, and for \nother purposes.''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/27/senate-section/article/S6295-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDER FOR BILL TO BE PRINTED--S. 2514\n\n  Mr. REID.
