Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the situation in \nNorth Korea. Today President Kim Dae-jung of South Korea is meeting \nwith President Bush as part of his official state visit. His visit \noccurs against a hopeful backdrop of the third round of family reunions \non the divided Korean peninsula. Fathers are greeting their grownup \nsons; sisters are hugging their sisters they haven't seen for a \ngeneration. Grandmothers are meeting their grandchildren who they have \nnever met.\n  Tomorrow the distinguished chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs \nCommittee and I will host the President of South Korea for coffee here \non Capitol Hill. Kim's visit will give us a chance to renew the close \nbonds forged in blood in the common struggle against the forces of \noppression which unite our people in the United States and South Korea.\n  I rise today to talk a little bit about the Korean peninsula and the \nimportant role the United States can play in concert with our South \nKorean allies and other friends to help build lasting peace on that \npeninsula.\n  Yesterday the New York Times published an article by veteran defense \ncorrespondent Michael Gordon which suggests that a missile deal with \nNorth Korea may have been within reach last year. As fascinating as \nthis rendition of events was and as fascinating as the policies were, \nwe now have a new President. The failure or the judgment to not proceed \nwith negotiations into the month of January of this year on the part of \nthe new President is in fact at this moment irrelevant. We have a new \nPresident and a new administration. The question squarely now is not \nwhether President Clinton should have gone to North Korea; the question \nis whether this administration, the Bush administration, is going to \nbuild on the progress made over the past 5 years since we narrowly \naverted a nuclear showdown on the Korean peninsula.\n  I was pleased to see Secretary of State Powell quoted in a Washington \nPost article today, suggesting this administration was going to pursue \nthe possibilities of a better relationship with North Korea and was \ngoing to leave nothing on the table. I was slightly dismayed to read of \nan informed source in the administration who chose not to be \nidentified, demonstrating a great deal more of what seemed to me in the \narticle to be not only skepticism, which I share about the intentions \nof North Korea, but willingness to pursue vigorously the possibilities \nof further negotiations. Hopefully, I am misreading that unidentified \nhighly placed administration official.\n  In my view, there is only one correct answer and that is the one \nSecretary Powell has indicated today. For it would be irresponsible not \nto explore to discover whether North Korea is prepared to abandon its \npursuit of long-range missiles in response to a serious proposal from \nthe United States, our friends, and our allies.\n  North Korea confronts the United States with a number of security \nchallenges. North Korea maintains a huge army of more than 1 million \nmen and women in uniform, about 5 percent of its entire population. \nMany of that army are poised on the South Korean border. The threat \nthat North Korea opposes extends well beyond the Korean peninsula. Its \nNodong missile can not only strike all of South Korea but can also \nthreaten our ally, Japan. North Korea sells those same missiles to \nanyone who has the cash to buy them. North Korean missile exports to \nIran and Pakistan have guaranteed, unfortunately, that any future war \nin the Middle East or South Asia will be even more dangerous and more \ndestructive than past conflicts in that region.\n  North Korean missiles and the very real concern that North Korea \nmight even build longer range missiles capable of striking the United \nStates are a driving force behind our plans to build a national missile \ndefense system.\n  If we can remove that threat, that is, the threat from North Korea \nlong-range missile possibility, the impact will be huge, not only on \nthe security of Northeast Asia but also on our own defense strategy as \nwe debate how best to deal with our vulnerability to weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  For most of the past 50 years, U.S. soldiers of the 2d Infantry \nDivision have looked north from their positions along the DMV at North \nKorean adversaries that appeared unchanging--a hermit kingdom, locked \nin a Stalinist time warp. Indeed, 2 or 3 years ago if I had spoken to \nthe American people about landmines, the 38th parallel, and the armies \nof North and South Korea, it would have been to discuss the latest \nnorthern incursion along what remains the most heavily armed border in \nthe world. The troops of the 2d Infantry Division are still standing \nshoulder to shoulder with our South Korean allies. The landmines are \nstill there. And much of the tension along the DMZ remains unabated, at \nleast for now.\n\n  But maybe, just maybe, things are beginning to change.\n  The United States should end our ``prevent defense'' and go on the \noffensive to advance our vital interests--particularly the \ndismantlement of North Korea's long-range missile program. Now is not \nthe time for lengthy policy reviews or foot-dragging on existing \ncommitments. Now is the time to forge ahead and test North Korea's \ncommitment to peace.\n  A few weeks ago what had been unthinkable--the opening of direct rail \ntransport across the DMZ--became a near term achievable objective. The \nmilitaries of North and South Korea will soon begin to reconstruct the \nrail links connecting Seoul not only to Pyongyang, but also to China, \nRussia, and Western Europe.\n  I remember vividly the moment when the people of East and West Berlin \ndecided to tear down the Berlin Wall.\n  The Berlin Wall had become a true anachronism: a graffiti-strewn \nrelic of a morally, politically, and economically bankrupt Soviet \nregime. Once the East German people had torn down the ideological walls \nin their own minds, tearing down the concrete was a piece of cake.\n  The people of North and South Korea are not there yet. But the walls \nare under siege. The establishment of direct rail links will represent \na major breach in the walls of fear, insecurity, and isolation which \nhave built up over the past 50 years.\n  Last October, I spoke to this body about testing North Korea's \nwillingness to abandon its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. At \nthat time, I pointed to some of the hopeful signs that North Korea was \ninterested in improving its relations with its neighbors--a missile \nlaunch moratorium now more than 2 years old, summit meetings with South \nKorea, Russia, and China, and the first tentative steps toward economic \nreform.\n  I attributed these North Korean actions to the ``Sunshine Policy'' \ncrafted by South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, and to the hard-headed \nengagement strategy implemented by former Secretary of Defense William \nPerry on behalf of the Clinton administration.\n  Since last fall, evidence has mounted steadily that North Korea's \nleader Kim Jong-il has indeed decided that nothing short of a major \noverhaul of his economic system and diplomatic relations is likely to \npull his country back from the brink of starvation and economic \ncollapse.\n  In addition to the progress on rail links, here are some of the other \nrecent developments:\n  North Korea has expanded cooperation to search for the remains of \nAmericans missing in action from the Korean war. Uniformed U.S. \nmilitary personnel are working along side their North Korean \ncounterparts, searching the rice paddies, often in remote areas, in an \neffort to solve 50-year-old mysteries.\n\n[[Page S1917]]\n\n  The North has continued modest steps to allow family reunions across \nthe DMZ, exposing people from the North to the quality of life enjoyed \nby their brothers and sisters in the South. More than 300 families have \nenjoyed reunion visits, and more are scheduled.\n  The North has toned down its customary harsh rhetoric about the U.S. \nand South Korea, substituting a steady diet of editorials outlining the \nNorth's plans to make economic revitalization its top priority.\n  North Korea for the first time last November opened its food \ndistribution system to South Korean inspection and also provided a \ndetailed accounting of food aid distribution.\n  North and South Korea have held defense talks at both the ministerial \nlevel and subsequently at the working level, and have agreed, at the \nurging of South Korea, to improve military to military communications. \nThis is the first step toward confidence building measures that can \nreduce the likelihood that a relatively minor incident along the DMZ \nmight escalate into war.\n  North and South have established an economic cooperation panel and \nlaunched a joint study of North Korea's energy needs.\n  North and South Korean flood control experts met last month in \nPyongyang for talks on cooperation in efforts along the Imjin River, \nwhich crosses the border between the two countries.\n  The North Koreans have dispatched a team of financial experts to \nWashington to examine what it would take for North Korea to earn \nsupport from international financial institutions once it has taken the \nsteps necessary to satisfy U.S. anti-terrorism laws.\n  And, as I mentioned above, the North has not test-fired a missile for \nmore than 2\\1/2\\ years, and has pledged not to do so while negotiations \nwith the United States on the North's missile program continue.\n  Five years ago when people spoke of ``North Korean offensives,'' they \nwere referring to the threat of a North Korean assault across the DMZ.\n  Today, Kim Jong-il is mounting an offensive, but it is a diplomatic \nand economic offensive, not a military one. Over the past 12 months, \nNorth Korea has established diplomatic relations with almost all of the \nnations of Western Europe. Planning is underway for an unprecedented \ntrip by Kim Jong-il to Seoul to meet with President Kim Dae-jung later \nthis year.\n  Finally, Kim Jong-il's has publicly embraced China's model of \neconomic reform. His celebrated January visit to Shanghai and his open \npraise of Chinese economic reforms indicates that Kim is driving North \nKorea toward a future in which it would be more closely integrated \neconomically and politically to the rest of East Asia and the world.\n  What are we to make of all of this? How should we respond?\n  I want to be clear about why I find these developments so promising. \nI am not a fan of Kim Jong-il. No one should think that his motives are \nnoble or humanitarian.\n  Over the years, Kim Jong-il has shown himself willing to go to any \nlength--including state-sponsored terrorism--to preserve his regime.\n  I have no reason to believe he has abandoned his love of dictatorship \nin favor of constitutional democracy. Far from it.\n  Kim Jong-il is betting that he can emerge from a process of change at \nthe head of a North Korean society that is more prosperous, stable, and \nmilitarily capable than it is today, but still a dictatorship.\n  But frankly, the reasons why Kim Jong-il is pursuing economic reform \nand diplomatic opening are not as important as the steps he will have \nto take along the way.\n  If North Korea's opening is to succeed, the North will have to \naddress many of the fundamentals which make it so threatening--\nespecially the gross distortion of its domestic spending priorities in \nfavor of the military. The North cannot revitalize its economy while \nspending 25 percent of its gross domestic product on weaponry.\n  The North cannot obtain meaningful, sustained foreign investment \nwithout addressing the lack of transparency in its economy as well as \nthe absence of laws and institutions to protect investors and \nfacilitate international trade.\n  North Korea's pursuit of economic reform and diplomatic opening \npresents the United States with a golden opportunity, if we are wise \nenough to seize it.\n  We should welcome the emergence of North Korea from its shell not \nbecause North Korea's motives are benign, but because we have a chance, \nin concert with our allies, to shape its transformation into a less \nthreatening country.\n  If we play our cards right, North Korea's opening can lead to a less \nauthoritarian regime that is more respectful of international norms--\nall without any shots being fired in anger.\n  I point out, a number of old Communist dictators had thought they \ncould move in an easy transition from the Communist regime that has \nclearly failed to a market economy, or integration with the rest of the \nworld, and still maintain their power.\n  None, none--none has succeeded thus far. I believe it is an oxymoron \nto suggest that North Korea can emerge and become an engaged partner in \nworld trade without having to fundamentally change itself and in the \nprocess, I believe, end up a country very different from what we have \nnow.\n  I am delighted that Secretary Powell has expressed his support for \nthis hard-headed brand of engagement with North Korea. As he testified \nbefore the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last month:\n\n       We are open to a continued process of engagement with the \n     North so long as it addresses political, economic, and \n     security concerns, is reciprocal, and does not come at the \n     expense of our alliance relationships.\n\n  This is precisely the kind of engagement I have in mind. I think we \nshould get on with it.\n  North Korea knows that under our nonproliferation laws it cannot gain \nunfettered access to trade, investment, and technology without first \nhalting its development and export of long-range ballistic missile \ntechnology and submitting its nuclear program to full-scope safeguards \nunder the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n  North Korea knows it won't get World Bank loans as long as it remains \non our list of nations that condone international terrorism or provide \nsanctuary for terrorists. In order to get off that list, North Korea \nmust end all support for terrorist organizations and must cooperate \nfully with the Japanese government to resolve the question of Japanese \ncitizens abducted from Japan--some more than 20 years ago.\n  In other words, Mr. President, if North Korea is to turn around its \nmoribund economy and fully normalize relations with its neighbors, it \nwill have to take steps which are demonstrably in our national interest \nand in the national interests of our allies.\n  We should do everything in our power to ensure that North Korea does \nnot diverge from the path it is now on.\n  Specifically, we should continue to provide generous humanitarian \nrelief to starving North Korean children. Nothing about the situation \non the peninsula will be improved by the suffering of North Korean \nchildren racked by hunger and disease.\n  We should continue to abide by the terms of the Agreed Framework, so \nlong as North Korea does the same. We should not unilaterally start \nmoving the goal posts. The Agreed Framework has effectively capped the \nNorth's ability to produce fissile material with which to construct \nnuclear weapons. Under the terms of Agreed Framework, North Korea \nplaced its nuclear program under International Atomic Energy Agency \nsafeguards and halted work on two unfinished heavy water nuclear \nreactors in exchange for the promise of proliferation-resistant light \nwater nuclear reactors and heavy fuel oil deliveries for electric power \ngeneration. Without the Agreed Framework, North Korea might already \nhave sufficient fissile material with which to construct dozens of \nnuclear bombs.\n\n\n             missile agreement possible--patience required\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, we should engage North Korea in a serious \ndiplomatic effort aimed at an iron-clad agreement to end forever the \nNorth's pursuit of long range missiles.\n  In discussions with U.S., Russian, and Chinese officials, North Korea \nhas signaled its willingness to give up the export, and possibly the \ndevelopment, of long-range missiles, in response to the right package \nof incentives. Such\n\n[[Page S1918]]\n\nan agreement would remove a direct North Korean threat to the region \nand improve prospects for North-South reconciliation. It would also \nremove a major source of missiles and missile technology for countries \nsuch as Iran.\n  Getting an agreement will not be easy, but it helps a lot that we are \nnot the only country which would benefit from the dismantlement of \nNorth Korea's missile program. Our allies South Korea and Japan, our \nEuropean allies who already provide financial support for the Agreed \nFramework, the Chinese, the Russians, all share a desire to see North \nKorea devote its meager resources to food, not rockets. The only \ncountries which want to see North Korea building missiles are its \ndisreputable customers.\n  A tough, verifiable agreement to eliminate the North's long-range \nmissile threat might be possible in exchange for reasonable U.S. \nassistance that would help North Korea feed itself and help convert \nmissile plants to peaceful manufacturing.\n  Some people are impatient for change in North Korea. They want to \nadopt a more confrontational approach, including rushing ahead to \ndeploy an unproven, hugely expensive, and potentially destabilizing \nnational missile defense system.\n  I understand their frustration and share their desire for action \nagainst the threat of North Korean ballistic missiles.\n  But foreclosing diplomatic options by rushing to deploy NMD is not \nthe right antidote. Sure, a limited ground-based national missile \ndefense might someday be capable of shooting down a handful of North \nKorean missiles aimed at Los Angeles, but it will do nothing to defend \nour Asian allies from a North Korean missile attack.\n  Nor will it defend us from a nuclear bomb smuggled into the country \naboard a fishing trawler or a biological toxin released into our water \nsupply. NMD will not defend U.S. forces on Okinawa or elsewhere in the \nPacific theater. It will do nothing to prevent North Korea from \nwielding weapons of mass destruction against Seoul, much of which is \nactually within artillery range of North Korea.\n  Moreover, a rush to deploy an unproven national missile defense, \nparticularly absent a meaningful strategic dialog with china, could \njeopardize the cooperative role China has played in recent years on the \nKorean Peninsula. Given our common interest in preventing North Korea \nfrom becoming a nuclear weapons power, the United States and China \nshould work in concert, not at cross purposes.\n\n\n                       Opening North Korean Eyes\n\n  North Korea's opening has given the North Korean people a fresh look \nat the outside world--like a gopher coming out of its hole--with \nconsequences which could be profound over the long haul. Hundreds of \nforeigners are in North Korea today, compared with a handful just a few \nyears ago.\n  Foreigners increasingly are free to travel widely in the country and \ntalk to average North Koreans without government interference. North \nKorea has even begun to issue tourist visas. The presence of foreigners \nin North Korea is gradually changing North Korean attitudes about South \nKorea and the West.\n  One American with a long history of working in North Korea \nillustrated the change underway by describing an impromptu encounter he \nhad recently.\n  While he was out on an unescorted morning walk, a North Korean woman \napproached him and said, ``You're not a Russian, are you? You're a \nMiguk Nom aren't you?''\n  Her expression translates roughly into ``You're an American \nimperialist bastard, eh?''\n  The American replied good-naturedly, ``Yes, I am an American \nimperialist bastard.''\n  To which the woman replied quite sincerely, ``Thanks very much for \nthe food aid!''\n  Another American, a State Department official accompanying a World \nFood Program inspection team, noted that hundreds of people along the \nroad waved and smiled, and in the case of soldiers, saluted, as the \nconvoy passed.\n  He also reports that many of 80 million woven nylon bags used to \ndistribute grain and emblazoned with the letters ``U.S.A.'' are being \nrecycled by North Koreans for use as everything from back-packs to rain \ncoats. These North Koreans become walking billboards of American aid \nand generosity of spirit.\n  North Korea is just one critical challenge in a region of enormous \nimportance to us. We cannot separate our policy there from our overall \napproach in East Asia.\n  We cannot hope that decisions we make about national missile defense, \nTaiwan policy, or support for democracy and rule of law in China will \nbe of no consequence to developments on the Korean Peninsula. To the \ncontrary, we need to think holistically and comprehensively about East \nAsia policy.\n  Our interests are vast. Roughly one-third of the world's population \nresides in East Asia. In my lifetime, East Asia has gone from less than \n3 percent of the world GDP in 1950 to roughly 25 percent today.\n  Four of our 10 largest trading partners--Japan, China, Taiwan, and \nSouth Korea, are in East Asia.\n  Each of those trading partners is also one of the world's top ten \neconomies as measured by gross domestic product. China, Japan, and \nSouth Korea together hold more than $700 billion in hard currency \nreserves--half of the world's total.\n  East Asia is a region of economic dynamism. Last year Singapore, Hong \nKong, and South Korea grew by more than 10 percent, shaking off the \nEast Asian financial crisis and resuming their characteristic vitality. \nU.S. exports to the region have grown dramatically in recent years. \nU.S. exports to Southeast Asia, for instance, surpass our exports to \nGermany and are double our exports to France. U.S. direct investment in \nEast Asia now tops $150 billion, and has tripled over the past decade.\n  And of course these are just a few of the raw economic realities \nwhich underscore East Asia's importance. The United States has \nimportant humanitarian, environmental, energy, and security interests \nthroughout the region.\n  We have an obligation, it seems to me, not to drop the ball. We have \na vital interest in maintaining peace and stability in East Asia. We \nhave good friends and allies--like President Kim Dae Jung of South \nKorea--who stand ready to work with us toward that goal. It is vital \nthat we not drop the ball; miss an opportunity to end North Korea's \ndeadly and destabilizing pursuit of long range missiles. I don't know \nthat an agreement can be reached. In the end North Korea may prove too \nintransigent, too truculent, for us to reach an accord.\n  But I hope the Bush administration will listen closely to President \nKim today, and work with him to test North Korea's commitment to peace. \nWe should stay the course on an engagement policy that has brought the \npeninsula to the brink, not of war, but of the dawning of a brave new \nday for all the Korean people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today a new government has been formed \nin Israel under the leadership of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, with \nShimon Peres as Foreign Minister and the broad-based participation of \nmany across Israel's political spectrum.\n  I would like to take a few minutes today to share my assessment of \nthe present situation, where things stand, and what this may mean for \nU.S. policy in the region. I rise today as one who has supported the \npeace process, believed that a peace agreement was possible, and who \nhas worked in the Senate, along with many of my colleagues, to see that \nthe United States played an active role in helping Israel and the \nPalestinians seek peace.\n  Prime Minister Ehud Barak was elected two years ago to make peace and \nto bring about an ``end of the conflict'' with both Syria and the \nPalestinians. He was elected with a mandate to complete the Oslo \nprocess, a goal at the time supported by the majority of the people of \nIsrael.\n  Over the past two years Prime Minister Barak tried, heroically and \nenergetically, to achieve a comprehensive peace with both parties.\n\n[[Page S1919]]\n\n  Indeed, it has been said I believe, that Prime Minister Barak went \nfurther than any other Israeli Prime Minister in an attempt to reach a \ncomprehensive agreement with the Palestinians which includes:\n  The creation of a Palestinian state;\n  Palestinian control of all of Gaza;\n  Palestinian control of approximately 94 to 95 percent of the West \nBank, and territorial compensation for most of the other five percent;\n  A division of Jerusalem, with Palestinian control over the Arab \nneighborhoods in East Jerusalem and the possibility of a Palestinian \ncapitol in Jerusalem; and\n  Shared sovereignty arrangements for the Temple Mount.\n  The issue of Palestinian refugees, was addressed with tens of \nthousands of Palestinians to be allowed into Israel as part of a family \nreunification program, and compensation in the tens of billions of \ndollars provided to other Palestinian refugees as well.\n  Not only was the Palestinian response to these unprecedented offers \n``no,'' but, even as Prime Minister Barak attempted to engage Chairman \nYasser Arafat at the negotiation table, the Palestinians took to a \ncampaign of violence in the streets, and threatened to unilaterally \ndeclare an independent Palestinian state:\n  When the violence began, the Fatah's militia, the Tanzim, fired upon \nIsraelis with submachine guns. The Fatah and the Tanzim have been \nactive in the violence--even encouraging its escalation--to this day;\n  Chairman Arafat freed a number of Hamas terrorists who instantly \nturned around and vowed violence against Israel;\n  The Palestinian media, under the control of the Palestinian \nAuthority, has been used to disseminate inciting material, providing \nencouragement to damage holy Jewish sites, to kill Israelis, and carry \nout acts of terror; and,\n  Palestinian schools were closed down by the Palestinian Authority \nallowing Palestinian children to participate in the riots and violence.\n  And in reaction, all too often, Israel, too, has resorted to violence \nin an effort to protect its security and safeguard the lives of its \npeople.\n  This new Intifadah has been characterized by a level of hate and \nviolence that, frankly, I did not believe possible in view of the \nextensive concessions Israel had offered.\n  And it is clear, I believe, that much of this campaign of violence, \nthis new Intifadah which continues to this day, has been coordinated \nand planned.\n  Because I was at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos two months \nago which was also attended by Shimon Peres and Yasser Arafat, I read \nwith great interest Tom Friedman's op-ed in The New York Times 3 weeks \nago.\n  As Mr. Friedman's column reports, when Mr. Peres extended the olive \nbranch to Mr. Arafat at Davos, ``Mr. Arafat torched it.''\n  I urge all of my colleagues to read Thomas Friedman's op-ed article: \n``Sharon, Arafat and Mao,'' which I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 8, 2001]\n\n                         Sharon, Arafat and Mao\n\n                        (By Thomas L. Friedman)\n\n       So I'm at the Davos World Economic Forum two weeks ago, and \n     Shimon Peres walks by. One of the reporters with him asks me \n     if I'm going to hear Mr. Peres and Yasir Arafat address the \n     1,000 global investors and ministers attending Davos. No, I \n     tell him, I have a strict rule, I'm only interested in what \n     Mr. Arafat says to his own people in Arabic. Too bad, says \n     the reporter, because the fix is in. Mr. Peres is going to \n     extend an olive branch to Mr. Arafat, Mr. Arafat is going to \n     do the same back and the whole love fest will get beamed back \n     to Israel to boost the peace process and Ehud Barak's re-\n     election. Good, I'll catch it on TV, I said.\n       Well, Mr Peres did extend the olive branch, as planned, but \n     Mr. Arafat torched it. Reading in Arabic from a prepared \n     text, Mr. Arafat denounced Israel for its ``facist military \n     aggression'' and ``colonialist armed expansionism,'' and its \n     policies of ``murder, persecution, assassination, destruction \n     and devastation.''\n       Mr. Arafat's performance at Davos was a seminal event, and \n     is critical for understanding Ariel Sharon's landslide \n     election. What was Mr. Arafat saying by this speech, with Mr. \n     Peres sitting by his side? First, he was saying that there is \n     no difference between Mr. Barak and Mr. Sharon. Because \n     giving such a speech on the eve of the Israeli election, in \n     the wake of an 11th-hour Barak bid to conclude a final deal \n     with the Palestinians in Taba, made Mr. Barak's far-reaching \n     offer to Mr. Arafat look silly. Moreover, Mr. Arafat was \n     saying that there is no difference between Mr. Peres and Mr. \n     Sharon, because giving such a speech just after the warm \n     words of Mr. Peres made Mr. Peres look like a dupe, as all \n     the Israeli papers reported. Finally, at a time when \n     Palestinians are starving for work, Mr. Arafat's subliminal \n     message to the global investors was: Stay away.\n       That's why the press is asking exactly the wrong question \n     about the Sharon election. They're asking, who is Ariel \n     Sharon? The real question is, who is Yasir Arafat? The press \n     keeps asking: Will Mr. Sharon become another Charles de \n     Gaulle, the hard-line general who pulled the French Army out \n     of Algeria? Or will he be Richard Nixon, the anti-Communist \n     who made peace with Communist China? Such questions totally \n     miss the point.\n       Why? Because Israel just had its de Gaulle. His name was \n     Ehud Barak. Mr. Barak was Israel's most decorated soldier. He \n     abstained in the cabinet vote over the Oslo II peace accords. \n     But once in office he changed 180 degrees. He offered Mr. \n     Arafat 94 percent of the West Bank for a Palestinian state, \n     plus territorial compensation for most of the other 6 \n     percent, plus half of Jerusalem, plus restitution and \n     resettlement in Palestine for Palestinian refugees. And Mr. \n     Arafat not only said no to all this, but described Israel as \n     ``fascist'' as Mr. Barak struggled for re-election. It would \n     be as though de Gaulle had offered to withdraw from Algeria \n     and the Algerians said: ``Thank you. You're a fascist. Of \n     course we'll take all of Algeria, but we won't stop this \n     conflict until we get Bordeaux, Marseilles and Nice as \n     well.''\n       If the Palestinians don't care who Ariel Sharon is, why \n     should we? If Mr. Arafat wanted an Israeli leader who would \n     not force him to make big decisions, which he is incapable of \n     making, why should we ask whether Mr. Sharon is going to be \n     de Gaulle and make him a big offer? What good is it for \n     Israel to have a Nixon if the Palestinians have no Mao?\n       The Olso peace process was about a test. It was about \n     testing whether Israel had a Palestinian partner for a secure \n     and final peace. It was a test that Israel could afford, it \n     was a test that the vast majority of Israelis wanted and it \n     was a test Mr. Barak courageously took to the limits of the \n     Israeli political consensus--and beyond. Mr. Arafat \n     squandered that opportunity. Eventually, Palestinians will \n     ask for a makeup exam. And eventually Israelis may want to \n     give it to them, if they again see a chance to get this \n     conflict over with. But who knows what violence and pain will \n     be inflicted in the meantime?\n       All we know is that for now, the Oslo test is over. That is \n     what a vast majority of Israelis said in this election. So \n     stop asking whether Mr. Sharon will become de Gaulle. That is \n     not why Israelis elected him. They elected him to be Patton. \n     They elected Mr. Sharon because they know exactly who he is, \n     and because seven years of Oslo have taught them exactly who \n     Yasir Arafat is.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, Mr. Friedman makes a simple but \nprofound point. He writes that many ``are asking exactly the wrong \nquestion about the Sharon election. They're asking, who is Ariel \nSharon? The real question is, who is Yasser Arafat?''\n  He continues, ``the press keeps asking: Will Mr. Sharon become \nanother Charles de Gaulle . . . or will he be Richard Nixon, the anti-\nCommunist who made peace with Communist China?''\n  So we naturally ask the question, will Ariel Sharon reach out to the \nPalestinians? As Tom Friedman points out, this is exactly the wrong way \nto look at Ariel Sharon or the recent election.\n\n       Why? Because Israel just had its de Gaulle. His name was \n     Ehud Barak. Mr. Barak was Israel's most decorated soldier. He \n     abstained in the cabinet vote over the Oslo II peace accords. \n     But once in office he changed 180 degrees. He offered Mr. \n     Arafat 94 percent of the West Bank for a Palestinian state . \n     . . plus half of Jerusalem . . . and Mr. Arafat not only said \n     no to all this, but described Israel as ``fascist'' as Mr. \n     Barak struggled for re-election.\n\n  Mr. Friedman continues to state what has become clear: ``What good is \nit for Israel to have a Nixon if the Palestinians have no Mao?''\n  As someone who has been a supporter of the Oslo process from the \nstart, I say this with a great deal of regret. And I wish this were not \nthe case. But we have seen Israel make the offer, an historic offer, \nonly to have it rebuffed. The consequences of this could, in fact, be \ndevastating.\n  In his victory speech, Prime Minister Sharon called on the \nPalestinians ``to cast off the path of violence and to return to the \npath of dialogue'' while acknowledging that ``peace requires painful \ncompromises on both sides.''\n\n[[Page S1920]]\n\n  Mr. Sharon has said that he favors a long-term interim agreement with \nthe Palestinians since a comprehensive agreement is not now possible \nbecause the Palestinians have shown they are not ready to conclude such \nan agreement.\n  He has stated that he accepts a demilitarized Palestinian state, is \ncommitted to improving the daily lives of the Palestinians, and has \nreportedly indicated that he does not plan to build new West Bank \nsettlements.\n  Whatever happens, there can be little doubt that it will have a \nprofound impact on United States strategic interests in the Middle \nEast. And because of that, the United States must remain an interested \nparty in the region.\n  I believe that it is critical that both parties need to make every \neffort to end the current cycle of provocation and reaction, with a \nspecial responsibility that is incumbent upon the Palestinian Authority \nto seek an end to the riots, the terror, the bombings, and the \nshootings. There must be a ``time out'' on violence before the \nsituation degenerates further into war.\n  We can all remember the images, from last fall, of the Palestinian \nchild hiding behind his father, caught in the cross-fire, shot to \ndeath, and then the images, a few days later, the pictures of the \nIsraeli soldier who was beaten while in custody and thrown out of a \nsecond floor window of the police station, to be beaten to death by the \nmob below.\n  It is easy to understand how passions can run high, and frustration \nand fear can drive violence.\n  But it is also easy to see how these feelings--even these feelings, \nthat are based in legitimate aspiration--can get out of control and \nlead to ever deeper, and never-ending, cycles of violence.\n  The Palestinian leadership must make every effort to end this cycle, \nto quell the attitude of hate that has been fostered among the \nPalestinian people, and to act to curb the violence, and to convince \nIsrael that they are indeed serious and sincere about pursuing peace.\n  But until there is evidence that the violence is ending, the United \nStates cannot be productively engaged between the two parties.\n  If both Israel and the Palestinians can make progress in curbing or \nending the violence, the United States can play an important role in \nhelping to shape intermediate confidence-building measures between \nIsrael and the Palestinians. The current environment makes a \ncomprehensive agreement impossible, but proximity gives the Israelis \nand the Palestinians no choice but to learn to live together. The \nalternative is clearly war.\n  And the United States must continue to work together with Israel to \nstrengthen the bilateral relationship, to ensure that Israel has the \ntools it needs to defend itself, and to enhance security in the region.\n  There are those who now believe that the Palestinians don't want \npeace; that, in fact, they want to continue the violence, and force \nIsrael into the sea; to take back Jaffa; to take back Haifa.\n  There is a segment of the population that believes this is true. But \nI say, how realistic is this? Can there be any doubt that Israel has \nthe ability to defend itself, and will? Or that should there be an \neffort to attack Israel, to end this democracy, that the United States \nwould be fully involved? There is no doubt of that.\n  So the ball is now in the Palestinian court, to show that \nPalestinians are interested in ending violence and bloodshed. Israel, \nunder Barak, has shown how far it will go to search for peace, much \nfurther than I ever thought possible. The concessions offered at Camp \nDavid, and after, are testament, I believe, to Israel's desire and \ncommitment for peace. But to seek to force peace in light of hostility \nand hatred on the streets is neither realistic nor sustainable.\n  The Sharon election, I believe, can be seen as a referendum on \nArafat's actions and policies, and the Palestinian violence, and it \nmust be taken seriously by the Palestinians if the peace process is to \never get back on track.\n  Just last summer, the 7-year-old peace process seemed on the verge of \nsuccess, but the chairman walked away from the deal at the last moment.\n  I hope that someday soon Chairman Arafat will realize the profound \ndisservice that he has done his people, and the people of the world, \nthat he will realize that the framework for peace was on the table, \nthat he will realize that continued violence is not the way to achieve \nthe legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people, and that \ncontinued violence will not gain him or his people additional \nconcessions at the negotiating table.\n  And I believe that if and when he does realize this, when he takes \naction to bring the current violence to an end, he will find that \nIsrael remains a partner in the search for peace in the Middle East, \nwith the United States as a facilitator.\n  Until then, however, the United States must be clear that we continue \nto stand with Israel, an historic ally and partner in the search for \nsecurity and peace in the Middle East.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe).

Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to an \nissue Washington, and the American public, too often take for granted--\nsomething that is near and dear to my heart, and a part of my heritage. \nI am talking about American agriculture. This country needs a wake-up \ncall. Americans believe that their bacon, lettuce, and tomatoes are \nraised somewhere in the back of the local grocery store. As the \ndaughter of a seventh generation Arkansas farm family, I know where our \nfood supply is produced. It is grown in rural communities by families \nworking from dusk until dawn to make ends meet. Unfortunately, too many \nin Washington continue to pay lip-service to our Nation's agricultural \nindustry without actually providing them the tools and assistance they \nneed to sustain their way of life.\n  I recognize the hurt that is evident in our agricultural communities. \nI know that commodity prices are at record lows and input costs, \nincluding fertilizer, energy, and fuel, are at record highs. No \ncorporation in the world could make it today receiving the same prices \nit received during the Great Depression, yet, we are asking our farmers \nto do just that.\n  I am here to enlighten this body on the needs of our agricultural \ncommunity. And it is my intention to come to the Senate floor often \nthis year to highlight various issues affecting our Nation's farmers \nand ranchers.\n  In the interest of fairness, I will give credit where credit is due. \nIn recent years, Congress has recognized that farmers are suffering, \nand we have delivered emergency assistance to our struggling \nagricultural community. Arkansas' farmers could not have survived \nwithout this help. Nearly 40 percent of net farm income came from \ndirect Government payments during the 2000 crop year. The trouble with \nthis type of ad hoc approach is that farmers and creditors across this \ncountry never really know how or when the Government is going to step \nin and help them.\n  Many of my farmers are scared to death that the assistance that has \nbeen available in the past will be absent this year because the tax cut \nand other spending programs have a higher priority.\n  I will highlight my frustration with our Nation's farm policy in the \nnear future, but today I want to bring the Senate's attention to a \nmatter that should have been handled long ago, yet still remains \nunaddressed. Our farmers need the disaster assistance that Congress \nprovided last Fall. President Clinton signed the FY 2001 Agriculture \nAppropriations Act on October 28, 2000. Included in this legislation \nwas an estimated $1.6 billion in disaster payments for 2000 crop losses \ndue to weather-related damages. These payments are yet to arrive in the \nfarmer's mailbox. My phone lines are lit up with calls from farmers and \nbankers asking me when these payments are going to arrive. In the \nSouth, our growing season begins earlier than many parts of the \ncountry, and our farmers could head to the field right now to begin \nwork on the 2001 crop, if they just had their operating loan. The \ntrouble is, many of them are unable to cash flow a loan for 2001 \nbecause they still await USDA assistance to pay off the banker for last \nyear's disaster.\n  I reference the South's growing season because many of our farm State \nSenators are from the Midwest, and\n\n[[Page S1921]]\n\nthey may not be hearing the same desperation that I am hearing. Their \nfarmers are in no better shape, but they are not yet trying to put the \n2001 crop in the ground. Arkansas farmers have been wringing their \nhands all winter trying to determine if it is worth it to try one more \nyear. They are literally on the brink of bankruptcy and are weighing \nwhether it is worth exposing themselves to more potential financial \nloss. These are not bad businessmen. They have survived the \nagricultural turmoil of the 1980s because they practice efficient \nproduction techniques and are sound managers. They have simply been \ndealt an unbelievably difficult hand and are trying to figure out how \nthey can stay in the game. Some have already lost the battle. I have \nheard of more respected Arkansas farmers closing their shop doors and \nselling the family farm than ever before. Farm auction notifications \nfill the backs of agricultural publications.\n  Established, long time farmers are crying for help. A typical \nexample, a farmer from Almyra, Arkansas recently wrote to me asking for \nhelp. He has been farming rice and soybeans in southeast Arkansas for \nalmost 30 years. Like many others, he wanted Congress to know that \ngovernment assistance is vitally needed. He and other farmers would \nprefer to get their income from the marketplace, but most of all, he \njust wants to stay in business.\n  The repercussions of losing people like this good farmer will have a \ndrastic effect on our rural communities. To ignore agriculture's plight \nis to ignore rural America. Without farmers, the lifeblood of small \ntowns like Almyra, Arkansas will be lost, and I fear never regained.\n  Around 800 to 1,100 farmers apply for Chapter 12 bankruptcy each \nyear. The average age of the American farmer is getting older every \nyear because young men and women simply do not see a future in \nagriculture production. I am reminded of a joke that my father used to \ntell me about the farmer who won the lottery. When a reporter asked him \nwhat he was going to do with all that money, he replied ``Farm 'til \nit's gone!'' Unfortunately, that joke is not too far from the truth \nthese days.\n\n  We have a responsibility to provide a better agricultural policy for \nour nation's producers. As I stated earlier, I will address my specific \nfrustrations with the current farm bill at a later date. Today, I am \npleading that the disaster assistance we passed last Fall be delivered \nto the farmers as soon as possible.\n  I have written and urged President Bush to expedite this situation. I \nstressed the importance of quick action on this issue to Secretary \nVeneman in both private meetings and during her confirmation hearing. I \ncontacted the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) urging them to act \npromptly on the rules that must be finalized to begin the payment \nprocess. For all the farmers listening out there, don't hold your local \nFSA offices accountable. Their hands are tied just like yours. They \nawait the rules and procedures for disaster assistance distribution \njust like you do. The responsibility lies right here in Washington, DC. \nSpecifically, OMB, is responsible for finalizing the rules. I'm sure \nthey are working hard to get the ball rolling, but we need action \ntoday. Not tomorrow, not next week, but today!\n  I call upon the Administration to deliver the disaster assistance to \nthe farmers. Congress did its part last fall. It is now imperative that \nthe Administration take care of things on their end. Unfortunately, \nthis situation is nothing new. The last Administration was less than \nquick about implementing disaster programs as well. But that is no \nexcuse, farmers need the help now. Dotting the ``i's'' and crossing the \n``t's'' in the required paper work should not take months to \naccomplish.\n  For countless farmers across the nation, I call on the President to \nplease expedite this matter.\n  I look forward to many further discussions on the Senate floor about \nthe plight of the American farmer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to draw my colleagues \nattention to the continuing crisis in West Africa, where a deeply \ndisturbing trend has emerged in strong-man politics. In the model \nemerging in that region, violent regimes hold entire civilian \npopulations hostage in order to win concessions, and even the guise of \nlegitimacy, from the international community.\n  At the heart of this trend, is Liberian President Charles Taylor. \nWhile the Liberian Embassy here and the man himself are currently \ntrying to persuade the world of their good intentions, no one who has \nfollowed Africa in recent years should be deceived. Taylor has \nabsolutely no credibility. All reliable reports continue to indicate \nthat he is manipulating the situation in West Africa for personal gain, \nat the expense of his own Liberian people, the people of Sierra Leone, \nand now the people of Guinea.\n  Some of the responsibility for the terrible abuses committed in the \nregion must fall upon his shoulders. I believe that Liberian President \nCharles Taylor is a war criminal.\n  Having secured the presidency essentially by convincing the exhausted \nLiberian people that there would be no peace unless he was elected, he \nproceeded to provide support for the Revolutionary United Front, Sierra \nLeone's rebel force perhaps best known for hacking off the limbs of \ncivilian men, women, and children to demonstrate their might, although \ntheir large-scale recruitment of child soldiers--a page borrowed from \nTaylor's book--is also notorious. By funneling diamonds that the rebels \nmined in Sierra Leone out through Liberia, and providing weapons in \nexchange, Taylor has profited from terrible bloodshed. And after the \ncapture of RUF leader Foday Sankoh last year, many RUF statements \nsuggested that Taylor was directly in control of the force. The U.N. \nhas found ``overwhelming evidence that Liberia has been actively \nsupporting the RUF at all levels.''\n  An international sanctions regime has been proposed, but regrettably \npostponed, at the United Nations. Sanctions are the correct course. And \nwhile many fear the impact on the long-suffering Liberian people, the \nunfortunate truth is that they are living in a state of total economic \ncollapse even without the sanctions, largely because their head of \nstate has no interest in the well being of his citizens.\n  Mr. President, I raise these issues today because I was in Sierra \nLeone just a few days ago. Previously, I had traveled in Nigeria, the \nregional giant in transition. Although I am more convinced than ever \nbefore, in the wake of my trip, that Nigeria's leadership must take \nbold steps to confront that country's difficult resource distribution \nissues and to hold those guilty of grand corruption accountable for \ntheir actions, I came away from my visit to Nigeria more optimistic \nthan I had been when I arrived. From Port Harcourt to Kano, in Lagos \nand in Abuja, I met with dedicated, talented individuals in civil \nsociety and in government, who are absolutely committed to making the \nmost of their historic opportunity\n\n[[Page S1922]]\n\nto chart the course of a democratic Nigeria.\n  I also visited Senegal, which is truly an inspirational place. In a \nneighborhood plagued by horrific violence, where even the most basic \nhuman security is in jeopardy, Senegal is moving in the opposite \ndirection. Last year they experienced a historic and peaceful \ndemocratic transition. Senegal continues to be a global leader in AIDS \nprevention.\n  Both of these countries--one still consolidating its transition, \nanother forging ahead in its quest for development and concern for the \ncondition of its citizens--affected by the crisis in Sierra Leone, \nLiberia, and Guinea. The entire region is. Refugees flee from one \ncountry to the next, desperately seeking safety. States fear they will \nbe the next target of the syndicate of thugs led by Charles Taylor and \npersonified by the RUF, and for Guinea, this fear has become a reality. \nMany, most notably Nigeria but also including Senegal, are undertaking \nserious military initiatives to bolster the peacekeeping forces in \nSierra Leone.\n\n  Some will ask, why does it matter? Why must we care about the \ndifficult and messy situation of a far-away place. We must care because \nthe destabilization of an entire region will make it all but impossible \nto pursue a number of U.S. interests, from trade and investment to \nfighting international crime and drug trade. We must care because, if \nwe do not resist, the model presented by the likes of Charles Taylor \nwill surely be emulated elsewhere in the world. We must care because \natrocities like those committed in Sierra Leone are an affront to \nhumanity as a whole. We are something less than what we aspire to be as \nAmericans if we simply turn our heads away as children lose their \nlimbs, families lose their homes, and so many West Africans lose their \nlives.\n  What is happening in West Africa is no less shocking and no less \ndespicable than it would be if these atrocities were committed in \nEurope. The innocent men, women, and children who have borne the brunt \nof this crisis did nothing wrong, and we must avoid what might be \ncalled ignorant fatalism, wherein we throw up our hands and write off \nthe people of Sierra Leone and Liberia and Guinea with some groundless \nassertion that this is just the way things are in Africa. Africa is not \nthe problem. A series of deliberate acts carried out by forces with a \nplan that is, at its core, criminal--that is the problem. And these are \nforces that we can name, and we should. And Mr. President, the \nleadership of these forces should be held accountable for their \nactions.\n  That leads me to the next question--what can we do?\n  We can help the British, who are working to train the Sierra Leonean \nArmy and whose very presence has done a great deal to stabilize Sierra \nLeone. Their commitment is admirable; their costs are great. When they \nneed assistance, we should make every effort to provide it.\n  We can reinforce the democracies in the region, like the countries of \nSenegal, Ghana, and Mali, to help them pursue their positive, \nalternative vision for West Africa's future.\n  We can continue our efforts to bolster the peacekeeping forces in \nSierra Leone through Operation Focus Relief, the U.S. program to train \nand equip seven West African battalions for service in Sierra Leone. \nAnd we can urge the UN force in Sierra Leone to develop their capacity \nto move into the rebel controlled areas, and then to use that capacity \nassertively.\n  We can work to avoid the pitfalls of the past. We must not forget \nthat the welfare of the people of Sierra Leone is the responsibility of \nthat beleaguered government. I met with President Kabbah, and with the \nAttorney General and Foreign Minister. I know that they want to do the \nright thing. But the point is not about which individuals are holding \noffice. The point is that we must work to enhance the capacity and the \nintegrity of Sierra Leone's government, and it must work on that \nproject feverishly as well. The people of Sierra Leone need basic \nservices, they need to have their security assured, they need \nopportunities. Ending the war is not enough.\n  In the same vein, we must not tolerate human rights abuses no matter \nwho is responsible. When militia forces that support the government of \nSierra Leone abuse civilians, they should be held accountable for their \nactions. And we must work to ensure that our involvement in the region \nis responsible, and collaborate with regional actors to ensure that we \nmonitor the human rights performance of the troops we train and equip. \nWest Africa must break the cycle of violence and impunity, and all \nforces have a role to play in that effort.\n  And that leads me to a crucial point, one that is particularly \nimportant for this new Administration and for this Congress. We must \nsupport the accountability mechanisms being established in the region. \nThere has been consistent, bipartisan support for accountability in the \nregion. The Administration should find the money needed to support the \nSpecial Court for Sierra Leone, and it should find it now. And this \nCongress should commit to contributing to that court in this year and \nthe next.\n  The Special Court will try only those most responsible for terrible \nabuses--the very worst actors. Others who have been swept up in the \nviolence will be referred to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, \nanother entity which deserves international support. The Court and the \nCommission are two elements of the same strategy to ensure \naccountability without leaving the rank-and-file no incentive to disarm \nand demobilize. They are vital to Sierra Leone's future, and they will \nserve as a crucial signal of a changing tide, and an end to impunity, \nthroughout the region.\n  Finally, we must join together to isolate Charles Taylor and his \ncronies and to tell it like it is. There was a time when some believed \nthat he could be part of the solution in West Africa. At this point, we \nshould all know better. And we must speak the truth about the role \nplayed by the government of Burkina Faso, the government of Gambia, and \nthe others involved in the arms trade in the region.\n  Mr. President, these issues do matter. I have looked into the faces \nof amputees, refugees, widows and widowers and orphans. I have seen the \ntragic consequences of the near total disruption of a society--the \nmalnourishment, the disillusionment, the desperation. Some people are \ngetting rich as a result of this misery. I have heard the people of \nneighboring countries speak of their fears for the region's future. I \nimplore this body and this Administration to take the steps I have \ndescribed. It is in our interest and it is right. And if we fail to do \nso, I fear that the terrible crisis will only get worse.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am going to be joined shortly by my \nfriend from Texas. In the meantime, I want to comment for a moment on \nthe statement of the Senator from New Mexico on energy. We need to take \na long look at where we are with respect to energy. The Vice President \nwith his working group is putting together a national policy on energy, \nas are many groups. We have an oil and gas forum, which I cochair. We \nwill be taking a look at where we want to be on energy and energy \nproduction in this country over a period of time.\n\n[[Page S1923]]\n\n  We have not had an energy policy in the United States, I am sorry to \nsay, for the last 8 years. As a result, we did not look at what the \ndemand was going to be, where the supply was going to be, and, indeed, \nhave found ourselves depending almost 60 percent on imported oil, \ndepending on foreign countries and OPEC to manage that. So we need to \ntake a long look.\n  I was pleased with what the Senator from New Mexico had to say about \ndiversity. We need not only to take a look at our need to increase \ndomestic production in oil and gas, but we also need to look at \ndiversity, to where we can continue to use coal. You may have noticed \non his chart that coal now produces over 50 percent of our electric \nenergy. We need to do some research with respect to air quality so coal \nbecomes even more useful. We need also to look at coal and its \nenrichment, getting the Btu's out of low-sulfur coal so transportation \ncosts will not be so high.\n  Nuclear, I am sure, has a role in our future as a very clean and very \neconomical source of electric energy. However, before we do that, we \nare going to have to solve the question of the storage of nuclear \nwaste, or begin to use it differently, as they do in some other \ncountries, recycling the waste that is there.\n  We have great opportunities to do these things. We also need, along \nwith this, of course, to take a look at conservation to make sure we \nare using all the conservation methods available to us. Certainly we \nare not now. We have to be careful about doing the kinds of things that \nwere done in California, to seek to deregulate part of an industry--in \nthis case electric energy--however keeping caps on the retail part. \nObviously, you are going to have increased usage and reduced \nproduction, which is the case they have now.\n  It is really a test for us at this time. One of the issues is going \nto be the accessibility to public lands. Most of the States where gas \nand oil is produced in any volume are public land States, where 50 \npercent to 87 percent of the State belongs to the Federal Government. \nMuch of those lands have been unavailable for exploration and \nproduction.\n  We need to get away from the idea that the multiple use of lands \nmeans you are going to ruin the environment or, on the other hand, that \nwe need to do whatever we need to do and we do not care about the \nenvironment. Those are not the two choices. The choice we have is to \nhave multiple use of our lands, to preserve the environment and to have \naccess to those lands as well. We can do that, and we have proven that \nit can, indeed, be done.\n  That is one of the real challenges before us during this Congress, \nalthough, of course, Congress only has a portion of involvement--it is \nreally the private sector that will do most of it.\n\n  One of the most encouraging things is Vice President Cheney and his \nworking group have brought in the other agencies. Too often we think \nabout the Department of Energy being the sole source of involvement \nwith respect to energy, and that is not the case. The Department of the \nInterior is certainly just as important, in many cases more important \nregarding where we go, as well as the EPA--all these are a real part of \nit.\n  One of the difficulties, of course, in addition to the supply, is the \ntransportation. Whether we have an opportunity to have pipelines to \nmove natural gas from Wyoming to California--a tough job, of course--\nwhether we have a pipeline that economically can move gas from Alaska \ndown to the continental United States, those are some of the things \nwith which we are faced. In the case of California, people were not \nexcited about having electric transmission lines and therefore it was \nvery difficult and time consuming to get the rights-of-way to do these \nthings.\n  We have to take a look at all of those issues to bring back domestic \nproduction and be able to support our economy with electric and other \nkinds of energy.\n  It is going to be one of the challenges. The Senator from Alaska, \nchairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has introduced \na rather broad bill that deals with many parts of the energy problem. I \nam pleased to be a sponsor of that bill. Obviously, it will create a \ngreat deal of debate and discussion because it has all those items in \nit, but we need to move. We need to have a policy that will encourage \nproduction. But I say again, not only should we be looking at \nproduction but we should be looking at opportunities to, indeed, \nconserve and find efficient ways to use it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/07/senate-section/article/S1923-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1923]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE BUDGET AND TAX RELIEF\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. We are going to debate lots of issues. We went on an \nissue yesterday which was passed. We are going to go to bankruptcy \ntoday. We will talk about a lot of issues. But the real issue we need \nto work towards and keep in mind, it seems to me, is the budget and the \ntax relief issue we have and that the President has promised and that \nwe, I hope, will be able to support. We will be looking at spending, \nbudgets, taxes, and the size of tax relief. It is going to be one of \nthe most important things we do.\n  One important aspect of it is the American people are suffering under \na record level of taxation, which is 20.6 percent of the gross national \nproduct. They deserve some relief. The individual tax burden has \ndoubled from where it was. We really need to take a long look and \nencourage the private sector that has people who are paying excessive \namounts of taxes to have those taxes returned and at the same time pay \ndown the debt and be able to have a budget that pays for the increases \nwe are looking for in education and national security with the \nmilitary, as well as have some reserves. The President's plan does all \nof those things. It puts a limit on spending, which we very badly need.\n  It takes care of paying down the debt. That can be paid down between \nnow and 2011. It has a reserve for the kinds of things that come up \nunexpectedly and at the same time returns $1.6 trillion in overpaid \ntaxes to those people who in fact have paid the dollars.\n  We have a lot of important things to look forward to in this \nCongress. I am glad we are now beginning to get to where we are able to \ndeal with these issues. I think yesterday was an example of that. I am \ncertain we will move forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Wyoming for \ntalking about taxes because I don't think we can talk about tax relief \nenough. There is no question but that we have the chance of a lifetime \nto bring tax relief to every working American and also give increased \nbenefits to earned-income tax credit recipients. It is in everyone's \nbest interest that we do this.\n  I thank my colleague from Wyoming for starting this debate and \nstarting the process of educating everyone about the importance of this \ntax relief.\n  Let me say that when we talk about the tax relief package, we really \nare talking about good stewardship of our tax dollars. We have a \nprojected $5.6 trillion surplus. We have a bright red line between the \nSocial Security surplus and income tax withholding surplus. We are \ntaking half of the $5.6 trillion--roughly $3 trillion--that is in \nSocial Security surplus, and we are going to leave it intact in a \nlockbox so that Social Security will be totally within itself, solid \nand firm.\n  The other half of the $5.6 trillion--the $2.6 trillion or so--is the \nincome tax withholding surplus. That is very different from people who \nare paying into Social Security and expect that money to go to Social \nSecurity. But people who are sending $2.6 trillion in income taxes \nabove and beyond what government reasonably needs to operate should \nhave some relief. That is money coming right out of the pocket of every \nAmerican and going to Washington which we know it does not need for \nlegitimate government expenditures.\n  It is our responsibility to be careful how we spend taxpayer dollars. \nWith that $2.6 trillion surplus in income tax withholding, we have a \nproposal that takes $1.6 trillion and gives it back to the people so \nthey don't even have to send it to Washington. We have $1 trillion \nremaining. That $1 trillion is going to be for the added expenditures \nthat we know we need in priority areas to do the right thing.\n\n[[Page S1924]]\n\n  So what are the priority areas?\n  We are going to spend more for public education because we know \npublic education is the foundation of our freedom and our democracy. If \nwe allow public education to fail, or not produce, then we are taking \naway the strength that has been the foundation of our Nation.\n  We are going to spend more on public education.\n  No. 2. We are going to spend more on national defense.\n  Our national security forces have been deteriorating. We do not have \na solid plan to upgrade the quality of life for those serving in our \nmilitary. These are people who are pledging their lives to protect our \nfreedom. We owe them a quality of life that allows them to do their \njob. We are going to increase their housing quality and health care \nquality. We are going to increase salaries. We are going to increase \neducation for military children, spouses, and military personnel. All \nof these will add to the quality of life.\n  We are going to invest in the technological advances that will keep \nus ahead of any adversary we might have and also make sure that our \nallies are strong.\n  We are going to increase spending in national defense.\n  No. 3. We must address the prescription drug issue in this country.\n  Ten years ago, you would have to go in the hospital and have surgery \nfor an ailment that today can be treated with prescription drugs. \nHospital stays are much shorter. Sometimes it is just an office visit \nbecause prescription drugs are so much more effective. They are also \nmore expensive. We need to treat prescription drugs as one of the \nmainstays of quality health care, just as hospital stays and surgery \nused to be the avenue for treatment of a major problem.\n  We have to deal with this big expense and this big part of health \ncare that has changed our quality of life in America, but which many \npeople cannot afford or they have to make such tough choices that it \njust isn't right. People on fixed incomes cannot afford a $400-a-month \nprescription drug bill. Some people are making other kinds of choices. \nWe are going to have to have more benefits and more options for \nprescription drug help for people who need it.\n  These are the areas where we want the ability to have added income, \nto make sure we can do the job we are expected to do. I certainly think \n$1 trillion should be plenty if we are running the Government \nefficiently and making sure taxpayer dollars are not being wasted or \nmisused.\n  I think the tax relief plan is much more than tax relief. It is good \nstewardship of your taxpayer dollars and my taxpayer dollars. It is a \nbalanced approach that pays down the debt, protects Social Security, \nand adds spending in the priority areas where we must add spending. And \nit lets people keep more of the money they earn in their own \npocketbooks because we believe they can make better decisions for their \nfamilies than someone in Washington, DC, can do.\n  What is in the marriage penalty relief? What is in the tax bracket \nlowering? What is in the inheritance tax relief?\n  The biggest part of the tax cut is an across-the-board lowering of \neach tax bracket, so if you pay in the 15-percent bracket today, you \nwill either pay no taxes at all or you will go to a 10-percent level. \nThe most benefit of this tax relief is at that level. And then you go \nto a 15-percent bracket, a 25-percent bracket, and a 33-percent \nbracket. So everyone gets a lowering of their bracket.\n  We believe no one should pay more than 33 percent of their income in \nFederal taxes. That is a fair tax. It could be lower, but at least that \nis a fair cap on taxes for any individual. That is the biggest part of \nthe tax cut plan.\n  It will also increase the earned-income tax credit for people who are \nnot paying taxes at all but get a refund because we want them to have \nthe incentive to work rather than be on welfare. This is a good \nincentive, and it works.\n  In essence, the earned-income tax credit is a rebate of the payroll \ntax. For people who do not pay income taxes but they do pay payroll \ntaxes, they are going to get a bigger rebate. So that is the big part.\n  The next part of this tax relief plan is relief from the marriage \npenalty tax. Why on Earth should two single people, earning the incomes \nthey earn, who get married, be thrown into a higher bracket and pay \nmore in taxes just because they got married--not because they got a pay \nraise but because they got married? That is wrong. It is a wrong \nincentive in this country, and it was never meant to be that way. This \nwas a quirk in the Tax Code, and we must fix it.\n  You should not have to pay a marriage penalty. Today--and this is in \nmy legislation I have introduced--if you take the standard deduction, \nyou do not get the standard deduction if you get married. You do not \nget it doubled. In fact, the standard deduction is $4,550 for a single \nperson. For a married couple, it is $7,600. Under my bill, the standard \ndeduction for married couples will increase by $1,500 to $9,100, which \nis double the single standard deduction. So if you do not itemize and \nyou take the standard deduction, we want you to have double the single \nrate when you get married.\n  Secondly, we want to widen every bracket so you will not have to pay \nmore in income taxes because you go into a higher bracket just because \nyou combined incomes. We want to widen the brackets so your combined \nincome will be taxed at the same rate as if you were single making two \nincomes that added up to that. So we are going to try to widen the \nbrackets.\n  And third, on the earned-income tax credit, we will increase the \nadjustment on the income levels and make the earned-income tax credit \nalso come in at the same level as if they were two single people rather \nthan penalizing people who get the earned-income tax credit when they \nget married.\n  It is very important that we relieve the pressure on 21 million \nAmerican couples who pay the marriage penalty tax. This is not right, \nand we are going to change it. That is another major part of the tax \nrelief bill that will be before us in the coming weeks.\n  The third area is doing away with the death tax. There is no reason \nfor someone to have to sell a family farm, a ranch, or a small business \nin order to pay taxes to the Federal Government. We must take the lid \noff the death tax.\n  The people of America understand the death tax as being unfair. Even \nif they are not going to have to pay the death tax or their heirs will \nnot have to pay the death tax, they still have a fundamental sense of \nfairness that it is wrong to tax money that has already been taxed when \nit was earned and when it was invested. There is a sense of fairness in \nthe American people.\n\n  There is also a sense of hope. Every parent hopes that his or her \nchild is going to do better than they have done. So they want their \nchildren to have that opportunity to be able to keep the family \nbusiness and to do better. And they most certainly do not want a family \nbusiness to be sold off to pay taxes because they know that not only \naffects their own families but the jobs of the people who work for a \nfamily-owned business.\n  Fifty percent of the family-owned businesses in this country do not \nmake it to the second generation, largely because of the inheritance \ntax. Eighty percent do not make it into the third generation.\n  Do we want to be a country that does not have family-owned \nbusinesses? Do we want everything to be a big international \nconglomerate? I do not think so. I think we want the family farm to \nsucceed in this country because we know that family farmers are \ncontributing citizens to the community; they are contributing to the \nagricultural greatness of this country; and they are a stability for \nour country to make sure that we control our own resources.\n  I do not want a big international conglomerate to take the place of \nthe family farm in this country. And that is what death taxes produce. \nIt is in our interest that we have small family-owned hardware stores. \nIt is in our interest that we have small family-owned service companies \nthat contribute to a community.\n  I hope we will eliminate the death tax, or at least modify it greatly \nso that any reasonable description of a family-owned business would be \ncovered, so that there will not have to be a sale of assets that would \nbreak up that business, that farm, or that ranch.\n  The fourth major area of our tax relief plan is to double the child \ntax credit. Whether you have child care or not,\n\n[[Page S1925]]\n\nwe believe you should have more than the $500-per-child tax credit \nbecause we know how much it costs to raise a family. So we would double \nthat to $1,000 per child.\n  A $1,000-per-child tax credit isn't nearly enough to offset the costs \nof raising children. We know that. But we do not have children to get \ntax credits; we have children because we love them and we want them to \nbe strong, to continue the great heritage that we have in this country. \nBut we should give tax relief that is focused on helping families raise \ntheir children in as conducive an environment as we can possibly give \nthem.\n  That is our tax relief plan. It is our stewardship of tax dollars to \ngive more money back to the people who earn it, and to pay down the \ndebt at the most rapid rate that we possibly can. Over 10 years we will \nhave paid down the debt to the absolute minimum. And to help people \nwith prescription drug benefits, to rebuild our national defenses, and \nto make bigger investments in public education, we are saving $1 \ntrillion back from the surplus. And last, and most important, we are \nkeeping Social Security totally intact. That is good stewardship of our \ntax dollars.\n  I am proud to support a tax relief plan that saves Social Security, \nand keeps it secure, that adds spending where we need it, and makes \nabsolutely sure that we give back to the people who earn it more of the \ntax dollars they deserve to keep in their pocketbooks, rather than \nsending it to Washington for decisions to be made that they will \nprobably never realize.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/07/senate-section/article/S1925-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I know this bill has cleared \nthe Senate on at least three different occasions, as I recall, and with \nlarge majorities. I know a number of people have amendments they would \nlike to offer.\n  As a courtesy to the Members who had concerns about the legislation, \nMajority Leader Lott allowed the bill to go to the Judiciary Committee. \nWe had amendments and debate there for a good bit of time. It is now on \nthe floor. It is appropriate for amendments that are to be offered to \nbe offered now.\n  I urge my fellow Senators who have amendments they would like to \noffer to this legislation to bring them to the floor. This is the time \nthat has been set aside and announced for that purpose. It certainly \nwould not be courteous to the work of this body if people have \namendments and don't take advantage of the chance to bring them \nforward.\n  I see the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, has \narrived. Perhaps he will have some opening remarks at this time. If he \ndoes, I would be pleased to yield to Senator Hatch. Senator Grassley \nhad asked that I start this off. I believe we have a good piece of \nlegislation that has been examined. Every jot and tittle of it has been \nlooked at. Compromises and improvements have been undertaken time and \nagain. I believe the act will withstand scrutiny. It will eliminate a \nnumber of the abuses that have been occurring under the new modern-\nstyle bankruptcy.\n  The time has come, and I am confident that as this debate goes \nforward, this bill will pass and become law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am happy to be here and finally get this \nbankruptcy bill underway. We have done it year after year after year. \nIt certainly is time to pass this bill. I hope there won't be any \nfrivolous amendments or amendments trying to kill the bill or \namendments trying to make points rather than solve the problems we have \nregarding bankruptcy.\n  As I have indicated before, the bankruptcy reform legislation we are \nconsidering today, is the same legislative language that was contained \nin the conference report passed by the Senate in December by a vote of \n70-28. In addition, the language was marked up in the Judiciary \nCommittee, and has added several provisions sought by Democratic \nmembers of the committee.\n  I am asking that Members recognize and respect the compromises and \nagreements that have already been made with respect to this bill. While \nI do not believe that further amendments are necessary, I recognize \nthat it is the right of any Member to offer amendments. It is my \nsincere hope that Members will exercise reasonableness in the offering \nof any amendments.\n  This being said, If Members do have amendments, I ask them to come \ndown and offer them now, so that we can avoid any further undue delays \nand move forward.\n  While we are waiting for them, let me talk about the bankruptcy \nreform proconsumer provisions. This bill requires extensive new \ndisclosures by creditors in the area of reaffirmations and more \njudicial oversight of reaffirmations to protect people from being \npressured into agreements against their interests.\n  It includes a debtor's bill of rights with new consumer protections \nto prevent the bankruptcy mills from preying upon those who are \nuninformed of their legal rights and needlessly pushing them into \nbankruptcy.\n  It includes new consumer protections under the Truth in Lending Act, \nsuch as new required disclosures regarding minimum monthly payments and \nintroductory rates for credit cards. It protects consumers from \nunscrupulous creditors with new penalties on creditors who refuse to \nnegotiate reasonable payment schedules outside of bankruptcy.\n  It provides penalties on creditors who fail to properly credit plan \npayments in bankruptcy. It includes credit counseling programs to help \npeople avoid--we go that far--the cycle of indebtedness. It provides \nfor protection of educational savings accounts, and it gives equal \nprotection for retirement savings in bankruptcy.\n  S. 420 contains improvements over current law for women and children. \nWe have heard people complain that the bankruptcy laws do not take care \nof women and children. We have tried to do that in this bill, and we \nhave accomplished it.\n  It gives child support first priority status, something that has not \nexisted up until now. Domestic support obligations are moved from \nseventh in line to first priority status in bankruptcy, meaning they \nwill be paid ahead of lawyers and other special interests. It includes \na key provision that makes staying current on child support a condition \nof getting a discharge in bankruptcy. It makes debt discharge in \nbankruptcy conditional upon full payment of past due child support and \nalimony.\n  It makes domestic support obligations automatically nondischargeable \nwithout the costs of litigation. It prevents bankruptcy from holding up \nchild custody, visitation, and domestic violence cases. It helps \neliminate administrative roadblocks in the current system so kids can \nget the support they need. These are all valuable additions and changes \nin the bankruptcy laws that this particular bill makes. It is in the \nbest interests of women and children to pass this bill.\n  That is not all. Let me cite a few more improvements over current law \nfor women and children. The bill makes the payment of child support \narrears a condition of plan confirmation. It provides better notice and \nmore information for easier child support collection. It provides help \nin tracking down deadbeats. It allows for claims against a deadbeat \nparent's property. It allows for payment of child support with interest \nby those with means. It facilitates wage withholding to collect child \nsupport from deadbeat parents.\n  All of that is critical. All of that amounts to needed changes in the \nbankruptcy laws that we have worked very hard to bring about.\n\n[[Page S1926]]\n\n  As I have said before, the compromise bill we passed 70-28 was an \neffective compromise among Democrats and Republicans, among \nconservatives and liberals and independents. It was a bill that \nbasically brought almost everybody into the picture. Even after having \ndone that, having introduced that bill this year in the committee, we \nmade some additional compromises to satisfy our colleagues on the other \nside. Those compromises were difficult to make, but we have made them. \nWe have made every effort to try and bring as many people on to this \nbill as we possibly can and to try and resolve the various conflicts \nand difficulties that have existed in the past.\n  It is a very good bill. It is time we pass it. I hope people will \ncome and bring their amendments to the floor so we can begin the \namendment process and get this bill passed.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 13\n\n     (Purpose: To provide priority in bankruptcy to small business \n                               creditors)\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate last night voted for a \nresolution of disapproval of the new ergonomics regulations. Supporters \nof the resolution said the ergonomics rules would hurt small businesses \nand would cost millions in revenues each year. In fact, some claimed it \nwould actually force them out of business.\n  I disagreed with that analysis of the ergonomics rule, but I do agree \nwith the underlying principle that the Senate should be passing \nlegislation to foster small businesses across the country. I am going \nto offer an amendment to protect small business creditors from losing \nout in the bankruptcy reform process. I assume all those who are \nspeaking strongly in favor of small businesses would be supportive of \nthis.\n  The bankruptcy bill today puts the multibillion-dollar credit card \ncompanies ahead of the hard-working small business people from Utah, \nAlabama, Nevada, Kentucky, or Vermont in collecting outstanding debt \nfrom those who file for bankruptcy. My amendment corrects that \ninjustice by giving small business creditors a priority over larger \nbusinesses when it comes to distribution of the bankruptcy estate. The \namendment provides a small business creditor has priority over the \nlarger for-profit business creditor.\n  My amendment does not affect the bill's provision giving top priority \nin bankruptcy distribution to child support and alimony payments, but \nwe should be helping small businesses navigate through the often \ncomplex and confusing bankruptcy process. Small businesses cannot \nafford the high-priced bankruptcy lawyers corporate giants can afford. \nSmall business creditors need some kind of priority just to keep even \nwith the big companies. Small businesses are the backbone of this \nNation's economy.\n\n  Take a look at this chart. The total number of businesses nationwide \nis 5,541,918. Of those 5.5 million businesses, almost 5 million are \nsmall businesses, or 90 percent of all businesses in this country are \nsmall businesses.\n  Small business, for the purpose of this report, incidentally, is \ndefined as a company with 25 or fewer full-time employees. That is the \nsame definition of small business used in my amendment, which is very \nsimilar to the Leahy Press and Printing business in Montpelier, VT.\n  In full disclosure, my family sold that business when my parents \nretired. It is gone. This was a small printing business. We actually \nlived in the front of the store. Our house was in the front. The \nprinting business was in the back, but it was typical of small \nbusinesses that are the backbone of my own State of Vermont.\n  In Vermont, we have 19,000 businesses. Almost 17,000 of them are \nsmall businesses, again following the national model.\n  In virtually every State, 90 percent of the businesses are small. The \nbill, as it is written, will help the huge multibillion-dollar credit \ncard companies, and they have far more of a priority than these small \nmom-and-pop stores.\n  We can do right. It is not fair for us to ask these small businesses, \nagain, to hand over everything they have to the lawyers and accountants \nof these huge megabusinesses when it comes to collecting outstanding \ndebt. Large credit card corporations have thousands of employees. They \nrake in billions of dollars of profit every year. Small businesses \nstruggle every day just to pay their bills and their employees' \nsalaries.\n  Let us put these small businesses on an equal footing with big \nbusinesses by adopting the Leahy small business amendment.\n  In that regard, I appreciate what our distinguished majority leader, \nSenator Lott, said on the floor last Wednesday. He spoke about the \nhardships his parents suffered when they tried to run a small business. \nHis parents ran a furniture business, and most of the business was done \non credit. One of the reasons they were forced to leave that business \nwas that some people just would not pay their bills, according to the \nmajority leader.\n  I mentioned earlier Leahy Press in Montpelier. My parents did an \nawful lot of business on credit. I know they faced some of the same \nproblems the majority leader's parents did. I have always remembered \nthat. It is not easy for a small business owner to make an honest \nliving, whether during our parents' time or today, and it is not fair \nnow to allow large corporate giants to grab their share first in this \nbankruptcy bill ahead of hard-working small businesspeople.\n  Many of the most controversial proposals in this bankruptcy bill are \nto benefit the credit card industry and then to use taxpayer money to \nhelp them support their debt collection of billions of dollars, but \nthey also want tax dollars to help them in the collection of their \ndebts.\n  Business Week recently reported that Dean Witter estimated this bill \nwould boost the earnings of credit card companies by 5 percent a year. \nIn other words, we as taxpayers would increase the credit card \ncompanies' business by 5 percent. One credit card company alone, MBNA, \nwill make a net profit of $75 million a year more if we, on behalf of \nthe taxpayers in this country, pass this bill as it is written.\n  Across the industry, credit card company after credit card company \nwill reap millions of dollars in profits because of the changes this \nbill makes to the bankruptcy code.\n  I understand credit card companies are worried about collecting debts \nbecause their credit extended is typically unsecured, especially when \nthey send credit cards, in some instances, to somebody's dog--I know of \nthat happening--or send a credit card to someone's 4-year-old child \nwith an unsecured credit line.\n  If one were cynical, one might say that some of this problem is of \ntheir own doing, but we should understand most small businesses face \nthis peril. It is not fair to carve out a special exemption for the \nmultibillion-dollar credit card companies but leave the small \nbusinesses of Provo, UT, or Middlesex, VT, to fend for themselves. That \nis why I am offering this amendment to put small business owners at \nleast on an equal footing with large credit card companies.\n  Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 13.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title IV, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 446. PRIORITY FOR SMALL BUSINESS CREDITORS.\n\n       (a) Chapter 7.--Section 726(b) of title II, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``(b)'';\n       (2) by striking ``paragraph, except that in a'' and \n     inserting the following: ``paragraph, except that--\n       ``(A) in a''; and\n       (3) by striking the period at the end and inserting the \n     following: ``; and\n       ``(B) with respect to each such paragraph, a claim of a \n     small business has priority over a claim of a creditor that \n     is a for-profit business but is not a small business.\n       ``(2) In this subsection--\n\n[[Page S1927]]\n\n       ``(A) the term `small business' means an unincorporated \n     business, partnership, corporation, association, or \n     organization that--\n       ``(i) has fewer than 25 full-time employees, as determined \n     on the date on which the motion is filed; and\n       ``(ii) is engaged in commercial or business activity; and\n       ``(B) the number of employees of a wholly owned subsidiary \n     of a corporation includes the employees of--\n       ``(i) a parent corporation; and\n       ``(ii) any other subsidiary corporation of the parent \n     corporation.''.\n       (b) Chapter 12.--Section 1222 of title 11, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), as amended by section 213 of this \n     Act, by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(5) provide that no distribution shall be made on a \n     nonpriority unsecured claim of a for-profit business that is \n     not a small business until the claims of creditors that are \n     small businesses have been paid in full.''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(e) For purposes of subsection (a)(5)--\n       ``(1) the term `small business' means an unincorporated \n     business, partnership, corporation, association, or \n     organization that--\n       ``(A) has fewer than 25 full-time employees, as determined \n     on the date on which the motion is filed; and\n       ``(B) is engaged in commercial or business activity; and\n       ``(2) the number of employees of a wholly owned subsidiary \n     of a corporation includes the employees of--\n       ``(A) a parent corporation; and\n       ``(B) any other subsidiary corporation of the parent \n     corporation.''.\n       (c) Chapter 13.--Section 1322(a) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), as amended by section 213 of this \n     Act, by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(5) provide that no distribution shall be made on a \n     nonpriority unsecured claim of a for-profit business that is \n     not a small business until the claims of creditors that are \n     small businesses have been paid in full.''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(f) For purposes of subsection (a)(5)--\n       ``(1) the term `small business' means an unincorporated \n     business, partnership, corporation, association, or \n     organization that--\n       ``(A) has fewer than 25 full-time employees, as determined \n     on the date on which the motion is filed; and\n       ``(B) is engaged in commercial or business activity; and\n       ``(2) the number of employees of a wholly owned subsidiary \n     of a corporation includes the employees of--\n       ``(A) a parent corporation; and\n       ``(B) any other subsidiary corporation of the parent \n     corporation.''.\n       On page 67, line 4, strike ``inserting `; and' '' and \n     insert ``inserting a semicolon''.\n       On page 67, line 13, strike the period and insert ``; \n     and''.\n       On page 69, line 13, strike ``inserting `; and' '' and \n     insert ``inserting a semicolon''.\n       On page 69, line 22, strike the period and insert ``; \n     and''.\n       Amend the table of contents accordingly.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we owe the millions of small business \nowners across America, who are the backbone of our economy, adequate \nprotection from unforeseen bankruptcy losses. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Leahy small business amendment to provide small business \ncreditors with a simple priority in bankruptcy proceedings. They \ndeserve it.\n  Remember what this does: It gives small business creditors priority \nover larger for-profit business creditors in the order of distribution \nunder chapters 11, 12, and 13 of the bankruptcy code. It defines small \nbusiness as any business with 25 or fewer full-time employees. That \nsame definition of small business is already used in the bill for small \nbusiness creditors. It does not affect the bill's provisions giving top \npriority in bankruptcy distributions to child support and alimony \npayments.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have an amendment on which we are \nprepared to vote. I mention this only because I have heard constantly \non the other side how anxious they are to move this bill forward. I \nbrought this amendment up, proposed it, and am ready to go to vote all \nwithin 7 or 8 minutes. I don't want anyone to think we are trying to \nhold anything up. Frankly, I think this whole bill would have been \nfinished this afternoon if we had not been interrupted for the \nergonomics.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we are looking at the amendment. It is the \nfirst time I have seen it. We will look at it and see if this is an \namendment we can support. We would like to continue to call up \namendments and stack them.\n  There is Habitat for Humanity and a funeral today, but we will stack \nthe votes and this will be the first vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was not aware of the funeral.\n  Perhaps this is a plea the Senator from Utah would join; that if \nother Senators from both sides have amendments that are available, we \nurge them to get down here. The Senator from Utah and I will work to \nthe extent that people are here, probably go back and forth with \namendments and start voting soon.\n  On our side of the aisle, I urge all Democrats who have amendments to \nget to the floor, show them to the Republican side and this side, and \nstart moving on amendments.\n  Mr. HATCH. I agree with the Senator. We will stack the amendments \nuntil we can have a reasonable chance of getting Members here to vote. \nWe would like to move ahead on amendments and vote on them later today.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we now have an amendment that is pending on \nwhich the yeas and nays have been ordered. I know there is some urgency \nin moving this bill along. The Senator from Utah and the Senator from \nVermont have worked on this bill for years.\n  I know there are a couple of Senators who have gone to a funeral; the \nGovernor of their State died. I think we have to start moving \nlegislation. If going to a funeral is not an excuse for missing a vote, \nthere isn't much we can do to make an excuse for missing it. I don't \nthink we have to have everybody here to have a vote. If we are going to \nmove this legislation along, my experience dictates the way to get it \nmoving is you have to have something voted on. It seems to stimulate \ninterest in legislation.\n  I hope the leadership will allow us to move forward and vote on this \namendment. We can place in the Record that the Senators are not here, \nthat they are attending a funeral. If that were ever used against them \nin an adversarial way in a campaign, that it was wrong to miss votes to \ngo to a funeral, I would be happy to say that was wrong--and it would \nnot be done anyway.\n  I hope we can move this legislation along by voting on this \namendment. We have Senators who, I understand, are coming over to offer \nother amendments, but I repeat, my experience indicates the way to move \nlegislation is to start voting on amendments. Probably by the time this \nis over we will have 15 or 20 amendments offered and we will have to \nvote on them. The longer we wait, the more time we will take.\n  As I indicated when we opened business in the Senate this morning, we \nhave a very important meeting where Senators and House Members are \ntraveling together to Colombia where we appropriated lots of money. \nThese are members of the Intelligence Committee. They have reasons for \ngoing that are within the confines of the Intelligence Committee--I \ndon't know why they are going. But there are other things that will \nhold up this legislation.\n  I say to my friend from Utah, I hope we can get permission to go \nahead and start voting on this legislation. The fact that there are two \nSenators who have a valid excuse--they are attending a funeral for one \nof their colleagues who died, the Governor of the State--this \namendment, while an important piece of legislation, is not going to be \ndetermined by these two Senators who are not here today. I hope we do \nnot have a requirement in the Senate that every Senator has to be here \nto be able to vote on amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield, I do not disagree with my good \nfriend and colleague from Nevada. I think we need to find out who is \nhere. We know a lot of Senators are working in the Habitat for Humanity \nSenate home they are building, and I surely have to get some time for \nthat. We also will try\n\n[[Page S1928]]\n\nto be fair to our colleagues who had to be necessarily absent to go to \na funeral.\n  On the other hand, we do have one amendment up. We are prepared to \nvote on that. I think we probably will before the afternoon is up. We \nshould stack the other amendments. I am requesting that those who have \namendments get here and let's argue the amendments and then stack them \nand we will vote at the earliest convenience, and hopefully we will be \nable to move this bill forward.\n\n  Mr. President, let's get over here and offer our amendments, debate \nthem, and do the orderly legislative process. Then we will vote at our \nearliest possible convenience. We are working on just when those votes \nwill start because of the inconveniences to a wide variety of Senators \nright now. We will try to start those votes as soon as we can, but we \ncan stack them and debate them right now and not waste this time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I do request Senators get over here. As far \nas I know, there may be one or two amendments on this side. Most of the \namendments are on the Democrat side. We can move this quickly if they \nwill get here and offer their amendments.\n  I am requesting Republicans, if there are any Republican amendments--\nI am only aware of one on the Republican side. I am aware of probably \n27 on the Democratic side. So I am requesting Republicans and \nDemocrats, if they have amendments, to get over here and let's get it \ndone. But I only know of one on this side.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is right; there are a number of amendments to \nbe offered on this side. Senator Wellstone has five amendments, maybe \nmore. He is trying to get here. He is in an Education markup. He told \nus this last night.\n  Mr. HATCH. I understand he is at a markup--here he is.\n  Mr. REID. I say the same thing the Senator from Utah says. We need to \nmove this along. I see my friend from Minnesota has arrived. I will \nsuggest the absence of a quorum----\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will withhold, I appreciate the Senator's \ncomments. I note the presence of the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota. As he prepares to offer his amendments, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum to give him a little bit of time to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I apologize to the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, my friend from Utah, Senator Hatch, for delaying \nmy arrival. We have a markup in the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions on the pension education bill. I have a number of \namendments. That is the reason I did not come earlier. I am going to \nlay down an amendment in a moment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, we should lay \nthe Leahy amendment aside so the Senator may call up his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I also know Senator Dodd wants to speak \non this amendment, and other colleagues may want to speak as well.\n  This amendment says if you file for bankruptcy because of medical \nbills, none of the provisions of this bill will affect you. This is a \nvery simple and straightforward amendment.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 14\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 14.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 14) is as follows:\n\n         (Purpose: To create an exemption for certain debtors)\n\n       On page 441, after line 2, add the following:\n       (c) Exemptions.--\n       (1) In general.--This Act and the amendments made by this \n     Act do not apply to any debtor that can demonstrate to the \n     satisfaction of the court that the reason for the filing was \n     a result of debts incurred through medical expenses, as \n     defined in section 213(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986, unless the debtor elects to make a provision of this \n     Act or an amendment made by this Act applicable to that \n     debtor.\n       (2) Applicability.--Title 11, United States Code, as in \n     effect on the day before the effective date of this Act and \n     the amendments made by this Act, shall apply to persons \n     referred to in paragraph (1) on and after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, unless the debtor elects otherwise in \n     accordance with paragraph (1).\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have been working with my colleague, \nSenator Dodd. I will not include him as an original cosponsor because I \nwant to hear from him. But I believe he will be down here debating this \namendment.\n  One of the reasons I started out with this amendment--I will need to \ngive this amendment some context--is that the proponents of this bill \nmade the argument that we need to have ``bankruptcy reform'' because \nyou have all of these people gaming the system. I will cite a number of \ndifferent independent studies, including the American Bankruptcy \nInstitute, that say it is maybe 3 percent of the people.\n  This amendment says, wait a minute; we know that about 50 percent of \nthe people who file for bankruptcy do so because of medical bills that \nput them under. They are not gaming the system, so some of the really \nonerous provisions of this legislation should not apply to these \nfamilies.\n  It will take me some time to give this amendment some context. I \nthink, if this amendment should pass, it would make this piece of \nlegislation a much better piece of legislation and far less harsh and \nfar less imbalanced.\n  Let my right away give this some context. I have, perhaps among \nSenators, been strong and vociferous in my opposition. I want to have \nan opportunity to lay out the reasons why. I will talk about this bill, \nand then we will go to the amendment.\n  First of all, I think this piece of legislation is--I know it sounds \nstrong. I hate to say it because I like my colleague from Utah so much. \nIt has nothing to do with a dislike or a like. It has to do with policy \nissue. I think it will have a very harsh effect on a whole lot of \npeople and a whole lot of families who are not able to file chapter 7, \nfor whom the bankruptcy law has been a major safety net--not just low-\nincome families but middle-income families as well.\n  I find it bitterly ironic that this legislation is coming on the \nheels of the vote for a resolution that overturned 10 years of work for \nan ergonomics rule to provide protection for working men and women, \nmainly women in the workplace, for what has become the most widespread \ndisabling injury--repetitive stress injury.\n  Yesterday we did that. The Senate did it with no amendment, with \nlimited debate; it overturned that rule.\n  Today we say if you are working--believe me, trust me. I will say it \non the floor of the Senate, and if my colleagues prove me wrong I will \nbe delighted to be proven wrong--there will not be a substantial rule \nor any substantial piece of legislation providing people with \nprotection at the workplace for repetitive stress injury for a long \ntime.\n  Basically what we are doing is saying OK, there won't be the \nprotection. Now you are injured. Now you are disabled. Now you are not \nable to work. Now you have earned little income. Now you come to file \nchapter 7 because you find yourself in very difficult circumstances, \nand you are not going to be able to do so.\n  But your home could be foreclosed. Your car could be repossessed. And \na lot of people are going to get ground into pieces, in my opinion.\n  It says a lot about the priorities of the majority party--that the \nfirst\n\n[[Page S1929]]\n\nmajor piece of legislation we bring to the floor is an unjust, \nimbalanced bankruptcy bill which is great for the big banks and it is \ngreat for the credit card companies. I am sure Senator Feingold will \nhave more to say about this.\n  There was a piece in Business Week, which is not exactly a bastion of \nliberalism about, I guess, one of the largest credit card issuers, MBNA \nCorporation. By the way, I cannot make the assumption that because \nSenator Hatch or anyone else disagrees with me they are doing it \nbecause of campaign contributions. I refuse to make the one-to-one \ncorrelation. You can't do it. But you can say at the institutional \nlevel some people have certainly a lot more clout than other people, \nand it just so happens that the people who find themselves in terrible \neconomic circumstances through no fault of their own--major medical \nbills, they have lost their jobs, or there has been a divorce--it is my \nview as a former political scientist and now a Senator for the State of \nMinnesota that those people do not have the same kind of clout that \nMBNA Corporation has, which, by the way, contributed $237,000 to \nPresident Bush, according to the Center for Responsible Politics; and \non the soft money side, MBNA chipped in nearly $600,000, about two-\nthirds going to the GOP, and the other part going to the Democratic \nParty. There are a whole lot of heavy hitters and well-connected folks \nwho are for this.\n  We have an unjust and imbalanced bankruptcy bill that is great for \nbig banks, and great for credit card companies, with hardly a word \nabout any accountability calling for these companies to stop their \npredatory lending practices.\n  I am going to have an amendment on payday loans. I hope we can adopt \nit. There is not a word about the ways in which they pump the credit on \nour kids in such an irresponsible way, but it is very harsh. When it \ncomes to many working families--low- and moderate-income families--it \nsays a lot about our priorities. It says that a special interest \nboondoggle, a bailout for big banks and credit card companies, is ahead \nof education, is ahead of raising the minimum wage, is ahead of \nproviding affordable drug coverage, prescription drug coverage for \nseniors, and is ahead of expanding health care coverage for people.\n  Remember, 50 percent of the people who file for bankruptcy do it \nbecause of major medical bills. But this bankruptcy bill --perfect for \nbig banks and credit card companies--comes ahead of all those \npriorities.\n  I believe what the majority party is trying to do is to sort of say: \nLook, here are the differences between President Clinton, who vetoed \nthis bill, and President Bush, who said he will sign it.\n  I hope the bill does not get to President Bush's desk in its present \nform. I think the odds of my succeeding with some of my amendments, and \nother Democrats and other Republicans perhaps succeeding with their \namendments, are not good. But we will try.\n  I say to my colleagues I welcome the contrast. I say what a \ndifference an election makes. The civil rights community, the labor \ncommunity, children, women, consumers, all have said this bill is too \nharsh and this bill is too one-sided. President Clinton stood up for \nthem. He stood up for ordinary people. I give him all the credit in the \nworld, as a Senator who has not always agreed with former President \nClinton. Indeed, the differences do make a difference.\n  I have no doubt that President Bush will sign this bill. In many \nways, the financial services industry, the credit card companies, are \npart of his constituency.\n  My question is, What about unemployed taconite workers in northeast \nMinnesota? My question is, What about struggling family farmers in \ngreater Minnesota? My question is, What about a lot of low- and \nmoderate- and middle-income people in Minnesota who, through no fault \nof their own--especially as the economy begins to take a turn \ndownward--may find themselves in these difficult circumstances?\n  I am interested in representing them. That is why I am out here \ntoday. That is why I am fighting this legislation. That is why I have \nbeen fighting this legislation for 2\\1/2\\ years or more.\n  Let me talk a little bit about the history of this legislation. First \nof all, this bill was negotiated by only a small group of Members, out \nof the public eye. Second of all, up until this year, it had never been \nhere in an amendable fashion. Third of all, until a hearing was held by \nthe Judiciary Committee on February 8, there had been no hearings on \nthis legislation. In fact, the Senate had not conducted its own hearing \non bankruptcy since 1998. Finally, we had a hearing.\n  So I see a compelling reason for some lengthy and important \nstatements and debate on this bill. The bill deserves scrutiny. It \nshould be held up to the light of day so that citizens can see what an \nill-made, misshapen attempt at reform this legislation is.\n  Colleagues in this body need to understand what bad legislation \nreally is, how terrible an impact a piece of legislation such as this \ncan have on America's most powerless families, and what a complete \ngiveaway this piece of legislation is to banks, to credit card \ncompanies, and to other lenders.\n\n  Bankruptcy ``reform'' is not being taken up out of any kind of \nurgency. Indeed, while the supporters of this bill have cited the high \nnumber of bankruptcy filings in recent years as a reason to move \nforward with this so-called reform, there has been a dramatic drop in \nthe last 2 years in the number of bankruptcies. Over the past 2 years, \nany pretense that this legislation is urgently needed has evaporated. \nThe number of bankruptcies has fallen steadily over the past year. \nCharge-offs on credit card debt are significantly down, and \ndelinquencies have fallen to the lowest level since 1995.\n  Proponents and opponents agree that nearly all debtors resort to \nbankruptcy not to game the system but, rather, as a desperate measure \nof economic survival, and that only a tiny minority of chapter 7 \nfilers--as few as 3 percent--could afford any debt repayment. But \nthrough this legislation, we are going to make it well nigh impossible \nfor families in our country to rebuild their economic lives.\n  But the true outrage is that now the bankruptcies are projected to \nincrease because of a slowing economy and high consumer debts that are \noverwhelming families. Proponents of this bill are using this as an \nexcuse to curb access to bankruptcy relief. Because there will be more \neconomic misery, because there will be more financial stress, because \nmore American families will succumb to their debts, the proponents of \nthis measure argue we should make it harder for them to get a fresh \nstart. Let me make that clear. That is what this is about.\n  Now the economy is going to turn down. We know there is high consumer \ndebt. We know there is going to be more people struggling. We know \nthere is going to be more financial distress. We know there is going to \nbe more economic misery. And the proponents of this bill are now \narguing that we need this measure to make it harder for these families \nin Minnesota and this country to get a fresh start. I reject that \nproposition. We are trying to address yesterday's headlines.\n  But I have already stated that this really shouldn't be any wonder. \nThe credit card industry wants this bill. They want to be able to \nprotect the risky investments they have made, and so the Senate does \ntheir bidding. They want to be able to pump credit out there. They want \nto be able to engage in irresponsible lending practices. They are not \nheld accountable at all. They want to make sure that people, in one way \nor another, are squeezed and squeezed and squeezed, so they can get as \nmuch money back as possible. This is a carte blanche blank check for \nthe credit card industry.\n  I have been proud to fight this bill. I am proud of the fact that it \nhas taken many years for this bill to get through, and still it is not \nthrough yet. I hope we will be able to stop it or make it significantly \nbetter.\n  Let me outline some of my reasons for opposing this bill, and then I \nwill move to our first amendment.\n  First of all, this legislation rests on faulty premises. The bill \naddresses a crisis that does not exist. Increased filings are being \nused as an excuse to harshly restrict bankruptcy protection, but \nfilings have actually fallen in the last 2 years.\n  In addition, the bill is based upon the myth that people feel no \nstigma; that they find it easy to declare bankruptcy, and there is \nwidespread fraud\n\n[[Page S1930]]\n\nand abuse. By the way, if you think there is widespread abuse, then you \nshould be all for the amendment I am going to offer which says when \npeople are going under because of medical bills, they should be exempt \nfrom the provisions of this legislation.\n  Two, abusive filers are a tiny minority. Bill proponents cite the \nneed to curb ``abusive filings'' as a reason to harshly restrict \nbankruptcy protection. But the American Bankruptcy Institute found that \nonly 3 percent--if my colleagues have other data, they can present it--\nonly 3 percent of chapter 7 filers could have paid back more of their \ndebts. Even bill supporters acknowledge that, at most, 10 to 13 percent \nof filers are abusive. Surely you would want to support this amendment \nthat says when people have to declare bankruptcy because of major \nmedical bills, they should be exempt because they could not be in any \nSenator's category of people who have been dishonest or have abused the \nsystem.\n  Three, the legislation falls heaviest on the most vulnerable. This \ntroubles me. The harsh restrictions in this bill will make bankruptcy \nless protective, more complicated and expensive to file. This will make \nit much more difficult for low- and moderate-income people to be able \nto effectively file. Unfortunately, the means test and safe harbor will \nnot be a shield from a majority of those provisions that have been \nwritten in such a way that they will capture many debtors who truly \nhave no ability to pay off any significant debt. As a result of this \nlegislation, they are going to be put under.\n\n  Four, the bankruptcy code is a critical safety net for America's \nmiddle class. Low- and moderate-income families, especially single \nparent families, are those who most need the fresh start that is \nprovided by bankruptcy protection. This bill will make it much more \ndifficult for people to get out from under the burden of crushing debt. \nThat should matter to us. I know these folks don't have a lot of clout. \nI know they don't lobby every day. I know they are among the most \nvulnerable citizens. I know they don't have a lot of income, but they \nshould matter.\n  Five--and this should bother all of my colleagues--the banking and \ncredit card industry gets a free ride. Why is there not more balance in \nthis bill? The bill, as drafted, gives a free ride to banks and credit \ncard companies that deserve much of the blame for the high number of \nbankruptcy filings because of their loose credit card standards.\n  Any of us who have children know the kind of stuff that gets sent to \nthem in the mail. Lenders should not be rewarded for reckless lending. \nThat is what we are doing in this bill. We are just giving them a blank \ncheck.\n  Six, this legislation may cause increased bankruptcies and defaults. \nSeveral economists have suggested that restricting access to bankruptcy \nprotection will actually increase the number of filings and defaults \nbecause banks will be more willing to lend money to marginal \ncandidates. Indeed, it is no coincidence that the recent surge of \nbankruptcy filings began immediately after the last major ``procreditor \nreforms'' were passed by Congress in 1984.\n  I say to the Senator from California: I have sent an amendment to the \ndesk which says we ought to go after people who are gaming the system, \nbut if a family is filing for bankruptcy, chapter 7, because of a major \nmedical bill, they should be exempt from the provisions of this \nlegislation. I am now putting this in a broader context.\n  I welcome discussion by any other Senators on the floor, and I do not \nintend to monopolize. It will take me some time to go through the \namendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will my friend yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me first assure my friend that I was not intending to \ntake any time. I want to thank him for his work on this issue. We know \nin this country one of our biggest problems is lack of health care and \nthe fact that the burden of disease sometimes falls on the family to an \namazing extent. If they are hit by hard times, it could well be because \nof these medical bills. People are driven into bankruptcy because of \nthat. Then to have the double horror of having that not be exempted \nfrom the eventual resolution would be a real disaster for people.\n  I thank the Senator not only for this amendment but for the many \namendments that I will be supporting that he will be introducing to \nmake this a bill that has at least a semblance of fairness.\n  Right now, it hurts people. I am really waiting with anticipation for \na moment when we do something that helps people. So far I haven't seen \none thing we have done to help people.\n  Yesterday, we repealed a measure that would have protected people in \nthe workplace from repetitive motion illness.\n  Does the Senator know when we are finally going to get something \ndone, such as an education bill, that helps people? I haven't seen \nanything to date that actually does.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I had said earlier that I find it \nbitterly ironic that on the heels of yesterday's action by the Senate, \nwhere in 10 hours we overturned 10 years of work to provide some \nprotection to the workforce--men and women, mainly women--for the most \nserious disabling injury right now, repetitive stress injury, we now \nturn to the first major piece of legislation in this 107th Congress, a \nbankruptcy bill which is so imbalanced and so harsh in its effect, \nespecially on middle income, low- and moderate-income people, many of \nwhom, again, are women and children. It speaks volumes about our \ndisordered priorities, which we will speak to.\n  I ask unanimous consent to go into a quorum call for 30 seconds, and \nthen I will regain the floor and go forward with the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have much more to say about the bill, \nbut I will get to the first amendment I want to introduce today, which \nI think goes to the heart of what is a fundamental problem with this \nlegislation. This legislation purports to go after abuse in the \nbankruptcy system, but it casts a wide net that captures all debtors \nwho file for bankruptcy, regardless of their circumstances. This is a \nsimple amendment. This is what it says. If you file for bankruptcy \nbecause of medical bills, none of the provisions of this bill will \naffect you.\n  I know Senator Dodd has been working on a very similar amendment, and \nhe and Senator Chafee have been working on an amendment. I think as the \ndebate goes forward, we will probably join forces.\n  The reason I introduce this amendment--and other Senators also are \ninterested in the same kind of amendment--is, in the vast majority of \ncases, the people who file for bankruptcy do it because of desperate \nfinancial circumstances and do it because they are overburdened by \ndebt. Specifically, we know that nearly half of all debtors report that \nhigh medical costs force them into bankruptcy. This is an especially \nserious problem for the elderly. Just think about prescription drug \ncosts and the increased medical bills one has as they become older.\n  A medical crisis is a double whammy for a family. First, there are \nthe high costs associated with the treatment of a serious health \nproblem, costs that may not be covered by insurance. Certainly, for \nsome 40 million people in the country who have no health insurance \nwhatsoever, it can put them under. And please remember, anyone who has \nspent one second in any coffee shop back in their States knows that the \nhealth care crisis is not just people with no health insurance at all. \nIt is also people who are underinsured. They have some coverage, but it \nis by no means comprehensive.\n  The other thing that happens is, if it is a serious accident or \nillness, then for a time, if you are the primary earner in the \nhousehold, the income is not coming in. And even if it isn't the person \nwho draws the income, a parent, if I am working and my child is very \nill, you know what--many of us know this now--or if your parent is very \nill, then you may need to be caring for that elderly parent. This means \na loss of income. It means more debt and more of an inability to pay \nback the debt.\n\n  I am kind of surprised, frankly, that the proponents of this \nlegislation did\n\n[[Page S1931]]\n\nnot at least have some sort of clear exemption and, if you will, some \ncompassion for people who end up filing for bankruptcy because of a \nmajor medical illness that has put them under.\n  Are the people in our country--the families in Minnesota --who were \noverwhelmed with medical debt or sidelined with an illness and \ntherefore they can't work, are they deadbeats? This bill assumes they \nare. For example, it would force them into credit counseling before \nthey could file for bankruptcy, as if a serious illness or disability \nis something that can be counseled away. Colleagues, that is not what \nit is about.\n  Both of my parents had Parkinson's disease. My father had severe \nParkinson's disease. I believe, ultimately, it is the reason my dad \npassed away. We helped take care of him, and I saw him struggle. I can \nassure you that the cost of the drugs to treat those diseases is not \nsomething that can be counseled away. It has nothing to do with these \ncitizens and these families being bad managers of their budget. It is, \n``There but for the grace of God go I.'' People, through no fault of \ntheir own, are stricken with illnesses and disabling injuries and, \ntherefore, major medical bills can put them under. When these families \nneed to file for bankruptcy, they should be exempt from the harsh and \nrestrictive provisions of this bill.\n  A study published in May of 2000 by professors Melissa Jacoby, Teresa \nSullivan, and Elizabeth Warren determined that:\n\n       Hundreds of thousands of middle class families declare \n     bankruptcy each year in the financial aftermath of an \n     encounter with the American health care system.\n\n  The study goes on to note:\n\n       The data reported here serve as a reminder that self-\n     funding medical treatment and loss of income during a bout of \n     illness or recovery from an accident make a substantial \n     number of middle class families vulnerable to financial \n     collapse. They also demonstrate that the American social \n     safety net is composed of interwoven pieces, including \n     government subsidies for medical care, private insurance and \n     personal bankruptcy. For middle class people, there is little \n     government help, so that when private insurance is \n     inadequate, bankruptcy serves by default as a means for \n     dealing with the financial consequences of a serious medical \n     problem.\n\n  Let me translate that into ordinary language. There are many people \nin our country, families in our States, who are either not old enough \nfor Medicare--and even if they are, it doesn't cover prescription drug \ncosts, catastrophic expenses--or they are not poor enough for Medicaid \nand they are not fortunate enough to be working for an employer where \nthey have any coverage, or for an employer that gives them \ncomprehensive coverage that is affordable. Therefore, when the private \ninsurance is inadequate and people are faced with a major medical \ncatastrophe, bankruptcy serves by default as a safety net, a way in \nwhich these families can deal with these medical consequences. This \npiece of legislation takes that support away.\n  Again, this is the point I have been trying to make over and over \nagain in this debate: Bankruptcy is a critical safety net for middle-\nclass Americans. Yet we have a bill which rolls the safety net back.\n\n  A study conducted by Ian Domowitz and Robert Sartain found that the \npresence of medical debt had ``the greatest single impact of any \nhousehold condition in raising the conditional probability of \nbankruptcy . . . households with high medical debt exhibit a filing \nprobability greater than 28 times that of the baseline.''\n  Come on. A lot of people who file for chapter 7 bankruptcy do it \nbecause of major medical bills. This amendment says exempt them.\n  The figures I have cited so far speak to all bankruptcies. But the \nstatistics become even more troubling if you look specifically at \nseniors or single women with children who file for bankruptcy. Single \nwomen with children are 50 percent more likely to file because of \nmedical bills than single men. You know what. There is a reason for \nthat. Unfortunately, in many families--maybe 50 percent now--there is a \ndivorce, and quite often in the large percentage of the cases the \nsingle parent who has the most responsibility for taking care of the \nchildren is the woman. That is one of the reasons why so many of the \nwomen's organizations and children's organizations are adamantly \nopposed to this legislation.\n  There was another way we could have gone after this problem because \nfor these folks the problem isn't the bankruptcy system; it is the \nhealth care system. I will concede that to my good friend from Alabama. \nIt is a shame that this has to be the way in which people can get some \nsupport for major medical bills.\n  The United States of America is the only advanced economy in the \nworld that does not have some form of universal health care coverage.\n  The United States paid a third more per capita for health care than \nany other nation, and we spend a greater percentage of our gross \ndomestic product--14 percent--and we get far less for our money, \naccording to the World Health Organization report.\n  There are about 44 million people in our country who have no health \ninsurance whatsoever, and there are about the same number of people who \nare underinsured.\n  We could have gone after this problem in another way. I could be on \nthe floor right now--I would love it--advocating for senior citizens \nand, for that matter, other working families, saying we ought to have \naffordable prescription drug coverage. But that is not our priority. We \nhave to consider this bankruptcy bill. I could be out on the floor \narguing for health security for all citizens, that we could, as a \nnational community--in fact, maybe this will be one of the amendments. \nMaybe I can have a vote on the following amendment, a sense of the \nSenate that the people we represent should have as good a health care \ncoverage as we have. We could be out here talking about health security \nfor every citizen. We could be talking about the ways in which we can \nagree nationally on a package of benefits as good as what we have and \nthat there should be patient protection.\n  The Presiding Officer was one of the first people in the Senate to \ntalk about patient protection. We could be talking about how we can \nmake it affordable for families. We could be talking about how to get \nto universal coverage. We could talk about how we could decentralize \nhealth care so the different States can make a lot of decisions about \ncost containment and delivery of care. That would be a way of dealing \nwith this problem. We could be talking about expanding the children's \nhealth care plan to include their parents. We could be talking about \nmore support for community health care clinics.\n  But that is not what we are doing. You might ask, Paul, why is this \namendment even necessary given what the author of the bill, my friend, \nSenator Grassley from Iowa, said just recently:\n       So that I am crystal clear, people who do not have the \n     ability to repay their debt can still use the bankruptcy \n     system as they would have before.\n\n  On the one hand, Paul, if you are telling me this bill is incredibly \nharsh and will punish working families who need a fresh start, but the \nproponents of the bill say this bill will not affect people who are \ngaming the system, how do you explain that?\n  If you listen carefully to their statements, you will hear that they \nonly claim such debtors will not be affected by the bill's means test. \nNot only is that claim, I think, subject to much debate--the means test \nand the safe harbor have been written in a way that will capture \nworking families who are filing for chapter 7 relief in good faith--but \nit ignores the vast majority of this legislation which will impose \nneedless hurdles and punitive costs on all families who file for \nbankruptcy, regardless of their income. Nor does the safe harbor apply \nto any of these provisions.\n  Do not take my word for it. Here is how an article in the \nconservative Wall Street Journal on February 22 characterized this \nbill:\n\n       In most cases, the bill, which is almost identical to the \n     one that President Clinton vetoed, will make filing for \n     bankruptcy more costly and more of a hassle. That's the \n     point: It will increase lenders leverage to pressure \n     consumers to pay bills instead of going to court to void \n     them.\n\n  That is exactly right. The article concludes on this point:\n\n       The bill is so full of hassle-creating provisions, some \n     reasonable, some prone to abuse by aggressive creditors \n     trying to get paid at the expense of others. In a thicket of \n     compromises, Congress risks losing sight of the goal: making \n     sure that most debtors pay their bills while offering a fresh \n     start to those who honestly can't.\n\n\n[[Page S1932]]\n\n\n  That is what this amendment does: to make sure we offer a fresh start \nfor those people put under by medical bills who honestly cannot pay \nback.\n  Again, this is the Wall Street Journal, hardly a bastion of populist \nsentiment, but that is the net effect of the bill: to make it harder \nfor families who have hit financial ruin, who have hit financial bottom \nto get a fresh start. That is what is wrong with this legislation.\n  The proponents of this bill have said that all these provisions are \nnecessary to curb abuse. OK, let's take them at their word. If that is \ntrue, then I assume the proponents of this bill will support this \namendment.\n  If the proponents mean what they say, that the whole point of this \nlegislation is to curb abuse, then my colleagues will want to support \nthis amendment because this amendment just exempts those families who \nare filing for bankruptcy because of major medical bills. They are not \nslackers. They are not cheaters. They have not gamed the system.\n  If the sponsors are serious about just taking on deadbeats, not \nordinary Americans who file bankruptcy because they simply have no \nother choice to rebuild their lives, then they should be rushing to the \nfloor to cosponsor this amendment.\n  I repeat that. If the sponsors are serious about going after the \ndeadbeats but making sure ordinary people, hard-working people who file \nbankruptcy because they have no other choice, are going to be able to \nrebuild their lives, then they should be rushing to the floor to \ncosponsor this amendment.\n  I hope I will get support from my colleague from Utah. Surely no one \nwill argue that families that are drowning in debt as a result of \nmedical bills are gaming the system. These are the people who need the \nsafety net the most. These are the people who need to make a fresh \nstart.\n  Here are a number of examples of what I am talking about:\n  The prebankruptcy credit counseling requirements at the debtor's \nexpense is a requirement that people have to go to prebankruptcy \ncounseling. The debtor pays for it, as if, again, people who have been \nput under because of cancer, diabetes, or some kind of horrible injury, \ncan counsel away these conditions. They are not in financial difficulty \nbecause they need credit counseling.\n  New limits on repeat filings, again, regardless of personal \ncircumstances; revocation of automatic stay relief for failure to \nsurrender collateral; changes to existing cram-down provisions in \nchapter 13, making it more difficult for debtors to keep their car; the \nnew presumption of abuse of credit card if the debt is incurred within \n3 months of the bankruptcy.\n  We have all of these new burdens, all of these hurdles. Why do we \nwant to make it so horrible difficult for people who find themselves in \nhorrible financial circumstances because of a major medical illness, a \nmajor medical bill, to file chapter 7 and rebuild their lives? They are \nnot slackers. They are not gaming the system.\n  This amendment says let us have a good bill, and one of the ways to \ndo it is to at least have an exemption for these families.\n  Again, some of these onerous hurdles, requirements, that I mentioned \nmight be useful to get the deadbeats or go after the irresponsible \npeople--I am all for that. The problem is that all of these changes \nalso affect working families who file for bankruptcy through no fault \nof their own. Should a person who files because of medical bills be \ntreated with the same presumption of abuse as wealthy slackers? That is \nwhat this bill does.\n  I repeat that. Should a person who files because of major medical \nbills be treated with the same presumption of abuse as wealthy slackers \nwho are gaming the system? That is what this bill does.\n  I cite two specific examples of how this bill will hurt debtors who \nfile for medical reasons, and I hope my colleagues on the other side of \nthe issue will come to the floor--I know the distinguished Senator from \nUtah is here--to refute this, if they can. Both of these families were \ntalked about in an excellent Time magazine story last year which was \ncalled ``Soaked by Congress.'' My colleagues may remember this.\n  Allen Smith is a resident of Delaware, which has no homestead \nexemption. In other words, he cannot shield his home from his \ncreditors. Ironically, under this bill, wealthy scofflaws can shield \nmultimillion-dollar mansions from their creditors with little planning, \nbut not Mr. Smith. It is 2 years in advance. If you know you are facing \ntrouble and you are a multimillionaire, you can hire your lawyers and \nthen buy your real estate in Florida or wherever.\n  There is no such break for Mr. Smith. As a result, when the tragic \nmedical problems described in the Time article befell his family, he \ncould not file a chapter 7 case without losing his home. There was no \nhomestead exemption. Instead, he filed a chapter 13 case which requires \nsubstantial payments in addition to his regular mortgage payments for \nhim to save his home. Ultimately, after his wife passed away and he \nhimself was hospitalized, he was unable to make all these payments and \nhis chapter 13 plan failed.\n  Had Delaware had a reasonable homestead exemption and had Mr. Smith \nbeen able to simply file a chapter 7 case to eliminate his other debts, \nhe might have been able to save his home. He lost his home.\n  Mr. Smith's financial deterioration was caused by unavoidable medical \nproblems. Before he thought about bankruptcy, he went to consumer \ncredit counseling to try to deal with his debts. However, it appears he \nwent to consumer credit counseling just over 180 days before the case \nwas filed, and he did not receive a ``briefing.'' The new bill would \nhave required him to go again. This would have been very difficult \nconsidering his medical problems. In fact, his attorney demonstrated a \ndedication to his client that sharply contrasts with the creditor \npropaganda picture of bankruptcy lawyers just out to make a buck. He \nmade several home visits to Mr. Smith and his wife, who was a double \namputee. The new bill would also have required a great deal of \nadditional time and expense for Mr. Smith and his attorney, through new \npaperwork requirements and a requirement that he attend a credit \neducation course. Such a course would have done nothing to prevent the \nenormous medical problems suffered by Mr. Smith and his wife.\n\n  He did not get into financial trouble through failure to manage his \nmoney. He is 73 years old and had never before had any debt problems. \nThe bill makes no exceptions for people who cannot attend the course \ndue to exigent circumstances. Mr. Smith might never have been able to \nget any relief in bankruptcy under the new bill.\n  Under the new bill, this bill, Mr. Smith would also have had to give \nup his television and VCR to Sears which claimed a security interest in \nthe items. Under the bill, he would not be permitted to retain \npossession of these items in chapter 7 unless he reaffirms the debt or \nredeemed the items. Sears may demand reaffirmation of his entire $3,000 \ndebt under the bill, and to redeem, Mr. Smith would have to pay the \nretail value. After his wife died and her income was gone, Mr. Smith \ndid not have the money to pay the amounts to Sears. Since he is largely \nhome bound, loss of these items would have been devastating.\n  Sadly, this is a real person, about real people. Mr. Smith's medical \nproblems continue. Under current law, if he again amasses medical and \nother debts he cannot pay, he could seek refuge in chapter 13 where he \nwould be required to pay all he could afford. Under the new bill, Mr. \nSmith cannot file a chapter 13 case for 5 years, when he is 78 years \nold.\n  The time for filing a new chapter 7 has also been increased from 6 to \n8 years. What will happen to people such as him?\n  Charles and Linda Trapp were forced into bankruptcy by medical \nproblems. Their daughter's medical treatment left them with medical \ndebts well over $100,000, as well as a number of credit card debts. \nBecause of her daughter's degenerative condition, Linda Trapp had to \nleave her job as a mail carrier about 2 months before the bankruptcy \ncase was filed to manage her care. Before she left her job, the \nfamily's annual income was about $83,000 a year or $6,900 per month.\n  Under the bill, close to that amount, $6,200, the average monthly \nincome from the previous 6 months is deemed\n\n[[Page S1933]]\n\ntheir current monthly income, even though their gross monthly income at \nthe time of filing was only $4,800. Based on the fictitious deemed \nincome, the Trapps would have been presumed to be abusing the \nbankruptcy code since allowed expenses under the IRS guidelines \namounted to $5,339. The difference of $850 per month would have been \ndeemed available to pay unsecured debts and was over the $6,200 a \nmonth, triggering a presumption of abuse. The Trapps would have had to \nsubmit the detailed documentation to rebut this presumption, trying to \nshow their income should be adjusted downward because of special \ncircumstances and that there was no reasonable alternative to Linda \nTrapp leaving her job.\n  Because their current monthly income, although fictitious, was over \nthe median income, the family would have been subject to motions for \nabuse, filed by creditors who might argue Linda Trapp should not have \nleft her job and that the Trapps should have tried to pay debts in \nchapter 13. That is the same problem for taconite workers.\n  I will be proposing an amendment I hope will get 100 votes that will \nsay LTV, the large company that laid off 1,400 workers, if they file \nfor bankruptcy, chapter 7, should not be able to walk away from their \nhealth care obligation to retirees. The working men and women are out \nof work. You will do their average income over a 6-month period and \nthen determine whether or not they are eligible for chapter 7. How are \nthey able to rebuild their lives? They will not be able to do it. Their \naverage income over the last 6 months might look pretty good. That \ndoesn't do you much good if you were laid off 2 months ago. Where in \nthe world does this test come from?\n\n  The Trapps wouldn't have been protected by a safe harbor. The Trapps \nwould have paid their attorney to defend the motion, and if they could \nnot have afforded the $1,000 or more it would have cost, the case would \nhave been dismissed and they would not have received relief. If they \nprevailed, it is unlikely they would recover attorney fees from a \ncreditor who brought the motion, since recovery of fees is permitted \nonly if the creditor's motion was frivolous and could not arguably be \nsupported by any reasonable interpretation of law.\n  That is a much weaker standard than the original Senate bill. In \nfact, we have had better bills. This bill has gotten worse and worse. \nWe once had a bill that passed 99-1. I was the only Senator opposing \nit.\n  Because the means test is so vague and ambiguous, any creditor could \nargue it would simply make a good faith attempt to apply the means test \nwhich created a presumption of abuse.\n  Mrs. Trapp's medical problems continue and are only getting worse. \nUnder current law, if the Trapps amass medical and other debts, they \ncould seek refuge in chapter 13 where they would be required to pay all \nthey could afford. Under the new bill, the Trapps could not file a \nchapter 13 case for 5 years. Even then the payments would be determined \nby the IRS expense account and they would have to stay in the plan for \n5 years rather than 3 years required under current law. The timing for \nfiling chapter 7 would be increased by the bill from 6 to 8 years.\n  What does this bill do to keep people who undergo these wrenching \nexperiences out of bankruptcy? Nothing. Zero. Tough luck. Instead, this \nlegislation just makes the fresh start of the bankruptcy harder to \nachieve. This doesn't change anyone's circumstances. This doesn't \nchange the fact that these folks don't earn enough any longer to \nsustain their debt. There is not one thing in this bankruptcy \n``reform'' bill that would promote health security in working families.\n  I conclude this way: I came to this issue almost by accident. I am \nnot on the Judiciary Committee. I am not a lawyer. My colleague from \nUtah, Senator Hatch, is a very able lawyer. It is complicated. With all \nof the fine print and all of the detail, the more you go through it, \nthe more you are able to realize this piece of legislation lacks some \nbalance. This amendment gives this legislation badly needed balance. \nWhat this amendment says is, go ahead, let's not let anyone game the \nsystem. Whether it is the 3 percent the American Bankruptcy Institute \nor the 10 to 13 percent that others talk about, don't let people game \nit. Don't let people be slackers. Don't let people get away with \nmurder. When people go under--50 percent of the bankruptcy cases are \nbecause of a major medical illness--give them an exemption from the \nonerous requirements, give them the opportunity to rebuild their lives. \nThey didn't ask for the illness. They didn't ask for the major medical \nbill. They didn't ask for the disabling injury. They didn't ask to be \nput under.\n  The bitter irony is that just yesterday we passed a motion that \nemasculated 10 years of work to get a rule to provide protection for \npeople, many of them women, against repetitive stress injury, disabling \ninjuries, in the workplace.\n  Now we turn around today and say, and you know what, not only don't \nyou have the protection--and I said earlier, I made the prediction we \nwill not see an ergonomics standard passed by this Congress for years \nnow. If I am wrong, I will be pleased to be wrong. Now what we say is \nthere is not the protection and now, if you have a disabling injury and \nnow you do not have the income coming in and now you are in a desperate \nfinancial situation, we are going to make it impossible for you to file \nchapter 7 and rebuild your life.\n\n  It is not a good week for working people, not a good week for \nordinary citizens. What we could have done--and I conceded this point \nearlier in the debate. I really apologize that chapter 7 in bankruptcy \nis one of the ways people can deal with major medical bills because, \nfrankly, it is a pretty poor excuse for what we should be doing. We \nshould not have 44 million people without any coverage. We should not \nhave at least that number of people who are underinsured. We should be \nable to have comprehensive health care reform.\n  I think one of the amendments I should offer is to make sure all the \npeople we represent have as good health coverage as we have. We should \nbe doing that, but we are not. Instead, we are going to make it \nimpossible for some good, honest people to rebuild their lives when \nthey find themselves in desperate financial circumstances through no \nfault of their own.\n  I hope there will be support for this amendment that just says if you \nfile for bankruptcy because of major medical bills, none of the \nprovisions in this bill will affect you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, listening to my colleague, I wonder if he \nhas read this bill because most of what he said is untrue. I have \nrespect for him as a former professor of political science, but on the \nother hand, this bill has been around for a long time; we have worked \non it with virtually everybody in the Congress, everybody in the \nSenate.\n  We provide for people right and left and provide the means of taking \ncare of women and children. We have made it so that people who owe \ntheir debts and who can pay really ought to; the game is over.\n  Sometimes I get the impression some of our colleagues on the other \nside think the Federal Government is the last answer to everything and \nit is the only answer to everything. It is the last answer sometimes, \nbut it is not the only answer. I have to tell you, this amendment of \nthe distinguished Senator is unnecessary.\n  Let me just say one thing about ergonomics. I distinctly stayed away \nfrom the debate yesterday because we had plenty of good people on both \nsides arguing that debate. The distinguished Senator from Minnesota, \nhis side lost. The reason they lost is that anybody who has any brains \nat all knows we do not need to create a Federal welfare system or \nFederal workers compensation system. Everybody who has any brains knows \nthe minute you start doing that, there is going to be a plethora of \npeople who will take advantage of it. It is just human nature.\n  We do need to come up with a really workable, nonbudget-busting, \nergonomic-stress-related bill that I think will work. Certainly that \nregulation was way out of line and should not have been supported. I \nwas amazed there were as many Democrats who supported it as did. It was \na bipartisan rejection of those regulations.\n\n  If the Senate of the United States had any guts or any consideration \nfor its own power at all, that is what had\n\n[[Page S1934]]\n\nto be done. We just can't let bureaucrats go do whatever they want to \nregardless of what the law says, and that is why we came up with that \nparticular act, to provide a means whereby we can get rid of \nregulations such as that, that really are improperly written, way \nexcessive in their tone and their delivery and in their practicality. \nIt is, frankly, very detrimental to the country in the long run. They \nwould cause a lot of difficulty.\n  The thing I can remember that best reminds me of that kind of \nlegislation was the catastrophic bill a few years ago--just take care \nof everybody's catastrophic illness. It was wonderful to hear that and \nfind out the Federal Government was going to take care of everybody, \nuntil the people found out they had to pay for it. Then they were \njumping on top of Danny Rostenkowski's car, the chairman of the Ways \nand Means Committee, because they weren't about to pay the kind of \nrates that would have been required of them to have the kind of \ncatastrophic coverage we Members of Congress were going to give them \nbecause we know it all.\n  Let me say, this amendment is unnecessary, the amendment of the \ndistinguished Senator from Minnesota. There is a means test in S. 420 \nthat takes care of it and already accounts for 100 percent of a \nperson's medical expenses. Thus, if their medical expenses prevent them \nfrom being able to repay their debts, they don't have to under the \nmeans test. It takes care of the truly poor. We have taken great pains \nto take care of the truly poor.\n  But there are some people in our society who are using the bankruptcy \nrules, the bankruptcy laws, the current laws, to get around debts for \nwhich they are very capable of paying. Or they run up huge bills and \nthen expect society to pay for them. It is costing the average family \n$550 a year because of the inadequacies of our current bankruptcy laws \nwhich this bill cures.\n  The means test takes care of the poor. But if the Senator gets his \nway and this amendment is agreed to, let me tell you who will benefit \nfrom it. Donald Trump is going to benefit from it. Bill Gates will \nbenefit from it. Anybody who is wealthy who goes into bankruptcy and \nhas medical bills, they are going to be able to avoid those; they will \nnot have to pay them.\n  The way I read this, if a wealthy person files for bankruptcy and the \nreason they filed was to extinguish their debts from medical expenses, \nthen the means test will not apply to them even if they are fully \ncapable of paying their medical expenses, paying their debts. What this \nprovision of the distinguished Senator from Minnesota does is it puts \nhospital creditors at the head of the line. That is not what we want to \ndo.\n  The amendment says the entire act and amendments do not apply if you \nfile for bankruptcy because of medical expenses. This means the new \nprotections in the bill for women and children don't apply--or don't \napply to them. Credit counseling provisions don't apply that we have \nput in here. Homestead provisions don't apply.\n  I know the distinguished Senator is trying to do right here, and I \nknow he is well intentioned. I respect that. But we thought of these \nproblems, and I think we have solved them, cured them in this bill. \nThis bill does an awful lot to cure the problems of our country in \nbankruptcy. It does an awful lot to stop the fraud that is going on in \nbankruptcy. It does an awful lot to reduce the annual cost of every \nfamily in America--now estimated at $550 a year. It does a lot to \nalleviate those problems and reduce those costs of every American \ncitizen. It does an awful lot to help people be more responsible for \ntheir debts. It sends a message to everybody that you must be \nresponsible, even if you are having trouble paying your debts. We \nprovide all kinds of mechanisms so that they can pay their debts--maybe \nnot in full but at least can get discharged in bankruptcy after having \nmade a good-faith effort to live up to the terms of the law we would \npass.\n\n  I sometimes get the impression that our colleagues on the other side \nbelieve that Government is the last answer to everything. I know not \nall of them do, but it just seems as though more and more that seems to \nbe the argument, that only the Government can take care of health care, \nonly the Government can take care of savings and investment, only the \nGovernment can take care of education--only the Federal Government, \nthat is. We all know the Federal Government's share is only about 6 \npercent or 7 percent of the total cost of education in this society. \nYet they can come up with this idea that only the Federal Government \nhas the last answers and can solve all these problems.\n  The Federal Government isn't any brighter than the State governments. \nI have to say the State and local governments are closer to the people \nand, as a general rule, do a better job than we do. But we can do a \ngood job. This bill is a very good bill. Is it perfect? I have to say I \nhave never--well, maybe not never but hardly ever--seen a bill around \nhere that is perfect because we have to satisfy 535 people, and more; \nwe have to satisfy the administration. We have to satisfy a lot of \npeople out there. This bill takes care of a lot of problems in the \ncurrent bankruptcy system that need taking care of. We can argue these \nmatters until we are blue in the face, but it is time to vote on it.\n  Frankly, I respect anybody for their sincerely held opinions. I know \nthe opinions of the distinguished Senator from Minnesota are sincerely \nheld. He is a very bright man, and he raises some interesting issues \nfrom time to time. But on this one, he is just dead wrong.\n  Very frankly, the only people who are going to benefit from this \namendment are the rich who can afford to pay for their medical expenses \nbecause we take care of those who are poor under the means test. This \nparticular bill resolves that problem.\n  I wonder if we can go on to another amendment. I suggest we stack \nthis amendment behind the Leahy amendment and go to the next amendment. \nI hope our colleagues are prepared.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I also want to explain to my colleague \nfrom Utah what I said earlier this morning is that we have a markup. My \nunderstanding from Senator Leahy is that other Senators will come down \nwith amendments. I have a markup also going on at the same time with \namendments in committee. I will have to go back and forth.\n  First of all, when my colleague from Utah says there has been an \nadjustment in the means test for medical bills, I hope Senators' staffs \nwill take a look. When my colleague says, Wait a minute, we have taken \ncare of problems with major medical bills, we don't do an adjustment to \nthe means test. This is the part of the bankruptcy bill that deals with \nthat. Here is the whole bill.\n  There are lots of other very harsh provisions in this bill that go \nway beyond this. I am talking about the whole bill. There are \nprebankruptcy credit counseling requirements at the debtor's expense. \nWhy in the world do you want people who have been put under because of \na major medical bill to have to go to credit counseling? What kind of \npresumption do you make? Then they have to pay for their counseling. \nWhat is that doing in here? You think people can credit counsel their \nway out of having to deal with cancer and the bill they incur?\n  Again, my colleague from Utah talks about one little part of the \nbill.\n  The revocation of the automatic stay relief from failure to surrender \ncollateral is another provision. Now at least when you file for \nbankruptcy, there is some time that goes by. This means that Sears can \ncome and repossess. There is no time.\n  There are changes to existing cram-down provisions in chapter 13, \nmaking it more difficult for debtors. You end up paying for the full \nloan, not the value of the car.\n  How about this one? You can't file a new chapter 7 case for 8 years \nor a new chapter 13 case for 5 years--again, making it more difficult.\n  What happens if a family is put under with a major medical bill and \nthen there is another illness? You say this period of time has to go \nby? You have to go 7 or 8 years from 6 years in chapter 7, and from 6 \nyears under chapter 13 to 5 years. There is no limit under current law.\n  There are lots of provisions in this piece of legislation that are \nvery harsh. I do not understand.\n  I think this is a very challenging vote for Senators. I say to the \nSenator\n\n[[Page S1935]]\n\nfrom Iowa and other Senators who are on the floor right now that this \namendment concedes the point that we certainly ought to have some \nlegislation that deals with people who game the system--again, I think \nit is about 3 percent--people who really game the system, people who \nreally do not need to file chapter 7. But surely with this bill there \nare many harsh provisions, and we would want to at least have an \nexemption for people who go under because of major medical bills.\n  Let's just concede the point that people in Minnesota, Iowa, \nNebraska, and around the country who are having to file for chapter 7 \nbecause of a major medical bill that put them under ought to be exempt \nfrom all of these loopholes.\n  Talk about bureaucracy, and ways of discouraging people from filing, \nand making it difficult for people to get relief. Why wouldn't you at \nleast have an exemption?\n  I have opposed this bill with all my might for several years. I find \nit interesting that there are articles in Business Week and the Wall \nStreet Journal. There was a piece last night on ABC News; Time \nmagazine, a long piece--all of which say--I don't think this is \nnecessarily the tradition of blaming liberal media--that this bill is \nimbalanced and it is a dream come true for the credit card industry and \nfor the financial services industry. There is no question about it. But \nit is too harsh for many ordinary citizens in the country.\n\n  I say to my colleagues again: We represent people, too many of whom \ndon't have anywhere near the health care coverage we have. We represent \npeople who, through no fault of their own, wind up with a major illness \nor injury that puts them under financially.\n  Maybe I feel strongly about it. I think it took my mother and father, \nas I remember, 20 years to pay off a medical bill in our family. I \nthink it took them 20 years, as I remember. That still remains one of \nthe great fears and sources of insecurity of the people we represent--\nthat there is going to be a major medical bill that puts them under.\n  We do not come out here on the floor of the Senate and make \nprescription drugs more affordable. We don't come out here on the floor \nof the Senate and introduce and debate legislation that would provide \nmore health security for the people we represent and that would make \nhealth care coverage more comprehensive and more affordable. We don't \ncome out here in the Senate and dedicate ourselves to the proposition \nthat the people we should represent should have as good a coverage as \nwe have.\n  I think that would be a good amendment to vote on, on this bill. Then \nwe take what is a safety net, given the fact that we haven't done any \nof that in public policy and given the fact, therefore, that over 50 \npercent of the people who file for bankruptcy do it because of major \nmedical bills, and we tear the safety net apart.\n  I will tell you, I have some good friends on the other side of the \naisle on this issue. One of them is about to speak. I have said \npublicly that whatever the Senator from Iowa says and whatever he \nadvocates is what he honestly believes. Political truth can be elusive. \nOne person's solution can be another person's horror. People in good \nfaith can disagree.\n  So what I am about to say now is not directed personally. But again I \nfinish this way at least for the moment. I will tell you, I don't like \nthe feel of this at all. I don't like the feel of this bill at all. I \nthink when you look at the lobbying coalition and the campaign \ncontribution, because there is not one Senator--I need to say some of \nus aren't good at this if we aren't careful. We can't make a one-to-one \ncorrelation because a Senator received one contribution. That is not \nfair to do. But what you can say is that the families I talked about, \nthe unemployed Taconite workers on the Range--I say to the Presiding \nOfficer, the Senator from Nebraska, that farmers who are facing the \nprice crisis and barely hanging on--and a whole lot of middle-class \nfamilies who were doing well, they were doing well. My folks were doing \nwell. I do not know if they were middle class--what definition you \nwould use; they did not have a lot of money--but they were doing fine. \nBut then there was a major medical illness.\n\n  I am saying, you should exempt those families who file for bankruptcy \nfrom the provisions of this legislation. That way you get the cheaters \nand you get the slackers, but you do not make it impossible for a lot \nof people who are in a whole lot of physical pain and a whole lot of \neconomic pain to rebuild their lives.\n  I cannot understand, for the life of me, why I am not getting \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle sponsoring this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I am sorry, I saw the Senator from Iowa. I thought he would want to \nspeak.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Is the Senator from Minnesota done?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am not finished with my final remarks on this \namendment, but I always defer to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. If the Senator yields the floor, then I will ask for \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield to the Senator from \nIowa?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. First of all, I think the Senator from Minnesota thinks \nthat he has not made any impact on this legislation over the last 4 \nyears. This bill is a statement of considerable impact that the Senator \nfrom Minnesota has made on it because of his hard work. His work goes \nbeyond just improving the bill. He obviously does not want the improved \nbill to pass.\n  But the Senator from Minnesota is a legislator. He obviously believes \nin the legislative process. He knows how to use the legislative process \nto accomplish good from his point of view. And we have a bill that has \nchanged considerably since the recommendations in the Commission on \nBankruptcy report.\n  Senator Durbin and I introduced that bill two Congresses ago. It went \nthrough the process of subcommittee, full committee, to the floor of \nthe Senate, through the House of Representatives, through conference, \nthrough the House a second time but not having enough time to get it \nthrough the floor of the Senate that second time to get it to the \nPresident.\n  Then, in the last Congress, it went through the same process: \nsubcommittee, full committee, the floor of the Senate, the House of \nRepresentatives subcommittee, full committee, the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives, to conference and out of conference, passing the House \nof Representatives by a veto-proof margin, and through the Senate, \npassing the Senate by a veto-proof margin, and going to President \nClinton for his signature.\n  Obviously, with veto-proof margins in both Houses, the President knew \nif he vetoed it, we would be able to override it. The President waited \nuntil we adjourned last December, and at that point did what, under the \nConstitution, is called a pocket veto. We obviously were not in session \nand did not have an opportunity to override.\n  But I said: The Senator from Minnesota has had an opportunity to make \nconsiderable changes in this legislation. Maybe I do not like all those \nchanges, but I would have to look at this piece of legislation that has \nmy name on it as the principal sponsor, with Senator Torricelli of New \nJersey, and say this bill has improved a lot in ways that we probably \nshould have recognized when it was first introduced.\n\n  But you reach a point, in any legislative process, where you \neventually come to the conclusion that perfection in the way we do \nbusiness in the Government is never a possibility. And you get the best \npossible vehicle you can to get the job done--the best possible job.\n  I think the Senator from Minnesota would like to have me yield. I \nwill yield for the purpose of a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I just want to thank my colleague. Sometimes a \ndistinguished Senator can go on and on and on, and it is not sincere. I \nthank the Senator from Iowa for his graciousness. I have never doubted \nhis commitment to this legislation. I have never doubted his conviction \non it. And I want to apologize. I have a markup on an education bill, \nso I am going to leave now. The amendment will be laid aside. I will be \nback in a while. I did not want to appear to be impolite. I just have \nto go to the markup.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator from Minnesota does not have to apologize.\n\n[[Page S1936]]\n\n There are always demands upon our time. There are four or five places \nwe could be at one time. I did not get a chance to hear all of the \nSenator's speech because I was chairing the Senate Finance Committee on \nthe issue of giving tax relief to working American men and women, a \nbill that will probably pass here in the month of May.\n  Anyway, I plead with the Senator from Minnesota that he has had a \ntremendous impact upon this legislation, and it is a better bill in the \nsense that a lot of things that were brought to our attention are now \nchanges in this bill. But you cannot have perfection.\n  I think the Senator from Minnesota would say he really does not want \nthis bill to pass. So I think it is fair to say he, and other Members \nwho do not want it to pass, will be offering amendments, maybe because \nthey believe in them, but partly it is a process of slowing the \nlegislation down so, again, it may never pass.\n  But I think, unlike 4 and 2 years ago--or maybe more accurately, 3 \nand 1 year ago--we are starting out with this bill on the floor of the \nSenate in the first year of a 2-year Congress, where one or two Members \nof this body are not going to frustrate the will of almost all 535 \nMembers of Congress. And they do not have a President now that is going \nto veto the bill. So this legislation is going to become law. President \nBush will sign this legislation.\n  So now, if I could--we do have an amendment before us from the \nSenator from Minnesota--I want to address that amendment very directly. \nIt brings me to the means test.\n  By the way, I have a chart here speaking about how flexible this \nmeans test is, what it takes into consideration, so that it is not just \na quantifiable formula with no humanity to it. There is plenty of \nhumanity involved in this means test, whereby the means test determines \nwhether somebody has the ability to repay some of their debt. And if \nthey do, they then go into chapter 13, and they never get off scot-\nfree.\n  So I see the amendment from the Senator from Minnesota as gutting the \nmeans test, ignoring the means test. That would be very bad. And we \nhave had 70 Senators vote for this bill. By the way, 70 Senators \nrepresents a bipartisan vote.\n  If you believe this bill should be passed, and we should have strong \nimprovements in bankruptcy law, then you will want to keep the means \ntest; you will not want to gut the means test, as Senator Wellstone's \namendment does.\n  It sounds very humanitarian to talk about taking medical expenses \ninto consideration as to whether or not you ought to be granted access \nto having your debts discharged. I have stated before on this floor, \nthat in calculating a debtor's income, under this means test, 100 \npercent of medical expenses are deducted.\n  I have also said to my colleagues, including the Senator from \nMinnesota, that if we offer you a bill where, in determining whether or \nnot you should be in bankruptcy court--and 100 percent of your medical \nexpenses can be taken into consideration in that determination--how \nmuch better than 100 percent can we do? If I gave you 101 percent or \n102 percent would that be better? But with 100 percent deduction for \nsome expense, I do not know how you can do much better than that.\n  That is what this means testing formula does. And Senator Grassley \ndoes not say that, the General Accounting Office confirmed that. I have \na page from the General Accounting Office report in relation to that \npart of this legislation. This is the title page, if people are \ninterested in the entire book. But it lists what is deductible under \nthe IRS standards, in determining the ability to repay if you go into \nbankruptcy.\n\n  Here, under ``other necessary expenses,'' the description of the IRS \nguidelines, as stated by the General Accounting Office, includes such \nexpenses as charitable contributions, child care, dependent care, \nhealth care, payroll deductions, including taxes, union dues, life \ninsurance. There it is, under ``other necessary expenses,'' health \ncare, 100-percent deductible in making that determination. If you can \npay off some portion of your debt under the means test, then you should \nhave to do so. The means test takes into account these reasonable \nexpenses and others than what I listed, including 100 percent of \nmedical expenses.\n  If one is concerned about whether or not 100 percent of medical \nexpenses is clear enough as to what you can deduct, because the Senator \nfrom Minnesota used the term ``catastrophic'' medical expenses, the \ntest also allows, under our legislation, for special circumstances to \nbe taken into account when determining if a debtor can repay his or her \ndebt.\n  That means that after you have taken the IRS guidelines, as I have \nstated, the General Accounting Office saying 100 percent of medical \nexpenses--and that is not enough to satisfy the Senator from Minnesota \nso he talks about catastrophic medical expenses; whether they are \ncatastrophic or minor, 100 percent of medical expenses is 100 percent \nof medical expenses--but just in case, then under the special \ncircumstances provisions of our legislation, that debtor can go before \nthe judge and plead a case beyond what the IRS regulations allow.\n  This bill preserves a fresh start for people who have been \noverwhelmed by medical debt or unforeseen emergencies. The bill thus \nallows full 100-percent deductibility of medical expenses before \nexamining the ability to repay.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Minnesota says that if one files \nfor bankruptcy because of medical expenses, then he or she does not \nhave to go through this very flexible means test we are presenting in \nour legislation. His amendment doesn't take into account whether or not \na person can repay or not. Making it possible to go into bankruptcy \nwithout some determination of the ability to repay or not is just not \nright. It means you have a gigantic loophole for somebody to game the \nsystem and to do what we are trying to prevent with this legislation--\nnot hurting the principle of a fresh start, but if you have the ability \nto repay, you are not going to use the bankruptcy code for financial \nplanning. You are not going to get off scot free.\n  What the Wellstone amendment does is create a loophole for those who \ncan repay their debts. Our bill does it right. We allow all medical \nexpenses, if they are catastrophic or not, to be taken into account. So \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Minnesota creates this huge \nloophole in the bill. That is why I have to urge my colleagues to \noppose this amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to proceed on the \nbankruptcy bill in reference to the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone.\n  I know Senator Wellstone opposes this bill for any number of reasons, \nbut I think we ought to analyze carefully what he is saying to consider \nactually what the impact of the amendment he offered would be. I think \nwhen we do that, we find it would be a curious thing for him to offer \nand certainly would not be good public policy.\n  Basically, the Senator's amendment would say that if a person files \nbankruptcy because of health care expenses--I believe the words are \n``as a result of medical losses or expenses''--he would then be \nexempted from the new bankruptcy law. I think that is an odd thing to \nsay, and I think it focused more of his concern about people filing \nbankruptcy as a result of medical expenses than the remedy that he \nwould effect by the amendment.\n  We know that a number of people do get in financial trouble as a \nresult of medical expenses. But, first, I say without fear of \ncontradiction, those medical expenses will not impact a person in a way \nthat would require him to pay any of those back, unless he or she--the \nperson filing bankruptcy--made below the median income. Probably 80 \npercent, I would guesstimate, of the people who file personal \nbankruptcy make below the median income. So they would not be impacted \nby the means test requirement that they pay back some of the medical \nexpenses that they have incurred.\n\n[[Page S1937]]\n\n  Also, I think we ought to ask ourselves what expenses is he or she \nnot being required to pay back. Hospital expenses? Now, let's say a \nperson makes $150,000 a year--and people such as that are filing \nbankruptcy today. They are quite capable of paying back a substantial \nportion of their debts--maybe all of them. But they can file chapter 7 \nand wipe out all of their debts, with very little fear of any \nalternative consequences occurring to them. It is done every day.\n  As I read this amendment, it basically says that hospitals are the \nbig losers. You don't have to pay them back. If you owe hospitals a big \ndebt, and you are making above the median income, and you could easily \npay 25 percent of that back to the hospital, and a judge would require \nyou to do so, Senator Wellstone says, no, you can't be made to pay your \nhospital back. But if you owe some disreputable person--say, your \nliquor distributor, or somebody who has done those kinds of things--\nunder his amendment they would all be required to be paid back. Just \nnot the hospitals.\n  I have visited 20 hospitals this year in Alabama. I have talked to \nadministrators, nurses, and doctors. They are having a tough time with \ntheir budgets. I am concerned about them. They do not believe in having \npeople try to pay debts. They write off debts every day that people \ncan't pay. It is one of the things they share with me--that bankrupts \nand others are just not able to pay their debts and they write them \noff.\n  The Federal Government has some form to help to compensate for that. \nProbably not enough. At any rate, the question simply is, Why should a \nperson, if he is capable of paying back some debts, not pay his \ncommunity hospital? It was a hospital that served him, presumably, or \nhis family, and took care of their health needs; it exists to serve \nother people in the community--a good, noble, valuable institution. Why \nshould that be the institution that doesn't get paid, when you can pay \ncertain debts?\n  I think the amendment is rather odd, and it makes it less likely that \nthere would be good health care in the community. There is a concern \nabout, well, if you got continuing medical expenses, and this is going \nto leave you in debt, well, the way we wrote the bill--and we thought \nabout this very subject--what about a person who had substantial \nmedical expenses on a recurring basis?\n  How should that factor into your median income or special \ncircumstances? We created two situations that deal with that.\n  If a family of four has a median income of around $50,000, and if \nthey had $2,000 of recurring medical expenses for some reason and had \nto pay it every month, under IRS standards, which we adopted in this \nbill, that $2,000 adds on to the median income. The median income would \nnot be $50,000, it would be $2,000 a month--$24,000 more, $74,000. If \nthe income then was $70,000, the family could wipe out all debts, \nhospital and otherwise, without any problem because the median income \ncalculated under IRS standards would not prevent them from going \nstraight into chapter 7 and wiping out the debt, rather than being put \nin chapter 13 where the judge will say you pay back some of the debt as \nyou are able over a period of years.\n  We also have a provision referred to as ``special circumstances.'' A \nbankruptcy judge can find special medical hardship or circumstances and \nexempt it from the bankruptcy.\n  I do not think this is particularly good. The Senator says just \nbecause your bankruptcy filing was a result of medical expenses, you \nshould be exempted from all the law. What does that do? That eliminates \nthe great benefits we placed in this bill for women and children who, \nunder current law, rank down in the list of priority payments of \nlimited debts from the bankruptcy estate. Under this new bill, they go \nto No. 1.\n  If the bankruptcy was the result of medical expenses and the bankrupt \nindividual could pay his alimony and child support, it would not be the \nfirst priority on the estate like it is under present law. The women \nand children would lose that benefit.\n  We have had some discussion about the homestead provisions. There is \na much stricter standard under this current law under homestead to stop \nthe abuse of people putting their money into large homesteads in States \nthat have unlimited homestead exemptions. Tightening of that provision \nwould not apply here, leaving other people to lose more significantly.\n  This amendment is more out of the Senator's frustration over medical \ncare in America. I know he wants the Government to take care of \neverything that it can in that regard and more. I am willing to debate \nthat under a different circumstance. It does not apply here.\n  This bill makes provisions for people who have high medical expenses. \nIndeed, historically the bankruptcy law does not question why someone \nis in debt. One can be in debt because one made a risky investment. One \ncan be in debt because one messed up on some contract and then was \nsued. They were wrong, badly wrong, perhaps. One can be in debt because \nof health care. One can be in debt because of gambling or alcohol. \nMaybe just a lack of personal discipline drives people into bankruptcy.\n  We have never, and should not in my view, turn the bankruptcy court \ninto some sort of social institution that starts to evaluate \neverybody's personal conscience to see whether or not they were \njustified or unjustified into going into debt.\n  Remember, what we are crafting today is simply a procedure in a \nFederal court, a bankruptcy court, by which people who are unable to \npay their debts can wipe those debts out all or in part. Basically, the \nlaw says that if you are below median income, then you do not have to \npay any of them back. If you make above median income and you are able \nto pay some of those debts back, you should do so.\n  That is a reasonable approach. The Senator's amendment, whereas it \nmight be well-intentioned, is curious and I do not believe is helpful \nto this bill. I oppose it.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the current \nbankruptcy reform bill, S. 420, as written and reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee last week. Let me say from the outset that I \nsupport many aspects of bankruptcy reform. I support the right of \nfinancial service companies to have reasonable protection from spurious \nclaims of bankruptcy, from outlandish loopholes that leave some assets \nuntouchable. I support the right of consumers to have better protection \nfrom aggressive credit card solicitations and other offers of easy \ncredit that can easily trap people into massive debt. I support reforms \nthat strike the proper balance--and that is the key word, balance--\nbetween the needs of business in America and the needs of consumers. \nThat is why I oppose this bankruptcy bill in its current form. I \nsincerely hope the Members of the Senate will be open to some of the \namendments offered in a good faith effort to make this a better bill.\n  A little over 4 years ago, I served on the Judiciary subcommittee and \nwas ranking Democrat when my chairman, Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, \njoined with me in preparing a bipartisan bill which passed on the floor \nof the Senate with an overwhelming vote. If my memory serves me, over \n97 Members voted in support of that bankruptcy reform. I was proud to \njoin in that vote because I believed that the bill was balanced, was \nhonest, would reform the system, and do it in a sensible fashion.\n  Sadly, the conference committee that was called between the House and \nthe Senate after passage of that bill literally did not allow \nparticipation by every Senator. Figuratively, there was a sign outside \nthe door that said, ``Democrats not allowed.'' Then the bill came back \nfrom the conference committee with no input from the Democratic side of \nthe aisle, was brought to the floor, President Clinton threatened a \nveto, and the bill basically languished in the Senate.\n  Two years later, another effort was made. This time, I was not part \nof the committee process. Senator Torricelli\n\n[[Page S1938]]\n\nof New Jersey played that role. He and Senator Grassley also worked on \na bill with amendments added that I believed could be supported again. \nIt received a substantial vote on the floor of the Senate, went into \nthe meat grinder of the conference committee, and came out loaded with \nprovisions which, frankly, were unfair to consumers across America. \nPresident Clinton threatened a veto of that bill, and it basically sat \non the calendar until it was far too late for any action to be taken.\n  That is an indication of the history of an effort to modify and \nreform the bankruptcy system but to do it in a bad way. I believe my \ncolleague, Senator Grassley, who is on the floor at this moment, and \nother Senators have come to this process in good faith. I think we have \na chance with this bill, and some good amendments to it, to bring forth \na piece of legislation that may not please everyone in the credit \nindustry--it certainly won't please everyone who is fighting for the \nrights of consumers across America--but tries to strike a balance, a \nfair balance so both sides give something and ultimately justice is \nserved.\n  This constant theme has guided me through the years in the bankruptcy \ndebate--balanced reform. I do not believe you could have meaningful \nbankruptcy reform without addressing both sides of the problem: \nIrresponsible debtors and irresponsible creditors.\n\n  I agree that many people who go into bankruptcy court file to abuse \nthe system, to game the system, to avoid their responsibility to pay \ntheir just debts. I believe that is the case, and this is certainly an \narea in need of responsible reform.\n  Particularly urgent is the need to address abuses by those who have \nconsiderable assets and are using bankruptcy with impunity as a \nfinancial shield. I am thinking here of those infamous cases where \nwealthy homeowners sink their assets into properties that are protected \nfrom discharge during bankruptcy, or criminals who declare bankruptcy \nto escape financial penalties they brought on themselves by their \ncrimes.\n  But there are abuses and imbalances on the other side of the ledger \nas well. Financial abuses are certainly not limited just to those who \nowe money. Those who make it their business to extend credit can step \nover the line as well: Financial service companies extending credit \nwell beyond a debtor's ability to pay and then expecting Congress to \nbail them out from their unsound lending practices; special interests \nwho seek protection for their specific piece of the assets pie without \nconsidering issues of basic fairness or the need to leave some debtors \nwith enough assets for critical family obligations such as paying child \nsupport. I think we are all aware of this situation. I don't believe we \nshould ration credit in America.\n  I believe that we have a moral and legal obligation to inform \nconsumers of their responsibilities and let them make sensible, well-\ninformed decisions about their credit limits.\n  Those of us who go home regularly and open mail to find another \ncredit card solicitation understand that this industry literally \nshowers America with billions of solicitations for new credit card debt \nvirtually every year. Many people who are being offered credit cards, \nfrankly, shouldn't take another credit card. They are in over their \nheads. Many of these companies that are trying to lure them into their \ncredit operation don't think twice about it. They, frankly, don't care \nhow many credit cards you have. They would like to see you take another \ntwo credit cards and pile them on their own credit card, even if you \nhad a turn of bad events--lost your job, went through a divorce, or \nmaybe incurred some medical bills you never expected.\n  Financial predators praying on the most vulnerable members of society \nusing deceit to lure them into usurious transactions should not be \nrewarded in this law.\n  Central to the debate on this issue must be the question, What are we \nreally trying to solve? If the problem is the increase in filing of \npersonal bankruptcies, then we ought to take a look at the numbers. \nPerhaps this problem is starting to resolve itself.\n  When we began the bankruptcy debate several years ago, bankruptcy \nfilings were not only up but they had reached record-setting levels.\n  When the credit industry first came to me with their issue, they \nsaid: We just can't understand why we are having 25 or 30-percent \nincreases of bankruptcy filings every year. In a situation where the \nprosperity of this country is well documented, why are so many people \ngoing to bankruptcy court? Many of them should not. There were 1.44 \nmillion bankruptcy filings in calendar year 1998, of which 1.39 \nmillion, or 96.3 percent, were consumer bankruptcies.\n  Let me see if I can find the chart to show that.\n  This shows the national bankruptcy data by chapters of those filing. \nYou can see by this number that the filings in 1997 under chapter 7 \nwere 989,372, reaching a higher level of over 1 million in 1998, coming \ndown in 1999, and down further still in the year 2000. The same trend \ncan be found in the same filings for chapter 11 and chapter 13 as well.\n  What we see then is that over time, this problem, without the passage \nof Federal legislation, has started to resolve itself. I can't predict \nwhat the year 2018 will show. If this slowdown in the economy results \nin more filings, it is fairly predictable. If we were worried about \npeople who were taking advantage of the bankruptcy system in good times \nwho really didn't need to--we can see that there has been a decline in \nthe number of filings even before we consider the current legislation--\nno one can say what the future is going to bring in terms of filings. \nWe all recognize that the economic climate is uncertain.\n  Nevertheless, the data on hand suggests that the so-called explosion \nof personal bankruptcies has come to an end even without this \nlegislation.\n  As I said a moment ago, there are areas of bankruptcy law that are \nstill in need of reform. Three years ago, I worked to develop a \nbipartisan, balanced bankruptcy bill that addressed irresponsible \ndebtors and irresponsible creditors. Ninety-eight Senators voted for \nit. They agreed that that legislation eliminated abuses on both sides \nof the ledger while making available information that permitted \nconsumers to make an informed financial decision. That bill was \ndecimated in conference, as I mentioned.\n\n  Our bill in the 105th Congress included debtor-specific information \nthat would enable credit card holders to examine their current credit \ncard debt in tangible, real, and understandable terms driving home the \nseriousness of their financial situation.\n  My idea was very basic and simple. Every credit card statement ought \nto say that if you make the minimum monthly payment required by this \ncompany, it will take you x number of months to pay off the balance. \nWhen you pay it off, this is how much you will have paid in interest \nand how much you will have paid in principal.\n  When I made this suggestion, the credit card industry said that it \nwas impossible for them to calculate their information; and if they had \nto do this on every monthly statement, it was well beyond their means.\n  I find this incredible, in the day and age of technology and \ncomputers, when calculations are being made instantaneously, that they \ncould not put on each monthly statement how many months it would take \nto pay off the balance if only the minimum monthly payment was made. I \ndon't believe it; never have. I think they are ducking their \nresponsibility. They don't want consumers to know if they make that \nminimum monthly payment, they are never going to pay off the balance. \nIt might take 8 years. They end up paying a lot more interest than \nprincipal.\n  Why is this important for consumers? Frankly, so they will be \ninformed. They may think twice about making the minimum monthly payment \nif they cannot afford it. They may think twice about adding more credit \nto their card. They will be informed consumers making judicious \ndecisions instead of people making decisions without the information \navailable.\n  I don't think the credit card industry is showing good faith. This is \nan amendment which they should accept. It would be a good-faith \nindication to me that they are prepared to go that extra step not to \nissue credit but to inform creditors. They have been refusing to do it.\n  This bill also fails to close the homestead loophole. The homestead \nloophole is a State-by-State creation. In\n\n[[Page S1939]]\n\neach State, the decision is made as to what they can really accept from \nbankruptcy; in other words, what can be protected for you personally if \nyou file for bankruptcy.\n  One of the areas is the so-called homestead exemption for your home; \nyour residence. Each State has a different standard. Some States are \nvery strict and some are wide open.\n  Under this bill, someone renting or someone with less wealth will get \nto keep nothing. But a home owner who has equity in a home that has \nexisted prior to the 2-year cutoff can keep all of his equity. Failing \nto put a real hard cap on this provision only benefits the rich.\n  My colleague, Senator Kohl of Wisconsin, has said on many occasions \nthat we ought to get rid of this exemption because fat cats go out and \nbuy magnificent homes, ranches, and farms and call it their home and \nplow everything they have into them and say to the creditor that they \nhave nothing to put on the table. It is a mistake. Simply to say if \nthey owned it 2 years they are off the hook, I don't believe that is \nenough.\n  There is another provision in this bill relative to a system known as \ncram-down. The cram-down provision we have in the current bill as \nwritten is not final. Not only does it go too far, but it actually goes \nbeyond the well-targeted provision originally proposed by the credit \ncard industry. This is a very complex area of bankruptcy.\n\n  I note the two people in the rear of the Chamber. One is Natacha \nBlaine, an attorney on my staff, and Victoria Bassetti on my staff, who \nhave spent several years trying to make sure I understood this \nprovision. It is complicated. But it is very important.\n  There is an area where we shouldn't let complexity mask the \nunbalanced nature of the cram-down provision currently in the bill.\n  Take a look at current law. Under the bankruptcy code, a secured \ncreditor is given favored treatment for the value of the collateral \nthat secures the claim. Further, many nonpurchase money security \ninterests--where credit was not extended to purchase a specific item--\ncan be eliminated.\n  Or claims of abuse. When we first began the bankruptcy debate, the \ncredit card industry came to us with claims that debtors were \nintentionally taking on secured debt for items such as automobiles, \nwhich experience a rapid decrease in value once they are driven off the \nlot, and immediately declaring bankruptcy.\n  In order to address this issue, the industry initially proposed that \nsecured creditors would be protected for the amount of the loan if the \nbankruptcy was declared within 6 months of such purchase. Thus, as an \nautomobile loses value when being driven off the lot, to the extent \nsuch abuse was taking place, the 6-month period would fully protect the \ncreditor.\n  Congress listened to the credit card industry concerns with respect \nto cram-down, and adopted the original proposal incorporated in earlier \nversions of the bill. Although I opposed the amendment in the provision \nin the committee markup, the language was unfortunately unchanged.\n  What does the current bankruptcy bill do? The cram-down provision as \nwritten in the current bill would prohibit the use of cram-down chapter \n13 for any debt incurred within 5 years before bankruptcy for purchase \nof a motor vehicle, and for any debt incurred within 12 months of \nbankruptcy for which there is any other collateral. This provision is \nunjustly tipped in favor of the credit industry, providing little or no \nprotection for debtors.\n  Let me try to put all of this legal language into simple terms.\n  You buy a car. You don't have much money, but you need a car to go to \nwork. As soon as you drive the car off the lot--whether it is new or \nused--it starts depreciating in value. You reach a time later on where \nyour debts have mounted to the point where you can't make your car \npayment or a lot of other payments. You are not going to file in \nchapter 7 to try to be absolved of all your debts; you go to chapter \n13. You say: I am going to try to pay back what I can pay back. One of \nthe things I want to keep in this bankruptcy is my car because I can't \ngo to work without my car, and I can make money to pay back other \ncreditors under chapter 13.\n  The court takes a look at the car and says: You might have paid \n$10,000 for it, but that was several years ago. Now that car is only \nworth $8,000. So if the company you bought it from took repossession of \nthe car, the most they could get out of it is $8,000. So we will give \nthat company a secured interest, preference in bankruptcy, for the \n$8,000 value, and the fact that you still owe $2,000 on it will be in \nthe unsecured claims--a little harder to collect on. You end up with \nyour car. You end up paying the credit card company back the value of \nthe car as you have it, and you go to work. I think it makes sense.\n  You are a person in chapter 13 who said: I am going to try to pay \nback my debts. But now the credit industry has come in and said: Not \ngood enough. If you bought that car within 5 years of filing for \nbankruptcy, then you have to pay the entire balance on your secured \nclaim. We are not going to look at the real value of the car; we are \ngoing to look at the paper value of your debt.\n  So a person who wants to keep their car and go to work ends up being \na loser.\n  A 5-year period is totally unreasonable. That is why I think this \nprovision does not really recognize creditors who are stuck and trying \nto get themselves out of a bad situation.\n  Keep in mind, the average person filing for bankruptcy has an annual \nincome of around $22,000, $23,000 a year. These are not wealthy people \nthrowing money around, by and large. They are people who have gotten \ninto circumstances they cannot control because of medical bills or a \ndivorce and a lost job. If they go to chapter 13, they are doing their \nlevel best to pay off the debts. This bill, as presented to us today, \npenalizes those people. I think that is wrong. I am going to offer a \nprovision to change that.\n  Let me tell you of another area----\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator from Illinois yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I heard the Senator earlier speaking about the problem the \ncredit card companies say they have in declaring that if you pay the \nminimum amount what ultimately you are going to owe. I recall the \nSenator from Illinois made the same point in the Judiciary Committee \nmarkup. It struck me that the Senator from Illinois was correct in \nsaying this will be a good thing to put on the credit card.\n  So I asked a couple people who do programming in computers. I said: \nThe Senator from Illinois has been told they can't extrapolate this; \nthey can't put it on the bill. They said: Bull feathers. That's not the \ncase at all. They said: This is the easiest thing to do. They have \nteenage interns in their company who would be glad, if you just gave \nthem a couple access codes in the credit card companies, to show them \nhow to program that.\n\n  If you can program what the minimum payment is--and the minimum \npayment might come out to something like $118.39, because it is a \ncertain percentage of the overall, which might be $1,229.81--you are \ndealing in such strange numbers; every credit card bill is different, \nevery minimum payment is different, but they said with the same program \nthat set that up, you can basically put in a couple more lines of code \nand it can be figured out.\n  I mention this because I think that is the same experience the \nSenator from Illinois has had. I mention it because he is so absolutely \nright on this. This is not going to add any burden to the credit card \ncompanies. It is not going to be an additional cost to them because \nthey already have the computers making the basic computations that are \nnecessary.\n  Frankly, my question is this: Is it not the studied position of my \nfriend from Illinois that if the credit card companies want to let you \nknow how much you are on the hook with them for, they can easily do it?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is exactly right. The Senator from Vermont \nunderstands, as I do, that occasionally people find themselves in a \ndifficult position where they can only make the minimum monthly payment \nin a given month. They have bad circumstances and they are having a \ntough time of it. I understand that. I think that is something that may \nhappen to any family. But you ought to do it with your eyes wide open, \nso you realize if you do this repeatedly, making the minimum\n\n[[Page S1940]]\n\nmonthly payment month after month, you will never get out of the hole; \nthe hole may be there for 7 or 8 years.\n  Now, why is the credit card industry so reluctant to tell consumers \nthe truth? There was a law passed several decades ago called Truth in \nLending. This credit card provision that I am supporting is ``truth in \ncredit cards,'' so they will at least give consumers the information so \nthey can decide what is best for them and their families. They may \ndecide they had better pay off all the balance. Maybe they do not need \nan extra credit card. They can make a responsible decision.\n  This whole debate about bankruptcy got started when the credit \nindustry came to my office and said they thought bankruptcy had lost \nthe moral stigma it once had: Too many people are flooding the \nbankruptcy courts, and they are not very embarrassed by it.\n  I can tell you, the attorneys and the trustees and the judges to whom \nI have spoken dispute that. They find people showing up in these courts \nvery sad about the circumstances that surround them. They have done \ntheir level best with small businesses and their families, and they are \nin over their heads and have nowhere to turn. They have a family \ntragedy they didn't anticipate--usually a medical bill they can't pay--\nand they wish they never had to be in bankruptcy court.\n  I also turned to the credit card industry and said: If we are talking \nabout a moral stigma, what is your moral responsibility when it comes \nto flooding America with credit card applications? When it comes to \nyoung people in America, who do not have any source of income, \nreceiving solicitation after solicitation for credit cards, don't you \nhave some responsibility to make sure you are not extending credit \nbeyond a person's ability to pay? They will not accept that \nresponsibility.\n  Why is it that they focus on college students, for example? They \nbelieve in brand loyalty. They think if you are in college and you \ndecide to take a Visa card, or a MasterCard, or a Discover card, or an \nAmerican Express card, that is going to be your favorite brand of \ncredit. They want to get you early. And some sad things have resulted.\n\n  Senator Feinstein of California and I are going to offer an amendment \na little later. The amendment is going to set a cap on the total amount \nof credit available to young people through their credit cards. It is a \nsensible measure that protects college students and other young adults \nwho are at an age when many are getting their first taste of personal \nand financial independence. It protects the companies issuing the \ncredit cards from having their customers assume far more debt than they \nare able to handle.\n  I do not need to tell you there is an epidemic of credit card default \namong young people today, especially on college campuses. I can go to a \nUniversity of Illinois football game in Champaign. I go into the \nstadium, go up the ramp, and at the top of the ramp someone is waving a \nT-shirt at me that says ``University of Illinois.'' And I can say: What \nis this all about? They say: If you will sign up for a University of \nIllinois credit card, we will give you a free T-shirt. They are doing \neverything they can to lure students to these credit cards.\n  Then you go to places such as the University of Indiana, and the dean \nof students says more students drop out due to credit card debt than to \nacademic failure.\n  What are the statistics on young people filing bankruptcy in America? \nIn the early 1990s, only 1 percent of all personal bankruptcies were \nfiled by people under the age of 25. By 1996--just a few years later--\nthat figure increased to 8.7 percent--more than an eightfold increase \nin the proportion of young, college-age people filing for bankruptcy.\n  Remember, my friends, student loans are not dischargeable in \nbankruptcy. So if you go into a bankruptcy court because you are in \nover your head with a credit card, you still have your student loan \nhanging after you have left the court. That, to me, says we have a \nscandalous situation on our hands that the credit card industry is \nexploiting. The amendment Senator Feinstein will offer a little later \naddresses it.\n  Let me give you one illustration. Sean Moyer got his first credit \ncard at age 18, when he was a student at the University of Texas. Sean \ncommitted suicide at age 22, after he ran up more than $14,000 in debt \non his credit cards. His mother told CBS News the following:\n\n       It just did not occur to me that you . . . would give a \n     credit card to an 18-year-old, who was . . . making minimum \n     wage [at a job]. I never thought that he would end up with, I \n     think it was two Visas, a Discover, a MasterCard. When [Sean] \n     died, he had 12 credit cards.\n\n  Sean was a smart kid, a National Merit Scholar winner. He was on his \nway to law school. But in many ways he was a young boy who succumbed to \nthe temptation of easy credit.\n  As his mother went on to say:\n\n       Anybody that has 18-year-olds knows they are not adults \n     [many times]. I don't care what the law says. They are 18 one \n     minute. They are 13 the [next]. Here they are in college, \n     their first time away from home. They're learning to [try to] \n     manage their money.\n\n  We ought to keep people such as Sean Moyer and these young men and \nwomen in our mind as we talk about bankruptcy reform. That is why \nSenator Feinstein's amendment makes so much sense. It sets a reasonable \ncredit cap for all credit cards. We are not saying a young person can't \nhave a credit card. We are talking about unlimited credit, that we get \na young person with literally no job with debt of $14,000 or more. This \nis a reasonable extension of credit for these young credit card \nholders. It is indexed to the consumer price index to adjust to \ninflation.\n  As a further protection, we have in the amendment the statement that \nif you happen to have the cosignature of your parent or guardian, you \nmight have more credit offered to you.\n  These simple measures would protect our young people from getting in \nover their heads with multiple credit cards. It is no surprise that the \ncredit industry hates this like the Devil hates holy water. The idea \nthat they can't go out and lure and hook in all of these young people \nat a vulnerable point in their lives is something of which they are \nfrightened. They are going to oppose the Feinstein amendment.\n  Let me talk for a moment about moral stigma, the moral stigma of \npeople with an average income of $22,000 a year going to bankruptcy \ncourt, heartbroken over medical bills or divorce or loss of job. How \nabout the moral stigma of these credit card companies, wallpapering \ncollege campuses with credit cards the kids just can't keep up with. I \nknow Senator Feinstein plans to reoffer her amendment on the floor. \nSenator Jeffords and I are cosponsors of this sensible, bipartisan \namendment. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Balance is certainly the order of the day in this debate. We are a \nnew Congress with a balanced 50/50 Senate. We have a new President, \nfaced with the challenge of uniting an evenly divided electorate. We \nhave a new and real opportunity to work together to pass genuine \nbankruptcy reform, reform that is balanced, meaningful, and fair.\n  In a few moments I will send to the desk an amendment to the \nbankruptcy bill aimed at another area of abuse which should be \nresolved. It is directed particularly to what is known as predatory \nlending practices. Much of our discussion concerning reform of the \nNation's bankruptcy laws is focused on the perceived abuses of the \nbankruptcy system by consumers and debtors. Much less discussion has \noccurred with regard to abuses by creditors who help usher the Nation's \nconsumers into bankruptcy.\n  I believe there are abuses on both sides and that bankruptcy reform \nis incomplete if it does not address both sides. Studies have \nidentified a host of predatory financial practices directed at the \nNation's financially vulnerable. These studies suggest that many low-\nincome Americans participate in a virtual fringe economy. They may lack \naccess to mainstream banks and financial institutions. They may lack \nthe collateral or the credit rating needed to secure loans for a home, \nto buy a car, pay for home repairs, or other essential needs. This \nvulnerable segment of our economy is at the mercy of a variety of \ncredit practices by a variety of offerors that can lead to financial \nruin.\n  High-pressure consumer finance companies have bilked unsophisticated \nconsumers out of substantial sums by aggressively marketing expensive \nloan insurance products, charging usurious interest rates, urging \nrepeated refinancing, and loading their products\n\n[[Page S1941]]\n\nwith hidden fees and costs. High cost mortgage lenders have defrauded \nmillions of older Americans with modest income but substantial home \nequity of their lifelong home ownership investments. Senator Grassley \nof Iowa, who has been the chairman of the Senate Special Committee on \nAging, has held hearings, heartbreaking stories of elderly people, \nusually women living alone, who are preyed upon by these companies that \ncome in and lure them into signing documents they barely understand for \nrepair of their homes with terms and conditions that are unfair by any \nstandard.\n\n  Some auto lenders in the used car industry have gouged consumers with \ninterest rates as high as 50 percent, with assessments for credit \ninsurance, repair warranties, and hidden fees, adding thousands of \ndollars to the cost of an otherwise inexpensive used car. Pawnshops in \nsome States have charged annual rates of 240 percent or more to \ncustomers who have nowhere else to turn for small short-term loans. \nAbusive credit practices of every stripe harm millions of older and \nlow-income Americans every single year.\n  During the committee debate on S. 1301, I offered an amendment \ndesigned to address and curtail just one bad practice among many \npredatory high-cost mortgage loans targeted at the low-income elderly \nand the financially unsophisticated. This amendment was adopted \nunanimously on a previous bill and was stripped out in conference. The \ncredit industry did not want us to even go after the bottom feeders in \ntheir business, the people who prey on the elderly and uninformed.\n  I will reoffer this language today as an amendment to this bankruptcy \nbill. This is the exact same language that was in the 1998 bankruptcy \nbill that passed the Senate 97-1. It is also the same language that \nmany of my colleagues, including Senator Grassley and Senator Specter, \nvoted for in the 106th Congress. It is my hope that they will join me \nin supporting this amendment again.\n  In recent years there has been an explosion on the market for this \ntype of home mortgage, generally for second mortgages that are not used \nto fund the purchase or construction of a home. The market is known as \nthe subprime mortgage industry. The subprime mortgage industry offers \nhome mortgage loans to high-risk borrowers, loans carrying far greater \ninterest rates and fees than conventional loans and carrying extremely \nhigh profit margins for the lenders.\n  According to the Mortgage Market Statistical Annual for the year \n2000, subprime loan originations increased from $35 billion in 1994 to \n$160 billion in 1999.\n  As a percentage of all mortgage originations, the subprime market \nshare increased from less than 5 percent in 1994 to almost 13 percent \nin 1999. This is not an isolated incident. This is a trend, a trend \nwhere people are preying on vulnerable consumers across America, \nusually widows, usually elderly women, ultimately trying to take away \ntheir homes in bankruptcy court.\n  We are considering a bankruptcy reform bill where we are supposed to \nbe eliminating abuses? For goodness' sake, should we not eliminate the \nuse of the predatory lending which we see is growing by leaps and \nbounds in this country?\n  By 1999, outstanding subprime mortgages amounted to $370 billion. \nHome Mortgage Disclosure Act data shows a substantial growth in \nsubprime lending. The number of home purchase and refinance loans \nreported under HMDA by lenders specializing in subprime lending \nincreased almost tenfold between 1993 and 1998, from 104,000 to \n997,000. I will relate a few stories in a moment that will illustrate \nthe kinds of loans, the kinds of, what I consider, extremely corrupt \npractices by the credit industry that are rewarded in bankruptcy court.\n  You will see when this amendment comes up for a vote if the credit \nindustry itself, which prides itself on being a major financial \ninstitution in America, is willing to step forward and point out the \nwrongdoers within its own ranks. Sadly we have seen over the last \nseveral years they were not.\n  The growth of the subprime lending industry is of concern to us for \ntwo reasons: First, because of their reprehensible practices called \npredatory lending practices, which some of these companies use to \nconduct their business; second, because of the vulnerable people \ninvolved, senior citizens, low-income people, the financially unwary to \nwhom they often target their loans.\n  According to 1998 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data, low-income \nborrowers accounted for 41 percent of subprime refinance mortgages. \nAfrican-American borrowers accounted for 19 percent of all subprime \nrefinance loans. In 1998, when Senator Grassley held the hearing I \nreferred to earlier with the Special Committee on Aging, several people \ncame forward to tell their stories.\n  William Brennan, director of the Home Defense Program of the Atlanta, \nGA, Legal Aid Society, put a human face on this issue and this \namendment. He told us of the story of Genie McNab, a 70-year-old woman \nliving in Decatur, GA.\n  Mrs. McNab is retired. She lives alone on Social Security and \nretirement. In November of 1996, a mortgage broker contacted her and, \nthrough this mortgage broker, she obtained a 15-year mortgage loan for \n$54,000 from a large national finance company. Her annual percentage \nrate was 12.85 percent. Listen to the terms of the mortgage. She will \npay $596.49 a month until the year 2011, when she will be expected, and \nrequired, to make a final payment of $47,599.14--a balloon payment for \nan elderly lady living on Social Security. By the time she is finished \nwith this mortgage that this fellow convinced her to sign for, her \n$54,200 loan will have cost her $154,967, and she faces a balloon \npayment of almost $48,000 at the end.\n  When Ms. McNab turns 83 years old, she will be saddled with this \nballoon payment that she will never be able to make. She will face \nforeclosure of probably the only real asset in her life--something she \nhas worked for her entire life--and she will be forced to consider \nbankruptcy. She will face the loss of her home and her financial \nsecurity, not to mention her dignity and sense of well-being. \nIronically, she had to pay this mortgage broker a $700 fee to find her \nthis ``wonderful'' loan--a mortgage broker who also collected a $1,100 \nfee from the mortgage lender.\n  Unfortunately, Ms. McNab is a typical target of the high-cost \nmortgage lender--an elderly person, living alone, on a fixed income. \nShe is just the kind of person who may suddenly have encountered the \ndeath of a spouse and the loss of income, a large medical bill, an \nexpensive home repair, or mounting credit card debt. All of these \nthings could push her over the edge, just making regular monthly \npayments, not to mention a $48,000 balloon payment, at the age of 83.\n  These are all real-life circumstances which make her an irresistible \ntarget for some of the most unscrupulous members of the mortgage \nindustry in America.\n  According to a former career employee of this industry who testified \nanonymously at a hearing before Senator Grassley's committee, ``My \nperfect customer would be an uneducated woman who is living on a fixed \nincome--hopefully from her deceased husband's pension and social \nsecurity--who has her house paid off, is living off credit cards but \nhaving a difficult time keeping up with her payments, and who must make \na car payment in addition to her credit card payments.''\n\n  This industry professional candidly acknowledged that unscrupulous \nlenders specifically market their loans to elderly widowed women, \npeople who haven't gone to school, who are on fixed incomes, have a \nlimited command of the English language, and people who have \nsignificant equity in their homes.\n  They targeted another such person right here in Washington, DC, by \nthe name of Helen Ferguson. She also testified before Senator \nGrassley's committee. She was 76 years old at the time. This is what \nshe told us: As a result of predatory lending practices, she was about \nto lose her home. In 1991, she had a total monthly income of $504 from \nSocial Security. With the help of her family, she made a $229 monthly \nmortgage payment on her home. However, on a fixed income she didn't \nhave enough money for repairs. She started listening to radio and TV \nads about low-interest home improvement loans. She called one of the \nnumbers. She thought she had signed up for a $25,000\n\n[[Page S1942]]\n\nloan. In reality, the lender collected over $5,000 in fees and \nsettlement charges for a $15,000 loan.\n  Again, describing the predatory cases, Ms. Ferguson decided she \nneeded to take out a loan. She thought she was borrowing $25,000. After \nthe fees, she was borrowing $15,000. She was living on $500 a month in \nSocial Security. The interest rate the lender charged her was 17 \npercent. Her mortgage payments went up to $400 a month--almost twice \nher original payment. Over the next few years, this lender repeatedly \ntried to lure Ms. Ferguson into more debt. He called her at home, \ncalled her sister at home and at work, and he sent her letters, and, \nGod bless him, he even sent a Christmas card. In March of 1993, she \ngave in to this lender, borrowing money to make home repairs.\n  By March of 1994, she could not keep up with her mortgage payments. \nShe signed for a loan with another lender, unaware that it had a \nvariable interest rate and terms that caused her payments to rise to \n$600 a month and eventually to $723 a month. Remember, $500 a month was \nher Social Security income. She is now up to $723 a month in mortgage \npayments. For this loan, she paid $5,000 in broker fees and more than \n14 percent in total fees and settlement charges. The first lender also \ncontinued to solicit her. She eventually signed up for even more loans. \nEach time, the lender persuaded her that refinancing was the best way \nout of her predicament.\n  Ms. Ferguson was the target of a predatory loan practice known as \nloan flipping.\n  Why is this an important discussion in the middle of a bankruptcy \nbill? Because, frankly, these bottom feeders make terrible loans to \nvulnerable people who ultimately end up in bankruptcy court, taking \naway the homes of people such as Ms. Ferguson.\n  I have tried to convince my colleagues on the committee that if we \nare going to reform the bankruptcy code, for goodness' sake, why would \nwe reward people who are making these terrible arrangements with \nelderly, low-income people, with limited education, and taking away the \nonly thing they have on Earth--their homes?\n\n  When I say this to the financial industry and the credit card \nindustry, they say, ``You just don't understand the free market.'' The \nfree market? This isn't a free market. This is some of the worst \ncorruption, worst credit practices in America. We are about to protect \nthem with this bill.\n  Let me tell you what Senator Grassley said about it when he held this \nhearing back in 1998. My colleague from Iowa has a lot of Midwestern \nwisdom to share here:\n\n       What exactly are we talking about when we say that equity \n     predators target folks who are equity rich and cash poor? \n     These folks are our mothers, our fathers, our aunts and \n     uncles, and all people who live on fixed incomes. These are \n     people who often times exist from check to check and dollar \n     to dollar, and who have put their blood, sweat, and tears \n     into buying a piece of the American dream and that is their \n     own home.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Before we begin this hearing, I want to quote a victim--a \n     quote that sums up what we are talking about here today. She \n     said the following: ``They did what a man with a gun in a \n     dark alley could not do: they stole my house.''\n\n  That is Senator Grassley talking about predatory lenders, who are \nprotected by this bankruptcy bill. That is why I am offering this \namendment. They don't deserve this protection. Ms. Ferguson was \neventually obligated to make more than $800 monthly payments, although \nher income was $500--and the lenders knew it from the start. In 5 \nyears, the debt on her home--this elderly lady living on Social \nSecurity--increased from $20,000 to over $85,000.\n  She felt helpless and overwhelmed. It was only after contacting AARP \nthat she realized these lenders were violating the Federal law.\n  Lump-sum balloon payments on short-term loans, loan flipping, the \nextension of credit with a complete disregard for the borrower's \nability to repay--these aren't the only abusive mortgage practices. \nLenders on these secondary mortgages sometimes include harsh repayment \npenalties in the loan terms, or rollover fees and charges into the \nloan, or negatively amortize the loan payment so the principal actually \nincreases over time--all of which is prohibited by law, although \nordinary homeowners are unlikely to even know that. Some of these \nhomeowners will make it to a lawyer and get help before it is too late. \nMany of them will be forced into bankruptcy court. They will walk into \nthat court, and this slimy individual and his company, which has given \nthem this terrible loan that violates the law, will stand up proudly, \nthrough his lawyer, and take it all away.\n  This bill will not even address that issue unless the Durbin \namendment is adopted.\n  On March 5, US News & World Report featured a telling article in \ntheir business & technology section entitled: ``Sometimes a deal is too \ngood to be true: Big-bank lending and inner-city evictions.'' In the \narticle Jeff Glasser describes two cases that originate from my home \nstate of Illinois that I want to share with you.\n  The first involves Goldie Johnson. The lender was Equicredit, a \nsubsidiary of Bank of America:\n  Goldie Johnson is a 71-year-old homeowner who lives on the Westside \nof Chicago with her daughter and 4 grandchildren. Her income is $1,270 \na month from Social Security and pension. Between June 1996 and March \n1999, Ms. Johnson entered into at least three refinancing agreements \nwith various subprime lenders and brokers.\n  In March, Ms. Johnson was contacted through a phone solicitation by a \nmortgage broker, who promised Ms. Johnson that she could get a new loan \nthat would refinance her two existing mortgages, provide her with \n$5,000 in extra cash and lower her monthly mortgage payments. Ms. \nJohnson was in desperate need of cash to repair her kitchen. She agreed \nto meet with the broker.\n  She met with broker twice. On second visit she was presented with a \nmyriad of papers to sign.\n  Ms. Johnson, who suffers from glaucoma was not able to read the \ndocuments carefully. In fact, after looking over only a few of the \npapers she stopped because her eyes became too tired to continue.\n  Nonetheless, based on the broker's promises and representations that \nthe loan would provide her with cash to repair her kitchen and lower \nher mortgage payments, Ms. Johnson signed the loan documents. She was \nnot provided with copies of any of the documents.\n  The mortgage documents created a loan transaction between Ms. Johnson \nand Mercantile for the principal amount of $90,000 with an annual \npercentage rate of 14.8 percent.\n  The transaction created a 15-year loan with monthly mortgage payments \nof $994.57, excluding taxes and insurance, with a balloon payment on \nthe 180th month of $79,722.61.\n  The monthly mortgage payment was 80 percent of this retired lady's \nincome.\n  The final balloon payment--the amount of principal owed after Ms. \nJohnson pays the lender approximately $1,000 a month over 15 years--was \ngreater than the secured debt on her home before she entered into this \nagreement.\n  Ms. Johnson received no proceeds from the transactions. The broker \nand lender received at least $9,760 in points and fee from the loan. \nEquicredit is now attempting to foreclose on Ms. Johnson's home.\n  Then the case of James and Clarice Mason, the lender was Fieldstone, \nthen Household.\n  James Mason, age 62, with his wife Clarice who died on June 8, 1999, \nowned and lived in his home on the west side of Chicago since 1971.\n  In 1991, the Masons successfully paid off the original mortgage on \ntheir home.\n  In 1993, Mrs. Mason became disabled due to diabetes and arthritis.\n  In 1995, Mr. Mason became disabled due to a stroke. The stroke has \nleft Mr. Mason with brain damage that has impaired his memory and \nthinking.\n  In November 1998, Mr. and Mrs. Mason's home was free and clear of all \nliens.\n  On or about the end of November 1998, they were repeatedly solicited \nfor home repair work. Mrs. Mason eventually agreed to meet with home \nrepair company and later mortgage broker. They promised the necessary \nrepairs would cost $15,000 and that the broker would help them find \nfinancing.\n  On December 6, 1998, about a week after completing the loan \napplication, Mrs. Mason was hospitalized for complications arising from \nher diabetes.\n\n[[Page S1943]]\n\n  On December 7, 1998, Mrs. Mason was visited at the hospital by a \nbroker who explained that he had come to visit Mrs. Mason and to help \nher complete her loan transaction. What a wonderful person. He then \npresent Mrs. Mason with numerous documents and told Mrs. Mason to sign \nthem. The agent of the company provided Mrs. Mason with no opportunity \nto review the documents, but assured her that this was the loan she had \n``discussed'' with New Look that would allow her home to be repaired.\n  Mrs. Mason, although unclear about what she was signing, signed all \nthe documents provided by the agent because she trusted him. She \nbelieved he was trying to help.\n  At the time she signed the loan documents, Mrs. Mason was in a \ndisoriented state due to her severe illness. At the time she signed the \nloan documents, Mrs. Mason's vision was impaired because of a cataract \non one of her eyes. At no time was Mr. Mason, co-owner of the home, \nasked to sign any of the loan documents. Nonetheless, Mr. Mason's \nforged signature appears on the mortgage agreement. The documents that \nwere ``signed'' created a 30-year loan agreement, with a principle of \n$70,000.\n  Under the terms of the loan, Mr. and Mrs. Mason's monthly mortgage \npayment was to start at $601.41 and adjust upward to $697.\n  Remember, this is an elderly couple retired with their home all paid \nfor, and to get $15,000 worth of repairs on their home, they signed on \nto a mortgage that cost them about $700 a month.\n  Under the terms of the loan, Mr. and Mrs. Mason were charged at least \n$7,343 in prepaid finance charges.\n  The home contractor received $35,000.\n  The Masons received no money.\n  Work was barely started and never completed.\n  A suit was filed against the home repair company, broker, and two \nlenders.\n  After the suit, the home was severely damaged by a suspicious fire.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this US News & World \nReport article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From U.S. News & World Report, March 5, 2001]\n\n                Sometimes a Deal Is too Good To Be True\n\n                           (By Jeff Glasser)\n\n       Chicago.--One day in March 1999, mortgage broker Mark \n     Diamond arrived on Goldie Johnson's west-side doorstep, his \n     portable photocopier in tow. Here's the 72-year-old retiree's \n     version--from court papers and interviews--of how Diamond's \n     promise to save her thousands of dollars may end up costing \n     Johnson her home: He told her that if she refinanced her \n     mortgage, he could cut her debts and get her up to $8,000 in \n     cash. With the money, she could fix her rotting kitchen \n     floors and replace the rickety basement beams. But to get the \n     cash, she had to act fast. (She believed him. He said he was \n     ``in the business of helping senior citizens.'') He handed \n     her a thick stack of loan papers. Johnson, who suffers from \n     glaucoma, says she could barely read them. ``Don't worry \n     about it,'' he said. So she signed, 13 times.\n       Johnson says she never saw any cash. The loan she signed \n     saddled her with monthly payments of $994.57--about $200 more \n     than she had been paying--and consumed about 80 percent of \n     her fixed income. A balloon payment of $80,000 would be due \n     the year Johnson turns 86. Meanwhile, Diamond's company fee \n     for selling the loan came to $9,010. ``I've heard of sticking \n     people up with guns, not with pens,'' says Johnson, who \n     cannot pay the mortgage and is fighting to save her home from \n     foreclosure in court. Diamond disputed her account and denied \n     wrongdoing through his lawyer.\n       What's unusual about the case of Goldie Johnson is that she \n     wasn't simply the alleged victim of a fast-talking predator. \n     Her loan was sold to a company called EquiCredit, a \n     subsidiary of the Bank of America, a prestigious institution \n     not often linked to inner-city evictions. But Bank of America \n     is one of a number of the nation's top commercial banks, \n     including Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase, that have \n     recently inked deals with subprime lenders--companies that \n     offer loans to people with less than perfect credit. Subprime \n     loans promise profit margins far greater than do low-interest \n     conventional mortgages.\n       This foray by the big banks coincides with a surge in the \n     number of subprime loan defaults. Certainly not all subprime \n     loans are predatory. But foreclosures in the Chicago area by \n     subprimes have risen from 131 in 1993 to 4,958 in 1999, \n     according to the National Training and Information Center, a \n     watchdog group. Consumers in other areas are also complaining \n     about lending abuses, causing more than 30 states and dozens \n     of cities to consider curbs on predatory lending.\n       The upswing in defaults poses a double challenge for the \n     big banks: They must fend off hundreds of lawsuits brought \n     against their subsidiaries. As they do so, they will be asked \n     to bring better practices to an industry derided as \n     ``legalized loan sharking'' by detractors.\n       The tactics are all too familiar. Critics call one the \n     ``bait'' scam: In Philadelphia, where the 3,226 foreclosures \n     last year were almost double the number in 1997, a poor \n     veteran named Leroy Howard says in bankruptcy papers that he \n     was lured into refinancing his mortgage with an offer of \n     $4,000 in cash and debt relief. When he accepted, his \n     mortgage doubled in size to $40,000, including $9,040 in new \n     fees and charges. Howard's attorney charges the lender made \n     the loan even though it was aware Howard could not repay it; \n     a notation in his file says he would use the cash for food. \n     Citigroup, which acquired the loan's servicing rights, \n     settled the case.\n       There's the hard sell: In Chicago, it is alleged in court \n     that a home improvement contractor, along with a mortgage \n     broker, went to a local hospital and persuaded a woman \n     admitted there to refinance on unfavorable terms. ``You \n     couldn't tell him no that day,'' says Valerie Mason, daughter \n     of the woman, who has died.\n       The banks don't condone these tactics. ``Small, \n     unscrupulous lenders don't have to follow the rules,'' says \n     Howard Glaser, chief lobbyist for the Mortgage Bankers \n     Association. The responsible lenders ``get tainted by what \n     the bad actors do.'' The major lenders--including Citigroup \n     and Bank of America--argue that subprime lending doesn't bilk \n     the innocent or gut neighborhoods. Far from it, they say: The \n     vast majority of the loans help people with bad credit to \n     repair their homes and settle their debts. A decade ago, \n     homeowners with imperfect credit would have paid 5 to 10 \n     percentage points more for loans, they say, if they could get \n     a loan at all. The banks also claim that the number of \n     predatory lending cases is minuscule, though consumer \n     advocates disagree. (There are no national data to resolve \n     that dispute.)\n       Flipping and packing. The taint of predatory lending hasn't \n     deterred major banks from entering the growing subprime \n     market. There were 856,000 subprime loans issued in 1999, six \n     times as many as in 1994. Those loans often produce margins \n     eight times those of conventional mortgages, although there's \n     a greater risk of default and higher servicing costs. Banks \n     can make more money by packaging subprime loans as mortgage-\n     backed securities and selling them to mutual funds.\n       But can the major banks help curb bad practices? Citigroup \n     will be the largest test case. In November, the company \n     completed a $27 billion acquisition of Associates First \n     Capital, which was spending $19 million to fight more than \n     700 lending lawsuits. The suits spotlight more questionable \n     tactics. For example, Associates established quotas for \n     refinancing loans over and over, or ``flipping'' them, with \n     no benefit to the consumer, former company employees \n     testified. (Its motto, according to the court papers: ``A \n     loan a day or no pay.'')\n       Another common practice, employees said, was the \n     ``packing'' of costly insurance products into the price of a \n     loan. Consider the testimony of Rick McFadden, a branch \n     manager in Tacoma, Wash. When he failed to tack on the \n     insurance, the boss would crumple a piece of paper into the \n     phone. ``You hear that?'' the boss would say. ``That's your \n     loan. It doesn't have any insurance on it. . . .'' And into \n     the trash it would go. A Citigroup spokesman declined to \n     comment on the testimony but said the issues ``have been \n     addressed in the pledges we've made.'' Citi settled a Georgia \n     class-action ``packing'' lawsuit in January for $9 million \n     and, U.S. News has learned, a similar suit in Pennsylvania. \n     In reforms announced last fall (including caps on fees and \n     improved training), the company condemned the practices of \n     ``packing'' and ``flipping.''\n       Still, victims seeking restitution are having a hard time \n     figuring out who is to blame. In Goldie Johnson's case, her \n     loan was solicited by Diamond but ended up in EquiCredit's \n     portfolio. The Bank of America subsidiary then tried to \n     foreclose on Johnson. The company claimed in court, however, \n     that it was not responsible for tactics used to sell the \n     original mortgage. (Since the lawsuit was filed, the loan has \n     been sold again.) The insulation of the banks rankles legal-\n     aid lawyers. ``At some point, the ostrich defense doesn't \n     work,'' says Johnson's attorney, Ira Rheingold.\n       While lawyers and lenders duke it out, once stable \n     neighborhoods in places like Maywood, Ill., a working-class \n     Chicago suburb, are filled with boarded-up houses resulting \n     from foreclosures. Resident Delores Rolle, 51, says gang \n     members from the Latin Kings took over an abandoned house, \n     put up drapes, and used it for drug dealing. ``This has been \n     a nightmare,'' says Rolle. ``It's Beirut around here.''\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. As demonstrated in these cases, the people soliciting \nthese loans have won their trust and confidence, and the homeowners are \nreluctant to believe that they have been so ruthlessly taken in.\n  Just this morning the Washington Post reported that the Federal Trade \nCommission sued the Associates, a lending unit of Citigroup, for its \npredatory lending practices.\n  This is not just an occasional storefront operation. The growth of \nthese\n\n[[Page S1944]]\n\npredatory loans tells us we are dealing with a national phenomenon. \nThis is what they said at the FTC about this group from Citigroup \ncalled Associates:\n\n       ``They hid essential information from consumers, \n     misrepresented loan terms, flipped loans [repeatedly offering \n     to consolidate debt into home loans] and packed optional fees \n     to raise the costs of the loans,'' said Jodie Bernstein, \n     director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. The \n     practices, she said, ``primarily victimized . . . the most \n     vulnerable--hardworking homeowners who had to borrow to meet \n     emergency needs and often had no other access to capital.''\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article from today's \nWashington Post be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From The Washington Post, March 7, 2001]\n\n                   FTC Sues Lending Unit of Citigroup\n\n\n                 associates accused of ``abusive'' acts\n\n                         (By Sandra Fleishman)\n\n       The Federal Trade Commission yesterday sued a recently \n     acquired arm of financial giant Citigroup Inc., accusing it \n     of deceiving often cash-strapped home-equity borrowers \n     through ``systematic and widespread abusive lending \n     practices.''\n       The case is the largest ever brought for abusive or \n     predatory lending by the FTC, the government's chief \n     consumer-protection agency. If the case is proven, the FTC \n     estimates that it could result in hundreds of millions of \n     dollars in refunds to tens or hundreds of thousands of \n     borrowers.\n       The suit filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta names New \n     York-based Citigroup, CitiFinancial Credit Co. and the \n     acquired companies, Associates First Capital Corp. and \n     Associates Corp. of North America, collectively known as \n     Associates.\n       Associates, which specialized in loans to higher-risk \n     borrowers, was one of the nation's largest home-equity \n     lenders when Citigroup bought it in November for $31 billion. \n     It was then wrapped into the bank's CitiFinancial unit.\n       Yesterday's action was sought by consumer activists, who \n     for years labeled Associates as the worst predatory lender in \n     the country.\n       The FTC has been investigating Associates since at least \n     1998, when the company was a subsidiary of Ford Motor Co. \n     Ford eventually spun it off.\n       In a statement issued yesterday, Citigroup said, ``We \n     regret that we have been unable to resolve the FTC claims \n     regarding past practices of the Associates without \n     litigation.''\n       The statement also said: ``From the time we announced our \n     intent to acquire Associates, we indicated our full \n     commitment to resolve concerns that had been raised about \n     their business. To date, we have reached out to nearly a \n     half-million customers including every Associates home loan \n     customer, and we will continue these outreach efforts.''\n       According to the FTC suit, Associates' aggressive marketing \n     ``induced consumers to refinance existing debts into home \n     loans with high interest rates, costs and fees and to \n     purchase high-cost credit insurance.''\n       ``They hid essential information from consumers, \n     misrepresented loan terms, flipped loans [repeatedly offering \n     to consolidate debt into home loans] and packed optional fees \n     to raise the costs of the loans,'' said Jodie Bernstein, \n     director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. The \n     practices, she said, ``primarily victimized . . . the most \n     vulnerable--hardworking homeowners who had to borrow to meet \n     emergency needs and often had no other access to capital.''\n       The suit seeks financial redress but doesn't specify an \n     amount, ``If all of the charges are proven [the amount] could \n     be much more than $500 million,'' Bernstein said. That number \n     is drawn from the Associates financial reports, which show \n     earnings of more than $500 million from 1995 to 1999 in \n     single-premium credit life insurance premiums alone.\n       Single-premium credit life insurance, which enrages \n     consumer groups, is paid upfront through a home loan, rather \n     than monthly.\n       Because such insurance was factored into the loans, it \n     added ``hundreds or thousands of dollars to consumers' loan \n     costs,'' and in many instances ran out years before the home \n     loan did, the FTC said. Credit life insurance is a way to \n     cover the borrower's loan payments in the case of death, \n     illness or loss or employment. But the FTC said Associates \n     employees did not always mention or explain products and \n     discouraged consumers from refusing them.\n       Federal and state regulators cleared the way for the \n     Citigroup-Associates merger last year despite consumer \n     groups' pleas that Citigroup first be required to agree to \n     specific steps to protect consumers.\n       Yesterday, consumer groups welcomed the FTC suit but sought \n     further action.\n       ``The FTC case backs up what we've been saying, that \n     Associates has been ripping off homeowners across the \n     country,'' said Maude Hurd, president of the Association of \n     Community Organizations for Reform Now.\n       Citigroup's stock closed yesterday at $48.63, up 38 cents, \n     on the New York Stock Exchange. John Wimsatt, who tracks \n     Citigroup for Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group Inc., said \n     strong investor confidence in the company reflects \n     ``consensus estimates that it will earn about $15.8 billion'' \n     in 2001 and the belief that the company, aware of the FTC \n     investigation, either put money into reserves to cover the \n     litigation ``or factored it into the purchase price.''\n       Most of the other 14 predatory lending cases the FTC has \n     brought since 1998 have been settled. One case still in \n     litigation involves Washington-based Capital City Mortgage \n     Corp.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. The problem of predatory financial practices in the high-\ncost mortgage industry is relevant to bankruptcy because it is driving \nvulnerable people into bankruptcy. These people are not entering \nbankruptcy in order to abuse the system. They are filing bankruptcy \nbecause the reprehensible tactics of unscrupulous lenders have driven \nthem into insolvency and threatens their homes, cars, and other \nnecessities; frankly, everything they own on Earth.\n  My amendment prohibits a high-cost mortgage lender that extended \ncredit in violation of the provisions of the Truth-In-Lending Act from \ncollecting its claim in bankruptcy.\n  I repeat this because the credit industry which opposes this \namendment, opposes the following: A suggestion by me that if you have \nmade a high-cost mortgage loan and in doing so violated the provisions \nof the Truth in Lending Act, you cannot go into bankruptcy court and be \nprotected by the laws of the United States. If you violated the law to \ncreate this mortgage, then the bankruptcy court law will not protect \nyou. It is that simple. You wonder why these major credit companies and \nfinancial institutions oppose this amendment. They say: If you get your \nnose under the tent, Durbin, we don't know where you are going next.\n  I suggest to them that they ought to look outside their tent for a \nmoment at some of the scummy practices of people who say they are also \ntheir brothers and sisters in the mortgage credit industry. They should \nnot make excuses for them and expect the American people to trust the \nmortgage credit industry when they tell us they have the best interest \nof consumers in America in their hearts.\n  The result of my amendment will be that when individuals like Genie \nMcNab, Helen Ferguson, Goldie Johnson, or the Masons, goes to the \nbankruptcy court--seeking last-resort help for the financial distress \nan unscrupulous lender has caused her--the claim of the predatory home \nlender will not be allowed.\n  If the lender has failed to comply with the requirements of the Truth \nin Lending Act--a law created by Congress and signed by the President--\nfor high-cost second mortgages, the lender will have absolutely no \nclaim against the bankruptcy estate.\n  My amendment is not aimed at all subprime lenders or all second \nmortgages. Indeed, it is only aimed at the worst, most predatory scum-\nsucking bottom feeders in this industry. My provision is aimed only at \npractices that are already illegal under the law. It does not deal with \ntechnical or immaterial violations of the Truth in Lending Act. \nDisallowing the claims of predatory lenders in bankruptcy cases will \nnot end these predatory practices always. But for goodness sake', why \nshould we come to this floor and pass a law to protect these people? It \nis one step we can take to curb credit abuse in a situation where the \nlender bears primary responsibility for the deterioration of a \nconsumer's financial situation.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 17\n\n  Mr. President I send my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator seeking consent to set aside \nthe pending amendment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, I ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 17.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of the \namendment be dispensed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To make an amendment with respect to predatory lending \n                   practices, and for other purposes)\n\n        At the end of subtitle A of title II, add the following:\n\n[[Page S1945]]\n\n     SEC. 204. DISCOURAGING PREDATORY LENDING PRACTICES.\n\n       Section 502(b) of title 11, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (8), by striking ``or'' at the end;\n       (2) in paragraph (9), by striking the period at the end and \n     inserting ``; or''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(10) the claim is based on a secured debt, if the \n     creditor has failed to comply with any applicable requirement \n     under subsection (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), or \n     (i) of section 129 of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. \n     1639).''.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I represent to Members of the Senate that \nmy description of this amendment is very simple. Senator Grassley is on \nthe floor, and I can say his hearings before the Select Committee on \nAging regarding predatory lending have inspired us to offer this \namendment. Some of the statements he made during the course of those \nhearings about the abuses of predatory lending and the victims across \nAmerica have led us to offer an amendment on the floor of the Senate to \nthe bankruptcy bill to say these people who are taking advantage of \notherwise good citizens should not be allowed the protection of the \nbankruptcy court. If they violate the law in creating this debt, they \nshouldn't be able to hide behind the bankruptcy law when they go to \ncourt.\n  I hope even my friends in this Chamber who feel very strongly about \nthe credit and financial industry, during the course of the \nconsideration of this debate on this amendment, will at least find some \nsympathy and understanding for people such as those I have described--\ngood, hard-working Americans living in retirement who have been \nvictimized by people engaged in illegal practices. I hope we can adopt \nthis amendment as part of the reform of our bankruptcy system to keep \nin mind some of the victims of the credit system from some of the worst \nperpetrators.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nresume consideration of the pending Leahy amendment No. 13 at 5:30 pm \nand there be up to 20 minutes equally divided in the usual form.\n  I further ask consent that at the conclusion of this debate, the \namendment once again be laid aside and the Senate resume consideration \nof the Wellstone amendment No. 14 and there be up to 60 minutes equally \ndivided in the usual form.\n  I further ask consent that at the conclusion of the debate on the \nWellstone amendment, the Senate proceed to vote in a stacked sequence \non or in relation to the Wellstone amendment, to be followed by a vote \non or in relation to the Leahy amendment, and that no amendments be in \norder to either amendment.\n  Further, I ask that there be 2 minutes equally divided for closing \nremarks prior to the second vote in the series.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. As a result of this agreement, at least two back-to-back \nvotes will occur at 6:50 this evening. So I put all colleagues on \nnotice that we will have at least two back-to-back votes.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 17\n\n  Mr. President, as I understand it, the amendment of the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois, the predatory lending amendment, takes away the \nlender's right to satisfy a claim to get paid on the debtor's \nbankruptcy if there was any ``material'' Home Ownership Equity \nProtection Act violation. The Home Ownership Equity Protection Act is \nnot a predatory lending law. Any attempt to characterize it as such is \nmisleading and inflammatory.\n  Many legitimate lenders--banks, community banks, and finance \ncompanies--make home equity loans which fall under this act, codified \nsection 129 in the Truth in Lending Act. Section 129 recognizes a \nlegitimate sector of the home lending market, certainly one that is not \n``predatory'' and already provides ample protection for consumers, both \nin the form of disclosures and substantive prohibitions and remedies \nfor violations of this act.\n  First, this is a banking amendment. This is outside the jurisdiction \nof this committee. Second, and more importantly, this amendment is \nproblematic in its effect in a number of ways. For instance, it will \nadversely affect the availability of credit to certain consumers, many \nof whom may be low income and minorities whom this amendment purports \nto protect. Moreover, the secondary markup for such mortgages will also \nbe affected, thereby placing upward pressure on the pricing of such \nloans.\n  A number of the horror stories given are already covered by current \nlaw, and we should be enforcing those laws.\n  It appears this amendment, though seemingly well meaning, might \ncreate more problems than it might remotely solve. Already there are \nnumerous protections and built-in super-remedies afforded the borrowers \nunder the Homeownership and Equity Protection Act. For example, a \nconsumer can rescind any loan that violates the provision. This alone \ntakes care of any conceivable problem in bankruptcy. Furthermore, all \nmaterial violations result in civil liability under the Home Ownership \nEquity Protection Act and enhance civil remedies such as ``an amount \nequal to the sum of all finance charges and fees paid by the consumer, \nunless the creditor demonstrates that the failure to comply is not \nmaterial,'' in addition to actual damages, statutory damages, \nattorney's fees, and costs.\n\n  Furthermore, to justify the harsh punishment it creates, in addition \nto those penalties already available in the Home Ownership Equity \nProtection Act, this amendment does not even require any finding that \nsuch a violation was the cause of the debtor going into bankruptcy.\n  That is not good law. That is not the way we should be making law. \nNor does it require that a violation of the Home Ownership Equity \nProtection Act had to have been found for this draconian remedy to take \nplace.\n  The result, I am afraid, will be litigation within a bankruptcy \nproceeding and a bankruptcy judge passing judgment on Federal lending \nlaws. Furthermore, I don't know why every debtor will not allege a \nviolation of the Home Ownership Equity Protection Act in the hopes of \nwinning this lottery of getting your home mortgage wiped out for even \nminor violations which did not contribute in any way to the bankruptcy \nof the debtor.\n  This is just plain bad policy. We can't permit this type of an \namendment on this bill. It is one thing to use rhetoric about predatory \nlenders, but I believe the current law takes care of that, and, \nfrankly, I don't think we should try to disturb it with an amendment \nthat doesn't do the job and, in fact, can do an awful lot of harm.\n  We have to oppose the sincere amendment of the distinguished Senator. \nI hope our colleagues will vote it down. It would cause tremendous \nproblems.\n  Last, but not least, I know my colleague is not trying to do this--or \nat least I believe he is not trying to do this--but this would lead to \nall kinds of unnecessary litigation, unnecessary failures, to be able \nto resolve problems as they arise and, frankly, fly in the face of good \nbankruptcy legislation.\n  I think the bill and current law in the bill, combined, do take care \nof some of the problems about which the distinguished Senator is \nconcerned. But his amendment would cause an awful lot of problems. In \nthe end I think all it would do is lend a lot of solace to a lot of \nlawyers who want to make a lot of money off what clearly are not \nreasons for the bankruptcy.\n  We have to oppose this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I briefly respond to say to my friend from Utah, keep in \nmind the people you are protecting by opposing this amendment. Keep in \nmind the institutions which you are trying to protect by opposing this \namendment.\n  These are people who are preying on our parents and grandparents, \nliving in their retirement, subjected to loan terms and conditions that \nare outrageous by any moral standard.\n  We are saying is, after they have perpetrated these frauds to the \npublic, after they have literally threatened to take away a home from a \nretired person with a loan that is unconscionable and violates the law, \nwe want them to have free rein in bankruptcy court to pursue their \nclaim.\n  I don't think that is right. Why in the world is this Senate spending \nits good time and the money of taxpayers on hearings involving \npredatory lending, coming up with all of these wonderful speeches about \nhow terrible these people are, and when we have a chance in the \nbankruptcy law to finally do something to stop these awful\n\n[[Page S1946]]\n\npredatory lending practices, we refuse? We refuse.\n  All of the moral indignation we were able to muster in these \ncommittee hearings about the outrageous examples of what is happening \nto senior citizens and low-income people, we forget as soon as we come \nto the floor and start talking about a bankruptcy law.\n  I don't care about committee jurisdiction. That may be an issue to \nsome; it is not to me. I am more concerned about the people who expect \nbankruptcy code reform to be sensitive to borrowers as well as lenders. \nI hope my colleagues in the Senate will support my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator from Florida yield for one last comment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, when we had this amendment in the \ncommittee, it had to be a substantive violation. The current amendment, \nas we view it, would provide for triggering with even a technical \nviolation. That would be catastrophic in bankruptcy law. We just cannot \nsupport this amendment.\n  I know the distinguished Senator is trying to do something \nworthwhile, and I do not believe there should be predatory lending any \nmore than he does, but I do think we take care of it in this bill. But \nunder this current amendment, it is even worse than the amendment he \nwas prepared to offer in committee because even a technical violation \nwould trigger what he wants to do. So I just need to make that point \nfor the record, and I am happy to yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask, immediately upon the completion of \nmy remarks, my colleague, Senator Corzine, be recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Reserving the right to object, I ask Senators how much \ntime they intend to take?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. We will take approximately 15 minutes apiece.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Graham and Mr. Corzine pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 481 are located in today's Record under ``Statements \non Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 17, as modified\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I send to the desk a modification of the \namendment by the Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin. I am advised \nthat this modification has been cleared with Senator Hatch and his \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, reads as follows:\n\n        At the end of subtitle A of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 204. DISCOURAGING PREDATORY LENDING PRACTICES.\n\n       Section 502(b) of title 11, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (8), by striking ``or'' at the end;\n       (2) in paragraph (9), by striking the period at the end and \n     inserting ``; or''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(10) the claim is based on a secured debt, if the \n     creditor has materially failed to comply with any applicable \n     requirement under subsection (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), \n     (g), (h), or (i) of section 129 of the Truth in Lending Act \n     (15 U.S.C. 1639).''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know we are waiting for other Members to \ncome to the floor. It is interesting. I have listened to the outpouring \nof grief following the tragic events in Southern California, the \nshooting in the high school. As a parent, I obviously look at that and \ncan only begin to imagine the terror that was in the hearts of the \nparents of all the children there--not knowing from the initial reports \nwhether their child was alive or injured. And then, of course, it had \nto be the worst grief any parent could feel to find out their children \nhad been killed.\n  I could not help but think of my own son, who teaches high school in \nthat area. But one has to think of anybody, whether they know them, are \nrelated to them or not, in such a case because the whole country is \ninvolved. It is almost a John Donne reference in this case, and I think \nof this body having intense debate a couple of years ago after the \ntragedy at Columbine. It was actually one of our better debates. We \ndiscussed--both Republicans and Democrats--the fact that there are a \nnumber of different causes--no one magic thing, no one cause that sends \na young person out to do such a terrible, almost inexplicable deed; and \nin each of these instances when they have happened, and in those \ninstances where the police have caught somebody prior to it happening, \nthere is not a common denominator.\n  If there was some matrix that you could apply to each one of these, \nit would be, I suppose, easy enough to stop them. But there isn't. It \nis not just a question of stricter laws, not just a question of more \nteachers, not just a question of more security; it is not just a \nquestion of gun laws. But there are parts of each of those. What was so \ngood about the debate on the juvenile justice bill, which became the \nHatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill, is that we referred to each aspect \nand we debated and voted on everything from counseling for juveniles to \nstricter laws on juveniles, closing the gun show loophole, providing \ntools for teachers and communities. We passed the bill by overwhelming \nmargin. It got 73 votes. I think we can all feel that we had done \nsomething for the country.\n  But the bill never came back. It was never voted on again. It went \ninto a conference committee and never came out. There was never a vote \nthere. Yet I wonder, if you are a parent, and you see a child killed, \nand you think that at least some things could be done to stop this from \nhappening somewhere else, if you would not think that would be a top \npriority. We obviously thought it was at a time when this Senate was \nprobably embroiled in the most partisan divisions that I have seen in \n25 years. You would think that it would because we had 73 votes. This \nwas a case where Democrats, Republicans, liberals, and conservatives, \ncame together and we passed this bill.\n  But then a decision was made somewhere, and it never came back. It \nwas never voted on again and was never signed into law because the \nCongress decided never to act on it again. It was a hollow promise to \nthe parents and the teachers and the children of America. We lost any \nsense of urgency on this bill that got 73 votes.\n  But we passed the bankruptcy law--a flawed bankruptcy law, in my \nview--last year. That got 70 votes, less votes than juvenile justice \nand, by God, we have to bring it right back up here again--not because \nthe owners of the credit card companies are being shot at or their \nchildren are being shot at, not because they are all going out of \nbusiness. In fact, they have record profits and will have greater ones \nunder this bill because the commercial interests have been heard rather \nthan the interests of parents, children, and teachers.\n\n  I mention this in passing. I know there are others on the floor \nseeking recognition, and I will yield in a moment.\n  If the Senate is to be the conscience of this Nation, don't we have \nto sometimes ask ourselves what are our priorities? How can any parent, \nhow can any Senator, how can any American, with the carnage in our \nschools or on our streets, look at some of the terrible things \nhappening with our youth and ask, Why are we in such a hurry to pass a \npiece of commercial special interest legislation and we cannot bring \nourselves to take the final step across the finish line on the juvenile \njustice bill?\n  I cannot accept that, and, frankly, it is not that sense of priority \nthat brought me from my State of Vermont to serve in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today we are debating an extremely \ncomplicated and extremely important piece of legislation, the \nbankruptcy reform\n\n[[Page S1947]]\n\nbill. With the exception of a small number of amendments adopted by the \nJudiciary Committee last week, S. 420, the bill before us, is the same \nbill that President Clinton vetoed last year. The passing of a few \nmonths, and the change of Presidents has not made this bill any better, \nor more fair, or more balanced, or more worthy of this Congress than \nwas the one we passed last year. It is still a bad bill and I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose it.\n  Supporters of the bill have put enormous pressure on the Congress to \nact quickly and pass the bill again because President Bush has \nindicated he will sign it. The majority wanted to bring the bill \ndirectly to the floor without going through committee, notwithstanding \nthe fact that we have a very different Senate after the last election. \nWe had to fight for every moment of committee consideration. We did \nsucceed in convincing the majority that the Judiciary Committee should \nconsider the bill in committee. We had a quick hearing, and a markup, \nand I think the bill was improved in the process. Then, the same day \nthat we voted the bill out of committee, the majority leader sought \nconsent to bring the bill up on the floor. I am sorry this rush to \njudgment is happening. I believe this bill is bad policy, and I believe \nwe will come to regret passing it.\n  I respectfully suggest that having a new President who is inclined to \nsign the bill ought to put more pressure on the Senate to do its job in \na thoughtful and balanced way, not less. In the past two Congresses, it \nhas been my impression that the Republican majority has made decisions \non the substance of this bill in order to stake out a negotiating \nposition vis-a-vis the White House. Twice it has ignored the work done \nby the Senate on the floor and come up with a conference vehicle that \nwas designed to provoke a veto. In 1998, for example, we passed a bill \nthrough the Senate by a vote of 97-1. That is the way bankruptcy reform \nshould be done and has been done in the past. But the majority ignored \nthat bill and brought what was essentially the House bill back from \nconference, and it failed to become law. Again last year, on issue \nafter issue, including two crucial points--Senator Kohl's homestead \namendment and Senator Schumer's clinic violence amendment, where the \nSenate had spoken by clear bipartisan majorities--the bill that came \nback from the shadow conference was tilted more to the House bill, and \nthe bill was vetoed.\n  This time there is no administration to push back in negotiations. \nThis time, the bill will not be a product of compromise with the \nadministration. This time the majority will bear responsibility for \nwhat it produces and passes. This time for sure we should listen to the \nexperts who have been telling us to slow down and be careful.\n  Amending the bankruptcy code used to be a nonpartisan exercise, where \nthe Congress listened to experts--practitioners and law professors and \njudges and trustees, and made careful considered judgments about how \nthe law should work. Now it seems as if we ignore the experts and \ninstead do what the credit industry wants us to do. We use \nparliamentary tactics to avoid reasoned consideration. Those tactics \nharm the bill, and discredit the Senate.\n  Let me now turn to the substance of this legislation. I believe S. \n420 will do terrible damage to the bankruptcy system in this country, \nand even more importantly, to many hard-working American families who \nwill bear the brunt of the unfair so-called ``reforms'' that are \nincluded in this bill. This is a harsh and unfair measure pushed by the \nmost powerful and wealthy lobbying forces in this country, and it will \nharm the most vulnerable of our citizens.\n  First, let me talk about what is not in this bill, which is directly \nrelated to the fact that powerful special interests have shaped it. As \nI have said a number of times, this bill is not a balanced piece of \nlegislation. The interests that are the strongest supporters of this \nbill, the credit card companies and the big banks, succeeded in \nlimiting the provisions that will have any effect on the way they do \nbusiness. These interests gave us and our political parties millions of \ndollars of campaign contributions and they like the results they \nachieved in this bill.\n  If we are going to pass a credit card industry bailout bill, the \nleast we can do is to help save the industry from itself by taking some \nsteps to make sure that consumers are made more aware of the \nconsequences of taking on ever increasing amounts of debt. We have the \nchance in this bill to require credit card companies to be more open \nwith consumers about the consequences of running a balance on a card, \nbut so far we have not done it. We need more prevalent and more \ndetailed disclosures on credit card statements and solicitations. There \nare limited disclosure requirements in this bill, but they don't go \nnearly far enough in my opinion. I am afraid the main reason they do \nnot is the power of the credit card companies.\n  I will speak about this topic again because I am sure there will be \namendments offered to improve the disclosure provisions in the bill. \nAnd at that time, I will also call the bankroll on this bill, because \nthe political contributions made by the industry supporters of this \nbill are truly extraordinary.\n  There is another thing missing in this bill. Remember, this bill is \nsupposedly designed to end abuses of the bankruptcy system by people \nwho really can afford to pay off more of their debts. But the biggest \nabuses, and all the experts agree on this, come when wealthy people in \ncertain states file for bankruptcy by taking advantage of very large or \neven unlimited homestead exemptions that are available in their States. \nSome people with large debts even move to a State like Florida or Texas \nwhere there is an unlimited homestead exemption, specifically for the \npurpose of filing for bankruptcy.\n  The National Bankruptcy Review Commission and virtually all leading \nacademics believe that homestead exemptions are being abused and a \nnational standard is needed. And by a vote of 76-22, the Senate adopted \nin the last Congress an amendment from my colleague the senior Senator \nfrom Wisconsin to close the loophole. That amendment would have put a \n$100,000 cap on the amount of money that a debtor can shield from \ncreditors through the homestead exemption.\n  That amendment was stripped out of the bill during last year's secret \nconference and replaced by a weak substitute. The bill limits the \nhomestead exemption to $100,000, but only for property purchased within \ntwo years of filing for bankruptcy. That means that wealthy debtors can \nplan for bankruptcy by moving to an unlimited homestead exemption \nstate, buying a palatial estate, and then just put off their creditors \nfor two years before filing bankruptcy. If they do that, they can \ncontinue to shield millions of dollars in assets and throw off their \ndebts with a bankruptcy discharge. The bill will have no effect on this \nabuse of the bankruptcy system. This bill does not close the homestead \nexemption loophole that people like Burt Reynolds and Bowie Kuhn have \nfamously used in the past.\n  Once again, supporters of this bill chose to ignore reforms that \nwould give this bill some balance. Somehow the interests of wealthy \ndebtors who use the homestead exemption to abuse the bankruptcy system \nare more important than the interests of hardworking Americans who \nthrough no fault of their own--whether from a medical catastrophe, or \nthe loss of a job, or a divorce, are forced to seek the financial fresh \nstart that bankruptcy has made possible since the beginning of our \nRepublic. I will, of course, support Senator Kohl when he offers his \noriginal and stronger amendment on the homestead exemption. Any \nbankruptcy bill that does not deal with homestead exemption abuse is \nsimply not worthy of being called bankruptcy reform.\n  It is interesting and very revealing to contrast the treatment by \nthis bill of wealthy homeowners who abuse the bankruptcy system with \nhow the bill that was introduced treats poor tenants who need the \nprotection of the bankruptcy system to keep from being thrown out on \nthe street while they try to get their affairs in order. As I \nmentioned, the provision dealing with the homestead exemption is \nvirtually meaningless. At the same time, the bill President Clinton \nvetoed includes a draconian provision that denies the bankruptcy stay \nto tenants trying to hold off eviction proceedings, even if they are \nable to pay their rent while\n\n[[Page S1948]]\n\nthe bankruptcy is pending. I think this provision is purely punitive. \nIt will have no impact at all on getting debtors to pay past due rent. \nIt will result in the eviction of people who are not abusing the \nbankruptcy system, but who are trying to use it for exactly the purpose \nfor which it was intended--to get a fresh start and become once again \nproductive members of our society.\n\n  When the bankruptcy bill was before the Senate in the last Congress, \nI tried very hard to pass an amendment that would have made the bill \nless harsh on tenants while at the same time denying the protection of \nthe automatic stay to repeat filers who are abusing the system. I \nmodified the amendment to take account of some reasonable hypothetical \nsituations that the Senator from Alabama came up with. But the realtors \nstrongly opposed my amendment. And the Senate rejected it by a nearly \nparty line vote. That was unfortunate. It confirmed my view that this \nbill is not balanced. It is not rational. It's about punishing people, \nnot just stopping the abuses that we all agree should be stopped.\n  So I offered my amendment again in Committee this year, and with the \nhelp of Senator Feinstein, we actually succeeded in committee in \neliminating the unfair and harsh provision of the bill section of the \nbill and replacing it with a provision that is fair to both landlords \nand tenants. Mr. President, I sincerely hope that my colleagues will \noppose any attempt to eliminate the Feingold-Feinstein amendment that \nthe Judiciary Committee adopted.\n  Now let me turn to what proponents view as the central feature of \nthis bill, the means test. After much work, I believe this feature of \nthe bill is still flawed and unfair. The means test is the mechanism \nthat the bill's proponents believe will force people who can really \nmanage to pay some portion of their debts into Chapter 13 repayment \nplans instead of Chapter 7 discharges. The means test requires every \ndebtor to file detailed information on their expenses and income which \nis then analyzed according to a formula. Those who pass the means test \ncan file a Chapter 7 case; those who fail would have to file under \nChapter 13.\n  The bill includes an important ``safe harbor'' for debtors who are \nbelow the median income. The means test does not apply to them. That is \na good thing, since studies show that only 2 or 3 percent of debtors \nwould be required to move from Chapter 7 to Chapter 13 under the means \ntest. But even with that ``safe harbor,'' the bill has significant \nproblems. First, the bill specifies that for purposes of determining \nthe safe harbor, the median income for each individual state should be \nused, rather than the higher of the state or national median income. \nThis will unfairly disadvantage people who live in high cost areas of \nlow median income states. Furthermore, in the Senate bill in the last \nCongress, we included a safe harbor from creditor motions that applied \nto people with income less than either the national or the median \nincome. The people who drafted the final bill that President Clinton \nvetoed and that has been reintroduced ignored that standard. I doubt \nthey really believe it will mean that more abusers of the system will \nbe caught by the means test. But they did it anyway, giving further \nevidence of the arbitrary nature of this bill.\n  In addition, the means test still employs standards of reasonable \nliving expenses developed by the Internal Revenue code for a wholly \ndifferent purpose. These standards are too inflexible to be fair in \ndetermining what families can live on as they go through a bankruptcy. \nThey are arbitrary. And they are also ambiguous with respect to things \nlike car payments because they were not designed to be used in this \ncontext. We have pointed this out repeatedly over the past few years, \nbut the sponsors of the legislation have insisted on using these \ninflexible IRS standards.\n  The safe harbor from the means test also inexplicably counts a \nseparated spouse's income as income available to a mother with children \nwho has filed for bankruptcy, even if the spouse is not paying any \nchild support. This can't be fair. Mothers filing for bankruptcy \nbecause their spouses have left them are treated for purposes of the \nsafe harbor as if the spouse's income is still available to them. That \nis what this bill does. It makes no sense. It's arbitrary and punitive. \nAnd while I have heard that there may be some interest in fixing this \nproblem, I understand that the credit industry objected when they tried \nto do that in the House. So we will see just how strong the industry is \nhere in the Senate when an effort is made to correct this terrible \ninjustice in the bill.\n  Perhaps the thing that is most curious about the means test is that \nwhile we now have a safe harbor for lower income people, they still \nhave to fill out all the same paperwork, doing all of means test \ncalculations using the IRS expense standards. Why is that? If the \nintent is to exempt lower income debtors from the means test, why have \nthem go through the means test anyway? The burden of the means test for \nthese people is not the result--a tiny percentage would ever be sent to \nChapter 13 because of it. No, it's the burdensome paperwork that is the \nproblem. In our hearing, Bankruptcy Judge Randall Newsome made this \npoint very powerfully. He said:\n\n       If S. 220 must contain the means test as presently drafted, \n     then debtors whose incomes are below the applicable median \n     should be entirely insulated not only from its application, \n     but from its paperwork requirements as well.\n\n  Here is an example of the problem of making people go through the \nmeans test even though they are exempt from it. This bill would deny \nthe protection of bankruptcy to a single mother with income well below \nthe state median income if she doesn't present copies of income tax \nreturns for the last three years, even if those returns are in the \npossession of her ex-husband. I can see no justification for this \nresult whatsoever.\n\n  So for those supporters of the bill who trumpet the safe harbor, I \nask you: Why doesn't the bill apply the same safe harbor to creditor \nmotions as the Senate bill did, and why doesn't it exempt people who \nfall within the safe harbor from the paperwork requirements? I have yet \nto hear reasonable answers to those questions, which leads me to \nbelieve that there are no reasonable answers. This bill is arbitrary, \nand it is punitive.\n  This bill also includes a number of ``presumptions of \nnondischargeability'' provisions, which basically say, ``these debts \ncan't be discharged in bankruptcy because we think they look like \npeople are running up bills in contemplation of bankruptcy.'' In other \nwords, they are abusing the system. They are accumulating debt with no \nintention of paying it off.\n  The problem is that these presumptions are unfair. So instead of \nbeing a deterrent to abuse of the system, they are simply a gift to the \ncredit industry, and a harsh punishment to hard working people trying \nto do the best they can to meet their obligations to their families. \nOne such provision creates a presumption of nondischargeability if a \ndebtor takes $750 of cash advances within 70 days of bankruptcy. And \n$750 in a little more than two months is not much. I think all of us \ncan imagine a single mother with children who loses her job or has \nunexpected medical bills for her kids and has to use cash advances to \nbuy food for her family or pay her rent. But if that woman files for \nbankruptcy, the debt to the credit card company is presumed to be \nfraudulent. That means that the debt from those cash advances will not \nbe discharged by bankruptcy. It will still hang over her head as she \ntries to get back on her feet and support her family after the \nbankruptcy proceeding is over. That is not balanced reform. Once again, \nthis bill gives special treatment to credit card companies at the \nexpense of the most vulnerable members of our society. It is arbitrary \nand punitive.\n  This example shows how empty the proponent's arguments are when they \nclaim that the bill gives first priority to alimony and child support. \nOver 100 law professors wrote the Senate last year to contest that \nclaim. Let me quote from their letter:\n\n       Granting ``first priority'' to alimony and support claims \n     is not the magic solution the consumer credit industry claims \n     because ``priority'' is relevant only for distributions made \n     to creditors in the bankruptcy case itself. Such \n     distributions are made in only a negligible percentage of \n     cases. More than 95 percent of bankruptcy cases make no \n     distributions to any creditors because there are no assets to \n     distribute. Granting women and children a first priority for \n     bankruptcy distributions permits them to stand first in line \n     to collect nothing.\n\n\n[[Page S1949]]\n\n\n  The law professors continued:\n\n       Women's hard-fought battle is over reaching the ex-\n     husband's income after bankruptcy. Under current law, child \n     support and alimony share a protected post-bankruptcy \n     position with only two other recurrent collectors of debt--\n     taxes and student loans. The credit industry asks that credit \n     card debt and other consumer credit share that position, \n     thereby elbowing aside the women trying to collect on their \n     own behalf. . . . . As a matter of public policy, this \n     country should not elevate credit card debt to the preferred \n     position of taxes and child support.\n\n  What the law professors point out so convincingly is that the key \nissue is not how the limited assets of a debtor are distributed in \nbankruptcy but what debts survive bankruptcy and will compete for the \ndebtors income when the bankruptcy is over. In a variety of ways, this \nbill will encourage reaffirmation agreements, and increase \nnondischargeability claims, which will lead to more debtors having more \ndebt that continues after bankruptcy.\n\n  That is what hurts women and children, not the priority of child \nsupport claims in the bankruptcy itself. The priority of claims in the \nbankruptcy itself is almost meaningless since in the vast majority of \nbankruptcy cases there are no assets to distribute. People are broke \nand they don't have anything to sell to satisfy their creditors. That \nis why they file for bankruptcy. You can't squeeze blood from a stone.\n  One of the interesting things about this bill is the almost Orwellian \nnames of some its provisions. There are a number of them. For example, \nthere is a title of this bill with the name: ``Enhanced Consumer \nProtection.'' But many of the provisions in this title actually offer \nlittle if any protection at all. The weak credit card disclosure \nprovisions are one example. Yes, those may be ``enhanced'' consumer \nprotections, enhanced from nothing, but they aren't considered \nsufficient by any organization whose primary concern is consumer \nprotection.\n  There is another section within the so-called ``Enhanced Consumer \nProtection title called ``Protection of Retirement Savings in \nBankruptcy.'' Sounds pretty good. But what the provision does is put a \ncap on the amount of retirement savings that are put out of reach of \ncreditors in a bankruptcy proceeding. You see, before this bill, there \nwas no limit at all on the amount of retirement savings that can be \nprotected. So this bill is not an enhanced consumer protection at all. \nIt is a step backward for consumers and hardworking Americans who have \ntried to put aside some money for their golden years.\n  Incidentally, this provision was nowhere to be found in either the \nbankruptcy bill that passed the Senate last year or the bill that \npassed the House in 1999. This is one of those provisions that appeared \nout of nowhere. In fact, before a firestorm of criticism forced him to \nreconsider, the Senator who proposed this provision wanted to let \nconsumers waive the existing protection of retirement savings in \nboilerplate consumer credit agreements. So the $1 million cap is an \nimprovement over what the sponsors of this bill tried to do, but it is \nhardly a ``protection.'' I understand that Senator Kennedy may offer an \namendment to eliminate this cap, and I will support it.\n  Here is another Orwellian title. Section 306 is called ``Giving \nSecured Creditors Fair Treatment Under Chapter 13.'' It ought to be \ncalled ``Giving Certain Secured Creditors Preferred Treatment Under \nChapter 13,'' because it favors those who make car loans over other \nsecured creditors and over unsecured creditors.\n  Here is how it works: There is a concept in bankruptcy law currently \ncalled ``cramdown'' or ``stripdown.'' It recognizes the fact that the \ncollateral for some kinds of loans can lose value over time, so that it \nmay be worth significantly less than the debt owed. Remember that in a \nbankruptcy proceeding, secured creditors get paid first. But the \ncramdown concept says to those creditors, you only get paid first up to \nthe amount of the value of the collateral for the loan. After that, if \nyou are still owed money, you get in line with other unsecured \ncreditors.\n  To give a more tangible example, if someone owes $10,000 on a car \nloan, but the car which is collateral for that loan is worth only \n$5,000, then only $5,000 of that loan is considered secured in a \nbankruptcy. That makes perfect sense, since the maker of that loan has \nthe right to repossess the car, but if it does that it can only get \n$5,000 when it sells the car.\n  What the bill does is to eliminate the cramdown for any car that is \npurchased within 5 years of bankruptcy. That means that even though the \nvehicle that secures the loan has lost much of its value, the entire \namount of the debt must be repaid in a Chapter 13 plan. This gives \nspecial treatment to the lender, but more importantly, it will make it \nmuch more difficult for a Chapter 13 plan to work. And that will hurt \npeople who want to pay off their debts in an organized fashion under \nChapter 13.\n  In answer to my written question, Bankruptcy Judge Randall Newsome \nsupplied a detailed example that shows how the elimination of the \ncramdown option will hurt both debtors and creditors. In his example, a \ndebtor with a seven year old car who files under Chapter 13 under \ncurrent law will be able to pay off his car loan up to the value of the \ncar with interest and make a meaningful payment of his unsecured debts \nover the 3 year duration of his Chapter 13 plan. But with the \nelimination of the cramdown in the bill, he would, he would have no \nchoice but to file in Chapter 7 and allow the car lender to repossess \nhis vehicle. And his unsecured creditors would get nothing. I ask that \nJudge Newsome's letter to me providing the details of this example be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         United States Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of \n           California,\n                                   Oakland, CA, February 22, 2001.\n     Senator Russ Feingold,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: This letter will serve as my \n     response to the written questions you submitted to me on \n     February 20, 2001. Your first question asks whether S. 220 \n     ``will essentially destroy Chapter 13 as an option for \n     debtors who wish to keep their cars. . . .'' As I stated in \n     both my written and oral testimony, I believe that the \n     ``anti-cramdown'' provision in Sec. 306(b) of the bill will \n     destroy the incentive for many debtors to file a chapter 13 \n     case. When Sec. 306(b) is combined with Sec. 314(b), which \n     eliminates the enhanced discharge presently afforded by \n     chapter 13, only those debtors seeking to save a home from \n     foreclosure will find chapter 13 a reasonable option.\n       A hypothetical will illustrate why Sec. 306(b) will hurt \n     both debtors and creditors. Suppose in 1998 Mr. Jones, who is \n     single and lives in an apartment, purchased a 1994 Dodge for \n     $15,000 on credit. At the time he bought the car, its fair \n     market value was only $12,000, but because of his poor credit \n     rating, he was forced to pay substantially over market. \n     Because he can't afford the payments on the Dodge along with \n     his other monthly payments, he files a chapter 13 case in \n     2001. At the time he files, he still owes $10,000 on the car, \n     and he has other unsecured debts totaling $4,000. Without \n     counting payments on his debts, his monthly income exceeds \n     his monthly expenses by $240 per month. The real fair market \n     value of the car at the time of filing is $5,000. Under \n     present law Mr. Jones could write down the value of Dodge to \n     $5,000 in his chapter 13 plan. Assuming he proposes a plan to \n     pay $240 a month over 36 months, he would be able to pay \n     $5,000 plus interest to the secured creditor, and repay a \n     meaningful portion of his unsecured debt over the life of the \n     plan. But under Sec. 306(b) of S. 220, Mr. Jones would be \n     forced to pay all $10,000 of the remaining contract price on \n     the car, because he bought it within five years of filing his \n     chapter 13 case. This is true even though the car is now 7 \n     years old, and the creditor would get substantially less than \n     its present value of $5,000 if the car were repossessed and \n     sold. Depending on the interest rate on the Dodge debt and \n     the chapter 13 trustee's commission, Mr. Jones might not even \n     be able to propose a plan that would pay off the car, pay \n     nothing to his unsecured creditors, and be completed within \n     the 60-month time limit for chapter 13 plans. He would be \n     much better off allowing the secured creditor to repossess \n     the Dodge, file a chapter 7 case, and attempt to buy a newer \n     car, even though the interest rate undoubtedly would be \n     exorbitant. Thus, neither the secured nor the unsecured \n     creditors are paid what they're owed, and the debtor is back \n     in a debt trap. No one benefits.\n       Your second question concerns the problem of repeat filers. \n     I view this as one of the most serious abuses of the \n     bankruptcy system. It has been most severe in the Central \n     District of California. Nonetheless, I would urge caution in \n     attempting to correct it. No one would seriously argue \n     against amending the bankruptcy code to target those who file \n     repeatedly just to stop a foreclosure or an eviction. But \n     many repeat filers are forced to file a second petition \n     because their first case was dismissed for reasons beyond \n     their control, such as the incompetence of a bankruptcy \n     petition preparer. I have read your proposed\n\n[[Page S1950]]\n\n     amendment to S. 220, and believe it strikes the appropriate \n     balance. It protects the rights of innocent tenants, while \n     preserving the right of a landlord to rid themselves of a bad \n     tenant without the legal expense of seeking relief from the \n     automatic stay in bankruptcy court.\n       Please don't hesitate to contact me if I can be of further \n     assistance.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                               Randall J. Newsome.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Most people file Chapter 13 cases because they want to \nkeep their cars. The cramdown allows them to reduce their car payments \nto a reasonable amount, leaving enough money to pay off other secured \ncreditors and make a repayment plan work. According the Chapter 13 \ntrustees, who know what they are talking about since they deal with \nthese cases day in and day out, this single provision of the bill will \nincrease the number of unsuccessful Chapter 13 plans by 20 percent. And \nJudge Newsome states that if this bill becomes law, Chapter 13 will \nessentially be eliminated as an option for people who wish to hold on \nto their cars. He writes: ``When Sec.  306(b) is combined with \nSec. 314(b), which eliminates the enhanced discharge presently afforded \nby chapter 13, only those debtors seeking to save a home from \nforeclosure will find chapter 13 a reasonable option.''\n  Making it more difficult for debtors to get Chapter 13 plans \nconfirmed will lead to more repossessions of cars, and ultimately to \nmore Chapter 7 filings. And even where a Chapter 13 plan can be \nconfirmed and is successful, the anti-cramdown provision will reduce \nthe amount that a debtor can pay to unsecured creditors or for child \nsupport or alimony. In essence, under this bill, car payments, on a car \nworth far less than the debt owed, are given priority over child \nsupport. Another example of how this bill is arbitrary and punitive and \nhow the claims of the bill proponents that the bill will help women and \nchildren are empty indeed.\n  The anti-cramdown provision undermines the efficacy of Chapter 13. \nAll the experts tell us that. And I have to point out the irony here. \nThe avowed purpose of proponents of this bill is to move people from \nChapter 7 discharges to Chapter 13 repayment plans, yet the bill \nundermines Chapter 13. I will support an amendment to eliminate this \nparticular provision that is really a gift to the auto industry at the \nexpense of other secured creditors.\n  There is another provision in this bill that undercuts Chapter 13. \nThe small group of Senators who shaped this bill in a shadow conference \naccepted a provision from the House bill that says that for those \ndebtors with income above their state's median income, Chapter 13 plans \nmust extend over 5 years, rather than three. That's a 66 percent \nincrease in payments required to complete the plan. In view of the fact \nthat the majority of three year plans fail, the requirement that the \ndebtor go two more years without an income interruption or unexpected \nexpenses will inevitably lead to an even higher rate of Chapter 13 plan \nfailures and discourage even more debtors from filing voluntarily under \nChapter 13. I will support the amendment that Senator Leahy may offer \nto correct this problem.\n  I will also support another amendment that may be offered by Senator \nLeahy to deal with the damage this bill does to Chapter 13. The bill \nmakes people who voluntarily file under Chapter 13 go through what \namounts to a means test using the same wooden and arbitrary IRS \nstandards to determine how much disposable income they have available \nto pay off their secured creditors. Anyone who has more than the median \nincome will have to limit their monthly expenses to those permitted \nunder the IRS standards. That is going to discourage Chapter 13 \nfilings. If we want to encourage debtors to use Chapter 13 rather than \nChapter 7, we have to get rid of that provision.\n  As I have said before, this bill is at war with itself. Bankruptcy \nexperts from around the country say it will not work. This bill will \ndestroy Chapter 13 as an option for many debtors. If we pass it, I'm \nconvinced that we will be back here trying to fix it once it starts to \ntake its toll on the American people. In the meantime, how many lives \nwill we make harder, how much more heartache are we going to inflict on \nhard-working Americans?\n  Mr. President, I will offer an amendment to address another provision \nof the bill that is bound to inflict heartache on families and \nchildren. Section 313 of the bill includes a definition of ``household \ngoods.'' The effect of this definition is to limit the ability of \ndebtors to avoid non-purchase money liens on personal property. I \nconsider the practice engaged in by many finance companies of taking a \nsecurity interest in personal property that was not purchased with the \nloan to be highly questionable. The FTC in the early '80s prohibited \ntaking these nonpurchase money security interests in certain household \nproperty. But because the list of what constitutes household goods in \nthe FTC regulation is outdated and limited, many finance companies put \na lien on every other type of personal property that they can identify. \nThose liens give them leverage to try to collect on their loans, even \nif the property is of minimal value. And they have a leg up on getting \nreaffirmation in bankruptcy if the liens can be enforced.\n  The Bankruptcy Code of 1978 allows debtors to avoid these liens as \nlong as the property is exempt from foreclosure under the applicable \nstate or federal personal property exemption. But the section 313 \ndefinition of household goods would limit the liens that can be avoided \nto a narrow list of certain goods. The list is based on the FTC \nregulation from the early 1980s. So essentially, if this provision \nbecomes law, the liens that can be avoided in bankruptcy are mostly the \nones that the FTC has already said should be. But anything else that's \nnot on the list can be foreclosed on things like garden equipment, and \nfamily heirlooms or paintings of a debtor's parents.\n\n  Now remember, the liens we are talking about here are non-purchase \nmoney liens, they aren't loans taken out to buy a particular item. \nThere is no evidence that the power to avoid these non-purchase money \nliens is being abused. It can't be abused, because personal property \nexemptions are quite limited. No one can shield thousands of dollars of \nfancy stereo equipment in a bankruptcy. So the definition of household \ngoods in the bill is just a gift to the finance companies who prey on \npeople living at the edge. This bill facilitates these kinds of \nborderline unethical lending practices. I will have an amendment to \nsubstitute for the limited and counterproductive definition in the \nbill, a broad definition of household goods that many courts are \nalready employing.\n  I have spoken for quite awhile here about the problems with this \nbill. In fact, I have probably only scratched the surface. This is an \nimmensely complicated bill about a very technical area of the law. \nThere are provisions in this bill that I would venture to guess that no \none in the Senate really understands. We are hearing every day about \nnew problems with this bill, particularly in the business bankruptcy \nprovisions that few people have paid much attention to.\n  Before I close, I have to mention one provision that was slipped into \nthis bill in the shadow ``conference'' and remains in it today section \n1310 barring enforcement of certain foreign judgments. This provision \nis an example of lawmaking at its worst. It has nothing to do with \nbankruptcy law whatsoever. It is a provision designed to assist about \n200 to 300 investors in Lloyds of London who lost money in the 1980s. \nThese individuals tried to avoid their responsibilities in the British \ncourts and failed, and they have repeatedly failed to have the \njudgments against them thrown out by American courts. In fact, eight \ncircuit courts have ruled that these investors' disputes with Lloyds \nshould be settled in British courts. So they have been seeking special \ntreatment from the Congress, and if President Clinton didn't veto the \nbill last year they would have got it.\n  This provision is opposed by the State Department that rightfully \nworries about the impact of a law on international economic \ntransactions that gives the back of the hand to respected foreign \ncourts. It also will make it harder to enforce U.S. court orders in \nforeign courts. The Organization for International Investment, the \nNational Association of Insurance Commissioners, and the Council of \nInsurance Agents and Brokers oppose the provision because of their \nconcern over its impact on the international insurance market.\n  Worst of all, this provision smacks of the kind of special interest \ngiveaway\n\n[[Page S1951]]\n\nthat pervades this bill. But this one is worse because we have had no \nhearings on this provision, it did not come out of this committee, it \ndid not come out of the Senate or the House, it was just slipped into \nthe bill at the last minute. There is a lot of legislation that I would \nlike to slip into this bill since it does appear that it is on the way \nto the President's desk. I would like to do something about mandatory \narbitration of employment disputes. I would like to require that DNA \ntesting be made available to all inmates on death row. I would like to \nend racial profiling or pass campaign finance reform. But the interests \nthat support me on these issues don't have an in with the people who \nare writing this bill. They can't get their pet legislation inserted in \nthis bill in a conference committee. But these investors in Lloyd's \ndid, so they stand to get their way. That's not right. So I may offer \nan amendment to strike section 1310 and I certainly look forward to \nseeing it removed from the bill.\n  It is important to note that if we do our job here and pass some \namendments to improve the bill, the fight is not over. Because there is \na long record of the conference committees simply ignoring the Senate's \nwork and sending back to us a much worse bill. So I have to say to my \ncolleagues, if you support the bill after the Senate completes its work \nyou must fight to demand that the conference respect the changes that \nthe Senate made. The House has done virtually nothing on this bill. It \nbasically rubber-stamped the conference report from last year. And our \nrights as Senators to offer and pass amendments are worthless if the \nconference committee simply returns the bill to the form in which it \nwas introduced.\n  To conclude, this is the kind of bill where we need to rely on the \nexperts to guide us. And we just haven't done that here. Once again, we \nhave a letter from over 100 law professors, from all across the \ncountry. They aren't debtors lawyers, they aren't all Democrats, they \ndon't have an ideological agenda, they just understand the law and care \nabout how it operates. And they plead with us, let me quote from their \nletter again: ``Please don't pass a bill that will hurt vulnerable \nAmericans, including women and children.''\n  This is extraordinary. The experts beg us to listen to them. They \ndon't have a financial interest here. They don't represent debtors. \nNone of them is in danger of declaring bankruptcy. They just hate to \nsee this Congress make such a big mistake in writing the laws. They \ndon't want us to ruin the bankruptcy system, which dates back to the \nearliest days of our country, by passing a bill that is so unbalanced, \nso arbitrary and so punitive.\n  I assure my colleagues that I am not opposed to reform of the \nbankruptcy laws. I know there are abuses that need to be stopped. I \nvoted for a bill in 1998 that passed this Senate with only a handful of \nvotes in opposition. There are things we can do to improve the \nbankruptcy system. There are loopholes we can close and abuses we can \naddress. We can do it in a bipartisan way. We can write a balanced bill \nthat the Senate and the country can be proud of. We can rely on the \nadvice of experts as we always have in the past. We didn't do that \nhere. We relied on the credit card industry, which has showered \nSenators and the political parties with campaign contributions, and it \nshows.\n  Before we barrel forward on a fast track to pass this bill just \nbecause it is where the process ended last year, we have one more \nchance to listen to the experts. One last chance to step back from the \nbrink of passing a very bad law, a law that I believe we will come to \nregret. It is a matter of simple fairness and simple justice.\n  S. 420 is an unfair bill, Mr. President. The Senate can do better. \nThe Senate must do better, for the sake of hard-working people who need \nour help.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I listened with great interest to my friend \nfrom Wisconsin when he talked about showering money by special \ninterests. Yesterday, he and I voted on a bill on ergonomics where the \noutfit that most wanted that bill not stripped away was the labor \ncommunity which, if we take his definition broadly, showered money on \neveryone here. I don't even accept PAC money. Yet I did not hear \nanybody stand up yesterday and say the reason we voted for ergonomics \nwas that labor showered money upon this body. I find it somewhat \nunusual that there is such selective judgment about how money is \nshowered on this body.\n  I wish the Senator was still here. I am also interested in what he \nconstantly refers to as the arbitrary nature of this bill. It seems to \nme the definition of arbitrary is whatever the Senator from Wisconsin \ndoesn't like, because such an arbitrary bill as this passed with 70 \nvotes last year, and it has been improved even further than last year. \nIt passed with 306 votes just a couple of days ago over in the House of \nRepresentatives. It must mean that two-thirds of the Senate last year--\nand I realize it has changed by several votes on this side now--and 306 \nof 435 Members over there are obviously very arbitrary. This bill is \nsupposedly so partisan that it has had broad bipartisan support in both \nthe House and the Senate.\n  I also point out that, having been involved with President Clinton \nrelative to his veto of the bill last year, the single most important \nthing the President wanted done through the help of Senator Schumer--\nand, through the leadership of Senator Schumer, it was done in this \nbill--was that he was very concerned about a provision that possibly \nwould allow someone who had violated the so-called FACE--that is, bomb \nan abortion clinic or do physical damage to the building or to persons \nworking in there--to then come along and declare bankruptcy on the \ngrounds that they should not have to pay the civil judgments against \nthem. That meant a great deal to President Clinton, to me, and to a lot \nof other people.\n  That was the primary reason President Clinton vetoed this bill last \nyear. That provision is no longer exempted from this bill. It is part \nof the bill. One of the nondischargeable debts under bankruptcy in this \nlegislation is for someone who has a judgment against them for \nviolating the rule. That is called the FACE law, relating to \nintimidating or doing damage to abortion clinics or persons who work in \nthem.\n  I also find interesting one thing the Senator said. I think he is \ncorrect. He pointed out that mothers filing bankruptcy even though \ntheir husbands are gone must still count their husbands' income.\n  That is not what was intended in the bill. I will give you an \nexample. On the section from which the Senator from Wisconsin read, \nthere was a drafting error here in all the provisions save one that I \nam aware of. It says:\n\n       . . .if the current monthly income of the debtor, or in a \n     joint case the debtor and the debtor's spouse. . . .''\n\n  That means that if the debtor is all by herself and has not filed for \nbankruptcy jointly, then you do not count the husband's income. That \nwas not intended. But there is a section where it is written \ndifferently and could be read differently. That is in section (7), on \npage 17 of the bill.\n  Section 7, in subsection (2) says:\n\n       . . . if the current monthly income of the debtor and the \n     debtor's spouse combined, as of the date of the order for \n     relief when multiplied by 12, is equal less than. . . .\n\n  It should read: if the current monthly income of the debtor, or in \nthe case of a joint filing by the debtor and their spouse. . . .\n  It is my intention, as one of the people who supports this bill, to \nsee that it is changed in the managers' amendment, so it reads as it \nwas intended.\n  But after that, what I heard added up to an awful lot of--how can I \nsay this--well, I will not characterize it. I do not think it was \nparticularly accurate. So since this is the first time I have spoken to \nthis bill on the floor, let me go into a little more detail. But I am \ngoing to go into a great deal of detail on each of these amendments \nthat are about to be offered.\n  First, the idea of a fresh start is absolutely fundamental to the \nAmerican way of life. Bankruptcy must remain available for those who \nreally need it. And it does. Let's put in perspective what we are \ntalking about. If you listened to the critics of the bill on the floor, \nit would sound as if we are eliminating bankruptcy. The only issue at \nstake here is whether or not someone files bankruptcy in chapter 7 or \nchapter 13. Right now, I might point out to\n\n[[Page S1952]]\n\nyou, bankruptcy judges are supposed to lay out in chapter 7--chapter 7 \nis one of those places where you eliminate all your debt. Chapter 13 is \nwhere you say: I want to eliminate most of my debt, but I can pay back \nsome of it. I can pay back some small percentage of it. And they set \nout a schedule to pay back some small percentage of it.\n  What we are talking about is a situation where someone who files in \nchapter 7, who is able to pay some of their debt, and should be filing \nin chapter 13 right now--a bankruptcy judge or a master must, in fact, \nlook at that circumstance and say: This is an abusive filing. He really \nshould be filing in chapter 13. But guess what. There is no uniform \nstandard nationwide. It is left up to every bankruptcy judge to \ndetermine what is abusive and what is not abusive.\n  So what are do we doing here? The essence of what we are doing is \nlaying out the standard at which a bankruptcy judge must look to \ndetermine whether or not the filer is abusing the system going into \nchapter 7 as opposed to chapter 13.\n  Why are we doing that? We are doing that because a lot of the very \npeople I represent, and that my friend from Wisconsin and others talk \nabout all the time--working-class folks--are getting hurt by the way \nbankruptcy is abused now. Because what simply happens is, all those \ndebts that they incur--and they never filed bankruptcy before--cost \nthem more money. It costs them more money at Boscov's when they go buy \na $100 item because people have declared bankruptcy who could be paying \nback something. It costs them more money.\n\n  The average person in America, the person who really is in a crunch, \nis hurt the most because interest rates go up, the cost of financing, \nbuying the new bed or refrigerator goes up.\n  You don't have to just listen to me about this. Unnecessary and \nabusive bankruptcy costs everyone. The Clinton administration's own \nJustice Department concluded that our current system costs the economy \n$3 billion a year. And they made the pursuit and prosecution of \nbankruptcy abuse a high priority.\n  This is not an imaginary problem. It is not going away. This week we \nare taking up a bill that is identical to the conference report that \nenjoyed strong bipartisan support in the House and the Senate--70 in \nthe Senate and 308 in the House. During the debate, we have already \nheard from some of my colleagues who claim that they support the \ngeneral idea of eliminating abuse in bankruptcy, but they oppose the \nparticulars.\n  Now, again, this costs every single solitary consumer. If you are \nmaking $300,000 a year, you don't have to buy your sofa bed on time. If \nyou are making $300,000 a year, you don't have to buy your refrigerator \non time. Where I come from--my family --you buy them on time. And it \ncosts them money. It costs them money--a lot more money--because these \nfolks do not write off this debt and say: I didn't get paid. I didn't \nget paid back for all that was owed me here, so forget it. I will just \ntake it out of my bottom profit line. They say: No. I have to make it \nup.\n  So what do they do? They charge my mother and father more money to \nbuy the refrigerator because they can't buy it other than buying it on \ntime.\n  So I am having it about up to here with how this is hurting so many \npoor people. I will get to that in just a minute.\n  During this debate, we have had raised many charges against the \nlegislation. I think it is fair to say that the concerns I have heard \nso far--and over the last 4 years that we have been dealing with this \nlegislation--I find it fascinating my friend from Wisconsin and others \nhave said that we were going to bring this bill right to the floor. The \nreason it did not get brought to the floor is yours truly, me. I made \nit clear they would get none of my support, no one would get my support \non this bill if, in fact, it did not go back through the committee \nsystem, if it did not go back to the Judiciary Committee, if it did not \ngo through the normal procedure.\n  As I said, this is the same bill, by and large, with a couple \nimprovements, that passed with 70 votes last year. The biggest charge \nyou hear is this is antiwoman and antichildren who depend on child \nsupport, and that it is unfair to low-income families which need the \nfull protection of chapter 7 or straight bankruptcy. I want to briefly \naddress both of these concerns. And I will go into more detail when my \ncolleagues want to come and debate this issue.\n  First, I want to point out a significant achievement reached in the \nJudiciary Committee on the question of those who have tried to hide in \nbankruptcy from the penalties imposed on them for violating the Fair \nAccess to Clinic Entrances Act. Senator Schumer, as I mentioned \nearlier, first brought this issue to our attention. We finally reached \nan agreement in the committee with this major step forward. The \ncompromise that we put forward is part of the bill that no one--no \none--who violates the FACE Act, the Fair Access to Clinic Entrances \nAct, can, in fact, avoid their responsibility in bankruptcy.\n\n  Now as to those specific charges of unfairness. First, there is the \nclaim that the bill will leave women and children who depend on child \nsupport worse off than they are today. This is perhaps the easiest \ncharge to refute because the legislation before us today has the \nendorsement of the National Child Support Enforcement Association. The \nNational Child Support Enforcement Association--they are all the folks \nin all of our States who sit there behind counters, working for the \nState, who are trying to collect support payments and child support \nfrom deadbeat husbands. These are people on the side of the women and \nchildren who need their support payments made to them. They support \nthis bill.\n  The National District Attorneys Association--and specifically because \nof the important new protection for women and children who depend on \nfamily support payments--and other professionals whose job it is to \nenforce family support payments every day, from the California Family \nSupport Council to the Corporation Counsel for the City of New York, \nhave endorsed these new protections as well. That is because there are \nnew specific protections for family support payments in this bill.\n\n  Let's go through how it currently works. One thing the Senator said \nis correct: Bankruptcy is a complicated issue. Hopefully, the vast \nmajority of Americans will never have to become acquainted with it.\n  Under current law, we tell creditors they can't collect debts owed \nthem starting right away, as soon as someone files bankruptcy. Put \nanother way, I go in and file bankruptcy. I owe child support and \nsupport payments. I file for bankruptcy. In the vast majority of \nStates, immediately all creditors have to back off, including mom and \nthe kids. That means a woman owed alimony or child support can't \ncollect either.\n  I am one of the authors of the deadbeat dad legislation to put more \npressure on States to go after deadbeat dads. All of a sudden, once \nsomebody files bankruptcy, in most States in America now, mom is out, \nthe kids are out. Bankruptcy stays the proceeding.\n  All those hard-working folks in the family court in Delaware trying \nto see to it that Johnny and Mary and Alice get something to eat and \nmom gets a support payment, they can do nothing. They have to stand \nback, instead of bringing that deadbeat dad in and arresting him and \ngarnishing his wages. That is why the national child support agencies \nsupport this bill. That is why they want it. It improves the plight of \nwomen and children who, by the way, can't wait 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 \nweeks, 10 weeks, 5 months while the bankruptcy is proceeding, as they \nhave to now.\n  This bill gives child support and alimony the first and highest \npriority among any claim able to be made in bankruptcy. Do you know \nwhere they are under present law, the law my friend seems to love so \nmuch? They rank No. 7, S-E-V-E-N. This bill says you have to be fully \npaid up on child support and alimony before you can be released from \nbankruptcy. You have to be fully paid up or you don't get out of \nanything via bankruptcy. A woman collecting child support or alimony \nmust, under section 219 of this bill, be notified of the full array of \nfamily support enforcement rights and available options to her under \nFederal law, including the kind of wage attachments that will trump \nevery other claim in and out of bankruptcy.\n\n[[Page S1953]]\n\n  So there is an affirmative requirement under this bill. If a woman \ndid not know she had additional rights, she is required, under this \nlaw, if we pass it--and I am confident we will--to be notified by the \nbankruptcy court: By the way, you have these additional rights, and we \nwill help you attach this deadbeat's wages.\n  All other parties to bankruptcy, from her spouse's creditors to the \ncourt that monitors the bankruptcy plan, are notified that the full \nforce of the Federal support enforcement law is part of the bankruptcy \nproceeding, which it is not now. Under this bill, the fact that other \ncreditors with perhaps deeper pockets might be looking for repayment \nfrom her spouse is an asset, not a liability. Those other creditors \nmust provide her and the support enforcement officials this bill \nrecruits, by the way, to assist her with the last known address of her \nspouse who owes her the support and payments.\n  I used to be a family court lawyer. Do you know how it works now? The \ncourt can't find where Charlie Smith is. The woman is going into court \nday after day. Charlie Smith has a job. Everybody knows Charlie Smith \nhas a job, but they can't find him. So Charlie Smith files bankruptcy \nin another State, another place, another time. What happens now? \nNothing. What happens under this bill? The creditors who go in saying, \nI want to repossess Charlie's car, I am going to take Charlie's house, \nI am going after Charlie's bank account because he owes me money, have \nto notify the spouse.\n\n  Give me a break. No protections? It doesn't exist in present law.\n  These are concrete, positive steps from start to finish, and even \nbeyond bankruptcy, to assure that payments are made to those who need \nthem. These are real, tangible improvements over the current bankruptcy \nand child support laws. My friends who talk so much about child support \nought to go practice it as I did. They ought to go back home and check, \ngo sit in that family court and find out how it works right now.\n  Against them we will hear the vague assertion that those payments \nwill compete with ``more powerful creditors.'' The fact is, in actual \npractice now, and more certainly under this bill, those payments will \nbe accomplished by wage attachments and could not be reached by any \nother creditor during or after bankruptcy, no matter how powerful or \nhow devious the creditor is.\n  I heard a little flip on this. I may hear from my friend from \nWisconsin and others: Even though that is true, even though in this \nbankruptcy proceeding you can go out and attach the wages of this \ndeadbeat father, what is going to happen is the devious creditor will \nstill win. Do you know why? Because the deadbeat father will quit his \njob to spite payment. Then the creditor that repossesses the automobile \nor goes after whatever debt he has will be ahead of the mother because \nbankruptcy is over. Come on. If a father is going to do that, he \n``ain't'' paying anybody anything. Those payments come out of the \ndeadbeat dad's paycheck before he even sees it. He cannot be forced to \nchoose between child support and other debts. He doesn't have the \nchoice. Those payments are made automatically, straight from the \nemployer to the woman and children who need them. Those who claim \notherwise are simply ignorant of the way Federal family support law \ncurrently operates. Some of them simply misrepresent the way this \nlegislation protects family support payments in bankruptcy.\n  Next, we have the assertion that this legislation unfairly locks the \ndoor of chapter 7--liquidation or so-called straight bankruptcy--for \nthose low-income families that need it the most. Let's get a few things \nstraight about how the current code operates.\n  Today, bankruptcy judges are required as a matter of Federal law to \ndismiss petitions for chapter 7--that is straight bankruptcy--for \nsubstantial abuse, particularly if the debtor really has the ability to \npay his bills. This reform legislation will provide those judges with \nspecific criteria for determining if the debtor can, in fact, pay some \nof the bills he or she is asking to be forgiven. If the debtor can pay \nsome of those bills, at least $10,000 or 25 percent of those debts--\nthat is the threshold--then asking for chapter 7 is presumed to be an \nabuse of the system and you get bumped into chapter 13.\n  I will bet that most Americans would be very surprised that there is \nno systematic way for asking the basic question about the ability to \npay, no actual means test that exists now under the current code, and \nit is up to every different bankruptcy judge to decide how he or she \nwants to make that judgment. That is how our sentencing laws used to be \nuntil I wrote and we passed the Sentencing Reform Act. Every judge \ncould have a different sentence.\n  What did we find out there? We found out that black folks who \ncommitted the same crime that white folks committed went to jail longer \nbecause there was no standard.\n  We have national sentencing guidelines and other standards that guide \nthe decisions of judges. This bill simply tells judges how they should \ngo about making the decision that current law requires them to make.\n  But won't that means test disadvantage those of limited means who \ntruly need and deserve to fully get a chapter 7 liquidation?\n  Look at the facts. First, this bill will affect, at most, 10 percent \nof the people who currently file under chapter 7, and only those who \nhave a demonstrable ability to pay.\n  One of the main reasons for that small number--10 percent--is the \nmeans test in this bill would not even apply to anyone who earns less \nthan the median income in his or her State, and for those with less \nthan 150 percent of the median income, there is only a cursory \ncalculation on the ability to pay.\n  Let's go through what that means. Mr. President, in my State of \nDelaware, a family with a $46,000 income would not even be subject to \nthe means test--you got that?--not even subject to the means test. They \nare out. They can immediately go to chapter 7, no questions asked, \nnothing--even if they had the ability to pay.\n  That is exactly as it is today. In California, a family with a \n$43,000 income will have the exact same access. In Massachusetts, a \nfamily with $44,000 in income will have no change in access to chapter \n7; Illinois, $46,000; in Wisconsin, $45,000, no change. That is because \nthis legislation, I might add, at my insistence and that of Senator \nTorricelli, contains a safe harbor for those people. Only if you have \nmore than 1\\1/2\\ times the median income in your State will you be \nsubject to a serious examination about your ability to pay. And even \nthen, if you face what the bill calls ``special circumstances,'' that \nreduces your income or increases your regular expenses. You will still \nenjoy the full protection of chapter 7. Specifically--I don't know how \nmany times I have heard this on the floor--if you have ongoing medical \nexpenses, that means you don't have any money left over to pay \ncreditors, you can go straight to chapter 7.\n  One of the most basic misunderstandings about this bill is that folks \nwith medical bills will have their circumstances ignored, as my friends \nare saying on the floor here. That is just flat wrong. The standard \nthis bill uses for calculating someone's ability to pay under the means \ntest specifically includes not just medical bills but health insurance, \nand it even includes union dues.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 13\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 5:30 \nhaving arrived, there will now be 20 minutes of debate on the Leahy \namendment No. 13.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, nobody is here to yield time. I will be \nhappy to begin the debate on the Leahy amendment. Obviously, I can't \nyield time from Senator Grassley or Senator Leahy's time on this point.\n  Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Since nobody is here to debate \nthe Leahy amendment, is it appropriate to be able to proceed on the \nbill for another few minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may ask unanimous consent to do \nthat.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have just been told by the majority and \nminority staff that I can yield myself some time off of Senator Hatch's \ntime on this amendment. I will cease and desist the moment either \nSenator Leahy or Senator Hatch comes forward to debate the amendment.\n  Back to medical expenses.\n\n[[Page S1954]]\n\n  One of the most basic misunderstandings is that people with medical \nbills will have that circumstance ignored. Not only are those expenses \nexplicitly allowed but any other expenses that make sense are allowed. \nThat is under the IRS standards. On top of that, the bill allows \nadditional expenses, including medical expenses for everybody from your \nnondependent children to your grandparents and your grandchildren.\n  There are no reasonable medical expenses, from contact lenses to \ncancer therapy, from yours to your wife's to your grandchild's, that \nwould not be counted as a necessary expense in calculating someone's \nability to pay.\n  So much for this idea that these poor people who have these \nexceedingly high medical expenses--and they really do--will not be able \nto declare bankruptcy and do straight bankruptcy in chapter 7.\n  Again, if you are under the median income in your State, you are not \neven subject to the calculations anyway. So much for the charges that \nthis legislation is unfair to women and children and to those of \nlimited means. It improves protections for those who depend on alimony \nand child support, and those below the median income are explicitly \nexcluded from the means test. The means test for those who are above \nthe median income permits all forms of medical and other expenses to be \nconsidered in calculating the ability to pay.\n  Next, often cited is the ``failure'' of this legislation to deal with \nwhat is supposedly a major abuse of the current system, the unlimited \nhomestead exemption now permitted in a handful of States.\n  Let me make this clear. I agree with my friend from Wisconsin that we \nshould have an absolute cap on the homesteading expense. We should not \nhave it like Texas, Florida, and other States that allow the abuse of \nsomeone going out and buying a $6 million or $8 million home and then \ndeclaring bankruptcy and the home being out of reach of the creditors. \nThat is unfair. I think it should be capped in the $100,000 to $150,000 \nrange nationwide. We tried that. It didn't work. What we did do is \nthis.\n  Everyone should be outraged at those who thumb their nose and move to \nFlorida or Texas and buy multimillion-dollar homes. As outrageous as \nthese cases might be, this is quite rare. I am afraid those who made \nthe treatment of the homestead exemption the grounds for their \nrejection of this bill have based their votes on a pretty weak \nfoundation. Here is a GAO report from 1999 in which they found, first, \nthat only 52 percent of bankruptcy cases from a sample in Texas \ninvolved a homestead in any way.\n\n  Second, only 1.2 percent of those cases involved homesteads--that is \nhomes--of more than $100,000--not a lot of multimillion-dollar \nhomesteaders there, Mr. President. A similar sample from Florida, the \nother supposedly big offender on this issue, found that .8 percent--\nless than 1 percent--of the cases with any kind of homestead involved a \nhomestead of more than $100,000--not a lot of multimillion-dollar \nbankruptcy bungalows there.\n  Again, Mr. President, as far as I am concerned, a single abuse of the \nhomestead exemption by a filer is one too many. But let's not pretend \nthis bill has turned a blind eye to a major problem. There is not a \nmajor problem, but the bill, in fact, does make a major advance over \ncurrent law.\n  If I had my choice, it would be a $100,000 cap. If you buy a house \nwithin 2 years of filing for bankruptcy, the cap is $100,000, which we \nhave in this bill before us. No change in current law? Well, I will \ntake this bill over current law. Let me explain in more detail what I \nmean.\n  Right now, if in fact you go out and buy yourself an $8 million home \n2 years before you file bankruptcy, that home is liable to be \npossessed. Now, if they buy it 2 days before and it is exempt-- I am \ntalking about .8 percent of all the filers who claimed the homestead \nexemption in Florida. For example, I know I am going to file for \nbankruptcy in 2 years, so now I am going to go out and buy an $8 \nmillion home. Let me be clear. I think there should be a flat \nprohibition of hiding assets in homes above 100,000 bucks. Very few \nhave ever done it. It should be changed, but very few have done it, and \nwe have made a significant change among those who may have done it or \nwho are intending to do it.\n\n  Finally, I want to say something about a number of other amendments I \nexpect we are going to see in the course of this debate.\n  The truth in lending legislation is not a bankruptcy law. There is no \nevidence presented by anyone here that anyone has gone bankrupt or \ndeclared bankruptcy because they have been falsely or not honestly lent \nmoney. There is no evidence of that. These amendments are not about \nbankruptcy law; they are about banking law.\n  I support more disclosure, and they are clearly within the \njurisdiction of the Banking Committee, as I am sure Senator Gramm will \ntell us, but I know a number of my colleagues have felt it is essential \nto require, as they say, some balance in bankruptcy reform legislation \nby demanding more on the part of lenders as we demand more of debtors.\n  Fair enough. I support the idea. Last session, I offered, along with \nSenator Torricelli and Senator Grassley, an important amendment that \nrequired additional disclosure by lenders. That amendment was added on \nthe floor last Congress.\n  These new disclosures include a strong notice, a warning that making \nminimum payments will stretch out the time it will take to pay off the \nloan and that a 1-800 number must be put on there for you to call to \nfind out how long it would take you to pay.\n  Those disclosures include more information on so-called teaser rates \non the envelope that come in the mail every week.\n  This bill before us contains some improvements, but that is not \nrelated to bankruptcy. That is related to banking and truth in lending, \nwhich I support more of.\n  Additionally, there is the assumption that lenders, not borrowers, \nare responsible for bankruptcy. The key assumption here is that a \nrational businessman, a lender, especially credit card lenders, seek \nout those who have no hope of repayment and foist unbearable debt upon \nthem just so they can fight with them in bankruptcy.\n  I do not follow the argument, but we can see if there is anything to \nit. Fortunately, the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan \norganization in the U.S. Congress, for the last few years has looked \ninto the issue at my request.\n  I direct my colleagues' attention to the CRS report on March 19, \n1988, entitled ``Bankruptcy and Credit Card Debt: Is There a Casual \nRelationship?'' It is not every day we have such a direct response \navailable to a question that is constantly put forward on this floor. \nThis is not industry propaganda. This is not interest group rhetoric. \nThis has nothing to do with campaign contributions, as alleged by my \nfriend from Wisconsin. This is the Congressional Research Service on \nwhich we have all come to rely for expert nonpartisan analysis.\n  The answer to the question is no, credit card debt cannot be shown to \nbe the cause of bankruptcy.\n  Here is the conclusion of the report:\n\n       The available aggregate data do not show that credit card \n     debt has caused a major shift in U.S. household financial \n     conditions.\n\n  Addressing that underlying assumption I spoke of, the report says:\n\n       Is credit card borrowing a trap for the unwary, bringing \n     disorder into the financial houses of an unspecifiable number \n     of atypical families and individuals? Perhaps, but so are \n     medical expenses, divorce, job loss, casino gambling, \n     narcotics, investment scams, and so on. Anecdotal evidence \n     abounds, statistical evidence is scarce.\n\n  That was 1998. What has happened since? Last month, I asked the CRS \nto update its analysis.\n  Here is the unchanged conclusion--as of February 20--based on the \nlatest data:\n\n       While credit card debt has been the fastest-growing \n     component of household debt, the size of the debt outstanding \n     does not appear to be so great (especially when rising \n     incomes are considered) that it can be held primarily \n     responsible for the steep rise in consumer bankruptcy filings \n     since 1980. At the same time, the claim that credit card \n     companies are creating financial distress by mass-marketing \n     an expensive form of credit to low-income or financially \n     unsophisticated households finds little support . . . .\n\n  I know that for some of my colleagues, blaming lenders for \nbankruptcies is a matter of faith. Unfortunately, it is not a matter of \nfact.\n\n[[Page S1955]]\n\n  That is why I will vote against amendments that are properly the \njurisdiction of the Banking Committee.\n  It is not because I think all lenders act responsibly, or that nobody \never got suckered by a credit card company. It is because the best \nevidence I have to work with tells me that these amendments are not \ngermane to bankruptcy reform.\n  In closing, I look at the years of debate, hearings, and floor time \nwe have expended on this issue, and I look at the strong, bipartisan \nmajorities that have consistently supported bankruptcy reform \nthroughout this process, and finally, I look at the 70 votes that this \nvery bill--without the Schumer-Hatch language on clinic violence--\nreceived in the Senate last year.\n  Like every bill that has undergone this much debate and \nconsideration, it is the product of compromise. It is not a root-and-\nbranch overhaul of the current bankruptcy code; it makes incremental \nbut important changes in the operation of the current system.\n  It will affect perhaps 10 percent of those who currently file under \nchapter 7, and only those who have the demonstrated ability to pay. It \nadds important new protections for the women and children who depend on \nchild support. It restores, at the margins, some personal \nresponsibility to a system that that in recent years has been the \nsubject of abuse.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are considering the Leahy amendment. The \nSenator from Vermont has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I hope when the time \ncomes to vote this evening on the Leahy small business amendment that \nall Senators will vote for it. I have not heard the author of this \nbill, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the majority leader, or \nanybody else speak in opposition to it. Obviously, they can vote any \nway they want, but I have yet to hear anybody talk in opposition to it. \nThe time used on the other side was not used in opposition to it.\n  I hope this is an indication that we will look first and foremost at \nsmall businesses, those businesses with under 25 people, to give them \nparity with the multibillion-dollar corporations.\n  When we voted last night, many said we were helping small businesses \nby throwing out the ergonomics rule. While I disagree on that \nparticular rule, I do agree that small businesses should be helped. I \ngrew up in the front of a small business store in Montpelier, VT. We \nlived in the front of the store. My parents had a small business in the \nback.\n  Ninety percent of the businesses in Vermont are small but then many \nof the businesses nationwide are small businesses. If you define them \nas 25 employees or less, with 5,541,000 businesses in America, nearly 5 \nmillion of them are small businesses.\n  What I want to do is make sure we protect small business creditors \nfrom losing out in the bankruptcy reform process. They ought to be \nprotected.\n  The way the bill is written now--and I hope this was not \nintentional--but the way it is written puts large multibillion-dollar \ncredit card companies ahead of hard-working small business people--\nfarmers, ranchers, Main Street mom-and-pop stores. It puts these huge \ncompanies ahead of them in collecting outstanding debt from those who \nfile for bankruptcy.\n  I do not think any one of us intended that. I do not think any one of \nus actually want to go back home and tell all the farmers, ranchers, \nand small business people in our States that we put the credit card \ncompanies ahead of them.\n  My amendment gives small business creditors a priority over larger \nbusinesses when it comes to distributions of the bankruptcy estate. It \nprovides a small business creditor priority over larger for-profit \nbusiness creditors.\n  It does not affect the bill's provisions which give top priority in \nbankruptcy distributions to child support and alimony payments. We \nalready set certain priorities. We do it for alimony payments. We do it \nfor child support. We ought to do it for our Main Street businesses and \nour farmers and ranchers. We ought to give them the same kind of leg up \nover a deep-pocket, multibillion-dollar corporation.\n  If a large credit card company has John Jones or Mary Smith go into \nbankruptcy, and they owe them, say, $3,000, and they owe the local feed \nstore $3,000, obviously this $3,000 shows up differently on the bottom \nline of MasterCard than it does on the bottom line of the Jones Feed \nand Grain Store. It is a much bigger bite for that small store, and \nthey ought to be given priority.\n  That is all I am asking for in this. I cannot imagine any small \nbusiness organization that would not be supportive of this. We should \nactually be helping small businesses navigate the often complex and \nconfusing bankruptcy process because they are not going to be able to \nafford a galaxy of lawyers and accountants. The huge companies have \nthese people on retainer because they handle bankruptcy matters all \nover the place. For the small store, this may be their bottom line for \nthe year. It may be the one bankruptcy they are trying to collect for \nthe year, and they could be out of business as a result. They need \npriority just to keep pace with big business.\n  Small business is the backbone of our economy. In fact, I use the \nsame definition of a small business creditor that is already in section \n102 of the bill.\n  All I am saying is same rules, but if you are going to give priority, \ngive the priority not to the multibillion-dollar corporation for whom \nthis $3,000, $4,000, or $5,000 claim is nothing. Give the priority to \nthat small store, that small company on Main Street that may have to \nreally do something. I don't want them to have to get in line behind \nthe huge credit card companies. For them, it may mean the difference \nbetween going out of business or not, not the difference between \nwhether it means one one-hundred-thousandth of 1 percent.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Would this include an automobile dealer with 20 people that grosses \n$70 million a year?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Do we have that many?\n  Mr. BIDEN. We sure do. Check home. Any automobile dealer that has 20 \nor more people.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If we talk about grosses, that would be one that is \nmatching a 20-person unit of a credit card company that would gross \nseveral billion dollars.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am just asking a question. I hope it does include them. \nI want to know what you are including. That is all. Would that be \nincluded?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have used the small business definition that the Senator \nfrom Delaware has used in the bill he cosponsored.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That does mean it would include somebody grossing $100 \nmillion, $50 million.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If you had a car dealer that grossed that amount of money, \nconsidering the fact they often make only $100 or $200 on a car, \nalthough the cars sell at $30,000 or $40,000. By the same token, the \ncollection unit might be 20 people and they get several billions of \ndollars.\n  The bottom line: The percentage of what is going to be the net \nprofits is considerably different.\n  What this is going to affect--which is why I use the Senator from \nDelaware and his definition of a small business in the bill--these are \nthe same people, in most likelihood, the mom-and-pop store for whom \n$3,000 or $4,000 may mean making the mortgage payment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Would the Senator set an income level to protect them?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Are we going to change the definition of small business in \nthe bill that the Senator from Delaware cosponsored?\n  Mr. BIDEN. To accommodate the Senator, I would be happy to do \nwhatever he would like.\n  Mr. LEAHY. This is the bill that is presently before the Senate.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Without an exemption.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Cosponsored by the Senator from Delaware. I am using his \ndefinition.\n  Mr. BIDEN. But you are using it out of context.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I think not.\n  Let me talk about what this does: 5 percent to the small feed and \ngrain store could be the difference for them for the year and whether \nthey make it or don't make it.\n  Dean Witter said this bill gives just one credit card company alone, \nMBNA, an increase in net profits of 5 percent. That is $75 million. \nWith most of these small businesses we are talking about, 5 percent is \nnot 5 percent of MBNA.\n  What we want to do--we carve out a special exemption for credit card \ncompanies but leave small business owners fending for themselves--is \nput the small business owners on at least an equal footing.\n  The credit card companies say they need an exemption because their \ndebts are typically unsecured. Most of these small businesses are \nexactly the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Amendment No. 14\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all time having \nexpired, the Leahy amendment is laid aside and there is now 60 minutes \nof debate evenly divided on the Wellstone amendment No. 14.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I had a chance this afternoon to speak \nabout this amendment at great length and may not need all of my time. I \nrespond to some of the arguments made while I was off the floor. They \nwere not made because I was off the floor; I had to go to markup on an \neducation bill, and another Senator spoke.\n\n[[Page S1956]]\n\n  Let me take some of the arguments and respond as colleagues sort this \nout and decide how to vote.\n  First of all, this amendment provides that no provision of the \nbankruptcy bill will affect a debtor who files for bankruptcy if the \ncourt determines that the debtor filed as a result of overwhelming \nmedical bills, unless the debtor elects to have a particular provision \napply.\n  We are really saying if the goal of this bill is to go after those \nthat have gamed the system--again, I cite the American Bankruptcy \nInstitute's report that, at best, that is 3 percent of the people; \nthere are others who say 10 or 13 percent. Surely in those cases where \nthe court determines that the debtor who files for bankruptcy has filed \nfor bankruptcy because of a major medical bill, we would want to exempt \nthem from the provisions of this legislation. This is somebody who is \nnow going under because of cancer or because of a disabling injury. \nThere, but for the grace of God, go I. These are not people gaming the \nsystem.\n  I also pointed out earlier today--and I think it is important to give \nthis amendment some context--it is unfortunate we are not spending more \nof our time trying to figure out how to legislate so we can cover the \n43 or 44 million people with no insurance, or people who are \nunderinsured, people who go under because of catastrophic expenses.\n  Sad but true, being able to file for chapter 7 is one of the ways \npeople can rebuild their lives. It is one of the ways people can get \nback on their feet when they have been knocked down by a major medical \nbill.\n  Why is it necessary? The bankruptcy bill purports to target abuses of \nthe bankruptcy code by wealthy scofflaws and deadbeats who, as I said, \naccording to the American Bankruptcy Institute, make up about 3 \npercent. Yet hundreds of thousands of Americans file bankruptcy every \nyear. They don't file bankruptcy to game the system. They file \nbankruptcy because of medical bills. That can happen to any of us.\n  Unfortunately--and I went through these this afternoon--there are at \nleast 15 provisions in S. 420 that make it harder to get a fresh start, \nregardless of whether the debtor is a scofflaw or a person who must \nfile because they have been made insolvent by medical debt. In the case \nof those families made insolvent by medical debt, they ought to be \nexempt from some of the onerous provisions in this bill.\n  Some of the provisions in the bill include but go beyond the means \ntest. I said this to my colleague from Iowa this afternoon. An analysis \nin the Wall Street Journal last week said: The bill is full of hassle-\ncreating provisions. Some reasonable, some prone to abuse by aggressive \ncreditors trying to get paid at the expense of others. In a thicket of \ncompromises, Congress risks losing sight of the goal, making sure that \nmost debtors pay their bills, while offering a fresh start to those who \nhonestly can't.\n\n  My amendment makes sure we do not deny a fresh start to people who \nreally won't be able to do that with the bill the way it is written. \nThis amendment preserves the fresh start for those debtors who honestly \ncan't because they are drowning in medical debt. That is what this \namendment is about.\n  Let me go through some of the arguments that were made. Is the \nWellstone amendment made redundant by the means test in the bill? \nAbsolutely not. Neither the means test nor the safe harbor in the bill \napplies to the vast majority of new burdens placed on debtors.\n  I held up the whole bill. The bill is more than just the means test. \nThe bill is this size and the means test is this size.\n  Under S. 420, debtors will face those hurdles to filing, regardless \nof the circumstances. Let me give some examples of some of these \nhurdles. One is the prebankruptcy counseling requirements at the \ndebtor's expense, as if medical debts can be counseled away. Why would \nyou want to say to a family that is being put under by a medical bill, \nthat is going through a living hell, that they have to go through \ncredit counseling and they have to pay for it?\n  No. 1, they wouldn't be filing for bankruptcy if they weren't at the \nend of their wits; they wouldn't be filing for bankruptcy if they had a \nlot of extra change, a lot of extra money. This presumption that they \nare trying to abuse the system or have been bad managers and need to go \nthrough prebankruptcy counseling requirements makes no sense at all. It \nmakes no sense at all when families are being put under because of \nmedical bills.\n  There are no limits on repeat filers, regardless of personal \ncircumstances. There are changes to existing cram-down provisions in \nchapter 13 making it more difficult for debtors to keep their car and \nnew tax return filing obligations and new administrative burdens that \nare expected to raise the cost of filing, even in a simple case, by \nhundreds of dollars.\n  The point is, if you are going to try to deal with those people who \nyou think are deadbeats or are gaming the system, for God's sake don't \ndo it for families who are going under because of medical bills and for \nwhom chapter 7 gives them a chance to rebuild their lives.\n  No. 2, does the Wellstone amendment carve out a serious loophole in \nthe means test? No. The debtor can only get an exemption from this bill \nif the court finds that the debtor was forced to file because of \nmedical debt. A debtor who has carried some medical debt but filed \nbecause he ran up a bunch of credit card bills is not going to meet the \nstandard and he is not going to be protected by this amendment.\n  I need to make that point again. The debtor can only get the \nexemption from this bill if the court finds that this family was forced \nto file for bankruptcy because of medical debt.\n  Where is the burden of proof? On which side do we want to err? Don't \nwe want to err on the side of making sure, when people have been put \nunder because of medical circumstances, they are able to get a carve-\nout and go forward and file for chapter 7?\n  No debtor can get an exemption from this bill unless the court finds \nthat the debtor was forced to file because of medical debt. It is not \nenough to say, ``I had a medical bill,'' and then you see somebody who \nhas run up all kinds of credit card bills.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield? Is he talking about his amendment \nor the bill?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am talking about my amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. No. 3, does the Wellstone amendment leave hospitals or \nmedical centers at a disadvantage? No. The amendment doesn't make \nmedical debt a lower priority than other debt. The point is, this \ndoesn't change current law. With this bill, you have auto lenders, you \nhave credit card companies, you have all sorts of people who have a \nclaim. But this particular piece of legislation does not affect the \ndischargeability or nondischargeability of medical debt at all. This is \nthe same protections that people have right now. We are not changing \nany current law in terms of whether hospitals are able or not able to \nget reimbursement.\n\n  Can I give a real-world example of how the nonmeans test portion of \nthe bill affects medical debt filing? My colleague from Delaware may \nwant to respond to this Time magazine example about Allen Smith, a \nresident of Delaware, a State which has no homestead exemption. In \nother words, he can't shield his home from his creditors.\n  Ironically, under this bill, wealthy scofflaws can shield \nmultimillion-dollar mansions from their creditors with a little \nplanning. All you have to do is, a couple of years in advance, know you \nare going to be in trouble. A lot of people with high incomes know \nthat. You hire a lawyer and you are fine.\n  But Mr. Smith doesn't get that break. As a result, when the tragic \nmedical problems described in the Time magazine article befell his \nfamily, he could not file a chapter 7 case without losing his home. \nInstead, he filed a chapter 13 case, which required substantial \npayments in addition to his regular mortgage payments for him to save \nhis home. Ultimately, after his wife passed away and he himself was \nhospitalized, he was unable to make all those payments and his chapter \n13 plan failed.\n  Had Delaware had a reasonable homestead exemption and Mr. Smith been \nable to simply file a chapter 7 case to eliminate his debts, he might \nhave been able to save his home. Mr. Smith's financial deterioration \nwas caused not by his being a spendthrift, not because he was a bad \nmanager of his budget, not because he did anything wrong. His financial \ndeterioration was\n\n[[Page S1957]]\n\ncaused by unavoidable medical problems.\n  Before he thought about bankruptcy, he went to consumer credit card \ncounseling to try to deal with his debt. However, it appears that he \nwent to consumer credit card counseling just over 180 days before the \ncase was filed and he did not receive a briefing, so the new bill would \nrequire him to go again. This would have been very difficult, \nconsidering his medical problems. In fact, his attorney made several \nvisits to Mr. Smith and his wife, who was a double amputee.\n  The new bill would also have required a great deal of additional time \nand expense for Mr. Smith and his attorney through new paperwork \nrequirements and a requirement that he attend a credit education \ncourse. Such a course would not have done anything to help prevent the \nmedical problems suffered by Mr. Smith and his wife. He did not get \ninto financial trouble through his failure to manage his money. He is \n73 years old and he never had any debt problems.\n  The bill makes no exemptions for people who cannot attend the course \nthat they are supposed to take, this counseling, due to circumstances \nbeyond their control. So Mr. Smith might never have been able to get \nany relief in bankruptcy under this new bill.\n  Do we really want to do this to people? Under the new bill, Mr. Smith \nalso would have had to give up his television and VCR to Sears, which \nclaimed a security interest in the items. Under the bill, he would not \nbe permitted to retain possession of these items in chapter 7 unless he \naffirms the debt or retrieved the item. Sears may demand reaffirmation \nof the entirely $3,000 debt under the bill, and to redeem, Mr. Smith \nwould have to pay the retail value.\n  After his wife died and the income was gone, Mr. Smith did not have \nthe money to pay these amounts to Sears. Since he is largely homebound, \nloss of the items would have been devastating.\n  The point is, Mr. Smith's medical problems continued. Under the \ncurrent law, if he again amasses medical and other debts he can't pay, \nhe could seek refuge in chapter 13 where he would be required to pay \nall that he could afford. Under the new bill, Mr. Smith cannot file a \nchapter 13 case for 5 years. The time for filing chapter 7 has also \nbeen increased.\n\n  There have been a bunch of reports about this bill. I know the \nproponents think they have been unfair. We all have our own definition \nof right and wrong here. ABC had a tough piece last night. Time \nmagazine had a tough piece. The Wall Street Journal was tough. Business \nWeek had a tough piece.\n  Personally, as I said about 50 times today, every time I talk about \nmoney and the credit card industry, I have to be careful because you \ncannot make the assumption that because you have an industry, a \npowerful industry that has poured the money into doing the lobbying, it \nis a one-to-one correlation to people's positions. You can't do that. I \nrefuse to do it. People can do that to anybody here on any issue.\n  But that is not the point. Institutionally, I have to say this is, \nunfortunately, a classic example of an industry with a tremendous \namount of financial wherewithal, with an all-out lobbying effort, which \nI think is probably well satisfied with this piece of legislation \nbecause, frankly, there is very little in this legislation that calls \nfor any accountability on the part of this industry.\n  You will have an amendment tomorrow that deals with some of the \npredator practices and the ways in which they push credit cards on \nchildren.\n  But there is a whole lot in this legislation going way beyond a means \ntest--too many provisions, too many hurdles which are too harsh--which \nmake it really too difficult for a whole lot of ordinary people who \nhaven't abused anybody or any system to be able to file for chapter 7.\n  That is what I think this debate is about. Of course, the people most \nhurt are the people with the least amount of clout.\n  I think if this amendment passes, it makes this a much better bill \nbecause I don't disagree with the premise. I think the legislation is \nway too broad. Unfortunately, I think the legislation has some very \nfar-reaching and far-ranging serious implications in terms of how it \naffects people's lives.\n  If we want to go after people gaming the system, let's do it. Why not \njust say when you have a family filing for bankruptcy because of \nmedical bills that we exempt them from all of these different tests and \nprovisions and hurdles that will make it impossible for them to rebuild \ntheir lives? That is what this amendment is about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I appreciate what the Senator is trying to \ndo. It is confusing me a little bit, though--not his intention but the \nway he phrases it.\n  He talks about the fact that if someone has a serious medical bill \nthat causes them to move into bankruptcy, which I might add is a real \nproblem, and it is the reason why most people move into bankruptcy, it \nis not credit cards--you can't have it both ways and stand up on the \nfloor and say the reason people go into bankruptcy is credit card debt. \nThere is no evidence of that. The GAO report doesn't say that. The \nCongressional Research Service doesn't say that--and then point out, \nwhich is accurate, that medical bills cause people to go into \nbankruptcy in considerable numbers. I do not know the exact number. I \ndon't know whether it is 20 percent, 50 percent, or 70 percent. But it \nis a lot. I understand what he is saying.\n  By the way, there is one generic point to which I am sympathetic--\nthat people in fact have real serious medical problems and are forced \nto liquidate everything they have to pay the medical bills. It is an \nabsolute tragedy. I agree with my friend. That is why I support the \nnational health insurance plan and the need to cover all of those \nfolks.\n  I also appreciate the fact that he is not engaging in and he never \nhas the idea that because a particular group or group of people support \na position, and they have power, that anybody who votes with them is \nbecause of the power.\n  My friend and I voted against the position of the Chamber of Commerce \nyesterday notwithstanding the fact that labor poured tens of thousands \nof dollars into the campaigns of Members on this side. And I suspect \nthat labor PACs gave my friend from Wisconsin hundreds of thousands of \ndollars. They did not give a cent to the Senator from Delaware because \nI don't take PAC money, and I haven't taken PAC money.\n  I appreciate the honesty that he is exhibiting, but it confuses me on \na couple of points. One, I am from Scranton, PA. That is an area of the \ncountry that has been on hard times for a long time. My grandfather \nFinnigan used to have an expression. He would say: When the fellow in \nThroop--that was a community south of Scranton--loses his job, it means \nthere is an economic slowdown. When your brother-in-law loses a job, it \nmeans there is a recession. When you lose your job, it means there is a \ndepression.\n  I wonder why we don't include people who lose their jobs and have to \ndeclare bankruptcy and can't find employment.\n  I have a little bit of a problem in terms of singling out one type of \nthat debt that is exempt, but not because it has anything to do with \nany other industry. I don't know any other industry that cares a whole \nlot about that. My point is, that is a conceptual problem I am having \ndifficulty getting over.\n  But the second point I wish to make is that his amendment wouldn't \naffect what this bill is about. It would affect bankruptcy law \ntremendously, present bankruptcy law, future bankruptcy law, future \nbankruptcy changes, and present. It would have a profound impact.\n  But the reason for this bill is to set a standard on the basis of \nsomeone moving from chapter 7 to chapter 13. I remind anybody who is \nlistening to this at home that chapter 7 means if you file in that \nchapter, all your debts are discharged, and you start brand new. You \ndon't owe anybody anything. You don't try to pay anything off. It is \ndone. Chapter 13 means that the vast majority of your debts are \ndischarged,\n\n[[Page S1958]]\n\nbut you work out a payment plan because you can think you can pay some \nof it. Most people who chose chapter 13 in the old days chose it to \navoid the embarrassment of chapter 7 so they could pay something off in \ngood faith. They had something to pay, but they couldn't pay everybody. \nThey wanted the court to help them figure out how to divvy out what \nthey could pay.\n\n  That is what it is about. There is no standard now that a judge uses. \nThere is a generic standard saying substantial abuse. Right now, a \nbankruptcy court judge or master has to move someone from 7 to 13 if \nthat judge says, look, you are able to pay something so you should be \nin 13.\n  My dad always said: Keep your eye on the ball. The ball here is what \nthis is about. This bill is about whether or not there is a standard we \nare now going to set beyond the broad standard of substantial abuse \nthat says when you must move from chapter 7 into chapter 13 to pay some \nof your bills.\n  By the way, you only get moved into that if you have at least $10,000 \nto distribute after all of your necessities are taken care of, or you \nare able to pay 25 percent of your debt over 5 years. If you can't meet \nthat standard, you are not in 13 either. You don't get into chapter 13.\n  Again, keep your eye on the ball. This bill is about whether or not \nyou can pay some of your bills.\n  Along comes my friend who says--which may be good public policy. I am \nnot disagreeing with the possibility that anybody who declares \nbankruptcy because of medical bills can discharge those debts outright, \nperiod. They are just in chapter 7. They can, in fact, go there.\n  I point out to my friend about the case in Delaware. The individual \nfiled in chapter 7. He chose to file in chapter 7. He discharged all of \nhis debts. Unfortunately, my State has what I thought the Senator from \nMinnesota had been saying. You shouldn't have a homestead exemption. My \nState doesn't. Had he filed 13, he could have kept his home \ntheoretically. He was not required. He filed in chapter 7.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thirteen.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Then he would have been able to keep his home in chapter \n13. If I am wrong about that, I will correct the record. But in \nDelaware, under chapter 7, we don't have this way to hide assets in a \nhouse. I think you should be able to keep up to $100,000 of the value \nof your house. But in 13, you get to keep your house as long as you \nkeep your mortgage payments, and you are allowed to have that portion \ntaken out to keep your house just as you can have that portion taken \nout to pay your medical bills, or pay ongoing expenses that you have--\ngas for your car to go back and forth to work, et cetera.\n  That is the case that would not be affected by this legislation. It \nwould not be made better or not be made worse by this will. What would \nhappen is arguably he wouldn't have to go to 13 if he didn't want to \nbecause under this bill, the means test in S. 420 establishes a \nstandard. It establishes a standard. And it goes on to point out that \nin terms of this whole argument about medical bills, which I went into \na little while earlier, unless your means test--in my State, by the \nway, the means test for a family would be $46,000, and you would have \nto make more than that to even be considered in the means test, but \nonce you are in the means test, then what happens is special \ncircumstances can be counted, whether or not you can still stay in \nchapter 7 or get bumped to chapter 13. And the special circumstances \nrelate to medical expenses. The medical expenses are your special \ncircumstances.\n\n  If you are in a situation where not only do you have medical expenses \nthat you have to meet but you have the medical expenses and other \nnecessary expenses that are not limited to your own medical expenses--\nfor example, the medical expenses you are paying for your mom, the \nmedical expenses you are paying for your adopted child, the medical \nexpenses you are paying for your sister, the medical expenses you are \npaying for a family member --those get included so you do not get \nknocked out of chapter 7 under this law. You can count those medical \nexpenses.\n  So a judge says: OK, look, under the means test, you have this amount \nof money. You do not make more than $46,000 in Delaware, so you can \nstay in chapter 7. We are not even going to consider looking at whether \nor not you have a right to file in chapter 7. And then, by the way, if \nyou are 150 percent above that income, which gets you up to, what, \n$60,000, or something like that, whatever the exact number is, then you \ncan say: Hey, wait a minute. I have all these medical expenses so I get \nto stay in chapter 7 anyway.\n  My confusion is how this amendment relates to this bill. It relates \nto bankruptcy generally; I acknowledge that. It is a new standard that \nwe are considering, but it does not go to the assertions made by others \nthat people, because of their medical bills, are getting killed with \nthis legislation.\n  The very example my friend gave already was an example that occurred \nin Delaware that had nothing to do with this legislation. His medical \nbills were so high, the poor devil, and his income was so limited, he \nlost everything. That is tragic. That is why we need national health \ninsurance. But the passage of this bill would not alleviate that \nproblem. So it is kind of a non sequitur. They are not related.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am trying to respond to some of what my good friend \nfrom Delaware has said. It is true that in the example I gave of Allen \nSmith, he is not affected by the means test. That is my point. There \nare 200 pages to this bill. I say to my colleague, I went over some of \nthese provisions this afternoon that affect everyone, regardless of \nincome, regardless of whether or not they file for chapter 13 or \nchapter 7.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will make a couple points, and then I will yield to \nget the Senator's response.\n  My point is, why would you want to have these kinds of rules and \nthese kinds of provisions when you have a family being put under \nbecause of medical bills?\n  I am trying to get all my notes together, one by one.\n  My colleague said, conceptually why not somebody who has lost their \njob? That could very well be an amendment that I will have on this \nbill. It is pretty horrible when people lose their jobs. By the way, \nthe next thing they worry about, when they lose their job, is losing \ntheir health care coverage. You sort of assume, if somebody loses their \njob, they can find another job. But what if somebody has been put under \nbecause of a medical bill and they themselves are struggling with a \ndisease or a disabling injury? It seems to me this would be the first, \nif you will, order of exemption.\n  My colleague says there are sweeping changes to this amendment. That \nis true. This bill is also cause for sweeping changes. It depends on \nwhether you think the changes are good, whether you think they are the \nright thing to do or not. That is where we disagree.\n  Now, it is true--and this is a key point to make--that what I am \ndoing is saying there ought to be some discretion in the system. My \ncolleague talked about the standards. I do not mind having rigorous or \neven rigid standards, as long as you do not capture the wrong people. \nBut you are capturing the wrong people. The people who pay the price, \nas I have tried to argue, are people who, again, as determined by the \ncourt are filing for bankruptcy because of medical expenses. I think \nthat is about 50 percent of the cases, at least on the basis of what I \nhave seen.\n  Although, interestingly enough--and I do not want to have a side \ndebate with my colleague on this--although, interestingly enough, in \nconsumer surveys actually people cite credit card companies as the \nreason they file for bankruptcy before they do for medical expenses.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Kind of funny. It is wrong, though; isn't it?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. To my mind----\n  Mr. BIDEN. You can't have it both ways.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. You can't have it both ways, but it can be \ninteractive. Frankly, there are a number of variables that come into \nplay. I think my colleague from Delaware is right when he talked about \njob loss. But, I say to the Senator from Delaware--I do not know if he \nheard my first response,\n\n[[Page S1959]]\n\nwhich was that I absolutely understand conceptually what he was saying \nwhen he said: Why not job loss? And I said that could very well be \nanother amendment--as awful as that is, the place to start is the \nmedical expenses.\n  In relation to job loss, we have this going on right now with 1,300 \ntaconite workers. You go up there and talk to people. The next thing \nthey are frightened of is that in 6 months they will lose their health \ninsurance. If they worked there a little longer, they lose it after a \nyear. And do you know what else. And I am going to try--and this one I \nam hoping to get support on from a lot of Senators--the other thing I \nam worried about, I say to Senator Biden from Delaware, is that the \nretirees are terrified--and ``terrified'' is the right word; and too \nmany of them, I would argue, are dealing with cancer--that LTV, the \ncompany, is going to file for bankruptcy and they are going to walk \naway from their health care obligations. That is a huge concern.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Right. I agree.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. But my argument would be that with the medical, it is \nnot just the bills. I am imagining people who have been stricken with \nillnesses or disabling injuries. So I thought: Look, if there is any \ngroup of people--there, but for the grace of God, go I--it applies to \nthem.\n  Again, I am not arguing that there isn't discretion. Deliberately, we \nhave discretion put in here. I think the rules are too rigid in this \nbill. I am not arguing that the means test is the issue. In fact, I \nsaid this afternoon--and I say tonight--there are a whole bunch of \nother provisions--I outlined 12, or 13, or 14 provisions--that I think \nmake it difficult for people to rebuild their lives.\n  That is the point I am making. I do not see why we can't have an \nexemption. I think it would make the bill a much better bill, and it \nwould accomplish the goal you are trying to accomplish, which is to not \nlet folks game it. But for the families I am talking about, they are \nnot gaming it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I yield some of my time. I yield 5 \nminutes to the Senator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is very generous of the Senator.\n  I would like to make three points, and I will try to make them \nquickly.\n  One, the point of the Senator's amendment is--and I agree with the \nthrust of it because there should be no discretion--no discretion--if, \nin fact, you are bankrupt because of medical bills, then you \nautomatically are out, period. It is done. You do not owe anybody \nanything; finished, over, done, period. I understand that. And I \nsympathize with that.\n  I do not want anybody to mix apples and oranges unintentionally or in \nlistening to this debate. What would be implied from this debate or \nassumed from this debate is somehow, by the passage of this bill, \npeople with medical bills will be put at a greater disadvantage than \nthey are under the present system. That is not true.\n  In the broader question of whether or not bankruptcy law--period--\nshould be for people who have no ability to pay their bills because \nthey have medical bills, or have no ability to pay their bills because \nof the loss of their job, or have no ability to pay their bills because \nthey are deemed to be incompetent, even though they have an estate that \nexists out there--they are all different things that have nothing to do \nwith the question of whether or not this legislation should pass or \nshould fail. Based on the argument my friend from Wisconsin is making, \nwe should eliminate the bankruptcy law that exists now. We should have \nno bankruptcy law because this does not exist in the present bankruptcy \nlaw.\n  It doesn't exist in present bankruptcy law. Let's not get confused. \nIf the Senator wishes to make the argument that this is an important \nexemption that should be written into bankruptcy law as it exists or as \nit is amended, I understand that; I empathize with it. But if it is to \nmake the case that people with severe medical bills are more \ndisadvantaged under the changes we are proposing than the law that \nexists now, I don't buy that argument.\n  I will conclude by saying the only reason I spoke to the question of \nand agreed with the Senator that I think at least 50 percent of all \nbankruptcies are filed because of medical bills--at least 50 percent--\nif that is true, then my friend from Illinois and my other friend from \nWisconsin and my friend from Massachusetts are dead wrong when they say \nthe majority of bankruptcies are filed because of credit cards. That \nmeans that that can't be true.\n  Let's just look. I ``ain't'' slow; I did pretty well in math. It is \nreally simple. With fifty percent of 100 percent based upon the fact \nthat you have too many medical bills and you are required to go \nbankrupt, that means that all other bankruptcies, for whatever reason, \namount to 50 percent, which means that credit card bankruptcies must be \nless than 49 percent--at least less than 49 percent.\n  According to the study we have gotten, there is no evidence that they \nhave contributed at all to the increase in bankruptcy.\n  I might add, I am anxious to debate the predatory practice of sending \nthe kids the credit card and all that stuff. With the limits they put \non the credit card, those limits that you get when you get that credit \ncard at the front end, these people that can't pay that back are so few \nthat they are not even in the game of declaring bankruptcy. They are \nnot even in the game. The college student who gets a credit card and \nblows it up and spends $1,000 on the credit card, they don't declare \nbankruptcy because of a $1,000 debt they don't pay. That is malarkey.\n  They declare bankruptcy because they run up tens of thousands of \ndollars in loans to go to college. That is why you should support the \nSchumer-Biden amendment to make sure that people can deduct the cost of \ncollege from their taxes. That is why we should provide for health care \nfor all Americans so we don't have them declaring bankruptcy because of \nthis.\n  Bankruptcies increase in direct proportion to people losing their \nhealth insurance--in direct proportion. Senator Kennedy stands on the \nfloor--and no one knows more about it than he--and points out that \nfewer and fewer people have health care coverage since we started this \ndebate on health care because my friends on the other side of the aisle \nare reluctant to provide for health care for people.\n  I just want a little truth in advertising here; that is all. It is \nOK, beat up on the credit card companies, don't like them. Beat up on \nthe big companies, don't like them. This is an ironic position for me \nto be in after 28 years in the Senate. No one has ever accused me of \nbeing a friend of the banking industry. I have been around for a long \ntime. Let's get it straight; you can't have it all ways here.\n  My friend comes to talk about the predatory practices. There are \npredatory practices, I acknowledge that. But are they the reason \nbankruptcies are increasing? Maybe. I see no evidence of it. No one has \nshown any evidence of that. The only report that was done indicates the \nopposite. If 50 percent related to health care, then obviously it isn't \nbecause of any particular industry.\n  I thank my colleague for his generosity.\n  I ask my friend from Iowa--he was not on the floor--I am defending \nhis position. The Senator from Minnesota yielded me 5 minutes of his \ntime. If he needs time, I hope the Senator will lend him the 5 minutes \nhe would have lent me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 13\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I believe we can accommodate the Senator \nfrom Delaware and the Senator from Minnesota. We have 20 minutes \nremaining. I will yield myself 5 minutes. Then it is my understanding \nthat Senator Hatch needs some time to respond to the Senator from \nMinnesota. I will take my time to address an amendment that we are \ngoing to be voting on when we vote on two amendments in just a few \nminutes. That amendment is the amendment by the Senator from Vermont, \nMr. Leahy.\n  The amendment would allow small businesses to be given special \ntreatment as compared to other businesses. When the words ``small \nbusiness'' are used around the U.S. Congress, everybody looks up \nbecause we know that\n\n[[Page S1960]]\n\nsmall business is the engine of advancement in America, creating the \nnew jobs.\n  I have to say that albeit his amendment may be well intended because \nwe want small businesses to succeed--and I would be the first one to \nsay that--Senator Leahy's amendment would be detrimental to this bill \nand also to many small businesses as well as those he says he is trying \nto help.\n  I will explain to the Senate now why I believe his amendment is \nintended to help small businesses of some very small size and help \nother businesses that are just a little larger but still very much a \nsmall business.\n  He would do this by creating three categories of unsecured creditors \nin chapter 7, chapter 12, and chapter 13 proceedings under our \nbankruptcy code. Priority creditors would be paid first, then small \nbusiness creditors, and then general business creditors that are not \nsmall business creditors are the last in line. I will repeat that. It \nwould give priority creditors the option of being paid first, then \nsmall business creditors, and then general business creditors that are \nnot small business creditors are the last in line.\n  This idea is different from the way bankruptcy has been treated \nhistorically where we have only given special treatment to creditors \nwith extraordinary circumstances. What I mean to say is that we have \ncreated a priority status for those who have compelling reasons to go \nfirst, such as child support, which has dominated this debate on \nbankruptcy reform for 3 years now. After child support, people who \nmight be killed by drunk drivers is an example, or the importance of \nhigh priority for back pay and wages. If you don't have a compelling \nreason such as these categories I have just listed, then creditors \notherwise are given equal treatment.\n  I have to conclude that this is an antibusiness amendment. It would, \nfor instance, require a law firm or a payday loan shark of five members \nto be paid before an auto repair shop with 30 employees. Also, the \namendment could have an unintended result, such as larger businesses \nbeing deterred from offering credit to people who may really need it. \nFurther, this issue has not been examined at all. We don't know for \nsure what the implications are.\n  I hope my colleagues will oppose this amendment. Do not be sucked \ninto voting for it because it has a title of small business, because it \nhas small business of a certain category but it hurts small businesses \ngenerally.\n  I yield the floor and yield whatever time Senator Hatch might \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 14\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I appreciate all the \nwork he has done on this bill through the years and here today as well. \nHe and I have walked arm in arm on this bill for a long time.\n  We have tried to accommodate our friends on the other side in \ninnumerable ways. We have accommodated them. It seems as if we can \nnever quite satisfy some on the other side. I am not finding fault with \nthem; they are very sincere on these amendments, but there is no way we \ncould go with some of the amendments that have been offered.\n  I am going to talk about the amendment of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Minnesota, excepting those with high medical expenses from all \nprovisions of this reform legislation.\n  The effect of that amendment: If a debtor can demonstrate ``the \nreason for filing was a result of debts incurred through medical \nexpenses,'' the debtor is exempt from every provision of S. 420, except \nthose they might elect to have covered.\n  I can imagine that is not going to be much of an election. The \namendment would create a major loophole, if we were to accept or vote \nup the Wellstone amendment. S. 420 already allows all medical expenses \nto be deducted in determining the ability to pay.\n  If for some reason a debtor could not deduct them under the IRS \nguidelines, the debtor can demonstrate that there are ``special'' \ncircumstances. So the only people this amendment would help are well-\noff people who have the ability to pay but also suffered medical \nproblems.\n  The amendment unwisely creates two classes of debtors. One class must \nuse the bankruptcy bill as S. 420 would amend it, and another class can \nuse bankruptcy law as it exists today or pick and choose what \nprovisions of this new law apply to it.\n  To allow some group of citizens, no matter how unfortunate, to pick \nand choose what parts of the law will apply to them is absolutely \nunprecedented. But that is what the amendment of the Senator from \nMinnesota would do. It would allow debtors to evade the child support, \nalimony, and marital property settlement provisions of this bill that \nhelp women and children. The debtor who owed child support could evade \nhis basic responsibilities to pay child support by fitting under the \nloophole created by this Wellstone amendment.\n  I have worked long and hard to solve these problems. I have to tell \nyou, I think we have them solved, to a large degree, in this bill. I \nthink people on both sides of the aisle are appreciative we have worked \nso hard for women and children.\n  The Wellstone amendment would allow debtors to evade the homestead \nexemption caps imposed by this bill. His amendment is unworkable. \nCreditors would not know if they had to make the truth in lending \ndisclosures this bill imposes on them until after the debtor filed for \nbankruptcy. Yet the disclosures must be given in credit card \nsolicitations and on monthly statements.\n  The amendment would have the strange effect of apparently exempting \ncreditors from complying with consumer protections in this bill, such \nas the reaffirmation reforms that we have here, such as the \nrestrictions on creditors who fail to credit plan payments properly, \nsuch as the privacy protections, and so forth.\n  So I hope my colleagues will recognize this amendment for what it is. \nIt is an amendment that will not work. It is not fair. It would benefit \nonly those who could afford to pay their medical bills, and it would \nnot do anything for others. It would allow a loophole so people could \npick and choose in legislation that we ought to all be subjected to or \nhave to comply with, or that we ought to all benefit from, depending \nupon the use of the particular bill because all of those factors are \npart of it.\n  I hope our colleagues will vote against this amendment. It is an \nunwise amendment. It would devastate this bill in many respects, and it \nwould not accomplish what the distinguished Senator would want to \naccomplish because I know his goal is to help those who are \nunfortunate. That is our goal, too. That is why we have special \ncircumstances in this bill, to help those who are unfortunate, who \nshould not have to comply with some of the aspects of the bill. His \namendment basically helps those who should not be helped, who ought to \nbe able to pay for their own expenses, and who can pay for them.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wonder whether my colleague--I think \nI have 2 minutes--will grant me 2 minutes. I won't need more than 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I tried to respond to what colleagues \nhave said. I want to respond to one point my friend from Utah made. The \nquestion is whether the amendment carves out a serious loophole in the \nmeans test. The answer is no.\n  The debtor can only get an exemption from this bill if the court \nfinds that the debtor was forced to file because of medical debt. \nAgain, I say to my colleague, I don't have any problem with rigorous \nstandards, or even rigid standards, as long as you don't capture the \nwrong people. This legislation captures the wrong people. There ought \nto be some discretion in the system that says, yes, go after those \npeople who are gaming the system--although I think we have very \ndifferent views about what percentage they are. But for God's sake, \nwhen it is a family being put under, through no fault of their own, \nbecause of a major medical illness or injury and, therefore, medical \nbills,\n\n[[Page S1961]]\n\nand the court finds that indeed the debtor was forced to file because \nof a major medical bill, that is where I would argue we ought to have \nan exemption for these families from any number of the different \nprovisions in this bill that are meant to deal with people involved in \ngaming the system, which will make it so difficult.\n  I have listed a lot of these provisions all day. Why would we not, if \nthe purported purpose of this legislation, I say to two good Senators, \nis to go after people who are gaming the system, to go after some of \nthe abuses, why would we not want to have this very simple exception \nfor people who are filing for bankruptcy because of major medical \nexpenses? That is all this does, as determined by the court.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I listened to our distinguished colleague \nfrom Minnesota. I have to say this bill takes care of people who cannot \nafford to pay their medical expenses. His amendment would allow those \nwho can afford to pay for them a loophole to get out of paying for \nthem.\n  The poor really are taken care of in this bill because of the means \ntest we have provided. But the wealthy, even though they have a \ntremendous capacity to earn money in the future, would be able to get \nout of all of the provisions of this bill under his amendment if they \nhave medical expenses they can't afford to pay for at that particular \ntime, but they clearly have the ability to pay for it in the future.\n  This bill is to try to stop that kind of abuse. That is why I cannot \nsupport the amendment of the Senator. I know he is trying to do what is \nright. As a practicality, under bankruptcy law, it would be one of the \nworst things you could put in this bill. So this is a harmful and \nunnecessary amendment that would undermine the important reforms in the \nbankruptcy bill.\n  Under this amendment, all the debtor who is fully able to repay his \ndebts would have to do to get out of repaying them is to show he filed \nfor bankruptcy because of medical expenses--somebody fully capable of \npaying his or her bills. S. 420 already allows for unlimited medical \nexpenses to be deducted in determining the ability to pay, and its \nmeans test only applies to those who have income above the national \nmedian income and have the ability to pay at least 25 percent of their \ndebts over 5 years.\n  So the amendment of the distinguished Senator is ill-advised. It \nwould be a travesty as part of this particular bill, where we are \ntrying to solve problems and trying to get those who can pay to live up \nto the responsibilities and not use the bankruptcy laws as a \nmethodology of getting out from under debts they are capable of paying.\n  I hope our colleagues will vote against this amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Senator from Minnesota has been \nbuilding a Potemkin village against this bill over a period of 3 years. \nWe have dealt with many of the houses and buildings that have been put \nup. First, it was child support. That has quieted down. Then it was the \nunemployed. That has quieted down. Then it was those who were in a \ndivorce with special problems. That has quieted down.\n  We have destroyed almost every one of these homes in your village \nexcept this one of medical expenses, and it keeps coming up. It started \nlast spring when the Time magazine story came out about how this bill \nwas so unfair to certain families in America.\n  I assure the Senator that every one of those families mentioned in \nthat story would have been able to take bankruptcy even if our bill \nwere law. Most of those are people who had medical expenses.\n  This paper house of medical expenses comes up again. I have said so \nmany times in this debate, not just this year but last year, that we \nallow under this bill 100 percent of the medical expenses to be \ndeducted in determining whether somebody can file under chapter 7 and \nhave the ability to pay. If 100 percent of expenses are not enough, \nwill 101 percent or 102 percent or 110 percent satisfy the Senator? I \nwould almost be willing to give it to the Senator.\n  I know the Senator says he has to have his amendment or we go through \na certain procedure. What does the Senator from Minnesota think the \nwhole process of bankruptcy is about? If we did not have that process, \neverybody would be gaming the system. We have people gaming the system \nnow.\n  I just read a story put out by the credit union people about somebody \nfrom the Senator's State who had made it very clear why he was going \ninto bankruptcy, and he spent the next 3 months traveling through the \nSouth after he retired.\n  What we are trying to do is bit by bit destroy these faults, these \nstructures built against this bill, and I think we have destroyed them \nall. I hope this vote on the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota \nwill put this issue of medical expenses to rest once and for all.\n  The very same people the Senator wants to make sure get a fresh \nstart, I want to make sure get a fresh start, and they are going to be \nable to do it under our bill. They do not need the amendment of the \nSenator from Minnesota to do it.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, do we have the yeas and nays on both \namendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have only been ordered on \nthe Leahy amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask for the yeas and nays on the Wellstone amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 14.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate on the Leahy amendment.\n\n[[Page S1962]]\n\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week the distinguished majority leader \nsaid we needed to pass this bill to help small business creditors in \nbankruptcy. I agree with him. Tonight we can take a bipartisan step to \ndo just that.\n  This amendment provides small business creditors with the priority \ndistribution from the bankruptcy estate. They make up 90 percent of the \nbusinesses in our country. These are the mom-and-pop stores across the \ncountry--the feedstores, the small ranchers, and the small farmers. \nThey are the backbone of our economy.\n  We are already giving different preferences in this bill. All I am \nsaying is that if you have to have the first preference to a \nmultibillion-dollar credit card company, or the stores on your main \nstreet of your hometown, when you list those preferences, give the \nstores the first preferences. It doesn't let any debtors off their \ndebt, but it helps the small businesses of America.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this amendment would discriminate against \nany business with more than 25 employees with regard to their ability \nto collect debts in bankruptcy. Instead of allowing the bankruptcy \nprocess to proceed fairly, this amendment would prevent businesses with \nmore than 25 employees from being paid a single penny until smaller \nbusinesses were paid in full. It is an improper way to proceed in \nbankruptcy. We should not discriminate against anybody and let the \nprocess takes its course.\n  I hope our colleagues will vote against this amendment.\n  I move to table the amendment.

A witness who is unable to obtain \n     counsel may inform the Committee of such fact. If the witness \n     informs the Committee of this fact at least 24 hours prior to \n     his or her appearance before the Committee, the Committee \n     shall then endeavor to obtain voluntary counsel for the \n     witness. Failure to obtain such counsel will not excuse the \n     witness from appearing and testifying.\n       (b) Counsel shall conduct themselves in an ethical and \n     professional manner. Failure to do so shall, upon a finding \n     to that effect by a majority of the members present, subject \n     such counsel to disciplinary action which may include \n     warning, censure, removal, or a recommendation of contempt \n     proceedings.\n       (c) There shall be no direct or cross-examination by \n     counsel.

The Committee may use such questions and \n     dispose of such suggestions as it deems appropriate.\n       8.5. Statements by Witnesses.--A witness may make a \n     statement, which shall be brief and relevant, at the \n     beginning and conclusion of his or her testimony.

Objections and Rulings.--Any objection raised by a \n     witness or counsel shall be ruled upon by the Chairman or \n     other presiding member, and such ruling shall be the ruling \n     of the Committee unless a majority of the Committee present \n     overrules the ruling of the chair.\n       8.7. Inspection and Correction.--All witnesses testifying \n     before the Committee shall be given a reasonable opportunity \n     to inspect, in the office of the Committee, the transcript of \n     their testimony to determine whether such testimony was \n     correctly transcribed. The witness may be accompanied by \n     counsel. Any corrections the witness desires to make in the \n     transcript shall be submitted in writing to the Committee \n     within five days from the date when the transcript was made \n     available to the witness. Corrections shall be limited to \n     grammar and minor editing, and may not be made to change the \n     substance of the testimony.

Requests to Testify.--The Committee will consider \n     requests to testify on any matter or measure pending before \n     the Committee. A person who believes that testimony or other \n     evidence presented at a public hearing, or any comment made \n     by a Committee member or a member of the Committee staff may \n     tend to affect adversely his or her reputation, may request \n     to appear personally before the Committee to testify on his \n     or her own behalf, or may file a sworn statement of facts \n     relevant to the testimony, evidence, or comment, or may \n     submit to the Chairman proposed questions in writing for the \n     cross-examination of other witnesses. The Committee shall \n     take such action as it deems appropriate.\n       8.9. Contempt Procedures.--No recommendation that a person \n     be cited for contempt of Congress shall be forwarded to the \n     Senate unless and until the Committee has, upon notice to all \n     its members, met and considered the alleged contempt, \n     afforded the person an opportunity to state in writing or in \n     person why he or she should not be held in contempt, and \n     agreed by majority vote of the Committee, to forward such \n     recommendation to the Senate.\n       8.10.

All documents or materials removed from \n     the Committee offices for such authorized purposes must be \n     returned to the Committee's secure storage area for overnight \n     storage.\n       9.3. Each member of the Committee shall at all times have \n     access to all papers and other material received from any \n     source. The Staff Director shall be responsible for the \n     maintenance, under appropriate security procedures, of a \n     registry which will number\n\n[[Page S1965]]\n\n     and identify all classified papers and other classified \n     materials in the possession of the Committee, and such \n     registry shall be available to any member of the Committee.\n       9.4.

No member of the Committee or of the Committee staff \n     shall disclose, in whole or in part or by way of summary, to \n     any person not a member of the Committee or the Committee \n     staff for any purpose or in connection with any proceeding, \n     judicial or otherwise, any testimony given before the \n     committee in executive session including the name of any \n     witness who appeared or was called to appear before the \n     Committee in executive session, or the contents of any papers \n     or materials or other information received by the Committee \n     except as authorized herein, or otherwise as authorized by \n     the Committee in accordance with Section 8 of S. Res. 400 of \n     the 94th Congress and the provisions of these rules, or in \n     the event of the termination of the Committee, in such a \n     manner as may be determined by the Senate.

An unclassified version of \n     each report may be made available to the public at the \n     discretion of the select committee. Nothing herein shall be \n     construed as requiring the public disclosure in such reports \n     of the names of individuals engaged in intelligence \n     activities for the United States or the divulging of \n     intelligence methods employed or the sources of information \n     on which such reports are based or the amount of funds \n     authorized to be appropriated for intelligence activities.\n       (c) On or before March 15 of each year, the select \n     committee shall submit to the Committee on the Budget of the \n     Senate the views and estimates described in section 301(c) of \n     the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 regarding matters within \n     the jurisdiction of the select committee.\n       Sec. 5. (a) For the purpose of this resolution, the select \n     committee is authorized in its discretion (1) to make \n     investigations into any matter within its jurisdiction, (2) \n     to make expenditures from the contingent fund of the Senate, \n     (3) to employ personnel, (4) to hold hearings, (5) to sit and \n     act at any time or place during the sessions, recesses, and \n     adjourned periods of the Senate, (6) to require, by subpoena \n     or otherwise, the attendance of witnesses and the production \n     of correspondence, books, papers, and documents, (7) to take \n     depositions and other testimony, (8) to procure the service \n     of individual consultants or organizations thereof, in \n     accordance with the provisions of section 202(i) of the \n     Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, and (9) with the \n     prior consent of the government department or agency \n     concerned and the Committee on Rules and Administration, to \n     use on a reimbursable basis the services of personnel of any \n     such department or agency.\n       (b) The chairman of the select committee or any member \n     thereof may administer oaths to witnesses.\n       (c) Subpoenas authorized by the select committee may be \n     issued over the signature of the chairman, the vice chairman \n     or any member of the select committee designated by the \n     chairman, and may be served by any person designated by the \n     chairman or any member signing the subpoenas.\n       Sec. 6. No employee of the select committee or any person \n     engaged by contract or otherwise to perform services for or \n     at the request of such committee shall be given access to any \n     classified information by such committee unless such employee \n     or person has (1) agreed to in writing and under oath to be \n     bound by the rules of the Senate (including the jurisdiction \n     of the Select Committee on Standards and Conduct and of such \n     committee as to the security of such information during and \n     after the period of his employment or contractual agreement \n     with such committee; and (2) received an appropriate security \n     clearance as determined by such committee in consultation \n     with the Director of Central Intelligence. The type of \n     security clearance to be required in the case of any such \n     employee or person shall, within the determination of such \n     committee in consultation with the Director of Central \n     Intelligence, be commensurate with the sensitivity of the \n     classified information to which such employee or person will \n     be given access by such committee.\n       Sec. 7. The select committee shall formulate and carry out \n     such rules and procedures as it deems necessary to prevent \n     the disclosure, without the consent of the person or persons \n     concerned, of information in the possession of such committee \n     which unduly infringes upon the privacy or which violates the \n     constitutional rights of such person or persons. Nothing \n     herein shall be construed to prevent such com mittee from \n     publicly disclosing any such information in any case in \n     which such committee determines the national interest in \n     the disclosure of such information clearly outweighs any \n     infringement on the privacy of any person or persons.\n       Sec. 8. (a) the select committee may, subject to the \n     provisions of this section, disclose publicly any information \n     in the possession of such committee after a determination by \n     such committee that the public interest would be served by \n     such disclosure. Whenever committee action is required to \n     disclose any information under this section, the committee \n     shall meet to vote on the matter within five days after any \n     member of the committee requests such a vote. No member of \n     the select committee shall disclose any information, the \n     disclosure of which requires a committee vote, prior to a \n     vote by the committee on the question of the disclosure of \n     such information or after such vote except in accordance with \n     this section.\n       (b)(1) In any case in which the select committee votes to \n     disclose publicly any information which has been classified \n     under established security procedures, which has been \n     submitted to it by the executive branch, and which the \n     executive branch requests be kept secret, such committee \n     shall notify the President of such vote.\n       (2) The select committee may disclose publicly such \n     information after the expiration of a five-day period \n     following the day on which notice of such vote is transmitted \n     to the President, unless, prior to the expiration of such \n     five-day period, the President, personally in writing, \n     notifies the committee that he objects to the disclosure of \n     such information, provides his reasons therefor, and \n     certifies that the threat to national interest of the United \n     States posed by such disclosure is of such gravity that it \n     outweighs any public interest in the disclosure.\n       (3) If the President, personally in writing, notifies the \n     select committee of his objections to the disclosure of such \n     information as provided in paragraph (2), such committee may, \n     by majority vote, refer the question of the disclosure of \n     such information to the Senate for consideration. The \n     committee shall not publicly disclose such information \n     without leave of the Senate.\n       (4) Whenever the select committee votes to refer the \n     question of disclosure of any information to the Senate under \n     paragraph (3), the chairman shall not later than the first \n     day on which the Senate is in session following the day on \n     which the vote occurs, report the matter to the Senate for \n     its consideration.\n       (5) One hour after the Senate convenes on the fourth day on \n     which the Senate is in session following the day on which any \n     such matter is reported to the Senate, or at such earlier \n     time as the majority leader and the minority leader of the \n     Senate jointly agree upon in accordance with paragraph 5 of \n     rule XVII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the Senate \n     shall go into closed session and the matter shall be the \n     pending business.

A native of Newberry, SC, he served for four years in the \nU.S. Marine Corps where he rose to the rank of sergeant and platoon \nleader. Then, in 1967, he became South Carolina's first African-\nAmerican highway patrolman. After a five-year stint as an instructor at \nthe South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy, he continued to climb the \nranks of the highway patrol, serving as Major for four years until \ntaking the marshal's post in 1994.\n  Recently, Marshal Brooks was honored here in Washington for his \nlifelong commitment to fostering equal opportunities in the workplace \nas a recipient of the Equal Employment Opportunity Award. He is most \ndeserving of this and the many other accolades that he has received \nthroughout his distinguished career. I am confident that Israel Brooks \nis one of the finest law enforcement officers in the modern history of \nSouth Carolina and my staff and I will miss working with him.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/07/senate-section/article/S1970-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S1970]]\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:54 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 724.

A bill to ensure that nuclear energy continues to contribute \nto the supply of electricity in the United States; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I joined with Senator Murkowski last \nweek when he introduced the National Energy Strategy Act. His Bill \naddresses the broad range of issues that must underpin a credible \napproach to our nation's energy needs. It had key provisions for each \nmajor source of energy, including nuclear energy.\n  I rise today to introduce the Nuclear Energy Electricity Assurance \nAct of 2001, which expands and builds on the National Energy Strategy \nin the specific area of nuclear energy. It provides a comprehensive \nframework for insuring that nuclear energy remains a strong option to \nmeet our future needs. It accomplishes for nuclear energy what Senator \nByrd's National Electricity and Environmental Technology Act does for \nclean coal technologies, which I also support.\n  There is no single ``silver bullet'' that will address our nation's \nthirst for clean, reliable, reasonably priced, energy sources. That's \nwhy the National Energy Strategy Act carefully reinforced the \nimportance of many energy options. Energy is far too important to our \neconomic and military strength to rely on any small subset of the \navailable options.\n  Both nuclear energy and coal are now major producers of our \nelectricity. In fact, between them they provide over 70 percent. In \nboth cases, their continued use presents significant risks They \nillustrate a fundamental point, that absolutely every source of energy \npresents both benefits and risks. It's our responsibility to ensure \nthat citizens are presented with accurate information on benefits and \nrisks, information that is free from any political biases. And where \nrisk areas are noted, it's our responsibility to devise programs that \nmitigate or avoid the risks. Senator Byrd's bill does this for coal \ntechnology, my bill does this for nuclear energy.\n  Nuclear energy now provides about 22 percent of our electricity from \n103 nuclear reactors. The operating costs of nuclear energy are among \nthe lowest of any source. The Utility Data Institute recently reported \nproduction costs for nuclear at 1.83 cents per kw-hr, with coal at 2.08 \ncents per kw-hr.\n  Through careful optimization of operating efficiencies, the output of \nnuclear plants has risen dramatically since the 1980's; nuclear plants \noperated with an amazing 87 percent capacity factor in 2000. Since \n1990, with no new nuclear plants, the output of our plants has still \nincreased by over 20 percent. That's equivalent to gaining the output \nof about 20 new nuclear plants without building any.\n  Safety has been a vital focus, as evidenced by a constant decrease in \nthe number of emergency shutdowns, or ``scrams,'' in our domestic \nplants. In 1985, there were 2.4 scrams per reactor, last year there \nwere just 0.03. While some use the Three Mile Island accident to \nhighlight their concerns the fact remains that our safety systems \nworked at Three Mile Island and no members of the public were harmed.\n  Another example of the exemplary safety of nuclear reactors, when \nproperly designed and managed, lies with our nuclear navy. They now \noperate about 90 nuclear powered ships, and over the years, they've \noperated about 250 reactors in all. In that time, they've accumulated \n5,400 reactor-years of operation, over twice the number of reactor-\nyears in our civilian sector. In all that time, they have never had a \nsignificant incident with their reactors. They are welcomed into over \n150 major foreign ports in over 50 countries.\n  Interest in our nuclear plants is increasing along with dramatically \nincreased confidence in their ability to contribute to our energy \nneeds. Interest in re-licensing plants, to extend their lifetime beyond \nthe originally planned 40 years, has greatly expanded. The NRC has now \napproved re-licensing for 5 reactors, and over 30 other reactors have \nbegun the renewal process. Industry experts now expect virtually all \noperating plants to apply for license extension.\n  Nuclear energy is essentially emission free. We avoided the emission \nof 167 million tons of carbon last year or more than 2 billion tons \nsince the 1970's. In 1999, nuclear power plants provided about half of \nthe total carbon reductions achieved by U.S. industry under the federal \nvoluntary reporting program. The inescapable fact is that nuclear \nenergy is making an immense contribution to the environmental health of \nour nation.\n  But unfortunately, when it comes to nuclear energy, we're living on \nour past global leadership. Most of the technologies that drive the \nworld's nuclear energy systems originated here. Much of our early \nleadership derived from our requirements for a nuclear navy; that work \nenabled many of the civilian aspects of nuclear power.\n  Our reactor designs are found around the world. The reprocessing \ntechnology used in some countries originated here. The fuel designs in \nuse around the world largely were developed here. This nation provided \nthe global leadership to start the age of nuclear energy.\n  Now, our leadership is seriously at risk. No nuclear plant has been \nordered in the United States in over 20 years. To some extent, this was \ndriven by decreases in energy demand following the early oil price \nshocks and from public fears about Three Mile Island and Chernobyl. But \nwe also have allowed complex environmental reviews and regulatory \nstalemates to extend approval and construction times and to seriously \nundercut prospects for any additional plants.\n  As a nation, we cannot afford to lose the nuclear energy option until \nwe are ready to specify with confidence how we are going to replace 22 \npercent of our electricity with some other source offering comparable \nsafety, reliability, low cost, and environmental attributes. We risk \nour nation's future prosperity if we lose the nuclear option through \ninaction. Instead, we need concrete action to secure the nuclear option \nfor future generations. We must not subject the nation to the risk of \ninadequate energy supplies.\n  My bill is squarely aimed at avoiding this risk. I appreciate that my \nco-sponsors: Senators Lincoln, Murkowski, Landrieu, Craig, Graham, Kyl, \nCrapo, Thompson, Voinovich and Hagel share these concerns and support \nthis bill to address them.\n  There are five broad aspects of this bill. First, it initiates \nprograms to ensure that the operations of our current nuclear plants \nremain adequately supported. It authorizes expanded research and \neducational programs to ensure that we have a qualified workforce \nsupporting nuclear issues. It sets up incentives for companies to \nincrease the efficiency of existing plants. And it\n\n[[Page S1974]]\n\nassures that the industries supporting our domestic nuclear fuel \nsupplies remain viable.\n  Second, it encourages construction of new plants, especially \nGeneration IV plants. Technology to build these plants is close at \nhand. This bill not only supports research and development on these \nplants, it also supports development of the regulatory framework within \nthe NRC that must be in place before they can be licensed.\n  Generation IV plants would\n\n       be cost competitive with natural gas, have significantly \n     improved safety features with the goal of passive safety \n     systems that would be immune to human errors, have reduced \n     generation of spent fuel and nuclear waste, and have improved \n     resistance to any possible proliferation.\n\n  In the U.S., Exelon Corporation has invested in design of a plant in \nSouth Africa that has many of these attributes.\n  Third, this bill has provisions to secure a level playing field for \nevaluation of nuclear energy relative to other energy sources. It seeks \nto avoid any scientifically inaccurate stigmas that have been placed on \nnuclear energy.\n  Fourth, this bill seeks to create improved solutions for managing \nnuclear waste. Our current national policy simply requires that we find \na permanent repository for spent fuel. But spent fuel has immense \nresidual energy. Our present plan simply assumes that future \ngenerations will be so energy-rich that they would have no interest in \nthis major energy source.\n  I'm not at all sure that view serves our nation and those future \ngenerations very well. I've favored study of alternative strategies for \nspent fuel. As a minimum we should be doing research now to enable \nfuture generations to decide if spent fuel should still be treated as \nwaste, or if it should be treated as a precious energy resource.\n  Advanced technologies for recycling spent fuel and regaining some of \nits energy value would also allow us to consider approaches to render \nthe final waste form far less toxic then spent fuel. These approaches \nrequire transmutation of the long-lived radioactive species into either \nshort-lived or stable species. This bill includes funding for a \nresearch project, based on modern accelerators, to study the economics \nand engineering aspects of transmutation. There is substantial interest \nin other countries in joining us in collaborative study of this option.\n  This accelerator project, almost as an added bonus, can also provide \na backup source of the tritium required to maintain our nuclear \nstockpile. The bill provides for this application. The accelerator \nprogram, called Advanced Accelerator Applications or AAA, would also \nproduce radioisotopes for medical purposes and would provide a great \ntest bed for study of many nuclear engineering questions.\n  Before leaving the part of the bill dealing with spent fuel, let me \nemphasize how very compact these wastes are already and how much more \ncompact they could be. For example, all the spent fuel rods from the \nlast 40 years of our nation's nuclear energy production would only fill \none football field to a depth of around 4 yards.\n  If we had encouraged reprocessing of spent fuel in this country, we \nwould have dramatically less high level waste. In France, they \nreprocess spent fuel, both to reuse some of the residual energy and to \nextract some of the more inert components. Through their efforts, a \ncontainer, smaller than two rolls of film, represents the final high \nlevel waste for a French family of four for twenty years.\n  And finally, the fifth and last part of this bill provides \nstreamlining for a number of Nuclear Regulatory Commission procedures \nand outdated statutory restrictions.\n  For example, in a global energy market it makes sense to allow \nforeign ownership of power and research reactors located in the United \nStates. At the same time, this amendment to the 1954 Atomic Energy Act \nretains U.S. security precautions in the original law.\n  Another amendment eliminates time-consuming and unnecessary antitrust \nreview requirements. This section of the bill would also simplify the \nhearing requirements in a proceeding involving an amendment to an \nexisting operating license or the transfer of an existing license. \nFurther, another provision gives the NRC the authority to establish \nrequirements to ensure that non-licensees fully comply with their \nobligations to fund nuclear plant decommissioning.\n  These and other changes to the 1954 Act will assist the NRC in its \npursuit of more effective and responsive regulation of our domestic \nnuclear plants. These changes to the Atomic Energy Act have the support \nof the leadership of the NRC Chairman.\n  Mr. President, this bill enables nuclear energy to continue to be \ntreated as a viable option for our nation's electricity needs. It would \nhelp ensure that future generations continue to enjoy clean, safe, \nreliable electricity and the many benefits that this energy source will \nprovide.\n  Mr. President, I am privileged to take a little bit of the Senate's \ntime to talk about something I think is very important. I have been \nworking on this for a long time, but it just wasn't opportune to bring \nit up and give serious consideration to this issue. With the energy \ncrisis in the United States, people are going to be able to understand \nthat we truly have a shortage in the capacity to produce electricity, \nwhich takes care of our homes, feeds our industry, and provides a \nsubstantial portion of America's economic prosperity and growth.\n  So today I am going to talk about a bill I am introducing, with \nbipartisan support, which essentially tries to bring back to a level \nplaying field for consideration nuclear energy and new nuclear \npowerplants.\n  This bill I am introducing is on my behalf and also for Senators \nLincoln, Graham, Thompson, Voinovich, Hagel, Murkowski, Landrieu, \nCraig, Kyl, and Crapo, I believe I will have another 10 to 12 \ncosponsors soon, all of whom see the importance of the United States of \nAmerica making sure we are taking care of all energy, looking out for \nand moving in the direction of every energy source we have that is safe \nand at the right level of risk, and that we proceed to develop those \nfor America's future.\n  One of those that can't be left out, in my opinion, is the entire \nfield of nuclear energy and what is needed to bring America back to a \nleading role in the world in terms of nuclear power and future \ngenerations of nuclear powerplants.\n  As a precursor to a few remarks, I want to indicate to the Senate, \nand those interested, that every American ought to be concerned about \nthe fact that America doesn't have enough energy being produced to keep \nourselves going at our current rate, much less at the natural growth \nrate that everybody expects.\n  My first little exhibit here is a very interesting evaluation and \nanalysis of America's current sources of electricity at the end of \n1999. (We don't have a more current one, but it hasn't changed much.) \nEverybody should know that in the United States coal-burning \npowerplants produce 51.4 percent of our electricity. Somehow or \nanother, even though coal provides 51 percent, we aren't building very \nmany coal powerplants because we have not moved fast enough with new \ntechnology, and there are many who don't want to build any more coal-\nburning plants, even if we can get their pollution down to a safe and \nnonrisky rate.\n  Then if we look at the next big source of electricity, it is nuclear \nenergy, 19.8 percent. Might I say that while this power crisis has come \nabout, the nuclear powerplants in the United States have been producing \nat a higher rate. They have produced far more electricity without \nadding any new plants because the regulatory schemes have become \nreasonable instead of unreasonable and generating capacity has risen. \nCapacity used to be 70 percent; it is now up to 90. Incidentally, if we \nhad time, we would show you that even during that period of time, the \nsafety record has become better rather than worse. We have a very \ninteresting chart that would show that.\n  Let's move on. Natural gas, which we are now rapidly building, \neverywhere I turn and look, people are building a new powerplant with \nnatural gas. A little bit of electricity comes from oil, 3.1 percent. \nAnd then hydroelectricity is 8.3 percent. Others sources are in yellow \non the chart--and I am telling it like it is. That yellow represents \n2.3 percent, solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, and others. Of that \nyellow, I believe solar and wind are about a half a percent of the 2.3 \npercent. So there are those who say we can solve our energy problem \nwith those items that are\n\n[[Page S1975]]\n\nin yellow here. I say, good luck. Let's proceed as rapidly as we can. \nBut I have a hunch that to increase those latter sources to a larger \nratio within our energy sources, we will have a long way to go.\n  We would have to produce these wind fields with windmills on them \nbeyond anything Americans expect. They expect this should not be the \ncase if we have another way.\n  Understand that hydroelectricity is a small amount, but it is pretty \nimportant. Even in the last administration, they were talking about \nknocking down some dams so we would have less of this. Actually, that \nis pretty risky for America's future.\n  For those who are wondering where we are in terms of cost, I want to \nshow them something. This is the electricity production costs. My good \nfriend occupying the Chair is from Oklahoma. He produces gas and oil in \nhis State. The best we could do is get information for the end of 1999. \nThe distinguished Senator and those in attendance know that the natural \ngas price has gone up substantially since 1999. I could not bring more \nrecent cost data because we do not have anything more current.\n  Since the only thing we want to use is natural gas, we have put an \nenormous demand on natural gas while those who supply it are struggling \nto keep pace. So the price of natural gas has gone up in a rather \nextraordinary manner. I think everybody in this Senate would agree with \nthat. That is because the market is taking hold of a very small portion \nthat is free to be traded and those who own it are saying: What will \nyou pay for it?\n  That is going up, but even in 1999, here is what it cost Americans. \nThe green line is nuclear power. We see that it is the lowest. In 1999, \nit is beginning to get even lower than coal-burning powerplants. This \nnext line is oil. One can see it is below natural gas. These are the \nnumbers: Nuclear, 1.83; coal, 2.07; oil, 3.18; and gas, 3.52 cents per \nkilowatt-hour.\n  Of course, just because energy is more expensive, it does not mean we \nshould not use it, but I believe the American people over the next 10 \nto 25 years ought to have a mix so there is a market balance and there \nis some competition for these various sources of energy. I believe that \nis why so many Senators have joined in this bill.\n  I want to quickly tell you what it does. It supports nuclear energy, \nand it does that in many ways. The Nuclear Energy Research Initiative, \ncalled NERI, which is being funded--we are going to authorize it to \nmake sure it continues.\n  Nuclear energy plant optimization is a few million dollars. This \nhelps certification of these plants for an extended licensure period.\n  Incidentally, that is happening. We are relicensing them. Those who \nare doing that are sure they are safe. I wish I had time. I would show \nyou relicensing versus closing them down, which some people would like. \nThis will add an enormous amount of energy over the next 20 to 30 \nyears. I have a chart showing that, but I will not use your time on \nthat.\n  We also have nuclear energy education support. America used to be not \nonly the leading producer of nuclear power, but we were the leader in \nall of the science and technology. We moved from the atom bomb to \npeaceful uses. The great scientists converted it and made nuclear \npowerplants. These plants are getting more and more modern in the \nworld, yet America is letting our technology and our science sit still. \nWe want to move that ahead in our universities where more people who \nwant to choose engineering and science are given an opportunity to get \ninto the nuclear field because it is important to America's future.\n  We encourage new plant construction. That will not come overnight, \nbut it is interesting that while the United States debates an issue of \nwhat we do with the waste that comes out of the nuclear powerplants--\nand I am sure the occupant of the chair and most Senators if they study \nit carefully will clearly come down on the side that this is not a \ndifficult problem--people who do not want nuclear power at all make it \na problem. But technically, scientifically, and safetywise, it is not a \nproblem. It is now a problem because the State of Nevada does not want \nit, so they are using every political means. That is their prerogative. \nBut somehow, somewhere, America will be moving in the direction of \ngetting that problem solved. We are working on a long-term solution.\n\n  Incidentally, in this bill we suggest and create waste solutions. We \ncreate an Office for Spent Nuclear Fuel in the Department. If you have \na Department of Energy for the greatest nation on Earth, you surely \nought to have within it, on its domestic side of achievements and \nactivities, an office for research on spent nuclear fuel. Which great \ncountry would not have that except us? But we went through 15 years \nwhen we threw almost everything nuclear out of the Department of \nEnergy, as if it were not an energy source, as if it would go away.\n  The spirit and energy of coming back and doing something significant \nis prompted because the world in the future wants to be free and wants \nto have production of wealth. People want to be part of a world in \nwhich the poor countries should get richer over the next 10, 20, 30 \nyears, not poorer, and America wants to be part of that. We all have to \nworry about energy supplies.\n  In South Africa, they are moving ahead with the next generation of a \nnuclear powerplant that is going to be completely different from the \npowerplants we have today. We are sending a few people there to help \nwith licensure and regulation, but America should be leading the way. \nWe should be there with the scientists, engineers, and American \ncompanies moving to the next generation.\n  There is a next generation. It is not cooled necessarily by water. \nThere are other ways to cool it. Incidentally, it will have passive \nsafety features so it cannot melt down. That is the one issue everybody \nputs up when they say do not touch nuclear power because they want to \nscare us to death--it might have a meltdown. But this new powerplant \ncannot do that, as a matter of fundamental design parameters.\n  In this bill, we are going to create waste solutions. We are looking \nat an advanced accelerator, called AAA. We are also looking at advanced \nfuel recycling. Ultimately we may have a whole new way to change the \nquality of high-level waste through a process called transmutation. The \nend product will mostly no longer be high-level waste; they will be \nable to dispose of the products from transmutation in a very easy way.\n  I was talking about waste. I was going to show the Senate a container \nwe received as a demonstration. This holds the waste from a family of \nfour in France for 20 years--a family of four, year round for 20 years. \nThat is the total waste they generate because they have 80 percent \nnuclear power. But here we are making nuclear waste the most enormous \nproblem in the world, and letting it stop our pursuit of the cleanest, \nmost environmentally friendly source of energy around. If we are \nlooking at balancing environmental needs with energy, nothing beats \nnuclear.\n  We also encourage new plant construction in this bill. That means \nevaluation of options to complete some unfinished powerplants and \nGeneration Four Reactors. These are the next generation. We are funding \nthem to try to catch up.\n\n  We are also going to assure a level playing field for nuclear power. \nBy that I mean it has not been entitled to some of the luxuries of \ncredits in terms of clean air and the like that other forms of energy \nhave. That is going to change.\n  Last, we are going to improve the NRC regulations.\n  I close by saying the United States has 103 nuclear powerplants \nproducing 20 percent of our energy.\n  Let me state how safe nuclear power is. First, we have about 90 ships \nat sea that have as part of their structure one or two nuclear \npowerplants. I want to make sure those who are interested know about \nthese ships sailing the seas with nuclear powerplants. I am talking \nabout nuclear powerplants that are just like the nuclear powerplants \nthat exist in America on this chart. They might be smaller, but they \nare the same and produce the same kind of power.\n  In 1954, we put the first one in the ocean. Today, we have them \nsailing everywhere with that reactor and nuclear fuel on board. Yet \nthey are permitted to dock all around the world except\n\n[[Page S1976]]\n\nNew Zealand. Does anybody believe they could dock all over the world if \nthey were unsafe? There would be an outcry to put them 80 miles out, \nbut they are right in the docks. They are welcome because they are \nabsolutely safe. There has never been a nuclear accident since 1954 in \nthe entire nuclear Navy history.\n  In the end, one of the issues will be what risks we take. Overall, we \ntake fewer risks by using nuclear power than by almost any other source \nbecause we produce dramatic environmental consequences on the plus side \nwith nuclear power.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 472\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the standard of living for citizens of the United \n     States is linked to the availability of reliable, low-cost, \n     energy supplies;\n       (2) personal use patterns, manufacturing processes, and \n     advanced cyber information all fuel increases in the demand \n     for electricity;\n       (3) demand-side management, while important, is not likely \n     to halt the increase in energy demand;\n       (4)(A) nuclear power is the largest producer of essentially \n     emission-free electricity;\n       (B) nuclear energy is one of the few energy sources that \n     controls all pollutants;\n       (C) nuclear plants are demonstrating excellent reliability \n     as the plants produce power at low cost with a superb safety \n     record; and\n       (D) the generation costs of nuclear power are not subject \n     to price fluctuations of fossil fuels because nuclear fuels \n     can be mined domestically or purchased from reliable trading \n     partners;\n       (5) requirements for new highly reliable baseload \n     generation capacity coupled with increasing environmental \n     concerns and limited long-term availability of fossil fuels \n     require that the United States preserve the nuclear energy \n     option into the future;\n       (6) to ensure the reliability of electricity supply and \n     delivery, the United States needs programs to encourage the \n     extended or more efficient operation of currently existing \n     nuclear plants and the construction of new nuclear plants;\n       (7) a qualified workforce is a prerequisite to continued \n     safe operation of--\n       (A) nuclear plants;\n       (B) the nuclear navy;\n       (C) programs dealing with high-level or low-level waste \n     from civilian or defense facilities; and\n       (D) research and medical uses of nuclear technologies;\n       (8) uncertainty surrounding the costs associated with \n     regulatory approval for siting, constructing, and operating \n     nuclear plants confuses the economics for new plant \n     investments;\n       (9) to ensure the long-term reliability of supplies of \n     nuclear fuel, the United States must ensure that the domestic \n     uranium mining, conversion, and enrichment service industries \n     remain viable;\n       (10)(A) technology developed in the United States and \n     worldwide, broadly labeled as the Generation IV Reactor, is \n     demonstrating that new designs of nuclear reactors are \n     feasible;\n       (B) plants using the new designs would have improved \n     safety, minimized proliferation risks, reduced spent fuel, \n     and much lower costs; and\n       (C)(i) the nuclear facility infrastructure needed to \n     conduct nuclear energy research and development in the United \n     States has been allowed to erode over the past decade; and\n       (ii) that infrastructure must be restored to support \n     development of Generation IV nuclear energy systems;\n       (11)(A) to ensure the long-term viability of nuclear power, \n     the public must be confident that final waste forms resulting \n     from spent fuel are controlled so as to have negligible \n     impact on the environment; and\n       (B) continued research on repositories, and on approaches \n     to mitigate the toxicity of materials entering any future \n     repository, would serve that public interest; and\n       (12)(A) the Nuclear Regulatory Commission must continue its \n     stewardship of the safety of our nuclear industry;\n       (B) at the same time, the Commission must streamline \n     processes wherever possible to provide timely responses to a \n     wide range of safety, upgrade, and licensing issues;\n       (C) the Commission should conduct research on new reactor \n     technologies to support future regulatory decisions; and\n       (D) a revision of certain Commission procedures would \n     assist in more timely processing of license applications and \n     other requests for regulatory action.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, today I join Senator Domenici in \nintroducing the Nuclear Energy Electricity Assurance Act of 2001. \nSimply put, this bill is designed to ensure that nuclear energy remains \na viable energy source well into the future of this country.\n  The Nuclear Energy Electricity Assurance Act of 2001 has many \nimportant provisions and I will talk specifically about a couple of \nthem today.\n  We should pursue innovative technologies to reduce the amount of \nnuclear waste that we will eventually have to store permanently in a \ngeologic repository. Technologies such as nuclear waste reprocessing \nwould allow us to recycle about 75 percent of the nuclear waste we have \ntoday. And there are technologies such as transmutation that would \nincrease the percentage of recycled waste even further. This bill \nestablishes a new national strategy for nuclear waste by creating the \nOffice of Spent Nuclear Fuel Research and beginning the Advanced Fuel \nRecycling Technology Development Program within the Department of \nEnergy to study and focus on achievable nuclear fuel reprocessing \ninitiatives. A strong nuclear fuel reprocessing program is necessary to \nensure we can make nuclear fuel a truly renewable fuel source. It \nsimply makes sense.\n  In my home State of Arkansas, we have one nuclear powerplant located \njust outside the small town of Dardanelle. This facility has provided \nsafe, clean, emission-free power to all Arkansans for many years, and I \naim to see that it remains for many more. This bill will help ensure \nthat this happens by providing incentive funding for utilities to \ninvest in increased efficiency and capacity of each nuclear powerplant.\n  This bill takes safe, legitimate steps toward bringing more nuclear \npower online, providing incentives to increase nuclear power \nefficiency, and strengthening the pursuit of needed reprocessing \ntechnologies. I look forward to the debate on this bill and providing \nthis Nation with a safe, economical, and environmentally safe energy \nsupply.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Senator \nDomenici on the introduction of his very fine bill regarding nuclear \nenergy in this country. He has been a strong advocate of strengthening \nand reassessing the US approach to nuclear technologies and this bill \ngoes a long\n\n[[Page S1983]]\n\nway toward attaining these goals. Senator Domenici has been an active \nparticipant in all aspects of nuclear production, nonproliferation and \nour nation's security and has been very helpful to me in my role as \nChairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. He has always \nbeen supportive of efforts to deal with our nation's nuclear waste and \nrecently co-sponsored my ``National Energy Security Act of 2001,'' a \nbipartisan approach to ensuring our nation's energy security.\n  Senator Domenici's bill is significant because it addresses both \nshort-term and long-term issues. Our bills share many provisions, \nincluding: renewal of the Price-Anderson Act, authorizations for \nNuclear Energy Research Initiative, NERI, Nuclear Energy Plant \nOptimization, NEPO, and Nuclear Energy Technology Programs, NETP, \nencouraging nuclear energy efficiencies, and creation of an office of \nspent nuclear fuel research.\n  Short-term goals of increasing efficiencies are especially important \nin a time when this country is running short of generation capacity. \nWhat is happening in California could happen elsewhere and we need to \nensure we get the most of existing generation. In 1999, U.S. nuclear \nreactors achieved close to 90 percent efficiency. Total efficiency \nincreases during the 1990's at existing plants was the equivalent of \nadding approximately twenty-three 1,000 megawatt power plants. And keep \nin mind, that is all clean, non-emitting generation. Despite what \nenvironmentalists want you to think, nuclear is clean. It is the \nlargest source of U.S. emission free generation, producing \napproximately 70 percent of our nation's clean-burning generation in \n1999.\n  In addition, Senator Domenici's bill encourages and funds long-term \nprogress in nuclear issues. If we are to have a viable nuclear industry \nin the future, we must have properly educated and trained \nprofessionals. To achieve that goal, Senator Domenici's bill encourages \neducation in the hard sciences by funding recommendations made by the \nNuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee to support nuclear \nengineering. Senator Domenici's bill also encourages developing waste \nsolutions, a problem that has bedeviled the industry since the first \nfuel rods were removed from a commercial plant. The federal government \nsaid it would take responsibility for this waste but has yet to do so. \nSenator Domenici's ``Office of Spent Nuclear Fuel Research'' would \ndevelop a national strategy for spent fuel, including the study of \nreprocessing and transmutation. The bill also includes authorization \nfor advanced accelerator applications and advanced fuel recycling \ntechnology development.\n  Unless this nation is able to address the nuclear waste issue, we are \nin danger of losing the nuclear option. And in this time of increasing \ndemand for clean, stable, reliable sources of energy, we just can't \nafford to lose nuclear energy. Nuclear energy is on the upswing. Four \nor five years ago, who would have thought we would hear talk of buying \nand selling plants and even building new plants. But it is happening! \nIn this deregulated environment, nuclear plants are becoming hot \ncommodities, if you will pardon the pun.\n  And US industry is actually putting its money where its mouth is. By \nthe end of 2001, Chicago-based Exelon Corporation will have invested \n$15 million in a South African venture to build a pebble bed modular \nreactor. Designed to be simpler, safer, and cheaper than current light-\nwater reactors, these pebble bed reactors have captured the attention \nof several companies and the NRC and Senator Domenici's bill will help \nto smooth the path for new reactor technologies.\n  If we ever hope to achieve energy security and energy independence in \nthis country, we cannot abandon the nuclear option. It is an important \nand integral part of our energy mix. Our economy depends on nuclear \nenergy. Our national security depends on nuclear energy. Our \nenvironment depends on nuclear energy. Our future depends on nuclear \nenergy.\n  If we do not create reasonable energy diversity with an increased \nreliance on nuclear generation, we endanger ourselves, our future, and \nour children's future.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I rise as an original co-sponsor \nof the Nuclear Energy Electricity Supply Assurance Act of 2001. I \ncommend the senior Senator from New Mexico for his passion and \npersistence on this issue.\n  The U.S. is currently experiencing unusually high and volatile energy \nprices. Residents of my state of Louisiana as well as citizens across \nthe country are facing abnormally high gas prices this winter and \ncannot pay their bills. While there are some steps we can take in the \nshort run to help, the situation is complex in nature and any attempt \nat an overall solution will require a number of different remedies over \nthe long run focusing on both the supply and demand side of the \nequation.\n  The need to increase our domestic supply of energy is apparent. One \nof the great strengths of the electric supply system in this country is \nthe contribution that comes from a variety of fuels such as coal, \nnuclear, natural gas, hydropower, oil and renewable energy. The \ndiversity of available fuels we have at our disposal should enable us \nto balance cost, availability and environmental impacts to the best \nadvantage. Unfortunately, we have not made adequate use of this supply.\n  While most of the attention this winter has focused on the role of \nnatural gas, coal and nuclear energy actually both make a larger \ncontribution to the electricity supply system of the United States, \nrepresenting approximately 55 and 20 percent respectively of our \nnation's electricity supply. Each of the above mentioned sources of \nelectricity has unique advantages and disadvantages. While it would not \nbe wise to rely too heavily on any single fuel for its electricity, we \nmust not allow our misconceptions to dissuade us from ignoring others \naltogether.\n  One source of energy which I believe we are not making proper use of \nis nuclear power. There are currently 103 nuclear power plants in this \ncountry but no new plants have been ordered since 1978. Two of these \nplants are located in my state of Louisiana where nuclear power \ngenerates 15 percent of the electricity. We have witnessed firsthand \nthe numerous benefits of nuclear energy.\n  First, nuclear energy is efficient and cost effective due to low \noperating costs and high plant performance. Also, nuclear energy is \nreliable in that it is not subject to unreliable weather or climate \nconditions, unpredictable cost fluctuations or dependence on foreign \nsuppliers. Thirdly, contrary to popular perception, nuclear energy has \nperhaps the lowest impact on the environment including air, land, water \nand wildlife of any energy source because it emits no harmful gases \ninto the environment, isolates its waste from the environment and \nrequires less area to produce the same amount of electricity as other \nsources. Finally, although many people associate the issue of nuclear \npower with the accident at Three Mile Island in 1979, its safety record \nhas been excellent, particularly in comparison with other major \ncommercial energy technologies.\n  The bill being introduced today will help provide nuclear power with \nits proper place in the energy policy debate taking place in our \ncountry. Three of the more important provisions contained in this \nlegislation are: the encouragement of new plant construction through \nloan guarantees to complete unfinished plants; the assurance of a level \nplaying field for nuclear power by making it eligible for federal \n``environmentally preferable'' purchasing programs and research \nsupporting regulations for new reactor designs with proper focus on \nsafety and efficiency.\n  Over the next several months the members of the United States Senate \nwill engage in a critical debate over the future of our nation's energy \npolicy. I look forward to participating in this discussion and \nadvocating for the important role of nuclear power. While development \nof nuclear power alone will not take care of our energy needs, it \nshould be part of the answer.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am very pleased to stand with my friend \nand colleague, Senator Pete Domenici, as an original cosponsor of the \nNuclear Energy Electricity Supply Assurance Act of 2001. Following on \nthe heels of the introduction of the comprehensive energy bill last \nweek, this bill takes a closer look at nuclear energy specifically and \nlays out a concrete plan to secure the continued viability of nuclear \nenergy, our largest source of emissions, free electricity.\n\n[[Page S1984]]\n\n  Let me also note that I am very pleased that this is a bipartisan \neffort. I appreciate my colleagues from across the aisle who are \njoining with us in acknowledging that it is vital to take steps now in \nsupport nuclear energy and thereby, help to increase our energy \nindependence.\n  The Nuclear Energy Electricity Supply Assurance Act of 2001 is a \npackage of measures which help our current energy situation by \nsupporting nuclear energy research and development, by encouraging new \nplant construction, by assuring a level playing field for nuclear power \nby acknowledging nuclear's clean air benefits, and by improving the \nregulatory process. Although the bill does not explicitly address the \nnuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, the bill does create an \nOffice of Spent Nuclear Fuel Research at the Department of Energy and \nprovides for research into advanced nuclear fuel recycling technologies \nsuch as those being studied at Argonne National Laboratory in Idaho.\n  If my colleagues are wondering why it is important that we address \nthe energy issue, they need look no further than the headlines. \nHowever, I would like to bring my colleagues' attention to a study that \nwas recently released on the subject of energy. The Center for \nStrategic and International Studies here in Washington, DC, recently \nreleased its study entitled, ``The Geopolitics of Energy into the 21st \nCentury.'' Their findings are sobering and I want to take a moment to \nhighlight some of their conclusions. I do this to provide the global \ncontext for our energy picture and to explain why it is so critical \nthat this nuclear energy bill and the comprehensive energy package \nintroduced last week receive our full attention.\n  This study on the geopolitics of energy found that during the next 20 \nyears, energy demand is projected to expand more than 50 percent and \nthat electricity will continue to be the most rapidly growing sector of \nenergy demand. Energy supply, not simply reductions in demand, will \nneed to be expanded substantially to meet this demand growth and that \nthe choice of primary fuel used to supply power plants will have \nimportant effects on the environment. Interestingly, this growth in \ndemand will not be fueled primarily by the United States, as some might \nthink. Developing economies in Asia and in Central and South America \nwill show the greatest increase in consumption.\n  The study points out that although the world drew some portion of its \nenergy supplies from unstable countries and regions throughout much of \nthe twentieth century, by the year 2020, fully 50 percent of estimated \ntotal global oil demand will be met from countries that pose a high \nrisk of internal instability. Furthermore, the study concludes that a \ncrisis in one or more of the world's key energy-producing countries is \nhighly likely at some point between now and the year 2020.\n\n  Given these predictions, I am alarmed by our current dependence on \nimported energy. I think it represents a very serious vulnerability in \nour energy picture. This situation makes it critical that the Senate \nact on energy legislation, to put in place the long term steps that \nwill help us climb out of the energy deficit we find ourselves in. \nProblems, such as the current energy crisis, that have been years in \nthe making will not be remedied overnight, but we need to start taking \nsteps now to improve what we can.\n  Taking constructive steps to strengthen our energy picture is what \nthe Nuclear Energy Electricity Supply Assurance Act of 2001 is about. \nOne of the first steps to be taken, is to recognize the tremendous \ncontribution that nuclear energy already is making to our domestic \nenergy picture. I think my colleagues might be surprised to hear that \nthe U.S. nuclear industry is considered the strongest in the world. \nMeasured in terms of output, the U.S. nuclear program is as large as \nthe programs of France and Japan combined. Nuclear energy recently \nreplaced coal as having the lowest electricity production cost, \napproximately 1.83 cents.\n  The process for extending nuclear power plant licenses has been \nsuccessfully demonstrated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Two \nplants have been successfully relicensed and three more are in the \nprocess now. Additionally, the nuclear industry continues to improve \nthe efficiency of its currently operating nuclear plants. During the \npast 10 years, these gains in efficiency have added 23,000 megawatts to \nthe power grid. This is the equivalent of adding 23 additional 1,000 \nmegawatt power plants. This additional power has satisfied \napproximately 30 percent of the growth in U.S. electricity demand \nduring the 1990s.\n  What I have not mentioned in all this, is the important contribution \nnuclear energy makes in meeting clean air goals. If this nuclear \ngeneration were not in place, some other carbon-emitting source of \ngeneration would probably be taking its place. In fact, if you look at \nthe portfolio of emission-free power generation in the U.S., nuclear \nenergy comprises about 69 percent of our emission-free power, with \nhydroelectric power making up about 29 percent and the remaining less \nthan 2 percent is made up by geothermal, wind and solar.\n  The Nuclear Energy Electricity Supply Assurance Act of 2001 will \nauthorize the exploration of advanced nuclear reactor designs which \nmeet the goals of being economic, having enhanced safety features, \nwhile also reducing the production of spent fuel. The development of \n``Generation Four'' nuclear reactors is something I am really excited \nabout because much of the work done so far on Generation Four reactor \ndesign has been done at the Idaho National Engineering and \nEnvironmental Laboratory and at Argonne West National Laboratory in my \nhome state of Idaho. One of the reasons I am so optimistic about the \nability of this country to tackle these tough energy challenges is the \ngood work that I have seen coming out of our laboratories. When we \nunleash our best minds on these issues, really wonderful ideas come \nforth. That kind of creativity and initiative is what this bill is \nattempting to harness.\n  I am excited to be a part of this bill and I thank Senator Domenici \nfor partnering with me early on in the development of this bill and \nsoliciting my input. I think we have a good product. As we move \nforward, I am sure we will receive additional innovative ideas. That is \nthe challenge to all of us as we address our energy crisis--bringing \nthe best ideas to bear. This bill is a good start to that process.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO:\n  S. 473. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965 to improve training for teachers in the use of technology; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Training \nTeachers for Technology Act of 2001, a bill to allow states to provide \nassistance to local educational agencies to develop innovative \nprofessional development programs that train teachers to use technology \nin the classroom.\n  As your know, education technology can significantly improve student \nachievement. Congress has recognized this fact by continually voting to \ndramatically increase funding for education technology. In fact, in \njust the programs under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, \nESEA. Federal support has grown from $52.6 million in Fiscal Year 1995, \nto over $700 million just five years later. As we debate the upcoming \nreauthorization of ESEA, I will be working to support legislation that \nbuilds on the strong educational technology infrastructure already in \nplace in school districts in nearly every state.\n  But we need to do more than simply place computers in classrooms. We \nneed to provide our educators with the skills they need to incorporate \nevolving educational technology in the classroom. My bill does exactly \nthat. It will encourage states to develop and implement professional \ndevelopment programs that train teachers in the use of technology in \nthe classroom. Effective teaching strategies must incorporate \neducational technology if we are to ensure that all children have the \nskills they need to compete in a high-tech workplace. An investment in \nprofessional development for our teachers is an investment in our \nchildren and our future.\n  Specifically, the legislation I am introducing today would allow \nlocal education agencies to apply once for all teacher training \ntechnology programs within the National Challenge Grants for Technology \nin Education, the Technology Literacy Challenge Fund, and\n\n[[Page S1985]]\n\nStar Schools. The U.S. General Accounting Office reported that there \nare more than thirty federal programs, administered by five different \nfederal agencies, which provide funding for education technology to K-\n12 schools. My measure would reduce the financial and paperwork burden \nto primarily small, poor, rural districts that don't have the resources \nto hire full time staff to handle grant writing for all of these \ndifferent programs. Instead, schools would be able to apply once for \nfederal technology assistance, and then combine their funds to develop \na comprehensive program that integrates technology directly into the \ncurriculum and provides professional development for teachers. My bill \nadopts the principles of simplicity and flexibility. This is what \nschools are asking for, so this is what we should give them.\n  My legislation helps those smaller schools that might ordinarily be \nunfairly disadvantaged through traditional grant programs. Idaho's \npublic schools are excelling rapidly in their understanding of how \ntechnology can enhance the teaching and learning environments in \nIdaho's classrooms. I would like to extend this same empowerment to \npublic schools throughout the nation. Investing in technology training \nfor teachers will make a significant difference in the lives of our \nchildren.\n  An opportunity has arisen where we, Members of the United States \nSenate, are able to help many students who face unique challenges and \nuncertain futures. I hope you agree that a strong technology component \nfor all students is necessary and essential in facilitating student \nachievement, and that through proper professional development our \nchildren will be provided an unparalleled opportunity for a better \neducation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and work for its \ninclusion in the reauthorization of the ESEA.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO:\n  S. 474. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965 to improve provisions relating to initial teaching experiences and \nalternative routes to certification; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Professional \nDevelopment Enhancement Act to strengthen and improve professional \ndevelopment opportunities for teachers.\n  Improving the quality of teaching in America's classrooms has been a \npriority of mine since the day my oldest child walked through the door \nof her public school. While I know that my five children were, and \nstill are, fortunate to have outstanding teachers, I am keenly aware \nthat others are not so fortunate. Nothing can replace qualified \nteachers with high standards and a desire to teach. Coupled with \nongoing professional development opportunities, our teachers are \nequipped to positively influence and inspire every child in their \nclassroom. Teachers are the backbone of education. They are our most \nimportant assets, therefore, we must continue to give them the support \nand appreciation they deserve.\n  As Congress takes up the reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, ESEA, the focus will shift to the recruitment \nand retention of good teachers. That is why my legislation is so \nessential. While using no new funds, the bill would strengthen existing \nlanguage by making recommendations on current mentoring programs. My \nproposal outlines the principal components of mentoring programs that \nwould improve the experience of new teachers, as well as provide \nincentives for alternative teacher certification and licensure \nprograms.\n  Mentoring is a concept that has been around for years, but only \nrecently have educators and administrators begun to talk about its real \nbenefits. We all know that good teachers are not created over night. It \nis only after years of dedication and discipline that teachers \nthemselves admit that they truly feel comfortable in their classrooms. \nUnfortunately, though, we see the highest level of turn-over among \nbeginning teachers, one-third of teachers leave the profession within 5 \nyears. Our goal must be to work with new teachers to assure they are \nconfident in their roles and to secure their participation in the \nteaching profession for years to come.\n  My legislation will ensure program quality and accountability by \nrequiring that teachers mentor their peers who teach the same subject, \nand activities are consistent with state standards. Under the \nsupervision and guidance of a senior colleague, teachers are more \nlikely to develop skills and achieve a higher level of proficiency. The \nconfidence and experience gained during this time will improve the \nquality of instruction, which in turn will improve overall student \nachievement.\n  Attracting and retaining quality teachers is a difficult task, \nespecially in rural impoverished areas. As a result, teacher shortage \nand high turnover are commonplace in rural communities in almost every \nstate in the nation. In addition to retention, recruitment must also be \nat the core of our efforts. My bill will provide incentives, and grant \nstates the flexibility to establish, expand, or improve alternative \nteacher certification and licensure programs.\n  I do not expect this legislation to solve all the problems \nconfronting our schools today. But, I do see it as a practical way to \nhelp make our schools stronger by providing teachers with the tools to \ngrow as professionals.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Professional Development \nEnhancement Act and work for its inclusion in the reauthorization of \nthe ESEA.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO.\n  S. 475. A bill to provide for rural education assistance, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rural \nEducation Initiative Act, which makes Federal grant programs more \nflexible in order to help school districts in rural communities. \nServing to compliment President George W. Bush's education proposal, \nschool districts participating in this initiative are expected to meet \nhigh accountability standards.\n  Targeting only those school districts in rural communities with fewer \nthan 600 students, this proposal reaches out to small, rural districts \nthat are often disadvantaged through our current formula-driven grant \nsystem. There is tremendous need in rural states like Idaho because \nmany of the traditional formula grants do not reach our small rural \nschools. And what money does reach these schools is in amounts \ninsufficient for affecting true curriculum initiatives. In other works, \nschools may not receive enough funding from any individual grant to \ncarry out meaningful activities.\n  My proposal addresses this problem by allowing districts to combine \nfunds from four independent programs to accomplish locally chosen \neducational goals. Under this plan, districts would be able to use \ntheir aggregate funds to support local or statewide education reform \nefforts intended to improve the achievement of elementary and secondary \nschool students. I am asking for an authorization of $125 million for \nsmall rural and poor rural schools, a small price that could produce \nlarge results.\n  Any school district participating in this initiative would have to \nmeet high accountability standards. It would have to show significant \nstatistical improvement in reading and math scores, based on state \nassessment standards. Schools that fail to show demonstrable progress \nwill not be eligible for continued funding. In other words, this plan \nrewards success, while injecting accountability and flexibility.\n  In reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, ESEA, \nCongress has an extraordinary opportunity to change the course of \neducation. We must embrace this opportunity by supporting creative and \ninnovative reform proposals, like the one that I have introduced here \ntoday. I am committed to working in the best interest of our children \nto develop an education system that is the best in the world. The Rural \nEducation Initiative moves us in the right direction and I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in supporting this measure. I urge the Senate \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee to incorporate this \nprovision into the upcoming ESEA bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n        Leahy, Ms. Mikulski, Mr.\n\n[[Page S1986]]\n\n        Reed, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Corzine):\n  S. 476. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965 to provide for a National Teacher Corps and principal recruitment, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I come to the Floor today to raise an \nissue that appears to be a foreshadowing national crisis. Every year we \nare losing more teachers than we can hire and many of our children are \nleft in classrooms without full-time permanent teachers to lead them in \nthe way that they need and deserve to learn.\n  The teacher shortage in the United States is projected to reach a \nstaggering 2.2 million teachers in the next ten years. And, these \nshortages have already begun for communities across my state as well as \nthroughout the country. In New York, a third of upstate teachers and \nhalf of New York City teachers could retire within the next five years \nthat's approximately 100,000 teachers across the State. In order to \ndeal with these shortages, far too many of our schools are forced to \nhire emergency certified teachers or long-term substitutes to get \nthrough the year. I remember one story about a little girl in Far \nRockaway, Queens who in March of last year had already had nine \nteachers so many she couldn't remember all of their names. Her mother \nwas worried sick that her child was not getting the instruction she \nneeded, but her mother felt powerless to do anything about the \nsituation. And, at one school in Albany, the principal has to regularly \nfill-in for absent teachers because there are no substitutes available.\n  The teacher shortage in New York State is only expected to get more \ndire in the next few years as more teachers retire. Now, in New York \nCity, we know that many teachers decide to leave the City for better \nworking conditions and higher salaries in the surrounding areas.\n  Last week, we learned from the United Federation of Teachers in New \nYork City that 7,000 teachers are expected to retire this year alone \nfrom the city's public schools. In Buffalo, 231 teachers retired last \nyear, compared with an average of 92 in each of the preceding eight \nyears. In addition, Buffalo lost 50 young teachers who moved on to \nother jobs or other school districts.\n  Not only are we losing teachers, but principals are becoming more \nscarce as well. Many of our schools in New York City opened their doors \nthis year without principals. In fact, New York City is expected to \nlose 50 percent of their principals in the next five years. That is \njust an unacceptable rate of attrition. We simply cannot afford to lose \npeople who provide instructional leadership and direction to help \nteachers do their best every day.\n  Mr. President, that's why I have chosen to focus on this issue so \nearly in my term. And that is why I am proud to introduce the National \nTeacher and Principal Recruitment Act. My legislation will create a \nNational Teacher Corps that can bring up to 75,000 talented teachers a \nyear into the schools that need them the most. The National Teacher \nCorps can make the teaching profession more attractive to talented \npeople in our society in several ways. One is by providing bonuses for \nmid-career professionals interested in becoming teachers. In this fast-\npaced world, more and more people are changing career paths several \ntimes during their working lives. A financial bonus plan can help \nattract people from other professions.\n  The National Teacher Corps will also make more scholarships available \nfor college and graduate students, and create new career ladders for \nteacher aides--to become fully certified teachers. And it will ensure \nthat new teachers get the support and professional development they \nneed both to become--and remain--effective teachers.\n  This bill will also create a national teacher recruitment campaign to \nprovide good information to prospective teachers about resources and \nroutes to teaching through a National Teacher Recruitment \nClearinghouse.\n  And, finally, the bill will create a National Principal Corps to help \nbring more highly qualified individuals into our neediest schools. Like \nthe Teacher Corps, the Principal Corps will be focused on attracting \ngood candidates and providing them with the mentorship and professional \ndevelopment they need to succeed.\n  I am introducing this bill to make sure that all teachers who step \ninto classrooms and all principals who step into leadership in their \nschools have the expertise, the knowledge, and the support they need to \nmeet the highest possible standards for all of our children, who \ndeserve nothing less.\n  Now, if a community were running short of water, a state of emergency \nwould be declared and the National Guard would ship in supplies \novernight. If a community runs short of blood supplies, the Red Cross \nstages emergency blood drives to ensure that patients have what they \nneed. Our communities are running short of good teachers and \nprincipals, and they are as important to our children's future as any \nother role that I can imagine. That's what makes it so important for us \nto act now.\n  Providing good teachers and principals to schools is a local issue, \nbut it should be a national concern. And to have a partnership with our \ngovernors and our mayors, our school superintendents and others is a \nway that will really help us begin to address this crisis. I hope that \nall of us on both sides of the aisle and in the public and private \nsector will join together to make sure we have the supply of teachers \nthat we need. It certainly is the most important public activity any of \nus can engage in, and it's important to our nation's values as well as \nour individual aspirations for our children. And I hope that we will \nfind support for doing something to work with our states and localities \nto meet this crisis.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBERTS (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 478. A bill to establish and expand programs relating to \nengineering, science, technology and mathematics education, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, today, even as I speak, the members of \nthe Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee are in the process \nof marking up the BEST bill. The BEST bill is an acronym describing an \neffort to try to put together the reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act.\n  I think without question, in poll after poll taken in America, trying \nto determine what the American citizenry is concerned about, every one \nof the polls show the No. 1 issue of concern on the minds of American \ncitizens today is education.\n  Today I am very proud to announce I am joined by my colleagues, \nSenator Bingaman and Senator Kennedy, and there will be other \ncosponsors as well, but they are the original cosponsors in introducing \nlegislation I think without question addresses a very critical need \nwithin the American educational system, and also in regard to our \nnational security, as well; that is, the need to improve math and \nscience education.\n  As a member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, \nI want to work with Members on both sides of the aisle. That is what we \nare attempting to do in the markup this morning: to address the \nimmediate need to improve and enhance the \nK-through-12 math and science educational level in the United States.\n  Simply put, the American educational system is not producing enough \nstudents with specialized skills in engineering, science, technology, \nand math to fill many of the jobs currently available that we need and \nthat are vital to the United States. Other countries are simply \noutpacing us in the number of students in education in EMST, \nengineering, math, science, and technology study. As a result of this \nshortage of skilled workers, Congress had to increase the number of H-\n1B visas by almost 300,000 from fiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2002.\n  Now, the United States will need to produce four times as many \nscientists and engineers than we currently produce in order to meet our \nfuture demand. The technology community alone will add 20 million jobs \nin the next decade that require technical expertise. The U.S. has been \na leader in technology for decades and the new economy has created and \nwill continue to create an ample number of jobs that require this kind \nof skilled workforce.\n\n[[Page S1987]]\n\n  While increasing the number of visas will assist our American \neconomies with their current labor shortage in specialty and technical \nareas, we need to focus on long-term solutions through the education of \nour children.\n  Improving our students' knowledge of math and science and technology \nis not only a concern of American companies to remain competitive but \nshould also be a concern of our U.S. national security. The \ndistinguished acting Presiding Officer, the Senator from Oklahoma, has \nthe privilege, along with me, to serve on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. He is the chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee. I am in \ncharge of a subcommittee called Emerging Threats and Capabilities.\n  Guess what is now a real threat, not an emerging threat. According to \nthe latest reports on national security, the lack of engineering, \nscience, technology, and math education, beginning at the K-through-12 \nlevel, imposes a great security threat. We don't have the people to do \nthe job to protect our country in regard to cyber threats and the many \nother threats that certainly threaten our national security.\n  The report issued by the U.S. Commission on National Security for the \n21st century reports:\n\n       The base of American national security is the strength of \n     the American economy.\n\n  And our education system.\n\n       Therefore, the health of the U.S. economy depends not only \n     on citizens that can produce and direct innovation, but also \n     on a populace that can effectively assimilate the new tools \n     and the technologies. This is critical not just for the U.S. \n     economy in general but specifically for the defense industry, \n     which simultaneously develops and defends against the same \n     technologies.\n\n  This is not only true in regard to that commission report, what we \ncall the Hart-Rudman report, but it is true in regard to the reports by \nthe Bremer commission, by the Gilmore commission, and the CSIS study. \nCommission report after commission report says we are lacking in regard \nto this kind of expertise and this kind of skill.\n  The EMST bill builds on several goals outlined in the National \nCommission on Mathematics and Science and Teaching of the 21st century. \nThat is the rather famous and well-read report now called the Glenn \nreport. These goals include:\n  First, establishing an ongoing system to improve science and math \neducation in K-12. The legislation we have introduced would accomplish \nthis through afterschool and day-care opportunities for more hands-on \nlearning and programming that is focused on math and science. It also \nstrives to make all middle school graduates technology literate through \na technology training program.\n  Second, it does increase the number of math and science teachers and \nimprove their preparation. EMST accomplishes this by several means, \nincluding intensive summer development institutes, grants for teacher \ntechnology training software and instructional materials, master \nteacher programs that aid other teachers and bring expertise in math, \nscience, or technology. And finally, expansion of the Eisenhower \nNational Clearinghouse to allow access via the Internet to real \nprograms that effectively teach science and math.\n  Third, the bill makes teaching science and math more attractive for \nteachers. The EMST bill provides mentoring for teachers to encourage \nthem to stay in their profession, in addition to educating our high \nschool students about the course of study to enter the science, math, \nand the teaching field.\n  Mr. President, I encourage all my colleagues to support increasing \nour K-through-12 teachers' ability to teach math, science, and \ntechnology to our students and encourage these students to enter into \nEMST fields by supporting this legislation.\n  I don't think it is an exaggeration to say our future depends on it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Hatch, Mr. \n        Voinovich, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Hagel, Mr. \n        Helms, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Nickles, and Mr. Santorum):\n  S. 480. A bill to amend titles 10 and 18. United States Code, to \nprotect unborn victims of violence; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak, once again, on \nbehalf of unborn children who are the silent victims of violent crimes. \nToday, along with my distinguished colleagues, Senators Hutchinson, \nHatch, Voinovich, Brownback, Ensign, Enzi, Hagel, Helms, Inhofe, \nNickles, and Santorum, I am introducing a bill called the ``Unborn \nVictims of Violence Act of 2001,'' which would create a separate \noffense for criminals who injure or kill an unborn child.\n  Our bill, which is similar to legislation we sponsored in the 106th \nCongress, would establish new criminal penalties for anyone injuring or \nkilling a fetus while committing certain federal offenses. Therefore, \nthis bill would make any murder or injury of an unborn child during the \ncommission of certain existing federal crimes a separate crime under \nfederal law and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Twenty-four \nstates already have criminalized the killing or injuring of unborn \nvictims during a crime. The Unborn Victims of Violence Act simply \nacknowledges that violent acts against unborn babies are also criminal \nwhen the assailant is committing a federal crime.\n  We live in a violent world. And sadly, sometimes, perhaps more often \nthan we realize, even unborn babies are the targets, intended or \notherwise, of violent acts. I'll give you some disturbing examples.\n  In 1996, Airman Gregory Robbins and his family were stationed in my \nhome state of Ohio at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton. At \nthat time, Mrs. Robbins was more than eight months pregnant with a \ndaughter they named Jasmine. On September 12, 1996, in a fit of rage, \nAirman Robbins wrapped his fist in a T-shirt and savagely beat his wife \nby striking her repeatedly about the head and abdomen. Fortunately, \nMrs. Robbins survived the violent assault. Tragically, however, her \nuterus ruptured during the attack, expelling the baby into her \nabdominal cavity, causing Jasmine's death.\n  Air Force prosecutors sought to prosecute Airman Robbins for \nJasmine's death, but neither the Uniform Code of Military Justice nor \nthe federal code makes criminal such an act which results in the death \nor injury of an unborn child. The only available federal offense was \nfor the assault on the mother. This was a case in which the only \navailable federal penalty did not fit the crime. So prosecutors \nbootstrapped the Ohio fetal homicide law to convict Airman Robbins of \nJasmine's death. Fortunately, upon appeal, the court upheld the lower \ncourt's ruling.\n  If it hadn't been for the Ohio law that was already in place, there \nwould have been no opportunity to prosecute and punish Airman Robbins \nfor the assault against Baby Jasmine. That's why we need a Federal \nremedy to avoid having to bootstrap state laws to provide recourse when \na violent act occurs during the commission of a federal crime. A \nfederal remedy will ensure that crimes within federal jurisdiction \nagainst unborn victims are punished.\n  Let me give you another example. In August 1999, Shiwona Pace of \nLittle Rock, Arkansas, was days away from giving birth. She was \nthrilled about her pregnancy. Her boyfriend, Eric Bullock, however, did \nnot share her joy and enthusiasm. In fact, Eric wanted the baby to die. \nSo, he hired three thugs to beat his girlfriend so badly that she lost \nthe unborn baby. According to Shiwona, who testified at a Senate \nJudiciary hearing we held in Washington on February 23, 2000: ``I \nbegged and pleaded for the life of my unborn child, but they showed me \nno mercy. In fact, one of them told me, `Your baby is dying tonight.' I \nwas choked, hit in the face with a gun, slapped, punched and kicked \nrepeatedly in the stomach. One of them even put a gun in my mouth and \nthreatened to shoot.''\n  In this particular case, just a few short weeks before this vicious \nattack, Arkansas passed its ``Fetal Protection Act.'' Under the state \nlaw, Erik Bullock was convicted on February 9, 2001, of capital murder \nagainst Shiwona's unborn child and sentenced to life in prison without \nparole. He was also convicted of first degree battery for harm against \nShiwona.\n  In yet another example, this one in Columbus, 16-year-old Sean Steele \nwas found guilty of two counts of murder for the death of his \ngirlfriend Barbara ``Bobbie'' Watkins, age 15, and her 22-week-old \nunborn child. He was convicted under Ohio's unborn victims\n\n[[Page S1988]]\n\nlaw, which represented the first murder conviction in Franklin County, \nOhio, in which a victim was a fetus.\n  Look at one more example. In the Oklahoma City and World Trade Center \nbombings, Federal prosecutors were able to charge the defendants with \nthe murders of or injuries to the mothers, but not to their unborn \nbabies. Again, federal law currently fails to criminalize these violent \nacts. There are no federal provisions for the unborn victims of federal \ncrimes.\n  Our bill would make acts like this, acts of violence within federal \njurisdiction, Federal crimes. This is a very simple step, but one that \nwill have a dramatic effect.\n  The fact is that it's just plain wrong that our federal government \ndoes absolutely nothing to criminalize violent acts against unborn \nchildren. We cannot allow criminals to get away with murder. We must \nclose this loophole.\n  As a civilized society, we must take a stand against violent crimes \nagainst children, especially those waiting to be born. We must close \nthis loophole.\n  We purposely drafted this legislation very narrowly. Because of that, \nour bill would not permit the prosecution for any abortion to which a \nwoman consented. It would not permit the prosecution of a woman for any \naction, legal or illegal, in regard to her unborn child. Our \nlegislation would not permit the prosecution for harm caused to the \nmother or unborn child in the course of medical treatment. And finally, \nour bill would not allow for the imposition of the death penalty under \nthis Act.\n  It is time that we wrap the arms of justice around unborn children \nand protect them against criminal assailants. Everyone agrees that \nviolent assailants of unborn babies are criminals. When acts of \nviolence against unborn victims fall within federal jurisdiction, we \nmust have a penalty. We have an obligation to our unborn children who \ncannot speak for themselves. I think Shiwona Pace said it best when she \ntestified at our hearing, ``The loss of any potential life should never \nbe in vain.''\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to join in support of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself and Mr. Corzine):\n  S. 481. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor a 10-percent income tax rate bracket, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, with my colleague, I rise today to \nintroduce the Economic Insurance Tax Cut of 2001.\n  In his 1862 message to Congress, President Abraham Lincoln surveyed \nour fractured national horizon and concluded that:\n\n       The occasion is piled high with difficulty and we must rise \n     to the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew \n     and act anew.\n\n  The same could be said about our current circumstances. The United \nStates has not experienced a recession since the one that occurred in \n1990-1991. At that time, the old economic assumptions were shattered \nand new ones born. Over the past 5 years, it seemed as if nothing could \nstop the American economy from roaring on.\n  It was during this comparatively serene time that then-candidate \nGeorge W. Bush, in the debates leading up to the Iowa caucus in the \nwinter of 1999-2000, announced his plan to cut taxes by $1.6 trillion \nover the next 10 years.\n  The landscape has shifted dramatically since the winter of 1999 to \nthe spring of 2001. That shift in the landscape did not just occur in \nSeattle. Today's headlines are filled with ominous news. Economic \nactivity in the manufacturing sector declined in February for the \nseventh consecutive month. DaimlerChrysler has laid off 26,000 workers. \nWhirlpool has slashed the estimates of its earnings and plans 6,000 job \ncuts. Gateway is dismissing 3,000 workers, 12.5 percent of its \nworkforce. Over the past 2 months, layoffs totaling more than 275,000 \njobs have been announced.\n  This bad news has had, as would be expected, a negative effect on \nconsumers' confidence. Consumers' confidence has plunged 35 points from \nan all-time high of 142.5 in September of 1999.\n  When their confidence is shaken, consumers stop spending. When \nconsumers stop spending, the economy gets worse. When the economy gets \nworse, consumer confidence falls further. The cycle feeds on itself.\n  In an attempt to staunch the bleeding, the Federal Reserve has twice \nlowered interest rates in January. Monetary policy, the adjustment of \nshort-term interest rates, is a trusted and often effective tool in \nstimulating the economy. I am confident that the Federal Reserve will \ncontinue to exercise wise judgment.\n  But there is a growing consensus that more must be done, that fiscal \npolicy can also play an important role in boosting the economy, if not \nimmediately then certainly in the second half of this year. In his \ntestimony before the Senate Budget Committee in January, Chairman Alan \nGreenspan of the Federal Reserve Board stated:\n\n       Should the current economic weakness spread beyond what now \n     appears likely, having a tax cut in place may in fact do \n     noticeable good.\n\n  On February 13, Treasury Secretary O'Neill told the House Ways and \nMeans Committee that he, too, supports the use of fiscal policy as a \ntool to boost the economy. Mr. O'Neill said:\n\n       To the extent that getting it [the surplus] back to them \n     [the American people] sooner can help stave off a worsening \n     of the economic slowdown, we should move forward immediately.\n\n  Finally, during the President's speech to the Nation a week ago, he \nstated:\n\n       Tax relief is right and tax relief is urgent. The long \n     economic expansion that began almost 10 years ago is \n     faltering. Lower interest rates will eventually help, but \nwe cannot assure that they will do the job all by themselves.\n\n  Senator Corzine and I agree. We think there are several perspectives \nfrom which this issue must be viewed. The first is the contextual \nperspective: How large a tax cut can the American economy and the \nFederal fiscal system sustain? We share the belief that we are facing a \nserious demographic challenge in the next 10 to 15 years, as large \nnumbers of persons born immediately after World War II will retire and \nplace unique strains on our Nation's Social Security and Medicare \nsystem. That is but one example of the kinds of steps that we need to \nbe cognizant to take and prepare for which will utilize a portion of \nour current surplus.\n  After we have determined how large a tax cut is prudent in the \ncontext of these other responsibilities, the next step is crafting a \nplan that can, in fact, be helpful in averting a prolonged economic \nslowdown. According to economists, a tax cut aimed at stimulating the \neconomy should have four characteristics.\n  First, the tax relief should be simple enough to be enacted quickly. \nOne of the principal criticisms of the attempts to use fiscal policy to \nstimulate the economy on a short-term basis is that, historically, \nCongress and the President have been sufficiently slow in reaching \nagreement for enactment of such tax cuts that by the time the tax \nrelief is available, the problem has passed. The longer Congress \ndeliberates, the less likely tax relief will get to the American public \nin time to do some good. Therefore, a simple, straightforward approach \nis absolutely essential to getting a bill passed quickly.\n  The more components this tax relief includes, the more debate, \ndiscussion, deliberation, and the likelihood of procrastination.\n  The second characteristic is the tax relief must be significant \nenough to have a measurable effect on the economy. The economists we \nhave consulted suggest that tax relief in the amount of $60 billion to \n$65 billion would boost the gross domestic product by one-half to \nthree-quarters of a percentage point. At a time when the economy is at \nvirtually zero growth, that would be a welcome improvement.\n  Third, the tax relief must be conspicuous. The more transparent the \ntax cut, the more positive effect it will have on consumer confidence.\n  Finally, the tax relief must be directed at those who will spend it. \nTwo-thirds of the Nation's economic output is based on consumer \nspending. Recessions are largely a result of a letup in that consumer \ndemand. Common sense suggests that broad-based tax cuts, the bulk of \nwhich are directed at low- and middle-income American families, are \nmuch more likely to be the tax cuts that will stimulate consumption. \nAny\n\n[[Page S1989]]\n\ntax cut that claims to provide an economic stimulus must be measured \nagainst these four standards.\n  When scrutinized this way, both the President's proposal and the plan \nwhich was reported last week by the House Ways and Means Committee, and \nmay, in fact, be voted on by the full House as early as tomorrow, \ndisplay significant weaknesses.\n  One, context: At $1.6 trillion, the Bush plan would consume nearly 75 \npercent of the non-Social Security, non-Medicare surplus, when interest \ncosts are included. That leaves precious few resources for other \nimportant initiatives like desperately needed prescription drugs for \nour seniors, modernization of our armed forces, improving our schools.\n  No funds would be left to add to the debt reduction that can come \nthrough the application of the surpluses coming into Social Security \nand Medicaid. The Ways and Means proposal is a more expensive down-\npayment of the Bush plan in that its implementation is pushed forward \nby a year.\n  Two, simplicity: The President's tax cut plan contains several \ncomplicated proposals that will require Congress to carefully consider \ntheir ramifications. This deliberation is likely to delay enactment of \nthe President's plan until it is too late to stimulate the economy.\n  Three, sufficiency: The president's budget tallies the total tax \nrelief for 2001 at $183 million. For 2002, the total is $30 billion. \nTax relief at that low level will do little to boost the economy. The \nPresident's tax relief is so small because it is phased in over a five-\nyear period. Phasing in tax relief is exactly the opposite policy to \nadopt if your goal is economic stimulus. Even the Ways and Means \npackage, despite applying retroactively to 2001, falls far short of \ninjecting tax cuts into the economy during the second half of this \nyear. That plan provides only $10 billion of ``stimulus'' during this \nperiod.\n  Four, propensity to Spend: Economic stimulus occurs when consumers \nare encouraged to spend. Only one of the proposals in the President's \nplan meets this standard. Eighty percent of all taxpayers are affected \nby changes to the 15 percent tax bracket. Therefore, the President's \nidea for creating a new 10 percent bracket--which has the effect of \nlowering the 15 percent tax rate--will apply quite broadly across those \npaying income taxes. In contrast, three-quarters of all taxpayers are \nunaffected by changes to the remaining four tax brackets. Yet, nearly \n60 percent of the total cost of both the President's and the Ways and \nMeans' tax cut packages are devoted to these upper rate cuts.\n  Earlier this year, noted economist Robert Samuelson wrote in the \nWashington Post that the time had come for tax cuts whose purpose was \nto stimulate the economy. He too, criticized the President's tax plan \nas being poorly designed for this purpose. Specifically, he argued that \nthe President should make his tax cuts retroactive to the beginning of \nthis year and focus more toward the bottom income brackets.\n  Samuelson also argued that other proposals, whatever their merit--\nmarriage penalty relief, estate tax repeal, new incentives for \ncharitable giving--should wait their place in line; that the first \nplace in this line of America in the year 2001 should be economic \nstimulation to keep this economy from falling into a deep ditch.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the columns by Robert \nSamuelson be printed in the Record immediately after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, Senator Corzine and I have an alternative \nthat makes the improvements to the President's tax cut plan suggested \nby Mr. Samuelson, and makes it consistent with the characterization \nwhich I have outlined. Senator Corzine and I have an alternative that \nbuilds upon a proposal included in the President's tax cut plan.\n  President Bush has proposed the creation of a new 10-percent rate \nbracket. His proposal is that for incomes up to $6,000 for an \nindividual and $12,000 for a couple, that the first $6,000 or $12,000 \nwould be taxed at 10 percent rather than the current 15 percent. The \nproblem with his proposal is that he proposes to implement this change \nover 5 years. It is not until the year 2006 that this plan is fully in \nplace.\n  Senator Corzine and I propose to fully implement this 10-percent \nbracket retroactive to January of this year. In addition, we suggest \nthe bracket needs to be expanded so the incomes on which it would apply \nwould be $9,500 for an individual, and $19,000 for a married couple.\n  There are several reasons why we believe their proposal makes sense.\n  First, it provides tax relief to a broad range of taxpayers. Every \nAmerican income tax payer would participate in this plan. All couples \nwith income tax liabilities would save $950 annually, or have their tax \nliability eliminated entirely.\n  Second, our proposal provides significant tax relief to middle-income \nfamilies who are more likely to spend their additional money, and, \ntherefore, create demand within our economy.\n  Our plan would be more effective in stimulating our economy, \nparticularly at this time of concern about our economic future.\n\n  This proposal will lower taxes by $60 billion in both 2001 and 2002.\n  I point out this contrast with the President's plan with the lower \ntaxes in 2001 by less than $200 million, and the plan of the House Ways \nand Means Committee which will lower taxes in 2001 by approximately $10 \nbillion.\n  We believe this infusion of energy into the economy--$60 billion in \nthis and the next year--is the first portion of tax relief which will \nbe strong enough to be able to have a meaningful effect on the economy.\n  We would propose that a large portion of the first year's tax relief \nbe reflected in workers' paychecks during the second half of the year, \nprecisely the time that would be needed to forestall a prolonged \neconomic downturn.\n  The 10-year cost of this proposal is $693 billion. This is less than \nhalf of the President's total plan, and it could be reduced further if \nthe Congress were to decide it wished to sunset any portion of this tax \ncut before the end of the 10-year period.\n  Fourth, this proposal is simple. There is no reason this proposal \ncould not be enacted by July 4. The Treasury would be directed to \nadjust its withholding tables as quickly as possible. Families could \nexpect to see an increase in their paychecks by a reduction in the \namount withheld for income tax in time for their August vacations. \nInstead of staying home that week, they could take their children to \nthe beach or take themselves out to dinner. They could use the money to \nfix the car and head for the mountains, or fix up the backyard and \ncelebrate with a barbecue.\n  In doing so, they could begin to reverse the cycle--to put money back \ninto the economy, to feed expansion, to stimulate growth, to create \njobs, to increase Americans' confidence in their economic future.\n  This tax cut would truly be the gift that keeps on giving.\n  There is one additional benefit to proceeding in the manner that \nSenator Corzine and I are suggesting. Enacting this stimulative tax cut \nfirst and waiting until later to address other tax matters will give \nCongress time to evaluate the seriousness of the economic downturn and \nto evaluate how effective this economic insurance policy has been in \nputting a foundation under that downturn.\n  In particular, this time will give us a better idea of whether the \nslowing economy will adversely affect the surplus projections on which \nadditional tax cuts are predicated.\n  Again, I return to President Lincoln's suggestion during one of the \nmost trying times of his service as President of the United States.\n\n       This is not the time for timidity and hand-wringing. This \n     is the time for swift, bold action. The occasion is piled \n     high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Jan. 9, 2001]\n\n                           Time for a Tax Cut\n\n                        (By Robert J. Samuelson)\n\n       For some time, I have loudly and monotonously objected to \n     large federal tax cuts. The arguments against them seemed \n     overwhelming: The booming economy didn't need further \n     stimulating; the best use of rising budget surpluses was to \n     pay down the federal debt. But I regularly attached a large \n     asterisk to this opposition. A looming economic slowdown or \n     recession might justify a big tax cut. Well, the asterisk is \n     hereby activated.\n       By now, it's clear that most commentators missed the \n     economy's emerging weakness.\n\n[[Page S1990]]\n\n     Indeed, a recession may already have started. Industrial \n     production has declined slightly since September. Christmas \n     retail sales were miserable; at Wal-Mart, same-store sales \n     were up a meager 0.3 percent from a year earlier. The story \n     is the same for autos; sales declined 8 percent in December. \n     Montgomery Ward is going out of business. Last week's \n     surprise interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve confirms \n     the large miscalculation.\n       A tax cut is now common sense. It would make it easier for \n     consumers to handle their heavy debts and, to some extent, \n     bolster their purchasing power. The fact that President-elect \n     George W. Bush supports a major tax cut is fortuitous. But \n     his proposal is poorly designed to combat recession. Although \n     the estimated costs--$1.3 trillion from 2001 to 2010--are \n     large, they are ``back-loaded.'' That is, the biggest tax \n     cuts occur in the later years. In 2002, the tax cut would \n     amount to $21 billion, a trivial 0.2 percent of gross \n     domestic product (national income). This would barely affect \n     the economy.\n       What Bush needs to do is accelerate the immediate benefits \n     (to resist a slump) while limiting the long-term costs (to \n     protect against new deficits). This would improve a tax \n     plan's economic impact and political appeal. The required \n     surgery is easier than it sounds:\n       Bush's across-the-board tax-rate cuts should be compressed \n     into two years--making them retroactive to Jan. 1, 2001--\n     instead of being phased in from 2002 to 2006. The idea is to \n     increase people's disposable incomes, quickly. (Under the \n     campaign proposal, today's rates of 39.6, 36, 31 and 28 \n     percent would be reduced to 33 and 25 percent. The present 15 \n     percent rate would remain, but a new 10 percent rate would be \n     created on the first $6,000 of taxable income for singles and \n     $12,000 for couples.) Similarly, the proposed increase in the \n     child tax-credit, from $500 to $1,000, should occur over two \n     years, not four.\n       The distribution of the tax cut should be tilted more \n     toward the bottom and less toward the top. One criticism of \n     the original plan is that it's skewed toward the richest \n     taxpayers, who pay most of the taxes. (In 1998 the 1.6 \n     percent of tax returns with incomes above $200,000 paid 40 \n     percent of the income tax.) The criticism could--and should--\n     be blunted by reducing the top rate to only 35 percent, while \n     expanding tax cuts for the lower brackets. This would \n     concentrate tax relief among middle-class families, whose \n     debt burdens are highest.\n       Bush should defer most other proposals: the gradual phase-\n     out of the estate tax, new tax breaks for charitable \n     contributions and tax relief from the so-called marriage \n     penalty. Together, these items would cost an estimated $400 \n     billion from 2001 to 2010. They are the most politically \n     charged parts of the package and the least related to \n     stimulating the economy. Proposing them now would muddle what \n     ought to be Bush's central message: a middle-class tax cut to \n     help the economy.\n       The case for this tax cut rests on a critical assumption. \n     It is that the slowdown (or recession) could be long, deep or \n     both. If it's just a blip--as some economists think--the \n     economic argument for a tax cut disappears. The economy will \n     revive quickly, aided by the Fed's lower interest rates. Then \n     the debate over a tax cut should return to political \n     preferences. Do we want more spending, lower taxes or debt \n     reduction? My preference would remain debt reduction. But I \n     doubt that the economic outlook is so charmed.\n       Just as the boom--the longest in U.S. history--was \n     unprecedented, so may be its aftermath. The boom's great \n     propellant was a buying binge by consumers and businesses. \n     Both spent beyond their means. They went deep into debt. Put \n     another way, the private sector as a whole has been running \n     an ever-widening ``deficit,'' says Wynne Godley of the Jerome \n     Levy Economics Institute of Bard College. By his calculation, \n     the deficit began in 1997 and reached a record 8 percent of \n     disposable income in late 2000. Household debt hit 100 \n     percent of personal disposable income, up from 82 percent in \n     1990.\n       What may loom is a protracted readjustment. ``An increase \n     in private debt relative to income can go on for a long time, \n     but it cannot go on forever,'' writes Godley. People and \n     companies reduce their debt burdens by borrowing less and \n     using some of their income to repay existing loans. The \n     private-sector ``deficit'' would shrink. But this process of \n     retrenchment would hurt consumer spending and business \n     investment, which constitute about 85 percent of the economy.\n       It's self-defeating for government to exert a further drag \n     through growing budget surpluses. Of course, government could \n     spend more. But politically, that isn't likely--and spending \n     increases take time to filter into the economy. A tax cut \n     could be enacted quickly and enables people to keep more of \n     what they've earned. Roughly speaking, the Bush tax cuts \n     could raise disposable incomes of middle-income households \n     (those between $35,000 and $75,000) by $1,000 to $2,500. This \n     would make it easier for consumers to manage their debts and \n     maintain spending. It's also an illusion to think that lower \n     interest rates (through Fed cuts and government-debt \n     repayment) can instantly and single-handedly stimulate \n     recovery.\n       ``The danger of a severe and prolonged recession is being \n     seriously underestimated,'' writes Godley. If you believe \n     that--and I do--then a tax cut that made no sense six months \n     ago makes eminent sense now.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 14, 2001]\n\n                        Who Deserves a Tax Cut?\n\n                        (By Robert J. Samuelson)\n\n       The economic case for a tax cut seems compelling. The U.S. \n     economy is unwinding from an unstable boom. ``Animal \n     spirits''--the immortal phrase of economist John Maynard \n     Keynes--took hold. Consumers overborrowed or, dazzled by \n     rising stock prices, overspent. Businesses overinvested \n     thanks to strong profits and cheap capital. Both consumers \n     and businesses will now curb spending: consumers made \n     cautious by high debts, stagnant (or falling) stocks and \n     fewer new jobs; businesses deterred by surplus capacity and \n     scarcer capital. A tax cut would cushion the spending \n     slowdown.\n       Of course, we don't yet know the slump's seriousness. In \n     the final quarter of 2000, business investment dropped at an \n     annual rate of 1.5 percent; in the first quarter of 2000, it \n     rose at a rate of 21 percent. Consumer spending rose at a 2.9 \n     percent rate in the last quarter, but within that, spending \n     on ``durables'' (cars, appliances, computers) dropped 3.4 \n     percent, again at annual rates. These were both large \n     declines from earlier in the year. In the first quarter, the \n     gains had been 7.6 percent and 23.6 percent.\n       Consumer spending (68 percent of gross domestic product) \n     and business investment (14 percent) constitute four-fifths \n     of the economy. If they are in retreat, the economy is--\n     almost by definition--in trouble. (Housing, exports and \n     government represent the rest.) The case against a tax cut is \n     that the spending slowdown will be mild; it will be checked \n     by the Federal Reserve's cut in interest rates. Perhaps. But \n     I'm skeptical. If businesses have idle capacity and consumers \n     have excess debts, lower interest rates may not stimulate \n     much new borrowing.\n       Nor will large budget surpluses automatically preserve \n     prosperity. This argument is (to put it charitably) absurd. \n     The surpluses are the consequence--not the cause--of the \n     economic boom and stock market frenzy, which created a tidal \n     wave of new tax revenues. The big surpluses were a pleasant \n     dividend. But now they may depress the economy by removing \n     purchasing power.\n       This is easy to grasp. Suppose the budget surplus were a \n     huge sum: say, $1 trillion or about 10 percent of GDP. Would \n     anyone deny the drag on economic growth? Personal and \n     corporate income would be reduced by the amount of the \n     surplus. This drag could be offset only if the resulting drop \n     in interest rates and repayment of federal debt created an \n     equal stimulus. Though conceivable, this is hardly certain \n     and--in my view--unlikely. Today's surplus is only $200 \n     billion to $300 billion, or about 2 to 3 percent of GDP. But \n     the same reasoning applies. The surplus doesn't mechanically \n     create demand or spending and, quite probably, does the \n     opposite.\n       A year ago, a tax cut would have been folly. Private \n     spending was booming. But a tax cut now is not an effort to \n     ``fine tune'' the economy. It's the logical response to the \n     end of the private boom--an attempt to prevent a ``bust'' by \n     restoring some of people's incomes. Whose incomes? Who \n     deserves tax cuts? These (to me) are the harder questions.\n       President Bush's across-the-board rate cuts would give the \n     largest dollar tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans, because \n     they pay most taxes. In 2000, the richest 10 percent of \n     Americans--whose incomes begin at about $100,000--paid 66 \n     percent of the federal income tax and 50 percent of all \n     federal personal taxes (including payroll and excise taxes), \n     estimates the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.\n       Within this group, the wealthiest one percent--with incomes \n     above $300,000--paid 34 percent of income taxes and 19 \n     percent of all taxes. Over time, these shares have increased. \n     In 1977 the richest 10 percent paid 50 percent of income \n     taxes and 43 percent of all federal taxes. There are two \n     reasons for this trend: (a) the rich's incomes grew faster \n     than everyone else's; and (b) tax relief went more toward the \n     lower half of the income spectrum.\n       If you like income redistribution for its own sake, this is \n     wonderful. But the growing gap between those who pay for \n     government and those who receive its benefits creates a \n     dangerous temptation. It is to tax the few and distribute \n     to the many. Though politically expedient, expanded \n     government programs may have little to do with the broader \n     national interest. They may simply make more people and \n     institutions dependent on Washington and the political \n     process. Taxes must be fairly broad-based if the public is \n     to weigh the pleasure of new government programs against \n     the pain of higher taxes.\n       As originally proposed, Bush's plan was avowedly political. \n     It aimed to restrain government spending by depriving \n     government of some money to spend. But Bush is now selling \n     his program as an antidote to economic slump. Ironically, \n     this strengthens the case for skewing the tax cut toward \n     middle- and lower-income households. Almost certainly, their \n     debt burdens are higher than upscale America's. they may also \n     spend more of any tax cut than the rich, providing greater \n     support to the economy.\n       Finally, it's true that an excessive tax cut would invite \n     future deficits. How to balance these competing pressures is \n     what we will debate. My preference is to accelerate the \n     introduction of Bush's across-the-board rate cuts, with one \n     exception; I would cut the top rate of 39.6 percent to 35 \n     percent, instead of Bush's 33 percent, and use the savings to \n     broaden tax cuts at lower income levels.\n       I would also accelerate the increase in the child tax \n     credit--from $500 to $1,000--but\n\n[[Page S1991]]\n\n     defer Bush's other proposals (ending the estate tax, bigger \n     charitable deductions). This would raise the overall tax \n     cut's immediate economic impact and reduce the long-term \n     budget costs.\n       As we debate, we should not idealize budget surpluses. They \n     are simply paper projections, based on various assumptions, \n     including strong economic growth. If the growth doesn't \n     materialize, neither will the surpluses. A slavish effort to \n     preserve the surpluses could perversely destroy them.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 7, 2001]\n\n                        Tax Cuts: The True Issue\n\n                        (By Robert J. Samuelson)\n\n       The tax and budget debate is essentially a quarrel about \n     political philosophy. President Bush wants to limit the size \n     of government by depriving it of more money to spend. His \n     Democratic critics want government to keep as much in taxes \n     as possible, because they want to spend it. In fiscal 2000 \n     federal taxes represented a post-World War II record of 20.6 \n     percent of gross domestic product (national income). Over a \n     decade, Bush wants to nudge that below 19 percent of GDP, \n     while Democrats prefer to keep it above 20 percent. That's \n     the central issue between them--and they're trying to obscure \n     it.\n       We have diehard liberals preaching the virtues of reducing \n     the federal debt, not because they believe in smaller \n     government but because this makes them seem frugal, cautious \n     and even conservative. Meanwhile, President Bush flaunts his \n     proposed spending increases for education and Medicare, not \n     because he believes in bigger government but because they \n     make him seem humane, sensitive and even liberal. Both sides \n     are fleeing their traditional stereotypes: liberals as \n     extravagant spenders, conservatives as cruel cheapskates.\n       The result is calculated confusion. The antagonists \n     informally deemphasize their central dispute--the size of \n     government--and shift the debate to side issues (they hope) \n     will disarm their opponents. For example:\n     Does a faltering economy need a tax cut?\n       This is Bush's ace. Consumer confidence has dropped for \n     five straight months; in January existing-home sales fell 6.6 \n     percent. The more the economy weakens, the harder it is for \n     Democrats to resist tax cuts. There's a certain common-sense \n     appeal to bolstering people's purchasing power by reducing \n     their taxes. A year ago President Clinton proposed only $350 \n     billion in tax cuts over a decade. Now many Democrats talk in \n     the $700 billion to $1 trillion range--much closer to Bush's \n     $1.6 trillion.\n     Do Bush's budget numbers add up?\n       No, say critics. His budget skimps on paying down the \n     federal debt--all the Treasury bonds and bills issued to \n     cover past budget deficits. Worse, the tax cut might create \n     future deficits when combined with programs not in the \n     present budget: an anti-missile defense and private accounts \n     for Social Security, for instance. All this is possible, \n     especially if the surplus forecasts turn out (as they might) \n     to be too optimistic. Still, the critics' case is wildly \n     overstated.\n       Between 2002 and 2011, Bush projects budget surpluses of \n     $5.6 trillion. This is defensible; the Congressional Budget \n     Office made a similar estimate. The tax cut would reduce the \n     surplus by $1.6 trillion and require an extra $400 billion in \n     interest payments. This leaves a surplus of $3.6 trillion. Of \n     that, Bush would use $2 trillion for debt reduction. (From \n     2001 to 2011, the debt would drop from $3.2 trillion to $1.2 \n     trillion. Interest payments would decline to below 3 percent \n     of federal spending, down from 15 percent in 1997.)\n       Now we're at $1.6 trillion. Bush proposes almost $200 \n     billion in new spending--mainly for changes in Medicare, \n     including a drug benefit. Bush labels the remaining $1.4 \n     trillion in surplus a ``reserve'' against faulty estimates, \n     further debt reduction or more spending. All the possible \n     claims on the reserve (the missile defense, private accounts \n     for Social Security) could exhaust it. But if you're trying \n     to make Congress set spending priorities--as Bush is--his \n     approach isn't unreasonable.\n     If there's a tax cut, who should get it?\n       Politically, this is Bush's Achilles' heel. He says that \n     taxes belong to the people who earned them--not the \n     government. Okay. The political problem is that most federal \n     taxes are paid by a small constituency of the well-to-do and \n     wealthy. In 2001 the richest 10 percent of Americans--\n     those with incomes above $107,000--will pay 68 percent of \n     the income tax and 52 percent of all federal taxes, \n     estimates the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. \n     With its across-the-board rate reductions, Bush's plan \n     give them the largest dollar cuts. Citizens for Tax \n     Justice, a liberal advocacy group, estimates that the \n     richest one percent get 31 percent of the income-tax cuts \n     (slightly below their share of income taxes, 36 percent). \n     Democrats are aghast; they want smaller tax cuts to \n     concentrate benefits on households under $100,000.\n       To handicap the tax debate, watch these issues. If the \n     economy weakens further, pressure for tax relief will \n     intensify. But so will pressure to redirect the benefits down \n     the income ladder. My view--stated in earlier columns--is \n     that the economy needs a tax cut. I would accelerate Bush's \n     across-the-board rate cuts and the doubling of the child \n     credit (from $500 to $1,000). But I would cut today's top \n     rate of 39.6 percent only to 35 percent, not 33 percent, as \n     Bush proposes. All this would maximize the tax cut's \n     immediate effect on the economy.\n       Like Bush's critics, I think the long-term budget \n     projections are too uncertain to enact his full tax package \n     now; so I would defer action on his other proposals \n     (abolishing the estate tax, marriage-penalty relief, new \n     charitable deductions). But unlike his critics, I think Bush \n     is correct on the central issue of government's size. The \n     real choice now is not between cutting taxes and paying down \n     the debt. If immense surpluses emerge, Congress--Democrats \n     and Republicans--will spend them. Even last year's modest \n     surplus spurred Congress to a spending spree.\n       It's the wrong time for huge spending increases. The \n     retirement of the baby boom generation, beginning in a \n     decade, will expand government commitments. Retirement \n     benefits will inevitably increase, exerting pressure for \n     higher taxes. If we raise spending now, we will begin this \n     process from a higher base of spending and taxes--that will \n     ultimately have to be paid by today's children and young \n     adults. This would be a dubious legacy.\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my \ndistinguished colleague from Florida, Senator Graham, in introducing \nthe legislation to establish a new 10-percent tax bracket.\n  This bill would provide a simple, fair, and fiscally responsible tax \ncut that can be enacted quickly, and that can provide an important \ninsurance policy against the risk of an economic slowdown, a slowdown \nthat to most observers appears to be more real and potentially deeper \nthan perceived even as early as in January of this year.\n  To me, there is little question that our economy needs stimulus, \nfiscally as well as monetarily, to return to a moderate growth path. \nThe question for policymakers is how to make that happen.\n  Some, including Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, have questioned whether \nCongress is capable of enacting a tax cut quickly enough to prevent a \nrecession or even help lift us out of one on a timely basis. I think we \ncan. In any case, as many other economists, Chairman Greenspan has \nargued that tax cuts would be helpful once an economic downturn is upon \nus, if a tax cut were implemented expeditiously.\n  To make any tax cut effective as an economic insurance policy, \nCongress and the President need to reach agreement quickly. To \nfacilitate such an agreement, we are proposing that Congress defer \nconsideration of the long list of worthy, and maybe some less worthy, \ntax cut proposals currently under debate, and, for now, adopt a very \nstraightforward, simple approach.\n  President Bush has already proposed the creation of a new 10-percent \nrate bracket for income of up to $12,000 for couples who are currently \ntaxed at 15 percent. The corresponding level for single taxpayers, \nunder the President's proposal, would be $6,000. However, as originally \nproposed, the Bush rate cut would not be fully effective until 2006.\n\n  Senator Graham and I are proposing to immediately--and retroactively \nfor this year--create a 10-percent rate bracket and increase the \nthreshold of that bracket to $19,000 for married taxpayers and $9,500 \nfor individuals.\n  There are several reasons why this 10-percent compromise makes sense \nto us. First, it provides equitable relief to taxpayers at all \ndifferent income levels. All couples with income tax liabilities would \nsave $950 annually or have their tax liability eliminated entirely.\n  Second, middle-class families are more likely to spend a tax cut than \nthe wealthier families favored under some aspects of the President's \nplan. Our proposal would be more effective in boosting the economy now.\n  Third, our proposal would put roughly $60 billion of the annual non-\nSocial Security surplus into a retroactive tax cut. This is the amount \nthat economists tell us is needed to achieve a noticeable economic \nimpact this year. At this level, we would expect that tax cut to boost \nGDP by one-half to three-quarters of a percentage point.\n  Fourth, because of its simplicity, the proposal could be debated, \nenacted, and implemented very quickly. I think the latter is very \nimportant. In fact, if the President and the bipartisan congressional \nleadership were to come to an agreement, announce an agreement on this \npackage, business and consumer confidence in private spending could be \nbolstered almost immediately. Later, once the proposal is signed into \nlaw, withholding tables could be adjusted in a matter of weeks. That is \nwhere the simplicity comes in. By contrast, many of the President's and \nCongress's proposals are not only controversial and would draw lengthy \ndebate, but would take much longer to be able to be implemented into \nlaw.\n  Finally, while providing a real economic stimulus up front, the cost \nof our proposal is something that is doable within the current context \nof our budget. The cost of our proposal is roughly $700 billion. This \nwould not preclude further debt reduction, tax cuts, or spending \npriorities, such as improvements in education, as the President has \nsuggested, and prescription drug coverage, or increases in defense \nspending.\n  By contrast, the President's original proposal provides very limited \nstimulus up front--only $21 billion in 2001--yet threatens to starve \nthe Government of needed resources in later years, especially when our \nobligations to Social Security and Medicare begin to grow \nsubstantially.\n  Our 10-percent compromise asks both parties to temporarily give up \ntheir favorite tax cut proposals in the interests of a quick compromise \nwhich would benefit the country, which would apply the principle that a \nrising tide lifts all boats. We do not accept the common wisdom that \nWashington is incapable of acting quickly. There is a need. When it \nreally matters, we know we can keep things simple, and we can get \nthings done, and make them happen.\n  I congratulate Senator Graham. And I very much appreciate the \nopportunity to introduce this legislation. We look forward to working \nwith the Congress to try to get a quick and stimulative and simple \nproposal through the Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 483 A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to improve the \ndisclosure of information to airline passengers and the enforceability \nof airline passengers and the enforceability of airline passengers' \nrights under airline customer service agreements, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nprovide enforceable consumer protections for airline passengers. The \nbill I introduce today is the result of a process that started over two \nyears ago, when I first introduced bipartisan passenger rights\n\n[[Page S1993]]\n\nlegislation. Instead of enacting that legislation, Congress decided to \ngive the airlines a year-and-a-half to improve customer service through \nvoluntary plans. At the end of that time, the Department of \nTransportation Inspector General was to report to Congress on the \nairlines' progress.\n  The Inspector General released his report last month. It is a \ncarefully researched and balanced document, and it finds that, while \nthe airlines have made progress in some areas, there are also \nsignificant continued shortcomings. In particular, in many cases \npassengers are still not receiving reliable and timely communications \nabout flight delays, cancellations, and diversions. The report \nrecommends a number of specific, reasonable steps that could be taken \nto improve the experience of the flying public.\n  I want to commend the chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator \nMcCain, and Senators Hollings and Hutchison, for the bill they have \nintroduced, which reflects the essence of the Inspector General's \nreport. My bill is intended to complement and further the discussion \nthat legislation has begun.\n  My legislation closely tracks the findings and recommendations of the \nInspector General's report. First, it features ``right-to-know'' \nprovisions that require airlines to tell customers when a flight they \nare about to book a ticket on is chronically delayed or canceled, and \nto provide better information about overbooking, frequent flyer \nprograms, and lost baggage. The bill also contains provisions to \nenhance and improve the enforcement of the airlines' customer service \ncommitments, such as requirement that each airline incorporate its \ncommitments into its binding contract of carriage. Finally, the bill \ncalls on the Secretary of Transportation to review existing regulations \nto make sure airlines adhere to their commitments, and to encourage the \nestablishment of a baseline standard of service for all airlines.\n  The provisions of this bill are not radical, nor are they regulatory; \nthey are basic reasonable steps based directly on the specific findings \nand recommendations of the Inspector General. Most importantly, they \nwould create meaningful, enforceable protections for consumers in the \nareas where the Inspector General has identified ongoing problems.\n  I am hopeful that my colleagues here in the Senate will join me in \nsupporting this legislation, and I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 483\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Treatment of Airline \n     Passengers Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) United States airline traffic is increasing. The number \n     of domestic passengers carried by United States air carriers \n     has nearly tripled since 1978, to over 660 million annually. \n     The number is expected to grow to more than 1 billion by \n     2010. The number of domestic flights has been steadily \n     increasing as well.\n       (2) The Inspector General of the Department of \n     Transporation has found that with this growth in traffic have \n     come increases in delays, cancellations, and customer \n     dissatisfaction with air carrier service.\n       (A) The Federal Aviation Administration has reported that, \n     between 1995 and 2000, delays increased 90 percent and \n     cancellations increased 104 percent. In 2000, over 1 in 4 \n     flights were delayed, canceled, or diverted, affecting \n     approximately 163 million passengers.\n       (B) At the 30 largest United States airports, the number of \n     flights with taxi-out times of 1 hour or more increased 165 \n     percent between 1995 and 2000. The number of flights with \n     taxi-out times of 4 hours or more increased 341 percent \n     during the same period.\n       (C) Certain flights, particularly those scheduled during \n     peak periods at the nation's busiest airports, are subject to \n     chronic delays. In December, 2000, 626 regularly-scheduled \n     flights arrived late 70 percent of the time or more, as \n     reported by the Department of Transportation.\n       (D) Consumer complaints filed with the Department of \n     Transportation about airline travel have nearly quadrupled \n     since 1995. The Department of Transportation Inspector \n     General has estimated that air carriers receive between 100 \n     and 400 complaints for every complaint filed with the \n     Department of Transportation.\n       (3) At the same time as the number of complaints about \n     airline travel has increased, the resources devoted to \n     Department of Transportation handling of such complaints have \n     declined sharply. The Department of Transportation Inspector \n     General has reported that the staffing of the Department of \n     Transportation office responsible for handling airline \n     customer service complaints declined from 40 in 1985 to just \n     17 in 2000.\n       (4) In June, 1999, the Air Transport Association and its \n     member airlines agreed to an Airline Customer Service \n     Commitment designed to address mounting consumer \n     dissatisfaction and improve customer service in the industry.\n       (5) The Department of Transportation Inspector General has \n     reviewed the airlines' implementation of the Airline Customer \n     Service Commitment. The Inspector General found that:\n       (A) The Airline Customer Service Commitment has prompted \n     air carriers to address consumer concerns in many areas, \n     resulting in positive changes in how air travelers are \n     treated.\n       (B) Despite this progress, there continue to be significant \n     shortfalls in reliable and timely communication with \n     passengers about flight delays and cancellations. Reports to \n     passengers about flight status are frequently untimely, \n     incomplete, or unreliable.\n       (C) Air carriers need to do more, in the areas under their \n     control, to reduce over-scheduling, the number of \n     chronically-late or canceled flights, and the amount of \n     checked baggage that does not show up with the passenger upon \n     arrival.\n       (D) A number of further steps could be taken to improve the \n     effectiveness and enforceability of the Airline Customer \n     Service Commitment and to improve the consumer protections \n     available to commercial air passengers.\n\n     SEC. 3. FAIR TREATMENT OF AIRLINE PASSENGERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subchapter I of chapter 417 of title 49, \n     United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``Sec.  41722.

A bill to amend part B of title IV of the Social Security Act \nto create a grant program to promote joint activities among Federal, \nState, and local public child welfare and alcohol and drug abuse \nprevention and treatment agencies; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President I rise today to introduce the Child \nProtection/Alcohol and Drug Partnership Act,\n\n[[Page S1995]]\n\nand I am pleased to be joined by my good friends, Senators Rockefeller, \nDeWine, Dodd, collins, and Lincoln. Mr. President this bill is an \nenormously important piece of legislation. It provides the means for \nstates to support some of our most vulnerable families, families who \nare struggling with alcohol and drug abuse, and the children who are \nbeing raised in these homes.\n  It is obvious, both anecdotally and statistically, that child welfare \nis significantly impacted by parental substance abuse. And it makes a \nlot of sense to fund state programs to address these two issues in \ntandem. The real question in designing and supporting child welfare \nprograms is how can we, public policy makers, government officials, \nwelfare agencies, honestly expect to improve child welfare without \nappropriately and adequately addressing the root problems affecting \nthese children's lives?\n  We know that substance abuse is the primary ingredient in child abuse \nand neglect. Most studies find that between one-third and two-thirds, \nand some say as high as 80 percent to 90 percent, of children in the \nchild welfare system come from families where parental substance abuse \nis a contributing factor.\n  The Child Protection/Alcohol and Drug Partnership Act creates a new \nfive-year $1.9 billion state block grant program to address the \nconnection between substance abuse and child welfare. Payments would be \nmade to promote joint activities among federal, state, and local public \nchild welfare and alcohol and drug prevention and treatment agencies. \nOur underlying belief, and the point of this bill, is to encourage \nexisting agencies to work together to keep children safe.\n  HHS will award grants to States and Indian tribes to encourage \nprograms for families who are known to the child welfare system and \nhave alcohol and drug abuse problems. These grants will forge new and \nnecessary partnerships between the child protection agencies and the \nalcohol and drug prevention and treatment agencies so they can work \ntogether to provide services fort this population. The program is \ndesigned to increase the capacity of both the child welfare and alcohol \nand drug systems to comprehensively address the needs of these families \nto improve child safety, family stability, and permanence, and to \npromote recovery from alcohol and drug problems.\n  Statistics paint an unhappy picture for children of substance abusing \nparents: a 1998 report by the National Committee to Prevent Child Abuse \nfound that 36 states reported that parental substance abuse and poverty \nare the top two problems exhibited by families reported for child \nmaltreatment. And a 1997 survey conducted by the Child Welfare League \nof America found that at least 52 percent of placements into out-of-\nhome care were due in part to parental substance abuse.\n  Children whose parents abuse alcohol and drugs are almost three times \nlikelier to be abused and more than four times likelier to be neglected \nthan children of parents who are not substance abusers. Children in \nalcohol-abusing families were nearly four times more likely to be \nmaltreated overall, almost five times more likely to be physically \nneglected, and 10 times more likely to be emotionally neglected than \nchildren in families without alcohol problems.\n  A 1994 study published in the American Journal of Public Health fund \nthat children prenatally exposed to substances have been found to be \ntwo to three times more likely to be abused than non-exposed children. \nAnd as many as 80 percent of prenatally drug exposed infants will come \nto the attention of child welfare before their first birthday. Abused \nand neglected children under age six face the risk of more severe \ndamage than older children because their brains and neurological \nsystems are still developing.\n  Unfortunately, child welfare agencies estimate that only a third of \nthe 67 percent of the parents who need drug or alcohol prevention and \ntreatment services actually get help today.\n  This bill is about preventing problems. My colleagues and I know that \nwhat is most important here is the safety and well-being of America's \nchildren. We expect much of our youth because they are the future of \nour nation. In turn, we must be willing to give them the support they \nneed to learn and grow, so that they can lead healthy and productive \nlives.\n  In 1997 Congress passed the Adoption and Safe Families Act, ASFA, \nauthored by the late Senator John Chafee. ASFA promotes safety, \nstability, and permanence for all abused and neglected children and \nrequires timely decision-making in all proceedings to determine whether \nchildren can safely return home, or whether they should be moved to \npermanent, adoptive homes. Specifically, the law requires a State to \nensure that services are provided to the families of children who are \nat risk, so that children can remain safely with their families or \nreturn home after being in foster care.\n  The bill we are introducing today identifies a very specific area in \nwhich families and children need services, substance abuse. And it will \nensure that states have the funding necessary to provide services as \nrequired under the Adoption and Safe Families Act.\n  On March 23, 2000, Kristine Ragaglia, Commissioner of the Connecticut \nDepartment of Children and Families, testified before the House \nSubcommittee on Human Resources on this issue. She said simply that \n``If substance abuse issues are left unaddressed, many of the system's \nefforts to protect children and to promote positive change in families \nwill be wasted.'' This legislation aims to address this very gap in our \nnation's child protection system.\n  I am pleased that this legislation has been endorsed by the American \nAcademy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry; the American Academy of \nPediatrics; the American Prosecutors Research Institute; the American \nPsychological Association; the American Public Human Services \nAssociation; the Child Welfare League of America; the Children's \nDefense Fund; Fight Crime: Invest in Kids; the Maine Association of \nPrevention Programs; the Maine Association of Substance Abuse Programs; \nthe Maine Children's Trust; Mainely Parents; the Massachusetts Society \nfor the Prevention of Cruelty to Children; the National Conference of \nState Legislators; the New York State Office of Alcoholism and \nSubstance Abuse Services; and Prevent Child Abuse America.\n  I encourage my colleagues to take a look at our bill, to think \nseriously about the future for kids in their states, and to work with \nus in passing this very important piece of legislation. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a fact sheet and section-by-section description of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Fact Sheet--Child Protection/Alcohol and Drug Partnership Act of 2001\n\n       The Child Protection/Alcohol and Drug Partnership Act of \n     2001 is a bill to create a grant program to promote joint \n     activities among Federal, State, and local public child \n     welfare and alcohol and drug abuse prevention and treatment \n     agencies to improve child safety, family stability, and \n     permanence for children in families with drug and alcohol \n     problems, as well as promote recovery from drug and alcohol \n     problems.\n       Child welfare agencies estimate that only a third of the 67 \n     percent of the parents who need drug or alcohol prevention \n     and treatment services actually get help today. This bill \n     builds on the foundation of the Adoption and Safe Families \n     Act of 1997 which requires states to focus on a child's need \n     for safety, health and permanence. The bill creates new \n     funding for alcohol and drug treatment and other activities \n     that will serve the special needs of these families to either \n     provide treatment for parents with alcohol and drug abuse \n     problems so that a child can safely return to their family or \n     to promote timely decisions and fulfill the requirement of \n     the 1997 Adoption and Safe Families Act to provide services \n     prior to adoption.\n     Grants to promote child protection/alcohol and drug \n         partnerships\n       In an effort to improve child safety, family stability, and \n     permanence as well as promote recovery from alcohol and drug \n     abuse problems. HHS will award grants to States and Indian \n     tribes to encourage programs for families who are known to \n     the child welfare system and have alcohol and drug abuse \n     problems. Such grants will forge new and necessary \n     partnerships between the child protection agencies and the \n     alcohol and drug prevention and treatment agencies in States \n     so they can together provide necessary services for this \n     unique population.\n       These grants will help build new partnerships to provide \n     alcohol and drug abuse prevention and treatment services that \n     are timely, available, accessible, and appropriate and \n     include the following components:\n       (A) Preventive and early intervention services for the \n     children of families with alcohol and drug problems that \n     combine alcohol and drug prevention services with mental \n     health\n\n[[Page S1996]]\n\n     and domestic violence services, and recognize the mental, \n     emotional, and developmental problems the children may \n     experience.\n       (B) Prevention and early intervention services for families \n     at risk of alcohol and drug problems.\n       (c) Comprehensive home-based, out-patient and residential \n     treatment options.\n       (D) Formal and informal after-care support for families in \n     recovery that promote child safety and family stability.\n       (E) Services and supports that promote positive parent-\n     child interaction.\n     Forging new partnerships\n       GAO and HHS studies indicate that the existing programs for \n     alcohol and drug treatment do not effectively service \n     families in the child protection system. Therefore, this new \n     grant program will help eliminate barriers to treatment and \n     to child safety and permanence by encouraging agencies to \n     build partnerships and conduct joint activities including:\n       (A) Promote appropriate screening and assessment of alcohol \n     and drug problems.\n       (B) Create effective engagement and retention strategies \n     that get families into timely treatment.\n       (C) Encourage joint training for staff of child welfare and \n     alcohol and drug abuse prevention and treatment agencies, and \n     judges and other court personnel to increase understanding of \n     alcohol and drug problems related to child abuse and neglect \n     and to more accurately identify alcohol and drug abuse in \n     families. Such training increases staff knowledge of the \n     appropriate resources that are available in the communities, \n     and increases awareness of the importance of permanence for \n     children and the urgency for expedited time lines in making \n     these decisions.\n       (D) Improve data systems to monitor the progress of \n     families, evaluate service and treatment outcomes, and \n     determine which approaches are most effective.\n       (E) Evaluate strategies to identify the effectiveness of \n     treatment and those parts of the treatment that have the \n     greatest impact on families in different circumstances.\n     New, targeted investments\n       A total of $1.9 billion will be available to eligible \n     states with funding of $200 million in the first year \n     expanding to $575 million by the last year. The amount of \n     funding will be based on the State's number of children under \n     18, with a small state minimum to ensure that every state \n     gets a fair share. Indian tribes will have a 3-5 percent set \n     aside. State child welfare and alcohol and drug agencies \n     shall have a modest matching requirement for funding \n     beginning with a 15 percent match and gradually increasing to \n     25 percent. The Secretary has discretion to waive the State \n     match in cases of hardship.\n     Accountability and performance measurement\n       To ensure accountability, HHS and the related State \n     agencies must establish indicators within 12 months of the \n     enactment of this law which will be used to assess the \n     State's progress under this program. Annual reports by the \n     States must be submitted to HHS. Any state that fails to \n     submit its report will lose its funding for the next year, \n     until it comes into compliance. HHS must issue an annual \n     report to Congress on the progress of the Child Protection/\n     Alcohol and Drug Partnership grants.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Section-by-Section--Child Protection/Alcohol and Drug Partnership Act \n                                of 2001\n\nA bill to amend part B of title IV of the Social Security Act to create \n a grant program to promote joint activities among Federal, State, and \n Local public child welfare and alcohol and drug abuse prevention and \n                          treatment agencies.\n\n     Grants to promote child protection/alcohol and drug \n         partnership for children\n       In an effort to improve child safety, family stability, and \n     permanence, as well as promote recovery from alcohol and drug \n     abuse problems, the Secretary may award grants to eligible \n     States and Indian tribes to foster programs for families who \n     are known to the child welfare system to have alcohol and \n     drug abuse problems.

jointly work together, \n     creating a plan to identify the extent of the drug and \n     alcohol abuse problem.\n       Creation of plan--State agencies will provide data on \n     appropriate screening and assessment of cases, consultation \n     on cases involving alcohol and drug abuse, arrangements for \n     addressing confidentiality and sharing of information, cross \n     training of staff, co-location of services, support for \n     comprehensive treatment for parents and their children, and \n     priority of child welfare families for assessment or \n     treatment.\n       Identify activities--A description of the activities and \n     goals to be implemented under the five-year funding cycle \n     should be identified, such as: identify and assess alcohol \n     and drug treatment needs, identify risks to children's safety \n     and the need for permanency, enroll families in appropriate \n     services and treatment in their communities, and regularly \n     assess the progress of families receiving such treatment.\n       Implement prevention and treatment services--States and \n     Indian tribes should implement individualized alcohol and \n     drug abuse prevention and treatment services that are \n     available, accessible, and appropriate that include the \n     following components:\n       (A) Preventive and early intervention services for the \n     children of families with alcohol and drug abuse problems \n     that integrate alcohol and drug abuse prevention services \n     with mental health and domestic violence services, as well as \n     recognizing the mental, emotional, and developmental problems \n     the children may experience.\n       (B) Prevention and early intervention services for parents \n     at risk for alcohol and drug abuse problems.\n       (C) Comprehensive home-based, out-patient and residential \n     treatment options.\n       (D) Formal and informal after-care support for families in \n     recovery.\n       (E) Services and programs that promote parent-child \n     interaction.\n       Sharing information among agencies--Agencies should \n     eliminate existing barriers to treatment and to child safety \n     and permanence by sharing information among agencies and \n     learning from the various treatment protocols of other \n     agencies such as:\n       (A) Creating effective engagement and retention strategies.\n       (B) Encouraging joint training of child welfare staff and \n     alcohol and drug abuse prevention agencies, and judges and \n     court staff to increase awareness and understanding of drug \n     abuse and related child abuse and neglect and more accurately \n     identify abuse in families, increase staff knowledge of the \n     services and resources that are available in the communities, \n     and increase awareness of permanence for children and the \n     urgency for time lines in making these decisions.\n       (C) Improving data systems to monitor the progress of \n     families, evaluate service and treatment outcomes, and \n     determine which approaches are most effective.\n       (D) Evaluation strategies to identify the effectiveness of \n     treatment that has the greatest impact on families in \n     different circumstances.\n       (E) Training and technical assistance to increase the \n     State's capacity to perform the above activities.\n       Plan descriptions and assurances--States and Indian tribes \n     should create a plan that includes the following descriptions \n     and assurances:\n       (A) A description of the jurisdictions in the State whether \n     urban, suburban, or rural, and the State's plan to expand \n     activities over the 5-year funding cycle to other parts of \n     the State.\n       (B) A description of the way in which the State agency will \n     measure progress, including how the agency will jointly \n     conduct an evaluation of the results of the activities.\n       (C) A description of the input obtained from staff of State \n     agencies, advocates, consumers of prevention and treatment \n     services, line staff from public and private child welfare \n     and drug abuse agencies, judges and court staff, \n     representatives of health, mental health, domestic violence, \n     housing and employment services, as well as representative \n     of the State agency in charge of administering the \n     temporary assistance to needy families program (TANF).\n       (D) An assurance of coordination with other services \n     provided under other Federal or federally assisted programs \n     including health, mental health, domestic violence, housing, \n     employment programs, TANF, and other child welfare and \n     alcohol and drug abuse programs and the courts.\n       (E) An assurance that not more than 10 percent of \n     expenditures under the State plan for any fiscal year shall \n     be for administrative costs. However, Indian tribes will be \n     exempt from this limitation and instead may use the indirect \n     cost rate agreement in effect for the tribe.\n       (F) An assurance from States that Federal funds provided \n     will not be used to supplant Federal or non-Federal funds for \n     services and activities provided as of the date of the \n     submission of the plan. However, Indian tribes will be exempt \n     from this provision.\n       Amendments--A State or Indian tribe may amend its plan, in \n     whole or in part at any time through a plan amendment. The \n     amendment should be submitted to the Secretary not later than \n     30 days after the date of any changes. Approval from the \n     Secretary shall be presumed unless, the State has been \n     notified of disapproval within 60 days after receipt.\n       Special application to Indian tribes--The Indian tribe must \n     submit a plan to the Secretary that describes the activities \n     it will undertake with both the child welfare and alcohol and \n     drug agencies that serve its children to address the needs of \n     families who come to the attention of the child welfare \n     agency who have alcohol and drug problems. The Indian tribe \n     must also meet other applicable requirements, unless the \n     Secretary determines that it would be inappropriate based on \n     the tribe's resources, needs, and other circumstances.\n     Appropriation of funds\n       Appropriations--A total of 1.9 billion dollars will be \n     appropriated to eligible States and Indian tribes at the \n     progression rate of:\n\n[[Page S1997]]\n\n       (1) for fiscal year 2002, $200,000,000;\n       (2) for fiscal year 2003, $275,000,000;\n       (3) for fiscal year 2004, $375,000,000;\n       (4) for fiscal year 2005, $475,000,000; and\n       (5) for fiscal year 2006, $575,000,000.\n       Territories--The Secretary of HHS shall reserve 2 percent \n     of the amount appropriated each fiscal year for payments to \n     Puerto Rico, Guam, the United States Virgin Islands, American \n     Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands. In addition, the \n     Secretary shall reserve from 3 to 5 percent of the amount \n     appropriated for direct payment to Indian tribes.\n       Research and training--The Secretary shall reserve 1 \n     percent of the appropriated amount for each fiscal year for \n     practice-based research on the effectiveness of various \n     approaches for screening, assessment, engagement, treatment, \n     retention, and monitoring of families and training of staff \n     in such areas. In addition, the Secretary will also ensure \n     that a portion of these funds are used for research on the \n     effectiveness of these approaches for Indian children and the \n     training of staff.\n       Determination of use of funds--Funds may only be used to \n     carry out a specific research agenda established by the \n     Secretary, together with the Assistant Secretary of the \n     Administration for Children and Families and the \n     Administrator of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \n     Administration with input from public and private nonprofit \n     providers, consumers, representatives of Indian tribes and \n     advocates.\n     Payments to states\n       Amount of grant to States and territories--Each eligible \n     State will receive an amount based on the number of children \n     under the age of 18 that reside in that State. There will be \n     a small state minimum of .05 percent to ensure that all \n     States are eligible for sufficient funding to establish a \n     program.\n       Amount of grant to Indian tribes or tribal organizations--\n     Indian tribes shall be eligible for a set aside of 3 to 5 \n     percent. This amount will be distributed based on the \n     population of children under 18 in the tribe.\n       State matching requirement--States shall provide, through \n     non-Federal contributions, the following applicable \n     percentages for a given fiscal year:\n       (A) for fiscal years 2002 and 2003, 15 percent match;\n       (B) for fiscal years 2004 and 2005, 20 percent match; and\n       (C) for fiscal year 2006, 25 percent match.\n       Source of match--The non-Federal contributions required of \n     States may be in cash or in-kind including plant equipment or \n     services made directly from donations from public or private \n     entities. Amounts received from the Federal Government may \n     not be included in the applicable percentage of contributions \n     for a given fiscal year. However, Indian tribes may use three \n     Federal sources of matching funds: Indian Child Welfare Act \n     funds, Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act \n     Funds, and Community Block Grant funds.\n       Waiver--The Secretary may modify matching funds if it is \n     determined that extraordinary economic conditions in the \n     State justify the waiver. Indian tribes' matching funds may \n     also be modified if the Secretary determines that it would be \n     inappropriate based on the resources and needs of the \n     tribe.\n       Use of funds and deadline for request of payment--Funds may \n     only be used to carry out activities specified in the plan, \n     as approved by the Secretary. Each State or Indian tribe \n     shall apply to be paid funds not later than the beginning of \n     the fourth quarter of a fiscal year or they will be \n     reallotted.\n       Carryover and reallocation of funds--Funds paid to an \n     eligible State or Indian tribe may be used in that fiscal \n     year or the succeeding fiscal year. If a State does not apply \n     for funds allotted within the time provided, the funds will \n     be reallotted to one or more other eligible States on the \n     basis of the needs of that individual state. In the case of \n     Indian tribes, funds will be reallotted to remaining tribes \n     that are implementing approved plans.\n     Performance measurement\n       Establishment of indicators--The Secretary, in consultation \n     with the Assistant Secretary for the Administration for \n     Children and Families, the Administrator of the Substance \n     Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration within HHS, \n     and with state and local government, public officials \n     responsible for administering child welfare and alcohol and \n     drug abuse prevention and treatment programs, court staff, \n     consumers of the services, and advocates for these children \n     and parents will establish indicators within 12 months of the \n     enactment of this law which will be used to assess the \n     performance of States and Indian tribes. A State or Indian \n     tribe will be measured against itself, assessing progress \n     over time against a baseline established at the time the \n     grant activities were undertaken.\n       Illustrative examples--Indicators of activities to be \n     measured include:\n       (A) Improve screening and assessment of families.\n       (B) Increase availability of comprehensive individualized \n     treatment.\n       (C) Increase the number/proportion of families who enter \n     treatment promptly.\n       (D) Increase engagement and retention.\n       (E) Decrease the number of children who re-enter foster \n     care after being returned to families who had alcohol or drug \n     problems.\n       (F) Increase number/proportion of staff trained.\n       (G) Increase the proportion of parents who complete \n     treatment and show improvement in their employment status.\n       Reports--The child welfare and alcohol and drug abuse and \n     treatment agencies in each eligible state, and the Indian \n     tribes that receive funds shall submit no later than the end \n     of the first fiscal year, a report to the Secretary \n     describing activities carried out, and any changes in the use \n     of the funds planned for the succeeding fiscal year. After \n     the first report is submitted, a State or Indian tribe must \n     submit to the Secretary annually, by the end of the third \n     quarter in the fiscal year, a report on the application of \n     the indicators to its activities, an explanation of why these \n     indicators were chosen, and the results of the evaluation to \n     date. After the third year of the grant all of the States \n     must include indicators that address improvements in \n     treatment. A final report on evaluation and the progress made \n     must be submitted to the Secretary not later than the end of \n     each five year funding cycle of the grant.\n       Penalty--States or Indian tribes that fail to report on the \n     indicators will not be eligible for grant funds for the \n     fiscal year following the one in which it failed to report, \n     unless a plan for improving their ability to monitor and \n     evaluate their activities is submitted to the Secretary and \n     then approved in a timely manner.\n       Secretarial reports and evaluations--Beginning October 1, \n     2003, the Secretary, in consultation with the Assistant \n     Secretary for the Administration for Children and Families, \n     and the Administrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental \n     Health Service Administration, shall report annually, to the \n     Committee on Ways and Means of the House of the \n     Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate on \n     the joint activities, indicators, and progress made with \n     families.\n       Evaluations--Not later than six months after the end of \n     each five year funding cycle, the Secretary shall submit a \n     report to the above committees, the results of the \n     evaluations as well as recommendations for further \n     legislative actions.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am here today to talk about our \nNation's most vulnerable children, innocent children who have been \nabused or neglected by parents, many of whom have alcohol and drug \nabuse problems. Over 500,000 children receive foster care services \nnationwide, including 3,000 children in West Virginia. These numbers \nbelie our policy that every child deserves a safe, healthy, permanent \nhome, as specified in the fundamental guidelines set forth in the 1997 \nAdoption and Safe Families Act, ASFA.\n  National statistics tell us that a majority of families in the child \nwelfare system may struggle with alcohol and/or drug abuse. One recent \nsurvey noted that 67 percent of parents involved in child abuse or \nneglect cases required alcohol or drug treatment, but only one-third of \nthose parents received appropriate treatment or services to address \ntheir addiction. In my own state of West Virginia, over half of the \nchildren placed in the foster care system have families with substance \nabusing behaviors. We are also aware of countless numbers of other \nchildren who, while not receiving foster care services, are at risk of \nneglect due their parents' addictions.\n  Another stunning, sad statistic is that children with open child \nwelfare cases whose parents have substance abuse problems are younger \nthan other children in the foster care system and are more likely to \nsuffer severe, chronic neglect from their parents. Once these children \nare placed in the foster care system, they tend to stay in care longer \nthan other children.\n  It will be impossible to achieve the critical goal of safe, healthy, \nand permanent homes for children in the child protection system if we \ndo not address the problems of parental alcohol and drug abuse.\n  Examining the effects of substance abuse involves complex and far-\nreaching issues. As part of the 1997 Adoption and Safe Families Act, \nthe Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, was directed to study \nsubstance abuse as it relates to and within the framework of the child \nprotection system. Their important report, ``Blending Perspectives and \nBuilding Common Ground,'' outlines many challenges. It concludes that \nwe lack the necessary array of appropriate substance abuse treatment \nprograms and services, and emphasizes the well-known lack of services \ndesigned for women, especially for women and their children. In \naddition, the report notes that the separate substance abuse and child \nprotection systems have no purposeful, planned partnership to address \nthe unique needs of abused and neglected children.\n  The report details the lack of a cooperative, inter-agency \nrelationship between the two systems whose staffs\n\n[[Page S1998]]\n\nwork diligently to provide services under their own jurisdiction, but \nhave minimal communication, different goals, and divergent service \nphilosophies with regard to each other. For example, each system has \ndifferent definitions of the ``client served.'' While ASFA views the \nchild as ``the client'' and expects child protection agencies and \ncourts to consider termination, within a 22-month time frame, of \nparental rights for children receiving foster care service for 15 \nmonths, substance abuse treatment providers often view the adult as the \nclient, with different time frames and expectations for recovery.\n  In order to meet the goals of ASFA, we must develop new ways to \nencourage these two independent systems to work together on behalf of \nparents with substance abuse problems and their children. The issues of \naddiction and children receiving protection services cannot be \naddressed in isolation. It is essential to consider the total picture: \nThe needs of the child, the needs of the parents, and cost-effective \nservices that meet adoption laws' goal to provide every child with a \nsafe, healthy, and permanent home.\n\n  The HHS report identifies significant priorities. First, it calls for \nbuilding collaborative working relationships between the child \nprotection and substance abuse agencies.\n  While substance abuse treatment is a challenge in and of itself, the \nreport explains that effective treatment is further complicated for \nparents with children. The majority of substance abuse treatment \nprograms are not set up to serve both women and their children. While \nour country in general lacks the comprehensive services needed for such \nfamilies, there are some models and promising practices on how to serve \nboth parents and children.\n  One model can be found in my State, the MOTHERS program in Beckley, \nWV, which serves women and their children. The majority of these women \nhave either lost custody of their children or were under child \nprotection service investigation or mandate, are typically unemployed \nand untrained for gainful employment, have few aspirations, and wrestle \nwith depression. This innovation program simultaneously addresses the \nneeds of both mothers and their children, through individual and joint \ntherapy, in such areas as recovery, mental health counseling, \nemployment, academic education, healthy living skills, parenting, and \nfamily permanency. These services are provided using a residential \nmodel where mothers and their children live in a therapeutic \nenvironment and receive temporary housing, meal service, recreation \nactivities, and transportation to and from community Alcoholics \nAnonymous and Narcotics Anonymous meetings. The bill we are introducing \ntoday would give other localities the opportunity to develop similar \nprograms or alternative models.\n  In addition, the HHS report recognizes the importance of research to \nbetter understand the relationship between substance abuse and child \nmaltreatment.\n  Today, I am proud to join with my colleagues, Senators Snowe, DeWine, \nand Dodd, to introduce legislation to address the challenges of abused \nand neglected children whose parents have alcohol and/or drug problems. \nWe have worked with state officials, child advocates, criminal justice \nofficials, and members of the substance abuse community to develop the \nChild Protection/Alcohol and Drug Partnership Act of 2001. This bill \nbuilds on ASFA's fundamental goal of making a child's safety, health, \nand permanency paramount.\n  To accomplish this bold purpose, we must invest in a partnership \ndesigned to respond to the needs and priorities outlined in the HHS \nreport. I believe that a new program and a new approach are essential. \nExisting substance abuse treatment programs such as those designed to \nserve single males cannot respond to the needs of a mother and her \nchild.\n  To be effective, we must connect child protection and substance abuse \ntreatment staffs and support them to work in partnership to test and \nidentify best practices. Forging new partnerships take time--and it \ntakes money. That is why this bill invests $1.9 billion over 5 years to \ncombat the problems of substance abuse faced by families whose children \nare sheltered by the child protection system. I understand this is a \nlarge sum, but alcohol and drug abuse is an enormous problem in our \ncountry and represents an overwhelming financial and human loss. Before \nreacting to the bill expenditure alone, consider the costs we would \nincur if we remain silent on this issue. If we do not invest in \nsubstance abuse prevention and treatment for such families, we cannot \neffectively combat the abuse and neglect of children.\n  Our bill is designed to tackle this tough issue and encourage child \nprotection and substance abuse agencies to work in partnership and \npromote innovative approaches within both of their systems to support \nwomen and their children. This bill can provide funding for outreach \nservices to families, screening and assessment to enhance prevention, \noutpatient or residential treatment services, retention supports to aid \nmothers to remain in treatment, and aftercare services to keep families \nand children safe. This bill also addresses the importance of dual \ntraining for the staffs of the child protection and substance abuse \ntreatment systems, to share effective strategies in order to meet the \ngoal of safe and permanent homes for children.\n  If we choose to invest in child protection and substance abuse \npartnerships for families, we can achieve two things. For many \nfamilies, I hope that parents will achieve sobriety through treatment \nand that their children will return to a safe and stable home. For \nthose who are unsuccessful, we will know that we have put forth a \nreasonable, good faith effort and learned an important lesson--that \nsome children need alternate homes, and that we will still need to \npursue adoption for some children. Under the Adoption and Safe Families \nAct, courts cannot move forward on adoption until appropriate services \nhave been provided to families. That is the law, and we need to follow \nit.\n  Our bill will promote a responsible approach with a focus on \naccountability. It requires annual progress reports that detail defined \noutcomes, challenges, and proposed solutions. These reports will \nevaluate parental treatment outcomes, the child's safety, and the \nstability of the family.\n  Throughout the years, I have worked to address the needs of abused \nand neglected children in a bipartisan matter. I am proud to continue \nthis bipartisan approach as we come to grips with such a controversial \nand emotionally charged issue as protecting children who are abused and \nneglected by their substance-abusing parents.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 485. A bill to amend Federal law regarding the tolling of the \nInterstate Highway System; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to bring to your attention an \nissue of great national concern. We all remember the great debate that \nthis chamber had last year during reauthorization of the federal \nhighway bill, TEA-21. We all negotiated to get more funds for our \nstates because we know that more investment in our highways means \nbetter, safer, and more efficient transportation for those who reply on \nroads for making deliveries, going to work or school, or just doing the \ngrocery shopping. Transportation is the linchpin for economic \ndevelopment, and those states that have good, efficient transportation \nsystems attract business development, ultimately raising standards of \nliving. However, I think that we may have gone too far in authorizing \nstates additional means to raise revenue for highway improvements. \nThese means to raise revenue are not productive and hurt our system of \ntransportation.\n  Specifically, I am concerned that states have too much flexibility to \nestablish tolls on our Interstate highway system. For many states, the \nlarge increases in TEA-21 funding have satisfied the need to invest in \ninfrastructure. Other states have found that they need to raise more \nmoney, and so they have raised their state fuel taxes or taken other \nactions to raise the needed revenue. These increases may be difficult \nto implement politically, because frankly most people don't support any \ntax increase. However, I believe that highway tolls are a non-\nproductive and overly intrusive means of raising revenue causing more \nharm to commerce than can be justified.\n\n[[Page S1999]]\n\n  Congress, mistakenly in my opinion, increased the authority of states \nto put tolls on their Interstate highway in TEA-21. I am introducing \nthe interstate Tolls Relief Act of 2001 to restrict Interstate toll \nauthority. The debate over highway tolls goes back to the genesis of \nour Republic, and contributed to our movement away from the Articles of \nConfederation to a more uniform system of governance under the U.S. \nConstitution. Toll roads were the bane of commerce, in the early years \nof the Republic, as each state would attempt to toll the interstate \ntraveling public to finance state public improvements. Ultimately, \nfrustration with delay and uneven costs helped contribute to the \nadoption of Commerce Clause powers to help facilitate interstate and \nforeign trade. Those same concerns hold true today, and I think that we \nin Congress must take a national perspective and promote interstate \ncommerce.\n  I think that if one were to ask the citizens of the United States \nabout tolls, they would ultimately conclude that Interstate tolls would \nreduce by efficiency of our Interstate highways, increase shipping \ncosts, and make interstate travel more expensive and less convenient. \nNot to mention the safety problems associated with erecting toll booths \nand operating them to collect revenues.\n  Now, I recognize that tolls under certain circumstances may be a good \nidea, and my bill does not prevent states from tolling non-Interstate \nhighways. My bill also does not affect tolls on highways where they are \nalready in use, and states will continue to be able to rely on existing \ntolls for revenues. Furthermore, my bill recognizes that when funds \nmust be found for a major Interstate bridge or tunnel project, states \nmay have no other option but to use tolls to finance the project. They \nmay continue to do so under my bill. I believe this consistent with the \noriginal intent of authority granted for Interstate tolls. What my bill \ndoes is to prevent the proliferation of Interstate tolls, and restrict \ntolling authority for major bridges and tunnels.\n  This bill is essential if we are to continue to have an Interstate \nHighway System that is safe and facilitates the efficient movement of \nInterstate commerce and personal travel. I urge the support of my \ncolleagues.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 485\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

LIMITATION ON USE OF TOLL REVENUES.\n\n       Section 129(a)(3) of title 23, United States Code, is \n     amended by--\n       (1) striking ``first'' in the first sentence and inserting \n     ``only''; and\n       (2) striking ``If the State certifies annually that the \n     tolled facility is being adequately maintained, the State may \n     use any toll revenues in excess of amounts required under the \n     preceding sentence for any purpose for which Federal funds \n     may be obligated by a State under this title.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Ms. Collins, Mr. \n        Levin, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Chafee, Mr. \n        Akaka, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Torricelli, \n        Mr. Wellstone, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Corzine):\n  S. 486. A bill to reduce the risk that innocent persons may be \nexecuted, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, a little over one year ago, I came to this \nfloor to draw attention to the growing crisis in the administration of \ncapital punishment. I noted the startling number of cases, 85, in which \ndeath row inmates had been exonerated after long stays in prison. In \nsome of those cases, the inmate had come within days of being executed.\n  A lot has happened in a year. For one thing, a lot more death row \ninmates have been exonerated. The number jumped in a single year from \n85 all the way to 95. There are now 95 people in 22 States who have \nbeen cleared of the crime that sent them to death row, according to the \nDeath Penalty Information Center. The appalling number of exonerations, \nand the fact that they span so many States, a substantial majority of \nthe States that have the death penalty, makes it clearer than ever that \nthe crisis I spoke of last year is real, and that it is national in its \nscope. This is not an ``Illinois problem'' or a ``Texas problem.'' Nor, \nwith Earl Washington's release last month from prison, is it a \n``Virginia problem.'' There are death penalty problems across the \nnation, and as a nation we need to pay attention to what is happening.\n  It seems like every time you pick up a paper these days, there is \nanother story about another person who was sentenced to death for a \ncrime that he did not commit. The most horrifying miscarriages of \njustice are becoming commonplace: ``Yet Another Innocent Person Cleared \nBy DNA, Walks Off Death Row,'' story on page 10. We should never forget \nthat behind each of these headlines is a person whose life was \ncompletely shattered and nearly extinguished by a wrongful conviction.\n  And those were the ``lucky'' ones. We simply do not know how many \ninnocent people remain on death row, and how many may already have been \nexecuted.\n  People of good conscience can and will disagree on the morality of \nthe death penalty. I have always opposed it. I did when I was a \nprosecutor, and I do today. But no matter what you believe about the \ndeath penalty, no one wants to see innocent people sentenced to death. \nIt is completely unacceptable.\n  A year ago, along with several of my colleagues, I introduced the \nInnocence Protection Act of 2000. I hoped this bill would stimulate a \nnational debate and begin work on national reforms on what is, as I \nsaid, a national problem. A year later, the national debate is well \nunder way, but the need for real, concrete reforms is more urgent than \never.\n  Today, my friend Gordon Smith and I are introducing the Innocence \nProtection Act of 2001. We are joined by Senators from both sides of \nthe aisle, by some who support capital punishment and by others who \noppose it. On the Republican side, I want to thank Senators Susan \nCollins and Lincoln Chafee, and my fellow Vermonter Jim Jeffords. On \nthe Democratic side, my thanks to Senators Levin, Feingold, Kennedy, \nAkaka, Mikulski, Dodd, Lieberman, Torricelli, Wellstone, Boxer and \nCorzine. I also want to thank our House sponsors William Delahunt, and \nRay LaHood, along with their 117 additional cosponsors, both Democratic \nand Republican.\n  Over the last year we have turned the corner in showing that the \ndeath process is broken. Now we will push forward to our goal of acting \non reforms that address these problems.\n  Here on Capitol Hill it is our job to represent the public. The \nscores of legislators who have sponsored this legislation clearly do \nrepresent the American public, both in their diversity and in their \nreadiness to work together in a bipartisan manner for common-sense \nsolutions.\n  Too often in this chamber, we find ourselves dividing along party or \nideological lines. The Innocence Protection Act is not about that, and \nit is not about whether, in the abstract, you favor or disfavor the \ndeath penalty. It is about what kind of society we want America to be \nin the 21st Century.\n  The goal of our bill is simple, but profoundly important: to reduce \nthe risk of mistaken executions. The Innocence Protection Act proposes \nbasic, common-sense reforms to our criminal justice system that are \ndesigned to protect the innocent and to ensure that if the death \npenalty is imposed, it is the result of informed and reasoned \ndeliberation, not politics, luck, bias, or guesswork. We have listened \nto a lot of good advice and made some refinements to the bill since the \nlast Congress, but it is still structured around\n\n[[Page S2000]]\n\ntwo principal reforms: improving the availability of DNA testing, and \nensuring reasonable minimum standards and funding for court-appointed \ncounsel.\n  The need to make DNA testing more available is obvious. DNA is the \nfingerpint of the 21st Century. Prosecutors across the country use it, \nand rightly so, to prove guilt. By the same token, it should be used to \ndo what it is equally scientifically reliable to do, prove innocence. \nOur bill would provide broader access to DNA testing by convicted \noffenders. It would also prevent the premature destruction of \nbiological evidence that could hold the key to clearing an innocent \nperson or identifying the real culprit.\n  I am gratified that our bill has served as a catalyst for reforms in \nthe States with respect to post-conviction DNA testing. In just one \nyear, several States have passed some form of DNA legislation. Others \nhave DNA bills under consideration. Much of this legislation is modeled \non the DNA provisions proposed in the Innocence Protection Act, and we \ncan be proud about this.\n  But there are still many States that have not moved on this issue, \neven though it has been more than six years since New York passed the \nNation's first post-conviction DNA statute. And some of the States that \nhave acted have done so in ways that will leave the vast majority of \nprisoners without access to DNA testing. Moreover, none of these new \nlaws addresses the larger and more urgent problem of ensuring that \npeople facing the death penalty have adequate legal representation. The \nInnocence Protection Act does address this problem.\n\n  In our adversarial system of justice, effective assistance of counsel \nis essential to the fair administration of justice. Unfortunately, the \nmanner in which defense lawyers are selected and compensated in death \npenalty cases too often results in fundamental unfairness and \nunreliable verdicts. More than two-thirds of all death sentences are \noverturned on appeal or after post-conviction review because of errors \nin the trial; such errors are minimized when the defendant has a \ncompetent counsel.\n  It is a sobering fact that in some areas of the Nation it is often \nbetter to be rich and guilty than poor and innocent. All too often, \nlawyers defending people whose lives are at stake are inexperienced, \ninept, or just plain incompetent. All too often, they fail to take the \ntime to review the evidence and understand the basic facts of the case \nbefore the trial is under way.\n  The reasons for this inadequacy of representation are well know: lack \nof standards for choosing defense counsel, and lack of funding for this \ntype of legal service. The Innocence Protection Act addresses these \nproblems head on. It calls for the creation of a temporary Commission \non Capital Representation, which would consist of distinguished \nAmerican legal experts who have experienced the criminal justice system \nfirst hand, prosecutors, defense lawyers, and judges. The Commission \nwould be tasked with formulating standards that specify the elements of \nan effective system for providing adequate representation in capital \ncases. The bill also authorizes more than $50,000,000 in grants to help \nput the new standards into effect.\n  We have consulted a great many legal experts in the course of \nformulating these provisions. They have all provided valuable insights, \nbut as a former prosecutor myself, I have been particularly pleased \nwith the encouragement and assistance we have received from prosecutors \nacross the nation.\n  Good prosecutors have two things in common. First, good prosecutors \nwant to convict the person, not to get a conviction that may be a \nmistake, and that may leave the real culprit in the clear. Second, good \nprosecutors want defendants to be represented by good defense lawyers. \nLawyers who investigate their client's cases thoroughly before trial, \nand represent their clients vigorously in court, are essential in \ngetting at the truth in our adversarial system.\n  Given some leadership from the people's representatives in Congress, \nsome fair and objective standards, and some funding, America's \nprosecutors will be ready, willing and able to help fix the system. We \nowe them, and the American people, that leadership.\n  On August 3, 1995, more than five years ago, the Conference of Chief \nJustices urged the judicial leadership in each State in which the death \npenalty is authorized by law to ``establish standards and a process \nthat will assure the timely appointment of competent counsel, with \nadequate resources, to represent defendants in capital cases at each \nstage of such proceedings.'' The States' top jurists, the people who \nrun our justice system, called for reform. But not much came of their \ninitiative. Although a few States have established effective standards \nand sound administrative systems for the appointment and compensation \nof counsel in capital cases, most have not. The do-nothing politics of \ngridlock got in the way of sensible, consensus-based reform.\n  We have made a commitment to the American people to do better than \nthat. At the end of the last Congress, members on both sides of the \naisle joined together to pass the Paul Coverdell National Forensic \nSciences Improvement Act and the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act. \nI strongly supported both bills, which will give States the help they \ndesperately need to reduce the backlogs of untested DNA evidence in \ntheir crime labs, and to improve the quality and capacity of these \nfacilities. Both bills passed unanimously in both houses. And in both \nbills, all of us here in Congress committed ourselves to working with \nthe States to ensure access to post-conviction DNA testing in \nappropriate cases, and to improve the quality of legal representation \nin capital cases through the establishment of counsel standards. \nCongress has already gone on record in recognizing what has to be done. \nNow it is time to actually do it.\n  If we had a series of close calls in airline traffic, we would be \nrushing to fix the problem. These close calls on death row should \nconcentrate our minds, and focus our will, to act.\n  This new Congress is, as our new President has said, a time for \nleadership. It is a time for fulfilling the commitments we have made to \nthe American people. And it is a time for action. The Innocence \nProtection Act is a bipartisan effort to move beyond the politics of \ngridlock. By passing it, we can work cooperatively with the States to \nensure that defendants who are put on trial for their lives have \ncompetent legal representation at every stage of their cases. By \npassing it, we can send a message about the values of fundamental \njustice that unite all Americans. And by passing it, we can \nsubstantially reduce the risk of executing innocent people. We have had \na constructive debate, and we have made a noble commitment. It is now \ntime to act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a summary of \nthe bill be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 486\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Over the past decade, deoxyribonucleic acid testing \n     (referred to in this section as ``DNA testing'') has emerged \n     as the most reliable forensic technique for identifying \n     criminals when biological material is left at a crime scene.\n       (2) Because of its scientific precision, DNA testing can, \n     in some cases, conclusively establish the guilt or innocence \n     of a criminal defendant. In other cases, DNA testing may not \n     conclusively establish guilt or innocence, but may have \n     significant probative value to a finder of fact.\n       (3) While DNA testing is increasingly commonplace in \n     pretrial investigations today, it was not widely available in \n     cases tried prior to 1994. Moreover, new forensic DNA testing \n     procedures have made it possible to get results from minute \n     samples that could not previously be tested, and to obtain \n     more informative and accurate results than earlier forms of \n     forensic DNA testing could produce. Consequently, in some \n     cases convicted inmates have been exonerated by new DNA tests \n     after earlier tests had failed to produce definitive results.\n       (4) Since DNA testing is often feasible on relevant \n     biological material that is decades old, it can, in some \n     circumstances, prove that a conviction that predated the \n     development of DNA testing was based upon incorrect factual \n     findings. Uniquely, DNA evidence showing innocence, produced \n     decades after a conviction, provides a more reliable basis \n     for establishing a correct verdict than any evidence \n     proffered at the original trial. DNA testing, therefore, can \n     and has resulted in the post-conviction exoneration of \n     innocent men and women.\n       (5) In more than 80 cases in the United States, DNA \n     evidence has led to the exoneration of innocent men and women \n     who were wrongfully convicted. This number includes at least \n     10 individuals sentenced to death, some of whom came within \n     days of being executed.\n       (6) In more than a dozen cases, post-conviction DNA testing \n     that has exonerated an innocent person has also enhanced \n     public safety by providing evidence that led to the \n     identification of the actual perpetrator.\n       (7) Experience has shown that it is not unduly burdensome \n     to make DNA testing available to inmates. The cost of that \n     testing is relatively modest and has decreased in recent \n     years. Moreover, the number of cases in which post-conviction \n     DNA testing is appropriate is small, and will decrease as \n     pretrial testing becomes more common.\n       (8) Under current Federal and State law, it is difficult to \n     obtain post-conviction DNA testing because of time limits on \n     introducing newly discovered evidence. Under Federal law, \n     motions for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence \n     must be made within 3 years after conviction. In most States, \n     those motions must be made not later than 2 years after \n     conviction, and sometimes much sooner. The result is that \n     laws intended to prevent the use of evidence that has become \n     less reliable over time have been used to preclude the use of \n     DNA evidence that remains highly reliable even decades after \n     trial.\n       (9) The National Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence, \n     a Federal panel established by the Department of Justice and \n     comprised of law enforcement, judicial, and scientific \n     experts, has urged that post-conviction DNA testing be \n     permitted in the relatively small number of cases in which it \n     is appropriate, notwithstanding procedural rules that could \n     be invoked to preclude that testing, and notwithstanding the \n     inability of an inmate to pay for the testing.\n       (10) Since New York passed the Nation's first post-\n     conviction DNA statute in 1994, only a few States have \n     adopted post-conviction DNA testing procedures, and some of \n     these procedures are unduly restrictive. Moreover, only a \n     handful of States have passed legislation requiring that \n     biological evidence be adequately preserved.\n       (11) In 1994, Congress passed the DNA Identification Act, \n     which authorized the construction of the Combined DNA Index \n     System, a national database to facilitate law enforcement \n     exchange of DNA identification information, and authorized \n     funding to improve the quality and availability of DNA \n     testing for law enforcement identification purposes. In 2000, \n     Congress passed the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act and \n     the Paul Coverdell Forensic Sciences Improvement Act, which \n     together authorized an additional $908,000,000 over 6 years \n     in DNA-related grants.\n       (12) Congress should continue to provide financial \n     assistance to the States to increase the capacity of State \n     and local laboratories to carry out DNA testing for law \n     enforcement identification purposes. At the same time, \n     Congress should insist that States which accept financial \n     assistance make DNA testing available to both sides of the \n     adversarial system in order to enhance the reliability and \n     integrity of that system.\n       (13) In Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390 (1993), a majority \n     of the members of the Court suggested that a persuasive \n     showing of innocence made after trial would render the \n     execution of an inmate unconstitutional.\n       (14) It shocks the conscience and offends social standards \n     of fairness and decency to execute innocent persons or to \n     deny inmates the opportunity to present persuasive evidence \n     of their innocence.\n       (15) If biological material is not subjected to DNA testing \n     in appropriate cases, there is a significant risk that \n     persuasive evidence of innocence will not be detected and, \n     accordingly, that innocent persons will be unconstitutionally \n     executed.\n       (16) Given the irremediable constitutional harm that would \n     result from the execution of an innocent person and the \n     failure of many States to ensure that innocent persons are \n     not sentenced to death, a Federal statute assuring the \n     availability of DNA testing and a chance to present the \n     results of testing in court is a congruent and proportional \n     prophylactic measure to prevent constitutional injuries from \n     occurring.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are to--\n       (1) substantially implement the Recommendations of the \n     National Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence in the \n     Federal criminal justice system, by authorizing DNA testing \n     in appropriate cases;\n       (2) prevent the imposition of unconstitutional punishments \n     through the exercise of power granted by clause 1 of section \n     8 and clause 2 of section 9 of article I of the Constitution \n     of the United States and section 5 of the 14th amendment to \n     the Constitution of the United States; and\n       (3) ensure that wrongfully convicted persons have an \n     opportunity to establish their innocence through DNA testing, \n     by requiring the preservation of DNA evidence for a limited \n     period.\n\n     SEC. 102.

Most urgently the \n     bill would afford greater access to DNA testing by convicted \n     offenders; and help States improve the quality of legal \n     representation in capital cases.\n\n\n         title I--exonerating the innocent through dna testing\n\n       Sec. 101. Findings and purposes. Legislative findings and \n     purposes in support of this title.\n       Sec. 102. DNA testing in Federal criminal justice system. \n     Establishes rules and procedures governing applications for \n     DNA testing by inmates in the Federal system. Courts shall \n     order DNA testing if it has the scientific potential to \n     produce new exculpatory evidence material to the inmate's \n     claim of innocence. When the test results are exculpatory, \n     courts shall order a hearing and make such further orders as \n     may be appropriate under existing law. Prohibits the \n     destruction of biological evidence in a criminal case while a \n     defendant remains incarcerated, absent prior notification to \n     such defendant of the government's intent to destroy the \n     evidence.\n       Sec. 103. DNA testing in State criminal justice system. \n     Conditions receipt of Federal grants for DNA-related programs \n     on an assurance that the State will adopt adequate procedures \n     for preserving biological material and making DNA testing \n     available to inmates.\n       Sec. 104. Prohibition pursuant to section 5 of the 14th \n     Amendment. Prohibits States from denying applications for DNA \n     testing by death row inmates, if the proposed testing has the \n     scientific potential to produce new exculpatory evidence \n     material to the inmate's claim of innocence. Also prohibits \n     States from denying inmates a meaningful opportunity to prove \n     their innocence using the results of DNA testing. Inmates may \n     sue for declaratory or injunctive relief to enforce these \n     prohibitions.\n       Sec. 105. Grants to prosecutors for DNA testing programs. \n     Permits States to use grants under the Edward Byrne Memorial \n     State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Programs to fund \n     the growing number of prosecutor-initiated programs that \n     review convictions to identify cases in which DNA testing is \n     appropriate and that offer DNA testing to inmates in such \n     cases.\n\n\n      title ii--ensuring competent legal services in capital cases\n\n       Sec. 201. National Commission on Capital Representation. \n     Establishes a National Commission on Capital Representation \n     to develop standards for providing adequate legal \n     representation for indigents facing a death sentence. The \n     Commission would be composed of nine members and would \n     include experienced prosecutors, defense attorneys, and \n     judges, and would complete its work within on year. Total \n     authorization $1,000,000.\n       Sec. 202. Capital defense incentive grants. Establishes a \n     grant program, to be administered by the State Justice \n     Institute, to help States implement the Commission's \n     standards and otherwise improve the quality of representation \n     in capital cases. Authorization is $50,000,000 for the first \n     year, and such sums as may be necessary for the two years \n     that follow.\n       Sec. 203. Amendments to prison grant programs. Directs the \n     Attorney General to withhold a portion of the funds awarded \n     under the prison grant programs from death penalty States \n     that have not established or do not maintain a system for \n     providing legal representation in capital cases that \n     satisfies the Commission's standards. The Attorney General \n     may waive the withholding requirement for one year under \n     certain circumstances.\n       Sec. 204. Effect on procedural default rules. Provides that \n     certain procedural barriers to Federal habeas corpus review \n     shall not apply if the State did not provide legal \n     representation to the habeas petitioner under a State system \n     for providing representation that satisfied the Commission's \n     standards. This section does not apply in any case in which \n     the relevant State court proceeding occurred more than 1 year \n     before the formulation of such standards.\n       Sec. 205. Capital defense resource grants. Amends the \n     Criminal Justice Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3006A, to make more \n     Federal funding available for purposes of enhancing the \n     availability, competence, and prompt assignment of counsel in \n     capital cases, encouraging the continuity of representation \n     in such cases, and increasing the efficiency with which \n     capital cases are resolved.\n\n\n                  title iii--miscellaneous provisions\n\n       Sec. 301. Increased compensation in federal cases. Raises \n     the total amount of damages that may be awarded against the \n     United States in cases of unjust imprisonment from $5,000 to \n     $50,000 a year in a non-death penalty case, or $100,000 a \n     year in a death penalty case.\n       Sec. 302. Compensation in state death cases. Encourages \n     states to maintain effective procedures for reasonably \n     compensating persons who were unjustly convicted and \n     sentenced to death, and investigating the causes of such \n     unjust convictions in order to prevent such errors from \n     recurring.\n       Sec. 303. Certification requirement in federal death \n     penalty prosecutions. Increases accountability by requiring \n     the Attorney General, when seeking the death penalty in any \n     case, to certify that the federal interest in the prosecution \n     is more substantial than the interests of the state or local \n     authorities. Modeled on the certification requirements in the \n     federal civil rights and juvenile delinquency laws, this \n     section codifies existing practice as reflected in section 9-\n     10.070 of the U.S. Attorney's Manual. This section does not \n     create any rights enforceable at law by any party in any \n     matter civil or criminal.\n       Sec. 304. Alternative of life imprisonment without \n     possibility of release. Clarifies that juries in death \n     penalty prosecutions brought under the drug kingpin statute, \n     21 U.S.C. Sec. 848(l), have the option of recommending life \n     imprisonment without possibility of release. This amendment \n     incorporates into the drug kingpin statute a procedural \n     protection that federal law already expressly provides to the \n     vast majority of capital defendants.\n       Sec. 305. Right to an informed jury. Encourages states to \n     allow defendants in capital cases to have the jury instructed \n     on all statutorily-authorized sentencing options, including \n     applicable parole eligibility rules and terms.\n       Sec. 306. Annual reports. Directs the Justice Department to \n     prepare an annual report regarding the administration of the \n     nation's capital punishment laws. The report must be \n     submitted to Congress, distributed to the press and posted on \n     the Internet.\n       Sec. 307. Sense of the Congress regarding the execution of \n     juvenile offenders and the mentally retarded. Expresses the \n     sense of the Congress that the death penalty is \n     disproportionate and offends contemporary standards of \n     decency when applied to juvenile offenders and the mentally \n     retarded.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I am proud to be a co-sponsor of \nthis new and improved Innocence Protection Act. The Innocence \nProtection Act we introduced last year was widely heralded as providing \nmuch-needed improvements to our nation's already strong judicial \nsystem. This year, the bill itself has been strengthened, so it can \nbetter benefit the truly innocent without imposing undue hardship on \nour hard-working law enforcement personnel. While our court and law \nenforcement officials work extremely hard to ensure justice for all, \noccasionally mistakes are made.\n  To prevent these rare instances, The Innocence Protection Act \nencourages appropriate use of DNA testing, and provision of competent \ncounsel. The bill also provides for adequate compensation in the rare \ncase that a person is wrongfully imprisoned, and encourages states to \nexamine these situations to prevent their recurrence. The Innocence \nProtection Act proposes to apply technological advances of the 21st \ncentury evenly across the country to ensure that justice is served \nswiftly and fairly, regardless of where you live.\n  Both supporters and opponents of the death penalty can support this \nbill, which will only improve the integrity of our Criminal Justice \nSystem. By helping ensure that the true perpetrators of heinous crimes \nare behind bars, the innocent can live in a safer world. I am a \nsupporter of the death penalty. I believe that there are some times \nwhen humankind can act in a manner so odious, so heinous, and so \ndepraved that the right to life is forfeited. Notwithstanding this \nbelief, indeed, because of this belief, I am reintroducing the \nInnocence Protection Act of 2001 with Senator Leahy and others today.\n  Clearly, there is a growing interest in this issue in Congress. I \nfeel strongly that this is a bill whose time has come, and I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in the House and Senate to ensure \nits passage this session.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 487. A bill to amend chapter 1 of title 17, United States Code, \nrelating to\n\n[[Page S2007]]\n\nthe exemption of certain performances or displays for educational uses \nfrom copyright infringement provisions, to provide that the making of a \nsingle copy of such performances or displays is not an infringement, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce with my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Leahy, legislation entitled the \n``Technology Education and Copyright Harmonization Act'' or fittingly \nabbreviated as the ``TEACH Act,'' which updates the educational use \nprovisions of the copyright law to account for advancements in digital \ntransmission technologies that support distance learning.\n  While distance learning is far from a new concept, there is no \n``official'' definition as to what falls under the umbrella of distance \nlearning. There is, however, general agreement that distance education \ncovers the various forms of study at all levels in which students are \nseparated from instructors by time or space. By creating new avenues of \ncommunication, technology has paved the way for so-called ``distance \nlearning,'' starting with correspondence courses, and later with \ninstructional broadcasting. Most recently, however, the introduction of \nonline education has revolutionized the world of ``distance learning.'' \nWhile the benefits of all forms of distance learning are self-evident, \nonline learning opens unprecedented educational opportunities. With the \nclick of a mouse, students in remote areas are able to access a broad \nspectrum of courses from the finest institutions and ``chat'' with \nother students across the country.\n  Distance education, and the use of high technology tools such as the \nInternet in education, hold great promise for students in states like \nUtah. Students in remote areas of my state are now able to link up to \nresources previously only available to those in cities or at \nprestigious educational institutions. For many Utahns, this means \nhaving access to courses or being able to see virtual demonstrations of \nprinciples that until now they have only read about.\n  True to its heritage, Utah is a pioneer among states in blazing the \ntrail to the next century, making tomorrow's virtual classrooms a \nreality today. Fittingly, since it is home to one of the original six \nuniversities that pioneered the Internet, the State of Utah and the \nUtah System of Higher Education, as well as a number of individual \nuniversities in the state have consistently been recognized as \ntechnology and web-education innovators. Such national recognition \nreflects, in part, Utah's high-tech industrial base, its learning-\noriented population, and the fact that Utah was the first state with a \ncentrally coordinated statewide system for distance learning. In the \ncourse of preparing the report that resulted in this legislation, I was \npleased to host the Register of Copyrights at a distance education \nexposition and copyright round table that took place at the nerve \ncenter of that system, the Utah Education Network, where we saw many of \nthe exciting technologies being developed and implemented in Utah, by \nUtahns, to make distance education a reality.\n  At the event in Salt Lake City, Ms. Peters and I dropped in on a live \non-line art history class hosted in Orem, that included high school and \ncollege students scattered from Alpine in the north to Lake Powell in \nthe south, nearly the length of the state. And the promise of distance \neducation extends far beyond the traditional student, making expanded \nopportunities available for working parents, senior citizens, and \nanyone else with a desire to learn.\n\n  This legislation will make it easier for the teacher who connects \nwith her students online to enhance the learning process by \nillustrating music appreciation principles with appropriately limited \nsound recordings or illustrate visual design or story-telling \nprinciples with appropriate movie clips. Or she might create wholly new \nexperiences such as making a hypertext poem that links significant \nwords or formal elements to commentary, similar uses in other contexts, \nor other sources for deeper understanding, all accessible at the click \nof a mouse. These wholly new interactive educational experiences, or \nmore traditional ones now made available around the students' schedule, \nwill be made more easily and more inexpensively by this legislation. \nBeyond the legislative safe harbor provided by this legislation, \nopportunities for students and lifetime learners of all kinds, in all \nkinds of locations, is limited only by the human imagination and the \ncooperative creativity of the creators and users of copyrighted works. \nI hope that creative licensing arrangements will be spurred to make \neven more exciting opportunities available to students and lifelong \nlearners, and that incentives to create those experiences will continue \nto encourage innovation in education, art and entertainment online. The \npossibilities for everyone in the wired world are thrilling to \ncontemplate.\n  While the development of digital technology has fostered the \ntremendous growth of distance learning in the United States, online \neducation will work only if teachers and students have affordable and \nconvenient access to the highest quality educational materials. In \nfact, in its recent report, the Web-Based Commission, established by \nCongress to develop policies to ensure that new technologies will \nenhance learning, concluded that United States copyright practice \npresents significant impediments to online education. Additionally, the \nWeb-Based Commission concluded that there are some needed reforms in \nhigher education regulations and statutes. Specifically, the Commission \nidentifies reforms needed in the so-called 12 hour rule, the 50 percent \nrule and the ban on incentive based compensation. These education \nrecommendations are not included in the legislation I am introducing \ntoday. However, I want to put my colleagues on notice that I will \npushing for these reforms and leave open the possibility of amending \nthis particular bill or seek other vehicles to include such education \nreform provisions which will improve delivery of distance education to \na wider variety of students. We will be discussing education reforms in \nthe Senate in the coming weeks, and I think it is important that any \neducation reform include the kinds of reforms that will promote the use \nof high technologies in education, such as the Internet. And I intend \nto work to have these reforms included in any larger education package \nconsidered this year.\n  As part of its mandate under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, \nDMCA, which laid the basic copyright rules in a digital environment, \nthe Copyright Office was tasked to study the impact of copyright law on \nonline education and submit recommendations on how to promote distance \nlearning through digital technologies while maintaining an appropriate \nbalance between the rights of copyright owners and the needs of users \nof copyrighted works. Without adequate incentives and protections, \nthose who create these materials will be disinclined to make their \nworks available for use in online education. The interests of \neducators, students, and copyright owners need not be divergent; \nindeed, I believe they coincide in making the most of this medium. As \nexpected, the Copyright Office has presented us with a detailed and \ncomprehensive study of the copyright issues involved in digital \ndistance education that takes into account a wide range of views \nexpressed by various groups, including copyright owners, educational \ninstitutions, technologists, and libraries. As part of its report, the \nCopyright Office concluded that the current law should be updated to \naccommodate digital educational technologies.\n  After careful review and consideration of the findings and \nrecommendations presented in the report prepared by the Copyright \nOffice, not to mention my enormous respect for and confidence in the \nRegister of Copyrights, I fully support the Office's recommendation to \nupdate the current copyright law in a manner that promotes the use of \nhigh technology in education, such as distance learning over the \nInternet, while maintaining appropriate incentives for authors. While \nthe bill we are introducing today is based on the hard work and expert \nadvice of the Copyright Office, and is therefore, I believe a very good \nbill, I welcome constructive suggestions from improvements from any \ninterested party as this bill moves through the legislative process.\n  Currently, United States copyright law contains a number of \nexemptions\n\n[[Page S2008]]\n\nto copyright owners' rights relating to face-to-face classroom teaching \nand instructional broadcasts. While these exemptions embody the policy \nthat certain uses of copyrighted works for instructional purposes \nshould be exempt from copyright control, the current exemptions were \nnot drafted with online, interactive digital technologies in mind. As a \nresult, the Copyright Office concluded that the current exemptions \nrelated to instructional purposes are probably inapplicable to most \nadvanced digital delivery systems and without a corresponding change, \nthe policy behind the existing law will not be advanced.\n  Drawing from the recommendations made by the Copyright Office, the \nprimary goal of this legislation is simple and straight forward: to \npromote digital distance learning by permitting certain limited \ninstructional activities to take place without running afoul of the \nrights of copyright owners. The bill does not limit the bounds of \n``fair use'' in the educational context, but provides something of a \n``safe harbor'' for online distance education. And nothing limits the \npossibilities for creative licensing of copyrighted works for even more \ninnovative online educational experiences. While Section 110(1) of the \nCopyright Act exempts the performance or display of any work in the \ncourse of face-to-face teachings, Section 110(2) of the Copyright Act \nlimits these exemptions in cases of instructional broadcasting. Under \nSection 110(2), while displays of all works are permitted, only \nperformances of nondramatic literary or mystical works are permitted. \nThus, an instructor is currently not able to show a movie or perform a \nplay via educational broadcasting.\n  This legislation would amend Section 110(2) of the Copyright Act to \ncreate a new set of rules in the digital education world that, in \nessence, represent a hybrid of the current rules applicable to face-to-\nface instruction and instructional broadcasting. In doing this, the \nlegislation amends Section 110(2) by expanding the permitted uses \ncurrently available for instructional broadcasting in a modest fashion \nby including the performance of any work not produced primarily for \ninstructional use in reasonable and limited portions.\n\n  In addition, in order to modernize the statute to account for digital \ntechnologies, the legislation amends Section 110(2) by eliminating the \nrequirement of a physical classroom and clarifies that the \ninstructional activities exempted in Section 110(2) of the Copyright \nAct apply to digital transmissions as well as analog. The legislation \nalso permits a limited right to reproduce and distribute transient \ncopies created as part of the automated process of digital \ntransmissions. Mindful of the new risks involved with digital \ntransmissions, the legislation also creates new safeguards for \ncopyright owners. These include requirements that those invoking the \nexemptions institute a policy to promote compliance with copyright law \nand apply technological measures to prevent unauthorized access and \nuses.\n  Moreover, in order to allow the exempted activities to take place in \nonline education asynchronously, a new amendment to the ephemeral \nrecording exemption is proposed that would permit an instructor to \nupload a copyrighted work onto a server to be later transmitted to \nstudents. Again, extra safeguards are in place to ensure that no \nadditional copies beyond those necessary to the transmission can be \nmade and that the retention of the copy is limited in time.\n  I believe that this legislation is necessary to foster and promote \nthe use of high technology tools, such as the Internet, in education \nand distance learning, while at the same time maintains a careful \nbalance between copyright owners and users. Through the increasing \ninfluence of educational technologies, virtual classrooms are popping \nup all over the country and what we do not want to do is stand in the \nway of the development and advancement of innovative technologies that \noffer new and exciting educational opportunities. I think we all agree \nthat digital distance should be fostered and utilized to the greatest \nextent possible to deliver instruction to students in ways that could \nhave been possible a few years ago. We live at a point in time when we \ntruly have an opportunity to help shape the future by influencing how \ntechnology is used in education so I hope my colleagues will join us in \nsupporting this modest update of the copyright law that offers to make \nmore readily available distance education in a digital environment to \nall of our students.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and explanatory \nsection-by-section analysis, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 487\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Current law allows performances and displays of all \n     categories of copyrighted works in classroom settings, under \n     section 110(1) of the Copyright Act, and allows performances \n     of non-dramatic literary and musical works and displays of \n     works during certain education-related transmissions (usually \n     television-type transmission) under Section 110(2). Section \n     110(2) is amended to allow performances of categories of \n     copyrighted works--such as portions of audiovisual works, \n     sound recordings and dramatic literary and musical works--in \n     addition to the non-dramatic literary and musical works that \n     may be performed under current law. Because of the potential \n     adverse effect on the secondary markets of such works, only \n     reasonable and limited portions of these additional works may \n     be performed under the exemption. Excluded from the exemption \n     are those works that are produced primarily from \n     instructional use, because for such works, unlike \n     entertainment products or materials of a general educational \n     nature, the exemption could significantly cut into primary \n     markets, impairing incentives to create. As an additional \n     safeguard, this provision requires the exempted performance \n     or display to be made from a lawful copy. Since digital \n     transmissions implicate the reproduction and distribution \n     rights in addition to the public performance right, section \n     110(2) is further amended to add coverage of the rights of \n     reproduction/and or distribution, but only to the extent \n     technologically required in order to transmit a performance \n     or display authorized by the exemption.\n       Section 110(2)(C) eliminates the requirement of a physical \n     classroom by permitting transmissions to be made to students \n     officially enrolled in the course and to government \n     employees, regardless of their physical location. In lieu of \n     this limitation two safeguards have been added. First, \n     section 110(2)(A) emphasizes the concept of mediated \n     instruction by ensuring that the exempted performance or \n     display is analogous to the type of performance or display \n     that would take place in a live classroom setting. Second, \n     section 110(2)(C) adds the requirement that, to the extent \n     technologically feasible, the transmission must be made \n     solely for reception by the defined class of eligible \n     recipients.\n       Sections 110(2)(D), (E)(i) and (E)(ii) add new safeguards \n     to counteract the new risks posed by the transmission of \n     works to students in digital form. Paragraph (D) requires \n     that transient copies permitted under the exemption be \n     retained no longer than reasonably necessary to complete the \n     transmission. Paragraph (E)(i) requires that beneficiaries of \n     the exemption institute policies regarding copyright; provide \n     information materials to faculty, students, and relevant \n     staff members that accurately describe and promote compliance \n     with copyright law; and provide notice to students that \n     materials may be subject to copyright protection. Paragraph \n     110(2)(E)(ii) requires that the transmitting organization \n     apply measures to protect against both unauthorized access \n     and unauthorized dissemination after access has been \n     obtained. This provision also specifies that the transmitting \n     body or institution may not intentionally interfere with \n     protections applied by the copyright owners themselves.\n\n\n                    section 3. ephemeral recordings\n\n       Section 112 is amended by adding a new subsection which \n     permits an educator to upload a copyrighted work onto a \n     server to facilitate transmissions permitted under section \n     110(2) to students enrolled in his or her course. Limitations \n     have been imposed upon the exemption similar to those set out \n     in other subsections of section 112. Paragraph 112(f)(1) \n     specifies that any such copy be retained and used solely by \n     the entity that made it and that no further copies be \n     reproduced from it except the transient copies permitted \n     under section 110(2). Paragraph 112(f)(2) requires that the \n     copy be used solely for transmissions authorized under \n     section 110(2). Paragraph 112(f)(3) prohibits a body or \n     institution from intentionally interfering with technological \n     protection measures used by the copyright owner to protect \n     the work.\n\n\n             section 4. implementation by copyright office\n\n       Subsection (a) requires the Copyright Office, not later \n     than 2 years after the date of the enactment, to conduct a \n     study and submit a report to Congress on the status of \n     licensing for private and public school digital distance \n     education programs and the use of copyrighted works in such \n     programs. Subsection (b) requires the Copyright Office, not \n     later than 2 years after the date of enactment, to convene a \n     conference of other interested parties on the subject of the \n     use of copyrighted works in education and, to the extent the \n     Office deems appropriate, develop guidelines for the \n     clarification of the appropriate use of copyrighted works in \n     educational settings, including distance education, for \n     submission to Congress and for posting on the Copyright \n     Office website as a reference resource.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, an important responsibility of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee is fulfilling the mandate set forth in Article 1, \nsection 8 of the Constitution, ``to promote the progress of science and \nuseful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the \nexclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.'' \nChairman Hatch and I, and other colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, \nhave worked together successfully over the years to update and make \nnecessary adjustments to our copyright, patent and trademark laws to \ncarry out this responsibility. We have strived to do so in a manner \nthat advances the rights of intellectual property owners while \nprotecting the important interests of users of the creative works that \nmake our culture a vibrant force in this global economy.\n  Several years ago, as part of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, \nDMCA, we asked the Copyright Office to perform a study of the complex \ncopyright issues involved in distance education and to make \nrecommendations to us for any legislative changes. In conducting that \nstudy, Maybeth Peters, the Registrar of Copyrights met informally with \ninterested Vermonters at Champlain College in Burlington, Vermont, to \nhear their concerns on this issue. Champlain College has been offering \non-line distance learning programs since 1993, with a number of online \nprograms, including for degrees in accounting, business, and hotel-\nrestaurant management.\n  The Copyright Office released its report in May, 1999, at a hearing \nheld in this Committee, and made valuable suggestions on how modest \nchanges in our copyright law could go a long way to foster the \nappropriate use of copyrighted works in valid distance learning \nactivities. I am pleased to join Senator Hatch in introducing the \nTechnology, Education and Copyright Harmonization, or TEACH, Act, that \nincorporates the legislative recommendations of that report. This \nlegislation will help clarify the law and allow educators to use the \nsame rich material in distance learning over the Internet that they are \nable to use in face-to-face classroom instruction.\n  The growth of distance learning is exploding, largely because it is \nresponsive to the needs of older, non-traditional students. The \nCopyright Office, CO, report noted two years ago that, by 2002, the \nnumber of students taking distance education courses will represent 15 \npercent of all higher education students. Moreover, the typical average \ndistance learning student is 34 years old, employed full-time and has \nprevious college credit. More than half are women. In increasing \nnumbers, students in other countries are benefitting from educational \nopportunities here through U.S. distance education programs.\n  In high schools, distance education makes advanced college placement \nand college equivalency courses available,\n\n[[Page S2010]]\n\na great opportunity for residents in our more-rural states. In \ncolleges, distance education makes lifelong learning a practical \nreality.\n  Not only does distance education make it more convenient for many \nstudents to pursue an education, for students who have full-time work \ncommitments, who live in rural areas or in foreign countries, who have \ndifficulty obtaining child or elder care, or who have physical \ndisabilities, distance education may be the only means for them to \npursue an education. These are the people with busy schedules who need \nthe flexibility that on-line programs offer: virtual classrooms \naccessible when the student is ready, and free, to log-on.\n  In Vermont and many other rural states, distance learning is a \ncritical component of any quality educational and economic development \nsystem. In fact, the most recent Vermont Telecommunications Plan, which \nwas published in 1999 and is updated at regular intervals, identifies \ndistance learning as being critical to Vermont's development. It also \nrecommends that Vermont consider ``using its purchasing power to \naccelerate the introduction of new [distance learning] services in \nVermont.'' Technology has empowered individuals in the most remote \ncommunities to have access to the knowledge and skills necessary to \nimprove their education and ensure they are competitive for jobs in the \n21st century.\n  Several years ago, I was proud to work with the state in establishing \nthe Vermont Interactive Television network. This constant two-way \nvideo-conferencing system can reach communities, schools and businesses \nin every corner of the State. Since we first successfully secured funds \nto build the backbone of the system, Vermont has constructed fourteen \nsites. The VIT system is currently running at full capacity and has \ndemonstrated that in Vermont, technology highways are just as important \nas our transportation highways.\n  No one single technology should be the platform for distance \nlearning. In Vermont, creative uses of available resources have put in \nplace a distance learning system that employees T-1 lines in some areas \nand traditional internet modem hook-ups in others. Several years ago, \nthe Grand Isle Supervisory Union received a grant from the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture to link all the schools within the district \nwith fiber optic cable. There are not a lot of students in this \nSupervisory Union but these is a lot of land separating one school from \nanother. The bandwidth created by the fiber optic cables has not only \nimproved the educational opportunities in the four Grand Isle towns, \nbut it has also provided a vital economic boost to the area's business.\n  While there are wonderful examples of the use of distance learning \ninside Vermont, the opportunities provided by these technologies are \nnot limited to the borders of one state, or even one country. Champlain \nCollege, a small school in Burlington, Vermont has shown this is true \nwhen it adopted a strategic plan to provide distance learning for \nstudents throughout the world. Under the leadership of President Roger \nPerry, Champlain College now has more students enrolled than any other \ncollege in Vermont. The campus in Vermont has not been overwhelmed with \nthe increase. Instead, Champlain now teaches a large number of students \noverseas through its on-line curriculum. Similarly, Marlboro College in \nMarlboro, Vermont, offers innovative graduate programs designed for \nworking professionals with classes that meet not only in person but \nalso online.\n\n  The Internet, with its interactive, multi-media capabilities, has \nbeen a significant development for distance learning. By contrast to \nthe traditional, passive approach of distance learning where a student \nlocated remotely from a classroom was able to watch a lecture being \nbroadcast at a fixed time over the air, distance learners today can \nparticipate in real-time class discussions, or in simultaneous \nmultimedia projects. The Copyright Office report confirms what I have \nassumed for some time--that ``the computer is the most versatile of \ndistance education instruments,'' not just in terms of flexible \nschedules, but also in terms of the material available.\n  Over twenty years ago, the Congress recognized the potential of \nbroadcast and cable technology to supplement classroom teaching, and to \nbring the classroom to those who, because of their disabilities or \nother special circumstances, are unable to attend classes. At the same \ntime, Congress also recognized the potential for unauthorized \ntransmissions of works to harm the markets for educational uses of \ncopyrighted materials. The present Copyright Act strikes a careful \nbalance and includes two narrowly crafted exemptions for distance \nlearning, in addition to the general fair use exemption.\n  Under current law, the performance or display of any work in the \ncourse of face-to-face instruction in a classroom is exempt from the \nexclusive rights of a copyright owner. In addition, the copyright law \nallows transmission of certain performances or displays of copyrighted \nworks to be sent to a classroom or a similar place which is normally \ndevoted to instruction, to persons whose disabilities or other special \ncircumstances prevent classroom attendance, or to government employees. \nWhile this exemption is technology neutral and does not limit \nauthorized ``transmissions'' to distance learning broadcasts, the \nexemption does not authorize the reproduction or distribution of \ncopyrighted works--a limitation that has enormous implications for \ntransmissions over computer networks. Digital transmissions over \ncomputer networks involve multiple acts of reproduction as a data \npacket is moved from one computer to another.\n  The need to update our copyright law to address new developments in \nonline distance learning was highlighted in the December, 2000 report \nof the Web-Based Education Commission, headed by former Senator Bob \nKerrey. This Commission noted that:\n\n       Current copyright law governing distance education . . . \n     was based on broadcast models of telecourses for distance \n     education. That law was not established with the virtual \n     classroom in mind, nor does it resolve emerging issues of \n     multimedia online, or provide a framework for permitting \n     digital transmissions.\n\n  This report further observed that ``This current state of affairs is \nconfusing and frustrating for educators. . . . Concern about \ninadvertent copyright infringement appears, in many school districts, \nto limit the effective use of the Internet as an educational tool.'' In \nconclusion, the report concluded that our copyright laws were \n``inappropriately restrictive.''\n  The TEACH Act makes three significant expansions in the distance \nlearning exemption in our copyright law, while minimizing the \nadditional risks to copyright owners that are inherent in exploiting \nworks in a digital format. First, the bill eliminates the current \neligibility requirements for the distance learning exemption that the \ninstruction occur in a physical classroom or that special circumstances \nprevent the attendance of students in the classroom.\n  Second, the bill clarifies that the distance learning exemption \ncovers the temporary copies necessarily made in networked servers in \nthe course of transmitting material over the Internet.\n  Third, the current distance learning exemption only permits the \ntransmission of the performance of ``non-dramatic literary or musical \nworks,'' but does not allow the transmission of movies or videotapes, \nor the performance of plays. The Kerrey Commission report cited this \nlimitation as an obstacle to distance learning in current copyright law \nand noted the following examples: A music instructor may play songs and \nother pieces of music in a classroom, but must seek permission from \ncopyright holders in order to incorporate these works into an online \nversion of the same class. A children's literature instructor may \nroutinely display illustrations from childrens' books in the classroom, \nbut must get licenses for each one for on online version of the course.\n  To alleviate this disparity, the TEACH Act would amend current law to \nallow educators to show limited portions of dramatic literary and \nmusical works, audiovisual works, and sound recordings, in addition to \nthe complete versions of nondramatic literary and musical works which \nare currently exempted.\n  This legislation is a balanced proposal that expands the educational \nuse\n\n[[Page S2011]]\n\nexemption in the copyright law for distance learning, but also contains \na number of safeguards for copyright owners. In particular, the bill \nexcludes from the exemption those works that are produced primarily for \ninstructional use, because for such works, unlike entertainment \nproducts or materials of a general educational nature, the exemption \ncould significantly cut into primary markets, impairing incentives to \ncreate. Indeed, the Web-Based Education Commission urged the \ndevelopment of ``high quality online educational content that meets the \nhighest standards of educational excellence.'' Copyright protection can \nhelp provide the incentive for the development of such content.\n  In addition, the bill requires the use by distance educators of \ntechnological safeguards to ensure that the dissemination of material \ncovered under the exemption is limited only to the students who are \nintended to receive it.\n  Finally, the TEACH Act directs the Copyright Office to conduct a \nstudy on the status of licensing for private and public school digital \ndistance education programs and the use of copyrighted works in such \nprograms, and to convene a conference to develop guidelines for the use \nof copyrighted works for digital distance education under the fair use \ndoctrine and the educational use exemptions in the copyright law. Both \nthe Copyright Office report and the Kerrey Commission noted \ndissatisfaction with the licensing process for digital copyrighted \nworks. According to the Copyright Office, many educational institutions \n``describe having experienced recurrent problems [that] . . . can be \nbroken down into three categories: difficulty locating the copyright \nowner; inability to obtain a timely response; and unreasonable prices \nfor other terms.'' Similarly, the Kerrey Commission report echoed the \nsame concern. A study focusing on these licensing issues will hopefully \nprove fruitful and constructive for both publishers and educational \ninstitutions.\n  The Kerrey Commission report observed that ``[c]oncern about \ninadvertent copyright infringement appears, in many school districts, \nto limit the effective use of the Internet as an educational tool.'' \nFor this reason, the Kerrey Commission report endorsed ``the U.S. \nCopyright Office proposal to convene education representatives and \npublisher stakeholders in order to build greater consensus and \nunderstanding of the `fair use' doctrine and its application in web-\nbased education. The goal should be agreement on guidelines for the \nappropriate digital use of information and consensus on the licensing \nof content not covered by the fair use doctrine.'' The TEACH Act will \nprovide the impetus for this process to begin.\n  I appreciate that, generally speaking, copyright owners believe that \ncurrent copyright laws are adequate to enable and foster legitimate \ndistance learning activities. As the Copyright Office report noted, \ncopyright owners are concerned that ``broadening the exemption would \nresult in the loss of opportunities to license works for use in digital \ndistance education'' and would increase the ``risk of unauthorized \ndownstream uses of their works posed by digital technology.'' Based \nupon its review of distance learning, however, the Copyright Office \nconcluded that updating section 110(2) in the manner proposed in the \nTEACH Act is ``advisable.'' I agree. At the same time we have made \nefforts to address the valid concerns of both the copyright owners and \nthe educational and library community, and look forward to working with \nall interested stakeholders as this legislation is considered by the \nJudiciary Committee and the Congress.\n  Distance education is an important issue to both the chairman and to \nme, and to the people of our States. I commend him for scheduling a \nhearing on this important legislation for next week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/07/senate-section/article/S2011-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 45--HORNORING THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE THIS \nCOUNTRY IN THE NATIONAL GUARD AND EXPRESSING CONDOLENCES OF THE UNITED \n STATES SENATE TO FAMILY AND FRIENDS OF THE 21 NATIONAL GUARDSMEN WHO \n                 PERISHED IN THE CRASH ON MARCH 3, 2001\n\n  Mr. BOND (for himself and Mr. Leahy) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services:\n\n                               S. Res. 45\n\n       Whereas on March 3, 2001, a tragic crash of a C-23 from the \n     171st Aviation Battalion of the Florida Army National Guard, \n     carrying guardsmen from the 203rd Red Horse Unit of the \n     Virginia Air National Guard took the lives of 21 guardsmen;\n       Whereas this unfortunate crash occurred during a routine \n     training mission;\n       Whereas the National Guard is present in every state and \n     four protectorates and is comprised of citizen-soldiers and \n     airmen who continually support our active forces;\n       Whereas members of the Tragedy Assistance Program for \n     Survivors were on site the day of the accident and generously \n     rendered assistance to family members and friends; and\n       Whereas this is a somber reminder of the fact that the men \n     and women in the United States Armed Forces put their lives \n     on the line every day to protect this great Nation and that \n     each citizen should forever be grateful for the sacrifices \n     made by these men and women: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the contributions of the 21 National \n     Guardsmen who made the ultimate sacrifice to their Nation on \n     March 3, 2001;\n       (2) expresses deep and heartfelt condolences to the \n     families and friends of the crash victims for this tragic \n     loss;\n       (3) expresses appreciation for the members of the Tragedy \n     Assistance Program for Survivors for their continued support \n     to surviving family members; and\n       (4) honors the men and women who serve this country through \n     the National Guard and is grateful for everything that each \n     guardsman gives to protect the United States of America.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, sadly, I rise today to talk about the \nrecent crash of a National Guard aircraft in flying over Georgia. Last \nFriday, 21 members of the National Guard lost their lives in a horrible \nplane crash. How does one understand the death of 21 soldiers and \nairmen who dedicated their time and energy to contribute to our \nnation's defense?\n  While there perhaps is no easy answer to this question, the \npatriotism and dedication of these men is without doubt. Nineteen \nserved with the Virginia Air National Guard in the 203d Red Horse Unit. \nThree were of the 171st Aviation Battalion of the Florida Army National \nGuard. All come from a proud citizen-soldier tradition that dates back \nto the War of Independence.\n  This was a routine mission for the fated C-23 Sherpa. With the \nFlorida Guardsmen at the controls, the plane took off on Friday \nmorning, headed for Virginia. Its passengers had just completed their \ntwo-weeks of annual training in Georgia, where they had honed their \nalready refined construction abilities. They were heading back to their \nfamilies and the civilian jobs. Alas, those reunions were never to \noccur.\n  It is a great loss whenever a member of the armed services gives his \nor her life in the lien of duty. But perhaps because these men came \nstraight out of local communities, because they were juggling the \ndemands of work and family along with their national service, we feel \nthe losses like these especially deeply. Their departure reminds us \nthat our friends, colleagues, and neighbors in the National Guard make \nsacrifices every time they report for duty. They leave the comfort of \ntheir homes for the rigors of service. It is a sacrifice that is worthy \nof honor and recognition, but often goes unnoticed until they make the \nultimate sacrifice.\n  With that in mind, I join with my colleague Senator Kit Bond in \nintroducing a resolution that honors their service and expresses our \nheartfelt condolences to the families of the victims.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/07/senate-section/article/S2011-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2011-S2012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 46--AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY THE SENATE COMMITTEE \n                           ON INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL submitted the following resolution; from the Committee \non Indian Affairs; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration:\n\n                               S.

Res. 48\n\n       Whereas the Senate has learned with sadness of the death of \n     Harold E. Stassen;\n       Whereas Harold E. Stassen, born in St. Paul, Minnesota, \n     greatly distinguished himself and his State by his long \n     commitment to public service;\n       Whereas in 1938, Harold E. Stassen, at age 31, became the \n     youngest person elected Governor in the history of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas Harold E. Stassen, elected to 3 consecutive terms \n     as Governor of Minnesota, was a visionary leader of the \n     Republican Party and was nationally recognized for civil \n     service and anti-corruption reforms while Governor;\n       Whereas during Harold E. Stassen's third term as Governor, \n     he voluntarily resigned from that office to join the United \n     States Navy in World War II, helping to free American \n     prisoners of war from Japan and received promotion to the \n     rank of captain;\n       Whereas Harold E. Stassen was an original signer of the \n     United Nations charter of 1948, and in that same year \n     undertook the first of 9 campaigns for President of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas Harold E. Stassen served 5 years in the Eisenhower \n     administration, first overseeing foreign aid programs, then \n     serving as a Special Presidential Assistant on disarmament \n     policy;\n       Whereas although Harold E. Stassen spent much of his life \n     as a public servant, he was also highly respected as an \n     international lawyer in private practice;\n       Whereas Harold E. Stassen, a major constructive force in \n     shaping the course of the 20th Century, was a great \n     intellectual force, a noble statesman, and a high moral \n     example;\n       Whereas Harold E. Stassen was committed not only to his \n     country and his ideals, but also to his late wife of 70 \n     years, Esther, his daughter and son, his 7 grandchildren, and \n     4 great-grandchildren; and\n       Whereas in the days following the passing of Harold E. \n     Stassen, many past and present Minnesota public servants and \n     national leaders have praised the life he led: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors the long life and devoted work of a great leader \n     and public servant; and\n       (2) expresses its deepest condolences and best wishes to \n     the family of Harold E.

Con. Res. 21\n\n       Whereas the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has projected \n     that the Federal unified budget surplus over the 10-year \n     period from fiscal year 2002 to fiscal year 2011 will total \n     $5,610,000,000,000;\n       Whereas the projected Federal on-budget surplus over the \n     same period of time is projected to be $3,122,000,000,000, \n     which includes a surplus for the medicare program in the \n     Federal Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund of \n     $392,000,000,000;\n       Whereas the projected surplus provides Congress with an \n     opportunity to address a variety of pressing national needs, \n     including Federal debt reduction, tax relief, and increased \n     investment in the shared priorities of the American people, \n     such as national defense, science, health, education, \n     retirement security, and other areas;\n       Whereas although CBO projections properly serve as the \n     basis for budgetary policies in Congress, actual economic and \n     fiscal outcomes may differ substantially from projections;\n       Whereas for example, as CBO indicates in its January 2001 \n     budget update, if the future record is like the past, there \n     is about a 50 percent chance that errors in the assumptions \n     about economic and technical factors will cause CBO's \n     projection of the annual surplus 5 years ahead to miss the \n     actual outcome by more than 1.8 percent of the Gross Domestic \n     Product, with a resulting difference in the surplus estimate \n     of $245,000,000,000 in the fifth year alone;\n       Whereas where appropriate, long-term changes to tax and \n     spending policy that are predicated on the existence of \n     significant budget surpluses should be linked to actual \n     fiscal performance, such as meeting specified debt reduction \n     or on-budget surplus targets, to ensure the Federal \n     Government does not incur on-budget deficits or increase the \n     publicly-held debt;\n       Whereas during his testimony before the Senate Budget \n     Committee on January 25, 2001, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan \n     Greenspan stated, ``In recognition of the uncertainties in \n     the economic and budget outlook, it is important that any \n     long-term tax plan, or spending initiative for that matter, \n     be phased in. Conceivably, it could include provisions that, \n     in some way, would limit surplus-reducing actions if \n     specified targets for the budget surplus and Federal debt \n     were not satisfied. Only if the probability was very low that \n     prospective tax cuts or new outlay initiatives would send the \n     on-budget accounts into deficit, would unconditional \n     initiatives appear prudent'', and he reiterated this \n     testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on February 13, \n     2001; and\n       Whereas in light of Chairman Greenspan's testimony and the \n     uncertainty of surplus projections, while Members of Congress \n     agree that the resources are available to address many \n     pressing national needs in the 107th Congress, Congress \n     should exercise great caution and not pass tax cuts or \n     spending increases that are so large that they will \n     necessitate future tax increases or significant spending cuts \n     if anticipated budget surpluses fail to materialize: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) with respect to any long-term, Federal surplus-reducing \n     actions adopted by the 107th Congress pursuant to the \n     Congressional Budget Office's projected surpluses, such \n     actions shall include a legislative ``trigger'' or ``safety'' \n     mechanism that links the phase-in of such actions to actual \n     budgetary outcomes over the next 10 fiscal years;\n       (2) this legislative ``trigger'' or ``safety'' mechanism \n     shall outline specific legislative or automatic action that \n     shall be taken should specified levels of Federal debt \n     reduction or on-budget surpluses not be realized, in order to \n     maintain fiscal discipline and continue the reduction of our \n     national debt;\n       (3) the legislative ``trigger'' or ``safety'' mechanism \n     shall be applied prospectively and not repeal or cancel any \n     previously implemented portion of a surplus-reducing action;\n       (4) enactment of a legislative ``trigger'' or ``safety'' \n     mechanism shall not prevent Congress from passing other \n     legislation affecting the level of Federal revenues or \n     spending should future economic performance dictate such \n     action; and\n       (5) this legislative ``trigger'' or ``safety'' mechanism \n     will ensure fiscal discipline because it restrains both \n     Government spending and tax cuts, by requiring that the \n     budget is balanced and that specified debt reduction targets \n     are met.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/07/senate-section/article/S2013-3", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2013-S2014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 22--HONORING THE 21 MEMBERS OF THE \n    NATIONAL GUARD WHO WERE KILLED IN THE CRASH OF A NATIONAL GUARD \n          AIRCRAFT ON MARCH 3, 2001, IN SOUTH-CENTRAL GEORGIA\n\n  Mr. WARNER (for himself, Mr. Allen, Mr. Graham, and Mr. Nelson of \nFlorida) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Armed Services:\n\n                            S.

For the information of all Senators, the Senate will \nconvene at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow and immediately resume the pending \nbankruptcy bill. Amendments and votes are expected to occur throughout \nthe day and into the evening in an effort to make substantial progress \non this vital piece of legislation. Members are encouraged to work with \nthe bill managers if they intend to offer amendments.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. We have a group of Senators, with House Members, members of \nthe Intelligence Committee, who are traveling to South America. Does \nthe Senator think we can learn early in the morning if there are going \nto be votes past 5 o'clock so they can have some idea as to what to \nplan and what they can do?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I understand the leadership is trying to work out a \nfinite list of amendments that could be worked on to the point that \nmaybe we could get that group done and limit it so we could have a \nvoting time set, and then those Members could plan what they are trying \nto do. I understand it is being worked on right now.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Leahy has indicated he is willing to cooperate in \nany way he can.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Good. I thank my colleague from Nevada for the \ncomments. Hopefully we can get a limited number of amendments and move \nthis bill through. This could be a substantial piece of legislation for \nthis body to pass.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/07/senate-section/article/S2016-5", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
